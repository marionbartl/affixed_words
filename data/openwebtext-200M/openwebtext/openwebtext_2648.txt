A True or False exam !
Response from the teacher :
Dear Michael ,
Every year I attempt to boost my students ' final grades by giving them this relatively simple exam consisting of 100 True or False questions from only 3 chapters of material .
For the past 20 years that I have taught Intro Communications 101 at this institution I have never once seen someone score below a 65 on this exam .
Consequently , your score of a zero is the first in history and ultimately brought the entire class average down a whole 8 points .
There were two possible answer choices : A ( True ) and B ( False ) .
You chose C for all 100 questions in an obvious attempt to get lucky with a least a quarter of the answers .
It 's as if you did n't look at a single question .
Unfortunately , this brings your final grade in this class to failing .
See you next year !
May God have mercy on your soul .
Sincerely ,
Professor William Turner
P.S. If all else fails , go with B from now on .
B is the new C
The next version of Microsoft Office , code - named Office 14 , will include lightweight but fully - functional versions of Word , Excel , PowerPoint and OneNote that can run in a browser .
Called Office Web Applications , the service will be in beta later this year , according to Microsoft , but the final versions of the Office Web apps wo n't come until the desktop version of Office 14 is also done .
Steve Ballmer announced in February that this wo n't happen until 2010 .
Office Web Applications follow through on Microsoft 's promise to deliver " software plus services " and are a belated move to get productivity tools online to curb the threat of free , Web - based apps from Google , Zoho and OpenOffice.org .
Microsoft currently has a free service called Office Live Workspace that lets users view and share — but not edit — Office documents .
Office Live Workspace never took off in a meaningful way with most enterprise users .

To keep more users from moving to Office alternatives , Microsoft is not tying the forthcoming Office Web Applications to Internet Explorer .
The company has confirmed that Office Web Applications will work on the Firefox browser and Apple 's Safari browser .
It has also insinuated , though not fully confirmed , that Office Web Apps will work on the iPhone .
So via the Firefox browser , Microsoft Office will run on Linux machines , giving Office a route onto Linux - based netbooks and smartphones that it did n't have before .
If Linux - based netbooks begin to increase market share , Microsoft will be losing OS dollars , but would at least be able to offer Office apps on Linux machines .
Microsoft Could No Longer Ignore Web - based Tools
Rob Enderle , industry analyst and president of consulting firm The Enderle Group , says that making Office an online service did not come lightly to Microsoft .
Office Web apps could conflict with the revenue of the Office desktop suite , which still dominates the market .
Nearly three in four North American online adults use paid Microsoft Office products , according to research firm Forrester .
" I 'll bet this is being argued really hard within Microsoft , " says Enderle .
" They know this is the direction the market is going in but are worried about prematurely cannibalizing their existing revenue stream or delivering a product that does n't meet expectations . "
For Microsoft , the business impact of Web - based productivity tools like Google Docs has actually been quite small — to date .
According to a recent survey by Forrester Research , only 3 percent of North American online adults use Google Docs , even though 84 percent use Web - based e-mail .
Yet despite such low adoption , online productivity tools are a category ripe for growth , writes Forrester analyst Nathan Safron in a recent report , citing momentum from the use of Web - based e-mail and free software that users found to be as good or better than purchased software .
" The value of the cloud computing , combined with disillusionment over paid software , creates latent demand among consumers that Web - based challengers can tap , " wrote Safran .
One - Two Punch of Linux Netbooks and Google Docs
On paper , Google Docs and Linux - based netbooks — which make up about 10 percent of the netbook market , according to research firm the NPD Group — do not seem like a big threat to Microsoft , some analysts say .
But with Forrester 's prediction of increased use of free , Web - based apps and the growth of Linux - based netbooks , the value of Microsoft moving Office to the Web becomes clear .
Office Web Apps will compete directly with the functionality of Google Docs and will run on Linux netbooks — an especially important option if netbooks should gain market share or move steadily into the corporate world .
How quickly netbooks will take off in the consumer and enterprise markets remains to be seen , but if Google decides to run its Android OS on netbooks , this could provide a trusty brand name at a lower price than Windows - based netbooks for consumers and businesses that are wary of Linux , Enderle says .
It 's unknown at this point if the Microsoft Office Web Applications will be completely free — as are Google Docs — just that they will be available to consumers through the Office Live Web site with both free ( ad supported ) and paid ( subscription ) offerings .
Office Web Apps will be offered to businesses as a hosted subscription service and through existing volume licensing agreements .
No pricing for businesses has been announced by Microsoft .
A new study in mice sheds light on the insulin resistance that can come from diets loaded with high - fructose corn syrup , a sweetener found in most sodas and many other processed foods .
The report in the March issue of Cell Metabolism , a Cell Press publication , also suggests a way to prevent those ill effects .
The researchers showed that mice on a high - fructose diet were protected from insulin resistance when a gene known as transcriptional coactivator PPARg coactivator - 1 b ( PGC - 1b ) was " knocked down " in the animals ' liver and fat tissue .
PGC - 1b coactivates a number of transcription factors that control the activity of other genes , including one responsible for building fat in the liver .
" There has been a remarkable increase in consumption of high - fructose corn syrup , " said Gerald Shulman of Yale University School of Medicine .
" Fructose is much more readily metabolized to fat in the liver than glucose is and in the process can lead to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , " he continued .
NAFLD in turn leads to hepatic insulin resistance and type II diabetes .
Metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes have both reached epidemic proportions worldwide with the global adoption of the westernized diet along with increased consumption of fructose , stemming from the wide and increasing use of high - fructose corn syrup sweeteners , the researchers noted .
High - fructose corn syrup , which is a mixture of the simple sugars fructose and glucose , came into use in the 1970s and by 2005 the average American was consuming about 60 pounds of it per year .
Overall , dietary intake of fructose , which is also a component of table sugar , has increased by an estimated 20 to 40 percent in the last thirty years .
Earlier studies had established that fructose is more readily converted to fatty acids than glucose and had also linked high - fructose diets to high blood levels of triglycerides ( a condition known as hypertriglyceridemia ) , NAFLD and insulin resistance .
While researchers had implicated a gene known as SREBP - 1 , a master regulator of lipids ' manufacture in the liver , much about the underlying molecular connections between fructose and those metabolic disorders remained mysterious .
In the new study , the researchers zeroed in on PGC - 1b , a gene known for boosting SREBP - 1 levels .
To test its role in the effects of fructose , they blocked its activity in mice fed a diet high in that sugar for four weeks .
Those treatments improved the animals ' metabolic profiles by lowering levels of SREBP - 1 and other fat - building genes in their livers .
The mice also showed a reversal of their fructose - induced insulin resistance and a threefold increase in glucose uptake in their fat tissue .
" These data support an important role for PGC - 1b in the pathogenesis of fructose - induced insulin resistance and suggest that PGC - 1b inhibition may be a therapeutic target for treatment of NAFLD , hypertriglyceridemia , and insulin resistance associated with increased de novo lipogenesis , " the researchers concluded .
The new study has " revealed the transcriptional coactivator PGC - 1b as a missing link between fructose intake and metabolic disorders , " wrote Carlos Hernandez and Jiandie Lin of the University of Michigan Medical Center , Ann Arbor in an accompanying commentary .
" The findings ... support the emerging role of gene / environment interaction in modulating the metabolic phenotype and disease pathogenesis .
Thus , perturbations of the same regulatory motif may produce vastly different metabolic responses , depending on the specific combinations of dietary nutrients , " they continued .

( score : 40 FOR / 4 AGAINST / 2 abst )
Two days to call all Members of the European Parliament ( MEPs ) seating in ITRE committee to ask them to vote again for amendment 138 ( now am . 46 )
Keep in mind that MEP are in Strasbourg today !
( most of them arrived in the afternoon , so if you could not reach them in the morning , try again ! )
On Tuesday , April 21st at 20:00 , the ITRE report of the Telecoms Package , rapported by Catherine Trautmann , will come to a vote in the ITRE ( Industry , TRansport , Energy ) committee .
It may reintroduce amendment 138 ( now renumbered amendment 46 ) , a crucial safeguard of user 's rights on the Internet , and protection against the media industry private police and retribution called the " graduated response " or " three strikes " schemes .
Am. 138 was approved by 88 % of the European Parliament in first reading , on September 24th , 2008 .
Yet rapporteur Catherine Trautmann is currently negotiating with the Council of the EU , which under the French presidency , and under very strong influence from M Sarkozy , deleted the amendment in first reading .
The Council may propose a compromise version of amendment 138/ 46 that is completely neutralized , or that may even become the opposite of the original by allowing the " three strikes " scheme instead of preventing it .
According to the latest negotiations , am .138/46 would n't anymore be an article ( that must be transposed by Member States in their law ) but a mere recital that has just indicative value .
It is urgent to contact the members of the ITRE committee to advise them to reject compromise with the Council that failed to respect the intent of the original amendment .
The best would be once again to approve the amendment .
Time is short , so we must act promptly .
Everybody should contact Members of the European Parliament ( MEPs ) sitting on the ITRE Committee .
Here is A list of the ITRE members indicating how they previously voted on amendment 138 , and their global score on the 1st reading of the Telecoms Package .
And here are vCards for easy import in your favorite address book .
Begin with the members from your country , then the substitutes from your country , then members and substitutes from other countries .
IMPORTANT :
Telephoning is much more effective than email , especially on such short notice
On Monday , MEPs will be reachable in Brussels .
On Tuesday they will be in Strasbourg .
Do n't send mass mailing , but personnal mails
Always stay polite , even if you are sad or angry .
The vote will take place on Tuesday , April 21 , 2009 , at 20h00 .
MEPs must be informed before that .
On the morning of Tuesday , April 21 , will be held a Coreper meeting ( the diplomatic body which prepares the decisions of the Council ) that will negotiate a compromise with Catherine Trautmann .
According to our information , the compromise can only be bad .
( Instead of an article , which requires implementation by the member states , they insist on making it a recital , that has only advisory value but does not become part of national laws ! )
Here are the major points you should explain to the MEPs and their assistants :
ITRE MEPs must advise Catherine Trautmann to refuse a weak compromise with the council which neutralizes it by making it a recital instead of an article and they should vote for amendment 46 ( which exactly restates amendment 138 ) .
Right before the elections , it 's a perfect way to show the usefulness of the European Parliament , and its commitment to protecting the rights and freedoms of its citizens .
Amendment 138 was approved by 88 % of the European Parliament in first reading on September 24 , 2008 .
It has been accepted by the Commission , and Mrs Reding herself said that “ The Commission considers this amendment to be an important restatement of key legal principles of the Community legal order , especially of citizens ' fundamental rights . ”
Amendment 138 is protective of users ' rights .
It reinforces a fundamental principle of European law : except where public security is directly threatened , only a judge can impose conditions -- a sentence under law -- that restrict a citizen 's fundamental rights and freedoms .
The original amendment 138 :
Applying the principle that no restriction may be imposed on the fundamental rights and freedoms of end -users , without a prior ruling by the judicial authorities , notably in accordance with Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union on freedom of expression and information , save when public security is threatened in which case the ruling may be subsequent .
It is directly opposed to " graduated response " ( or " three strikes " ) schemes such as the one being deployed in France ( yet it 's not a purely French problem , because other EU states are considering such a scheme , and at some point it was sneaked into the Telecoms Package ) .
It also opposes other forms of private , nonjudicial , parallel " justice " that would be dangerous for everyone 's civil liberties .
The Council removed it , with no justification , under heavy pressure from Nicolas Sarkozy , thus voiding a decision of 88 % of the Parliament .
No compromise should be accepted that does n't protect civil freedoms as well as the original amendment does .
As a recital instead of an article , it loses all protective power .
( The current state of the compromise between the rapporteur and the Council is a weak recital . )
It is a strong signal to the EU citizens at a time when EU institutions face a deep crisis of confidence .
Example phone call [ modifier ]
You : _ " Hello , i am ... , living in ... , I am calling you today regarding the Telecoms Package , as I understand Mrs / Mr MEP is a member of ITRE committee , and there is an important vote on April the 21st . "
( let your correspondent introduce herself , give her opinion and infos on the question , etc. )
You : _" Amendment 138 was a very strong signal sent by the European Parliament to the citizens .
It is protective of fundamental freedoms , when media industries want to impose their private police and parallel , arbitrary justice over the Internet , like what they are trying to do in France and in some other Member States . "
Interlocutor : " Mrs / Mr MEP is concerned with this topic , but she / he will follow the instructions of Mrs Trautmann . "
You : _ " I heard Mrs Trautmann is currently negociating with the Council , and may be about to accept to replace amendment 46 by a recital .
This would remove all protective value and make it useless .
Mrs / Mr MEP must vote for am.46 instead of a compromise recital . "
Interlocutor : " It is complicated .
We need to reach an agreement in order to avoid the conciliation procedure with the Council . "
You : _" Is reaching an agreement more important than protecting EU citizens ' fundamental rights and freedoms ?
It is important , before the elections , to show that the Parliament is useful , that it protects its electors , and that it does n't bend under the pressure a few member states apply through the Council ! "
Interlocutor : " There are many other important issues in the Telecoms Package , industries are waiting ... "
You : _" We need Europe to protect citizens before industries .
Please tell Mrs / Mr MEP to ask Mrs Trautmann to keep the am.46 as is , as an article .
Please ask Mrs / Mr MEP to vote for am.46 in the name of its electors who will be very attentive to the outcome of this vote .
I am available if you have questions about these issues , or other issues related to civil liberties in the digital environment .
( leave your contact infos ) .
Have a nice day , thank you for your time ! "
Other example phone call to begin the conversation [ modifier ]
You : _ " Hello , my name is ... , I live in ... .
I call you regarding amendment 138 renamed 46 from the Telecom Package .
I have red that Mrs / Mr MEP XXX is member of the ITRE comitee that will have to vote tonight about this amendment .
I just wanted to tell you my support for keeping this amendment in its original state , as an article and not just a recital . "
Interlocutor : _ " Mrs/ Mr MEP is concerned with this topic , but you know , it 's not as simple .
There is a lot of pressure and it would be a pity to make the telecom Package ' fall ' because of this amendment "
You : _" You are right , and I understand this delicate situation .
But I feel that the council tries to invert the responsibilities .
It would be natural , I would say indispensable , to save an amendment that had been supported by 88 % of the parliament .
If the council does n't accept that , the council will be the unique responsible for the Telecom Package ' failure ' .
I would like to add that this pressure looks like ' bluff ' .
The Telecom Package represents 3 years of work from a lot of parliamentarians .
The council will not decide to put the Telecom Package in danger . "
Interlocutor : _ " Ok , but you know ... "
Conversation
You : _" Thanks a lot for having listened to me and thank you for your work to you and to Mrs / Mr MEP XXX .
If you can tell him / her my call I would appreciate it .
And you can tell him / her also that he / she can call me at ( phone number ) if he / she wants to talk about that "
Interlocutor : _ " Of course , no problem . "
Arguments and counter - arguments [ modifier ]
Here are arguments you will hear , and how to counter them :
If you are given other arguments that you cannot counter , please add them to the list or send us an email ( contact AT laquadrature DOT net ) , we will try to counter them as soon as possible .
Going back to amendment 138 ( 46 ) would cause a direct conflict with the Council , thus bringing a " conciliation procedure " ( sort of a third reading , where the text is negotiated between the Parliament and the Council ) , that would take some more months , and where we may lose what we gained already .
The role of the European Parliament is to protect EU citizens .
Protecting citizens ' rights and freedoms must be more important for the Parliament than merely keeping to a schedule .
MEPs do n't want to show that the European Parliament always yields to the Council .
This would show that the Parliament is useless and that the Council always gets what it dictates .
Amendment 138/46 is not legal under the law of some Member States .
Some Member States such as France , UK , and Sweden wo n't accept it through the Council .
The Commission accepted the amendment ( “ The Commission considers this amendment to be an important restatement of key legal principles of the Community legal order , especially of citizens ' fundamental rights . ” ) , which means it is legal under EU law .
Moreover , this amendment just restates EU law , as stated by Catherine Trautmann herself after first reading : " if ' graduated response ' goes against the fundamental principle that we have only recalled , we must question the viability of the whole scheme " .
( “ S'il s’avère que la riposte graduée va à l’encontre du principe fondamental que nous n’avons fait que rappeler , il faut s’interroger sur la viabilité même du système . “ )
Maybe these countries just want to implement " graduated response " / " three strikes " schemes , such as the disastrous French HADOPI law , or create some other system private police and parallel " justice " disastrous for citizens ' rights .
This would be intolerable .
No one will approve it against the will of Rapporteur Trautmann anyway !
She knows this is the right thing to do to safeguard EU citizens ' rights , and she needs a strong majority within the ITRE committee to support her .
A few weeks before the elections , with massive abstentions expected , rejecting strong protection for their rights and freedoms would be a terrible signal to send to the voters .
If you encounter a question you cannot answer , DON'T PANIC .
Say that you will call back , and contact us ( contact AT laquadrature DOT net ) .
We will be pleased to help you in answering all your questions .
Please also contact us to tell us how it went with your MEP , and what response you received .
In 1991 , President George H. W. Bush implemented a ban on media coverage of returning war dead and their dignified transfer process at Dover Air Force Base , Delaware .
Shortly after he assumed office , President Barack Obama asked Defense Secretary Robert Gates to review this policy , and Gates later reversed it , giving family members of the fallen the right to allow or disallow media coverage .
On April 5th , 2009 , the repatriation of the remains of Air Force Staff Sgt. Phillip Meyers became the first such event to be covered by the press in 18 years .
This process has taken place , undocumented , over 5,000 times since the beginning of the war in Afghanistan in 2001 .

KANSAS CITY ( Reuters ) - Regulators worked on Saturday to assess troubles at the largest U.S. corporate credit union with the aim of keeping liquidity flowing through the nation ’s 7,800 credit unions .
A new chief executive will take charge on Monday at U.S. Central Federal Credit Union following seizure by regulators on Friday .
The institution , with $ 34 billion in assets , provides settlement services used by more than 90 percent of all U.S. credit unions , which are member - owned lending institutions .
The National Credit Union Administration , or NCUA , took control of U.S. Central as well as Western Corporate ( WesCorp ) Federal Credit Union of San Dimas , California , another corporate credit union with $ 23 billion in assets .
“ We took action to protect the assets , the share insurance fund and its members , ” NCUA regional director Keith Morton said in an interview from the Lenexa , Kansas , headquarters of U.S. Central , where he and other officials were working on Saturday .
NCUA officials cited declining values of mortgage - and other asset - backed securities as the core problem .
The action highlighted strains in the nonprofit banking sector that recently had been touted as a source of new lending even as many for - profit banks limit lending and receive billions of dollars of taxpayer - funded capital injections .
Corporate credit unions provide services such as lending and payment clearance services to retail credit unions .
NCUA officials would not disclose a specific loss figure for U.S. Central .
“ They have a significant amount of risk ... assets that are currently not marketable , ” said Morton .
A NCUA risk analysis completed this month put potential credit losses throughout the credit union system as high as $ 16 billion , “ with a most reasonable estimate in the current environment of $ 10.8 billion . ”
SYSTEM BLINKING RED ?
Warning signs had been mounting in recent months .
In February , U.S. Central said it replaced the executive who had been overseeing the credit union ’s investment portfolio , putting the division under the direct supervision of then - CEO Francis Lee .
Lee himself will now be replaced on Monday by regulators with James Nance , a former U.S. Central executive who oversaw the institution ’s assets and liabilities in the early 1990s .
In January , NCUA injected $ 1 billion into U.S. Central after the corporate credit union suffered dramatic declines in the value of mortgage - backed securities it had bought .
But a continued decline in mortgage values and a lack of marketability for a variety of underlying securities triggered the conservatorship when it became clear the liability to the reserve fund that backs credit unions had risen sharply to an estimated $ 5.9 billion from $ 4.7 billion , officials said .
Marla Marsh , chief executive of the Kansas Credit Union Association , whose members are among those relying in part on U.S. Central , called the takeover a “ stabilizing maneuver . ”
She said U.S. credit unions generally remained healthy , well - capitalized and eager to lend .
“ The corporate system has the strain on its liquidity and capital due to the credit market fluctuations , but we still remain overall healthy and sound , ” she said .
“ We continue to be a safe place for consumers to use for lending and savings . ”
John Kutchey , deputy director of the office of examination for the NCUA , said U.S. Central ’s mortgage securities were for the most part well - rated .
The blame for the credit union woes were due more to market woes than mismanagement , he said .
“ The downward spiral in real estate values is really the core issue that led to the decline in value and performance of the mortgage - backed securities , ” he said .
Morton said the NCUA was not planning to inject additional funds into U.S. Central but cited the need to increase the reserve fund , which helps back U.S. Central assets and is funded by member credit unions .
NCUA moved in January to guarantee $ 80 billion that U.S. credit unions have on deposit in the corporate network , a move considered a bailout of the U.S. credit union network .
The recently released RubyGems version 1.3.2 is more than just a minor bugfix release , it also contains new features :
As of RubyGems 1.3.2 , RubyGems will load plugins installed in gems or $ LOAD_PATH .
Plugins must be named ' rubygems_plugin ' are discovered via Gem : : find_files then loaded .
An example comes from Ryan Davis : the Graph plugin generates a graph of the dependencies and information ( outdated , incoming dependencies ) of your installed Gems .
We talked to RubyGems maintainer Eric Hodel to learn more about the general idea of RubyGems plugins :
The feature request tracker for RubyGems has lots of stuff people want to add , and some of it can be done as a stand - alone package .
There 's also things you may want to do at install time that otherwise would require manual intervention from the user .
The plugins started with a patch from Neil Wilson to add install hooks to RubyGems for Debian that would make it easier to integrate the two .
With his patch we added two special files that RubyGems would try to require at startup , rubygems / defaults/operating_system.rb for ruby packagers and rubygems / defaults / #{RUBY_ENGINE}.rb for ruby implementors to add special functionality .
For example , Rubinius could pre-compile all the .rb files in the gem to reduce startup time .
Around the same time I added Gem.find_files that would allow gem authors to easily construct their own plugin system .
RDoc uses this to automatically load its plugins .
Since it turned out rather well for RDoc I decided that RubyGems should have the same feature .
I did n't try to make the plugins have a comprehensive way to hook into every possible corner of RubyGems .
I 'm sure that people will want to hook into areas that are n't currently easy to access , and I hope they submit feature requests against RubyGems to help me find them .
It 's much easier for me to improve the API a little for a plugin than it is to maintain an entire new feature .
My hope is that creative people will provide amazing and useful things that I do n't have to ship or maintain inside RubyGems .
Besides the Graph plugin , there 's also rubypan to search rubypan.org and they are working on " a plugin that will create an OS X dictionary from ri data that would be updated whenever you install or uninstall a gem " .
Plugin writers can hook into RubyGems pre and post install and uninstall actions , see the Gem Documentation .
Writing a plugin for your own command is also straightforward : subclass Command and register it with the Gem:: CommandManager .
Do you miss a feature in RubyGems that could now be provided by a plugin ?
I CAN ’T say for sure whether I ’ve ever tried Popov vodka , but I seem to recall pouring it into a punch bowl in college .
Or maybe it was Gordon’s .
Tom Smith , the spirits director at Union Square Wines in Manhattan , says he does n’t carry Popov in his store because he associates it with his days of waiting tables , when he used it to polish silverware .
Even Diageo , the liquor conglomerate that owns the Popov brand , seems reluctant to own up to it .
Popov , which can sell for less than $ 9 a 750 - milliliter bottle , is n’t mentioned on its Web site , and when asked about the brand , a company spokeswoman kept trying to steer the conversation toward pricier spirits .
But the economic malaise has prompted consumers to trade down for all kinds of products , whether cereal , cars , sweaters or lunch fare .
The same is true for booze .
All of a sudden , Popov does n’t taste so bad .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A German woman was involved in three car accidents in less than an hour that left a total of seven vehicles damaged but she suffered only slight injuries from the series of mishaps , police said Tuesday .
The 69 - year - old woman from Berlin first crashed into three cars while trying to pull out of a supermarket car park on the Baltic resort island of Usedom .
Then , she accidentally stepped on the accelerator and sped across a lawn before crashing into a nearby house , police said .
She was taken to hospital in an ambulance but that vehicle was then hit by a truck .
“ She was actually fortunate that no one was seriously hurt in any of the accidents , ” said Zinnowitz police spokesman Axel Falkenberg .
“ The accidents were a little bit like dominoes toppling . ”
On Day 4 of The Pirate Bay trial , the Prosecutor referred to legal action taken against the admins of another BitTorrent tracker , Finreactor , who together received huge fines and currently have their case before the Supreme Court .
Since Sweden and Finland 's laws are similar , what does the Finreactor case mean for the TPB defendants ?
Last week , the prosecution in The Pirate Bay case referred to the earlier legal action against a Finnish BitTorrent tracker .
Based in Finland , many administrators of Finreactor received heavy fines totaling 500,000 euros .
It is believed that the prosecution may start referring to this case later in the trial since Finland ’s and Sweden ’s copyright laws are almost identical .
So , in conjunction with Mikko Valimaki of ‘ Turre Legal ’ law firm we look into the Finreactor case .
Mikko is the lawyer who defended the admins at Finreactor and he is currently taking their appeal to the Supreme Court .
Here is your chance to become a Finreactor expert – before the court in Stockholm does .
Part I : Finreactor Cases in Finland – the Story So Far
The Finnish BitTorrent tracker case began in 2006 and the case is currently being heard before the Finnish Supreme Court .
First some background .
Finreactor was a popular BitTorrent tracker that was raided in December 2004 .
The request came from a local attorney firm who signed it as the representative of major software companies such as Microsoft and Adobe .
Tens of admins had their computers seized during the raid , and some of them were even jailed for a night .
The site never returned .
After initial reports it turned out that the exclusively Finnish - speaking site had about 10,000 registered users .
It also became clear that Finreactor had nothing to do with commercial piracy , it was essentially just another community - driven tracker , which grew popular along with the rising popularity of the BitTorrent protocol .
Most of the admins are 15 - 25 year - old had no political intentions either , and most of them did not think they had done anything illegal .
So the case started in 2006 , and there were essentially two ‘ lines ’ for the cases .
One line was individual users .
The prosecutor chose 24 individuals who had both posted torrents and shared high volumes of data , and claimed criminal copyright infringement .
At this stage the local antipiracy bureau joined in and claimed for damages on behalf of recording companies and movie studios .
The other line was with the site admins .
The prosecutor chose to sue 32 individuals who had participated in the administration as site owners , software developers , user administrators , forum moderators etc .
Most of them had notoriously just edited discussions after torrent posts and managed user accounts .
The admins were jointly charged with criminal copyright infringement and saw claims for damages totaling some 5 million euros .
Our law firm represented over ten individuals in the process , both admins and individual users .
Of 24 individual users , 23 were convicted in the district court .
We represented four individual users .
We managed to win one case , and lost three .
Those who lost were typically ordered to pay 10 - 20 % of claimed damages , ranging from c. 1,000 to 10,000 euros , plus a few thousand euros in legal costs ( in Finland the loser pays the other side ’s costs ) , and a few hundred euros in fines .
We appealed all the lost cases , but lost the appeals as well .
One of our clients was then ready to negotiate with the copyright holders .
We continued to appeal the two remaining cases .
The Finnish Supreme Court granted us leave to appeal in July 2008 .
They take only some 10 % of cases appealed .
No other individual cases were appealed this far , as most of the convicted had agreed to pay an undisclosed amount to the right holders .
Of 32 admins , 21 were convicted in the district court .
We represented eight admins , of which 4 were convicted and another 4 released .
The convictions ranged from assisting copyright infringement to direct copyright infringement .
The convicted admins were ordered to pay jointly some 500,000 euros in damages to rights holders plus almost 200,000 euros in legal fees , and a few hundred euros in fines each .
Some admins chose to settle , but 14 appealed , and we continued to represent 4 admins in the appeals court .
The court of appeal released two more ( one was our client ) , and for the other 12 the convictions remained essentially the same – only all convictions were now based on direct infringement , and none were convicted of assisting infringements by users .
The relevant part of the court of appeal decision reads as follows :
“… a necessary precondition for the reproduction of copies through Finreactor has been Finreactor as a working system … .
Finreactor admins must have been aware that the aim has been to share material that is under copyright .
By administering a system that serves this purpose they have together with its users participated both in making works available to the public and the reproduction of copies as noted by the district court . ”
Again , we appealed to the Supreme Court .
The Supreme Court took the case in quickly following the user cases .
Somewhat surprisingly they gave leave to appeal only for the copyright holders , who want more in damages ( they were given 10 % claimed but they asked for at least 50 % ) .
The Supreme Court will decide later on whether our side of the story can be heard as well .
This was a guest article from Mikko Valimaki from Turre Legal
We will publish part two of this series of three articles tomorrow .
In it we look at the relevance of the Finreactor case viewed in the context of The Pirate Bay trial .
In part three we will look at why the admins were convicted and what people can do to remain within the law and avoid the same fate .
This is an oldie but it 's still very very cool even if you 've seen it .
The music is great and the company that did this did it all in one take - which is amazing .

Space is indeed curved -- in four dimensions .
Many people think the fourth dimension is simply time , and for some astronomical equations , it is .
Einstein used time as a fourth dimension to describe a coordinate system called space - time .
This is the stage on which planets , stars , galaxies -- all matter in the universe -- act their gravitational roles .
In Einstein 's Theories of Relativity , time helps us understand the three - dimensional experience of gravity .
But time is not a true spatial dimension like the three we 're familiar with .
Unlike width , length , and height , we only know time to move in one direction : past to present to future .
In this way , time merely serves as a yardstick for our personal experiences and our laws of physics .
Some theoretical equations incorporate many other " dimensions " -- velocity , temperature , or density , for example .
To assist you in imagining space curved in four dimensions , pay a visit to Flatland , a two - dimensional world full of square , triangular , and circular beings .
If it helps , draw Flatland and its residents on a sheet of paper and place it flat on a table in front of you .
The laws of 2D space as understood by 2D beings would restrict light ( and everything else ) from moving up and down ; in fact , there would be no up or down .
So as a three - dimensional being , your actions would violate the Flatlanders ' laws of physics .
Place your fingertips on Flatland -- you appear to them in many places at once .
Say " Hello " to Flatland -- your voice is also omnipresent .
And while Flatlanders cannot see beyond the boundaries of their world , to you they are nothing more than hollow geometrical shapes .
Regardless of the number of dimensions that describe a space , the curvature of that space , by definition , implies the existence of at least one more .
In other words , an additional dimension must exist into which the other dimensions can be curved .
You can curve Flatland in your three - dimensional reality by rolling the piece of paper into a tube , folding it into a paper airplane , or just crumpling it into a wad .
Doing so would not be immediately apparent to Flatlanders , because light still travels in straight lines within their 2D space .
They might experience some interesting phenomena , though - triangular residents might find that their interior angles no longer add up to 180 degrees , and parallel lines everywhere might begin to intersect .
If a 4D being decides to " crumple " our 3D space , like the Flatlanders , you would n't notice anything right away , either .
You might notice some unusual phenomena , like walking to your mailbox and ending up in Mongolia .
Scientists believe , however , that our space is smoothly curved -- more like a ball than a wad of paper -- and thus the effects are only noticeable on cosmological scales .
As 3D beings , we experience just the " surface " of the 4D ball , just as Flatlanders experience only two dimensions of their space that you can curve into three dimensions .

The Chandra X - ray observatory has taken a closer look at the galaxy Centaurus A , and new images have revealed in detail the effects of a shock wave blasting through the galaxy .
Powerful jets of plasma emanating from a supermassive black hole at the galactic core are creating the shock wave , and the new observation , have enabled astronomers to revise dramatically their picture of how jets affect the galaxies in which they live .
A team led by Dr. Judith Croston from the University of Hertfordshire and Dr. Ralph Kraft , of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics used very deep X - ray observations from Chandra to get a new view of the jets in Centaurus A .
The jets inflate large bubbles filled with energetic particles , driving a shock wave through the stars and gas of the surrounding galaxy .
By analyzing in detail the X - ray emission produced where the supersonically expanding bubble collides with the surrounding galaxy , the team were able to show for the first time that particles are being accelerated to very high energies at the shock front , causing them to produce intense X -ray and gamma-ray radiation .
Very high - energy gamma-ray radiation was recently detected from Centaurus A for the first time by another team of researchers using the High Energy Stereoscopic System ( HESS ) telescope in Namibia .
“ Although we expect that galaxies with these shock waves are common in the Universe , Centaurus A is the only one close enough to study in such detail , ” said Croston .
“ By understanding the impact that the jet has on the galaxy , its gas and stars , we can hope to understand how important the shock waves are for the life cycles of other , more distant galaxies . ”
Centaurus A ( NGC 5128 ) is one of our closest galactic neighbors , and is located in the southern constellation of Centaurus .
The supermassive black hole is the source of strong radio and X - ray emissions .
Visible in the image below , ( click here for a zoomable image from Chandra ) a combined image from Chandra and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment ( APEX ) telescope in Chile , is a dust ring encircling the giant galaxy , and the fast - moving radio jets ejected from the galaxy center .
The powerful jets are found in only a small fraction of galaxies but are most common in the largest galaxies , which are thought to have the biggest black holes .
The jets are believed to be produced near to a central supermassive black hole , and travel close to the speed of light for distances of up to hundreds of thousands of light years .
Recent progress in understanding how galaxies evolve suggests that these jet - driven bubbles , called radio lobes , may play an important part in the life cycle of the largest galaxies in the Universe .
Energetic particles from radio galaxies may also reach us directly as cosmic rays hitting the Earth ’s atmosphere .
Centaurus A is thought to produce many of the highest energy cosmic rays that arrive at the Earth .
The team believes that their results are important for understanding how such high - energy particles are produced in galaxies as well as for understanding how massive galaxies evolve .
The results of this research will be published in a forthcoming issue of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and were presented at the European Week of Astronomy and Space Science in the UK .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The National Security Agency intercepted Americans ’ e-mails and phone calls in recent months on a scale that went beyond limits set by the U.S. Congress last year , The New York Times reported on Wednesday .
The National Security Agency ( NSA ) logo is shown on a computer screen inside the Threat Operations Center at the NSA in Fort Meade , Maryland , January 25 , 2006 .

Citing unnamed intelligence officials , it said the NSA had engaged in “ ‘ over - collection ’ of domestic communications of Americans . ”
The sources variously characterized the practice as significant , systemic or unintentional , the Times said .
“ A series of classified government briefings have been held in recent weeks in response to a brewing controversy that some officials worry could damage the credibility of legitimate intelligence - gathering efforts , ” the paper said .
It said the Justice Department acknowledged in a statement on Wednesday that there had been problems with NSA surveillance operations and said they were resolved .
A bill passed by Congress in July 2008 authorizes U.S. intelligence agencies to eavesdrop without court approval on foreign targets believed to be outside the United States .
Critics complained that this allowed warrantless surveillance of phone calls and e-mails of Americans who communicate with the foreign targets .
The bill sought to minimize such eavesdropping on Americans , but critics said the safeguards were inadequate .
The Times said “ congressional investigators say they hope to determine if any violations of Americans ’ privacy occurred . ”
“ It is not clear to what extent the agency may have actively listened in on conversations or read e-mails of Americans without proper court authority , rather than simply obtain access to them , ” it added .
The 2008 bill was introduced after controversy over a warrantless domestic spying program , conducted under President George W. Bush ’s administration and revealed in 2005 .
It gave liability protection to telecommunications companies who took part in the program , part of the administration ’s “ war on terror ” launched after the September 11 attacks .
President Barack Obama has reversed some security policies of the Bush administration , ordering the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison for terrorism suspects within a year and an end to interrogation methods condemned as torture .
The April Numbers Are In – It ’s Official May 8 , 2009
Posted by geoff in News
UPDATE III : September ’s update is here
UPDATE II : Corrected graph available here .
[ UPDATE I : The May numbers are now in . ]
A couple of weeks ago I wrote a post on the predicted unemployment numbers for April .
Well , the real numbers came in today , and the result was exactly what they predicted : 8.9 % unemployment .
So once again , let ’s see how the actual unemployment numbers compare to what Obama ’s own economists predicted :
Oh my .
It appears that his economists can’t predict very well ( that fills me with confidence ) , and that his stimulus package is providing absolutely no benefit .
And it certainly does n’t look like his plan has “ saved or created 150,000 jobs . ”
[ Update : Why is this not a surprise ?
This is why . ]
[ Update II : The May numbers are now in . ]
This week , we finished up our 2009 Q1 release of the Intel driver .
Most of the effort for this quarter has been to stabilize the recent work , focusing on serious bugs and testing as many combinations as we could manage .
For the last year or so , we 've been busy rebuilding the driver , adding new ways of managing memory , setting modes and communicating between user space and the kernel .
Because all of these changes cross multiple projects ( X / Mesa / Linux ) , we 've tried to make sure we supported all of the possible combinations .
Let 's see what options we 've got :
Mode Setting
User mode .
The entire output side of the driver stack is in user mode ; all of the output detection , monitor detection , EDID parsing etc .
This has some significant limitations , the worst of which is that the kernel has no idea what 's going on , so you cannot show any kernel messages unless the X server relinquishes control of the display .
In particular , panic messages are lost to the user .
If the X server crashes , the user gets to reboot the machine .
A more subtle limitation is that the driver could n't handle interrupts , so there was n't any hot - plug monitor support .
That 's becoming increasingly important as people want hot - plug projector support , and as systems start including DisplayPort , which requires driver intervention when the video cable gets kicked out of the machine .
Kernel mode .
All of that code moves into the kernel , where it is exposed both as a part of the DRI interface and also through the frame buffer APIs for use by the fb console or any other frame buffer applications .
Lots of benefits here , but the development environment is entirely different from user mode , and so porting the code is a fair bit of work .
Dave Airlie has some pie - in - the - sky ideas about making the kernel mode setting code run in user mode by recompiling it with suitable user - mode emulation of the necessary kernel APIs .
Direct Rendering
None .
In this mode , the system does n't support direct rendering at all , so all rendering must go through the X server .
GL calls are generally implemented as a software rasterizer inside the X server .
DRI1 .
In this mode , applications share access to a single set of front / back / depth / stencil buffers .
They must carefully ensure that all of their drawing operations are clipped to the subset of each buffer that their window occupies .
Each application performs their own buffer swapping by copying contents from suitable regions of each buffer .
Synchronization with the X server is done through signals and a shared memory buffer .
While any application is executing , all other applications are locked out of the hardware , even if they would n't be conflicting .
DRI2 .
This gives each application private back / depth / stencil buffers ; they draw without taking any locks as the kernel mediates access to each object .
The real front buffer for each window is owned by the window system , and so requests to draw into it are directed through the window system API , using the DRI2 extension in the case of the X window system .
When applications ask to draw to the ' front ' buffer , they get a fake buffer allocated , which operates almost exactly like the back buffer , except that copies to the ' real ' front buffer are automatically performed at suitable synchronization points .
Memory Management
X server + Old - style DRI .
In this mode , the X server asks for a fixed amount of memory which is then permanently bound to the graphics aperture and treated like the memory on a discrete graphics card .
The X server allocates pixmaps from this fixed pool , when that runs out , it uses regular virtual memory .
It may move objects back and forth by copying them between the aperture and virtual memory .
This mode also supports direct rendering .
While the direct rendering application holds the DRI1 lock ( remember that from above ? ) , it has exclusive access to a area within the aperture which is granted to it by the X server .
Pages for this area are statically allocated ( by the X server ) .
Whenever the application loses the DRI1 lock , any or all of the data stored in those pages may be kicked out , so the application must be prepared to lose the data without notice .
For data like textures and vertex lists , which are generated by the application and not ( generally ) written by the GPU , this works fairly well ; the application has a copy of the data already and can re-upload it should it disappear .
GEM .
Here , no pages are statically allocated for exclusive use by the graphics system .
Instead .
individual objects ( " buffer objects " , or " bo's " ) are allocated as chunks of pages from regular virtual memory .
When not in -use , these objects can be paged out .
Furthermore , applications are n't limited to the graphics aperture space , they allocate from the system pool of virtual memory instead .
As objects are used by applications , the kernel dynamically maps them into the graphics aperture .
2D acceleration
None .
The X server has a complete software 2D rendering system ( fb ) , and if the driver does n't provide any accelerated drawing mechanism , the X server can use that software stack to provide all of the necessary drawing operations .
While it seems like this would be terribly slow , in reality , it 's not that bad as long as the target rendering surface is present in cached memory , and not accessed through a device in write - combining or uncached modes .
XAA .
This is the old XFree86 rendering architecture , and heavily focuses on ' classic ' X drawing operations , including zero - width lines , core text and even core wide lines and arcs .
It does not support accelerated drawing to anything other than the screen or pixmaps which precisely match the screen pixel format .
Pixmaps are allocated from a subset of the frame buffer , as if they were actually on the screen .
This causes huge problems for chips which have limited 2D addressing abilities ( like Intel 8xx - 945 and older ATI chips ) as they cannot use any memory beyond a single 2D allocation .
EXA .
This code was lifted from kdrive , where it was designed as a minimal graphics acceleration architecture for embedded X servers .
In that original design , all pixmaps were allocated in system memory as the target systems had essentially no off - screen memory available to the graphics accelerator .
In addition , with the goal of bringing up an X server quickly on simple hardware , the only accelerated operations were 2D solid fills and 2D blits .
However , one key feature of that code was that it provided a uniform API for drawing with arbitrary pixel formats .
As that code was moved into the core X server , it was changed so that pixmaps could be allocated from graphics memory .
In addition , acceleration for the Render extension was added so that modern applications could get reasonable performance for anti-aliased text and composited images .
However , it can only accelerate rendering to objects stored in graphics memory , and that memory must be pre-allocated by the X server ( see the Memory Management section above ) .
Once you run out of that memory , the X server is stuck trying to figure out what to do .
This single issue has been the focus of EXA development for the last couple of years -- when to move data between virtual memory and graphics memory .
Objects in graphics memory are drawn fastest with the GPU and objects in virtual memory can only be drawn with the CPU .
The key problem here is that reading data from graphics memory is horribly expensive , so the cost of moving an object from graphics memory to virtual memory is high .
When everything is in the right memory space , EXA runs fast .
When you start thrashing things around , EXA runs slow .
UXA .
Assume your GPU can draw to arbitrary memory .
Now assume that EXA 's basic drawing operations are sound , and do a reasonable job of supporting 2D applications ( as long as they fit within graphics memory ) .
UXA comes from the combination of these two assumptions -- GEM provides the first and the EXA drawing code provides the second .
UXA does n't need any of the ( ugly ) pixmap ' migration ' code because pixmaps never move -- they stay in their own little set of pages and the GEM code maps them in and out of the aperture as needed .
So , UXA and EXA are not far apart in style or substance , UXA simply skips the parts of EXA which are not necessary in a GEM world .
Pick One From Each Column
Now , many of the above choices can be made independently -- you can use User mode setting with DRI1 , classic memory management and XAA .
Or you can select Kernel mode setting with DRI1 , GEM and EXA .
With 2 × 3 × 2 × 4 = 48 combinations , you can imagine that :
Some of them can't work together
Some of them have n't been tested
Some of them have n't been tuned for performance
Some work well on i915 , and poorly on 965GM
Others work well on 965GM and poorly on 855
None of them ( yet ) work perfectly well everywhere
Two years ago , you had a lot fewer choices , only user mode setting , none or DRI1 direct rendering , only X server memory management and only none , XAA or EXA acceleration = 12 choices ) .
Even then , choosing between XAA and EXA was quite contentious -- EXA would thrash memory badly , while XAA would effectively disable acceleration for pixmaps as soon as it ran out of its ( tiny ) off - screen space .
In moving towards our eventual goal of a KMS / GEM / DRI2 world , we 've felt obligated to avoid removing options until that goal worked best for as many people as possible .
So , instead of forcing people to switch to brand new code that has n't been entirely stable or fast , we 've tried to make sure that each release of the driver has at least continued to work with the older options .
However , some of the changes we 've made have caused performance regressions in these older options , which does n't exactly make people happy -- the old code runs slow , and the new code is n't quite ready for prime time in all situations .
One option here would be to stop shipping code and sit around working on the ' perfect ' driver , to be released soon after the heat - death of the universe .
Instead , we decided ( without much discussion , I 'll have to admit ) to keep shipping stuff , make it work as well as we knew how , and engage the community in helping us make this fairly significant transition to our new world order .
We did , however , make a very conscious choice to push out new code quickly -- getting exposure to real users is often the best way to make sure you 're not making terrible mistakes in the design .
The thinking was that users could always switch back to the ' old ' code if the new code caused problems .
Of course , sometimes that ' old ' code saw fairly significant changes while the new code was integrated ...
You can imagine that our internal testing people have n't been entirely happy with this plan either -- our count of bugs has been far too high for far too long , and while we spent the last three months doing nothing but fixing things , it 's still a lot higher than I 'd like to see .
Performance Differences
Only a few things in the above lists have obvious performance implications -- choose XAA and your performance for modern applications will suffer as it offers no acceleration for the Render extension .
So , why does switching from EXA to UXA change the performance characteristics of the X server so much ?
The simple answer is that UXA , GEM and KMS have n't been tweaked on every platform yet .
For example , hardware rendering performance is affected by how memory is accessed by the drawing engine .
There are two ways of mapping pixels , " linear " and " tiled " .
In linear mode , pixels are stored in sequential addresses all the way across each scanline , subsequent scanlines are at ever higher addresses .
A simple plan , and all of the software rendering code in the X server assumes this model .
In tiled mode , rectangular chunks of the screen are stored in adjacent areas in memory , a block of 128x8 pixels forms an ' X tile ' in the Intel hardware .
Drawing to vertically adjacent pixels in this mode means touching the same page , reducing PTE thrashing compared with linear mode .
For systems with a limited number of PTEs and limited caches inside the graphics hardware , tiled mode offers tremendous performance improvements .
However , getting everything lined up to hit tiled mode is a pain , and on some hardware , in some configurations it does n't happen , so you see a huge drop in performance .
Similarly , mapping pages in and out of the GTT sometimes requires that the contents be flushed from CPU or GPU caches .
Now , GPU cache flushing is n't cheap , but we end up doing it all the time as that 's how rendering contents are guaranteed to become visible on the screen .
CPU cache flushing , on the other hand , is something you 're never " supposed " to do , as all I/O operations over PCI and communication between CPU cores is cache - coherent .
Except for the GPU .
So , we end up using some fairly dire slow - paths in the CPU whenever we end up doing this .
UXA is n't supposed to hit cache flushing paths while drawing , but sometimes it still happens .
So , you get UXA performance loss sometimes .
On the other hand , failing to dynamically map objects into the GTT means that some objects do n't fit , and so EXA spends a huge amount of time copying data around , in which case EXA suffers .
The difference between DRI1 and DRI2 is due in part to the context switch necessary to get buffer swap commands from the DRI2 application to the X server which owns the ' real ' front buffer .
For an application like glxgears which draws almost nothing , and spends most of its time clearing and swapping , the impact can be significant ( note , glxgears is not a benchmark , this is just one of many reasons ) .
On the other hand , having private back buffers means that partially obscured applications will draw faster , not having to loop over clip rectangles in the main rendering loop .
The obvious result here is that we 're at a point where application performance goes all over the map , depending on the hardware platform and particular set of configuration options selected .
Light at Tunnel's End
The good news is that our redesign is now complete , and we have the architecture we want in place throughout the system -- global graphics memory management , kernel mode setting and per-window 3D buffers .
This means that the rate of new code additions to the driver has dropped dramatically ; almost to zero .
Going forward , users should expect this ' perfect ' combination to work more reliably , faster and better as time goes by .
Right now , we continue to spend all of our time stabilizing the code and fixing bugs .
A minor but important piece of this work is to get UXA running without GEM so that we have EXA - like performance on older kernels .
That should be fairly straightforward as UXA shares all of the same basic EXA acceleration code , and the EXA pixmap migration stuff works best when it works in the most simplistic fashion possible ( move to GPU when drawing , move out only under memory pressure ) , something which we can provide in the GEM emulation layer already present under UXA .
Our overall plan is to focus our efforts on the ' one true configuration ' .
The best way to do that is to work on reducing the number of supported configurations until we get to just that one .
First on the block are XAA and EXA .
XAA because no - one should have to use that anymore , and EXA because it 's just UXA with some pixmap management stuff we do n't need .
There 's no reason UXA should be slower than EXA , once the various hidden performance bugs are fixed .
At the same time , DRI1 support will be removed .
We cannot support compositing managers under DRI1 , nor can we support frame buffer resize and a host of other new features .
You 'll still get a desktop without DRI1 , you just wo n't get accelerated OpenGL .
With the necessary infrastructure in the kernel and X server already released , this seems like the right time to switch off a huge pile of code .
Initial measurements from this work show that we 'll be shrinking our codebase by about 10 % .
Moving beyond this next quarterly release , the remaining ' legacy ' piece is the user mode setting code .
Something like 50 % of the code in the 2D driver relates this this , so removing it will rather significantly reduce our code base .
You can only imagine how excited we are about this prospect .
The goal is to take the driver we 've got and produce a leaner , faster more stable driver in the next few releases to come .
Chechnya 's capital , Grozny , was destroyed during the wars Russia has ended its decade - long " counter - terrorism operation " against separatist rebels in the southern republic of Chechnya , officials say .
The move aimed " to create conditions to further normalise the situation " , the National Anti-terrorist Committee said .
Russian forces have fought two wars in the mainly Muslim republic since 1994 .
Moscow says Chechnya has stabilised under its pro-Kremlin President , Ramzan Kadyrov , but human rights groups accuse his militias of widespread abuses .
" We received the news about cancelling the counter - terrorism operation with great satisfaction , " Mr Kadyrov told Russia 's Interfax news agency on Thursday .
Now the Chechen Republic ... is a peaceful , developing territory , and cancelling the counter - terrorism operation will only promote economic growth in the republic
Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov
Chechen problem far from over " The leadership of Russia has officially confirmed the fact that the nest of terrorism has been crushed , that illegal armed groups have been neutralised , and militant leaders on whose conscience lay the grief and suffering of thousands of people have been destroyed , detained and brought to court . "
" Now the Chechen Republic ... is a peaceful , developing territory , and cancelling the counter - terrorism operation will only promote economic growth in the republic , " he added , declaring that in future 16 April would be a public holiday .
Sporadic clashes persist in Chechnya , however , and violence continues in the neighbouring regions of Dagestan and Ingushetia .
Correspondents say Mr Kadyrov rules over Chechnya by fear .
Human rights groups have documented allegations of kidnappings , torture and murder of the president 's opponents .
Mr Kadyrov has dismissed such claims and denied any involvement .
Troop levels
In a statement on Thursday , Russia 's National Anti-terrorist Committee said it had " cancelled the decree imposing an anti-terror operation on the territory of Chechnya , effective from midnight [ 2000 GMT on Wednesday ] " .
" This decision aims to create conditions to further normalise the situation in the region , to restore and develop its economic and social infrastructure , " it said .
CHECHNYA KEY DATES 1991 USSR collapses , Chechen separatists declare independence 1994 Russia sends forces to crush independence movement 1996 Ceasefire called 1999 After explosions in Russia , Moscow sends troops back 2003 New constitution gives Chechnya more autonomy ; Akhmad Kadyrov elected president 2004 Kadyrov killed by bomb 2005 Separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov killed by troops 2006 March - Ramzan Kadyrov , son of Akhmad , becomes PM 2006 July - Warlord Shamil Basayev , Russia 's most wanted man , killed in Ingushetia 2007 Ramzan Kadyrov elected president by Chechen parliament 2009 Russia announces ended to " counter - terrorism operation "
The BBC's Richard Galpin in Moscow says the announcement is a moment of great symbolism - the official end of a conflict which first erupted in 1994 , and which has claimed more than 100,000 lives and left Chechnya in ruins .
But , our correspondent says , Wednesday 's decision reflects a reality on the ground which was established several years ago .
The separatist rebels have long been pushed to the margins , and have been unable to carry out any serious attacks for the past five years - not least due to the brutal tactics used by President Kadyrov , he adds .
And while the insurgents have been confined to the mountains , the capital Grozny is now being rapidly rebuilt , our correspondent says .
A huge , new mosque , named after Mr Kadyrov 's late father , opened last autumn .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered the end of the counter - terrorism operation after announcing last month that he believed the region was now stable enough to ease security restrictions .
These include curfews , road blocks , periodic searches by the security forces for suspected Islamist fighters , and relaxed detention rules .
" We must create new possibilities for investment and employment , " Mr Medvedev said in a broadcast on state television in March .
Chechnya will now be able to establish its own international airport and customs zone , which the authorities hope will encourage more trade .
It should also be much easier for Russians and foreigners to move in and out of the area .
However , our correspondent says it is not clear how many of the thousands of Russian troops will still remain in Chechnya .
Security sources have told the BBC that an entire army division of around 20,000 soldiers will continue to be based there .
The Russian interior ministry is meanwhile planning to withdraw 5,000 of its troops .
War - ravaged republic Chechnya declared independence from Russia in 1991 .
Three years later the Kremlin sent in troops to restore its authority , sparking the first Chechen war , which ended in humiliating defeat for Russian forces in 1996 .
Ramzan Kadyrov rose to power after the death of his father , Akhmad In 1999 , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin sent Russian troops back in , launching the " counter - terrorism operation " that has now been ended after 10 years .
The Kremlin pounded the rebels and gradually managed to persuade several powerful clan leaders to defect .
They included Akhmad Kadyrov , a senior Chechen religious leader , who later was elected president and declared his loyalty to Moscow .
He was killed in a bomb blast in October 2003 , but was eventually followed by his son , Ramzan .

Germany announced plans on Tuesday to ban the only genetically modified strain of corn grown in the European Union , dealing a new blow to the American manufacturer , Monsanto , and raising the specter of trade tensions with the United States .
The German agriculture minister , Ilse Aigner , said that the move was intended to protect the safety of consumers and the environment .
But she underlined that it would not represent a blanket ban on genetically modified crops .
“ My decision is not a political decision , it ’s a decision based on the facts , ” Ms. Aigner said .
“ I have come to the conclusion that there is a justifiable reason to believe that genetically modified maize of the type MON 810 presents a danger to the environment . ”
Kari Matalone , a spokeswoman for Monsanto , said the corn  which is engineered to resist pests  had been approved for cultivation in Europe more than a decade ago and that no ill effects had been detected since then .

To use a squat toilet , first decide whether you want to remove your pants or lower them to your ankles .
If you ’re new to squat toilets , it might be easier to take them off completely so they do n’t get in the way .
Once you ’re ready , stand over the toilet with one foot on each side .
Try not to squat directly over the hole since water could splash back up when you pee .
Instead , position yourself closer to the hood of the toilet if possible .
When you ’re lined up , bend your knees and lower yourself down into a deep squat .

参加者はgeekpageの人とか、生涯一プログラマの吉岡さんとか、SFCでネットワーク専門にやってる学士の人達とか少人数ながら錚々たる面子。
Akamaiの中の人が色々話してくれたんだけど、参加者からは矢継ぎ早に質問が投げかけられ、非常にホットな勉強会になった。私も質問するタイミングを図るのが大変でした。
参加者全員が 「 来て良かった 」 「想像以上だった」と大興奮な内容で、勉強会終わった後の懇親会でもAkamaiの方への質問は終始絶えなかった。
ここには書けないような話題もあったので、書ける範囲で書く。技術的な面は、他の人の方が詳しいだろうので、それ以外のところ。
Akamaiとは？
インターネット接続の不安定さを解消し、顧客企業のWebコンテンツ配信の信頼性を高めるサービスを展開している世界最強のCDN。
独自のコンテンツキャッシング技術、ピアリング技術、キャッシュへのDNS動的割り当て技術等によって、顧客企業のWebサイトを「Akamai化」することにより、コンテンツ配信の信頼性を100％(99.999%ではない!!)保証している。アメリカで100％を謳うとかありえない！
オライリーの 「 ハイパフォーマン スWebサイト 」 には、米国トッ プ10 サイト中5 サイト( amazon , aol , ebay , myspace , yahoo ) でAkamaiを利用と書いてありますが、今やもっとすごい状況になっているみたいです。アメリカの国防総省も使ってるみたい。これはWikipediaに載ってるから書いてよいよね。
最近はゲーム業界も大手はほぼ全てがAkamaiを採用していて、Akamaiにとっては美味しい状況だとか。確かに、オンラインゲーム切れたらまずいもんな。
Googleと同い年！
Googleと同い年だそうです。インターネットの表と裏の支配者がほぼ同時にスタートしているってのは興味深いですね。
ちなみに、アート引越しセンター理論と同様に「A」から始まる名前にしたかったとかで、ハワイ語の「Akamai」にしたんだそうな。英単語でAから始まるものなんて当然ながら全て他の企業に押さえられていたわけです。ちなみに「Akamai」は、CleverとかInteligentとかいう意味なんだそうだ。
世界 のWebトラフィックの15%程度をさばいている！
2009年3月現在、世界全体のインターネットトラフィックは、20Tbpsくらい。その中の10TがWebで使われていて、有効活用されているのは7Tくらい。その中の1TbpsをAkamaiはさばいている。つまり世界のWebトラフィックの15%程度をさばいている。
去年の末で、トラフィック総量が15Tbpsくらいだったらしいので、今も指数関数的な勢いで世界のインターネットトラフィックは伸びている。また、Web関係じゃない残りの10Tbpsのトラフィックの中で、利用が目立つのはP2P。
オバマ大統領の就任演説ストリーミングにもAkamaiが利用されたようで、そのときは世界同時700万アクセス、2Tbpsのトラフィックをさばいたそうな。
ちなみに日本の国会中継のストリーミングは同時接続500でダウンするらしく、そんなのに何億円もかけててアホかと。
個人的にはもっとさばいているのかなと思っていたのだけど、Akamaiとは関係のない個人のWebサイトとかそういうロングテールの部分がWebでは大きいんだなぁと改めて認識。
独自のデータセンターやネットワークを持っている訳ではない！
これは皆驚いていました。ISPにAkamaiのEdgeサーバーを置いて、それらを連携させることによってサービスを実現している。今や世界の半数以上のISPに総計4万台のサーバーを置いているのだそうだ。でもたった4万台。これも驚き。
つま りAkamaiはISPに間借りしているわけだけど、ISPからしてみても、Akamaiのサーバーを置く事にはかなりのメリットがあって置きたがる。Akamaiサーバーが外部コンテンツのキャッシュしたりキャッシュされてない情報もピアリングしてきてくれることによって、外部とのトラフィック(=通信費)を抑えることができるから。ISPは隣接しているISPとの通信状況しか分からないわけだけど、Akamaiサーバーは全世界のネットワークの状況が分かる訳なので。
各 Akamaiサーバーの状況は、20秒毎に更新され把握出来るようになっていて、冗長化も遠隔管理体制もばっちり。多少落ちても痛くも痒くも無い。リモートでOSをインストール(！)出来るようになっていて、必要なときは一部Windows機に切り替えたりもするみたい。仮想化は検討中だがまだやっていないとのこと。
ビジネス特許も強い ！
Akamaiが強い理由として、そのデファクト的な強さのほかに、パテント的な観点もある。技術的な特許のほかに、そのビジネスモデル自体にビジネス特許がかかっていて、競合の参入が難しい部分があるようです。
「 秘密結 社Akamai」とかそういうジョークも飛び出していました。
動的コンテンツもキャッシュ出来る！
これもすごい話。CDNというと、静的コンテンツのキャッシュのみという印象がありますが、Akamaiは顧客企業から情報をもらうことによって、Akamaiサーバーで一部の情報を処理することも可能みたいです。
ショッピングサイトなんかが混み合っているときに、これまでの行動履歴から購入意欲の少なそうだと判断した人はAkamaiサーバーのエラーメッセージで止めてしまって、購入意欲の有りそうな人に優先的に実サーバーへのアクセスを割り振るなんてこともやっているとのことでした。
もちろん上に書いたようなことは何れもサーバー側の自動処理なので、社員はそういう情報を見たりは出来ない。Akamai社員がAkamaiサーバーに実際に触る事自体に社内的な規制がかなりかかっているみたい。
その他
ユーザー毎にDNSを動的に書きかえる技術なんかも驚いたけど、これについてはもっと正確に解説出来る人がいると思うのでここで多くは書かない。
中国にも現地法人があって 、Akamaiサーバーは置いてあるけど、デフォルトでは機能はオフになっている。中国政府にコンテンツの審査を申請して、一ヶ月位したら許可が下りてやっと公開できるという流れになるらしい。
ただ、共産圏には基本的に はAkamaiサーバーは置かせてもらえないらしく、例えばロシアには置かれていない。中国は実はどちらかというと寛容で特殊な例。
Akamaiのサーバーが攻撃されても、もともとISPにAkamaiサーバーを置く際に、そのISP自体のトラフィック許容量よりも高い許容力をサーバーに持たせるので、Akamaiサーバーが落ちるよりも早くISPが落ちる(笑)
もちろんそんなことになる前に攻撃を弾いたり他のサーバーに流したりとかやりようはいくらでもある。いわば、全世界に40,000台のファイアウォールがあるようなもの。
数年前 にAkamaiが落ちた事があったけど、その原因を聞いてしまった。リンク先にあるようにDoS攻撃が原因ではないみたいです。流石にこれ以上はここには書けません。

Sales for BMW ’s M Division were up 50 % in 2008 .
Go figure .
And , when they announced these figures back in February of this year , BMW M Gmbh promised to actually expand its range in 2009 , bucking the current economic climate and prevailing trends .
Until now their product line included the M3 Coupe / Sedan / Convertible , M5 , M6 Coupe / Convertible and Z4 M Roadster / Coupe .
The 2009 NY Auto Show will showcase the new BMW X6 M and BMW X5 M sporting twin - turbocharged 555 hp engine capable of 500 lb- ft of torque in a wide power band from 1,500 up to 5,650 rpm .
This is a substantial boost from the standard 4.4 - liter twin - turbocharged V8 found in both previous top - of - the - line vehicles that produced a maximum of 400 hp and 450 lb - ft of torque .
And how , pray - tell , did they accomplish this feat ?
With a little engineering wizardry known as Cylinder - bank Comprehensive Manifold ( CCM ) .
The new M engine is the first in the world with a pulse - tuned exhaust manifold covering the cylinder rows in combination with high - performance twin - scroll twin turbo technology .
The end result is that both models perform 0 to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds .
For the first time in a BMW M model , there is a new 6 - speed M Sports Automatic transmission that offers various drive options including Sport and M manual modes .
Switching gears is controlled by operating aluminum paddle shifters that , when pulled on the left , downshift and , pulled on the right , upshift .
There is also a Launch Control feature available for when you need to get out of your driveway and down to the grocery store in a hurry .
Basically , you activate DSC - Off mode , keep the brake peddle pressed down in first gear while pushing the gas to at least 60 % throttle , which sets launch control to standby ( hint : two feet are required ) .
When you see the starter flag on the center console you can release the brake peddle and hurl yourself in any direction at breakneck speed .
The BMW X6 M and BMW X5 M share a hood , gaping front air dam and headlights .
They also have special gills in the front fenders and a new rear fascia in back featuring a set of double - tipped exhaust outlets .
The wheels are 20 inch alloys sporting 275/40 R 20s in front and 315/35 R 20 in back .
Massive brakes are required to bring these hefty powerhouses to a stop .
The M braking system includes 15.6 inch rotors with 4 piston fixed calipers in front and 15.2 inch rotors working with floating calipers in rear .
To keep things stable , controllable and in check BMW offers xDrive ( all wheel drive ) , Dynamic Performance Control , Dynamic Stability Control ( DSC ) , AntiLock Brakes ( ABS ) , Dynamic Brake Control , Trailer Stability Control , Hill Descent Control , Cornering Brake Control , Brake Fade Compensation , Brake Drying , Adaptive Drive , Electronic Damping Control , Active Roll Stabilization ( ARS ) ….
Basically , you get a lot of electronic systems that do their best to prevent you from putting these things into Indy - style roll flips .
But the point is that BMW has really put alot of well spent time and energy into engineering a vehicle that is both incredible from a performance standpoint and practical and safe as a daily driver .
And with the general lack of announcements and pizzaz out of the 2009 New York Auto Show , the BMW X5 M and BMW X6 M will be real show - stoppers .
We can only hope that we see the M treatment applied to the last remaining standout , the BMW 1 Series , in the very near future .

TOKYO -- Marijuana arrests are soaring in Japan , causing a public sensation in a nation where illegal - drug use is relatively rare .
What has made the wave of arrests especially shocking to some Japanese is numerous drug busts involving the country 's elite -- professional athletes , doctors and students at top universities -- who are expected to act as exemplary citizens .

In my book Death from the Skies ! , I described Earth 's first mass extinction event : the evolution of bacteria that were able to ingest the primitive atmosphere of the time , and excrete oxygen .
To these little beasties , oxygen was a lethal poison , and when enough accumulated in the atmosphere , it killed off a lot of our planet 's nascent life .
They could n't survive their own waste ( and , as I point out in the book , take home whatever cautionary tale from that you like ) .
The survivors were ones who could use this new molecule to their advantage .
Billions of years later , those survivors became us .
But how many billions of years ?
Current thinking is that this event happened about 2.7 billion years ago .
But new data seem to indicate that this event may have happened earlier than that .
A lot earlier : like 3.5 billion years ago .
This new data comes in the form of geological core samples containing hematite , a mineral that forms either through aerobic processes of bacteria ( that is , biology using oxygen ) or through photolysis ( chemical changes from light ) due to sunlight .
But that latter happens only near the surface of water , and the hematite in the core samples seem to be from too deep in water to be from photolysis .
The new data are controversial , of course .
It 's one thing to push back a date for an event like this , but another entirely to do so by 750 million years !
A lot of current evidence points to free oxygen being produced 2.7 billion years ago .
Clearly , either one or both of these measurements is wrong .
Sometimes , when I hear a controversy like this , I wonder if they 're both in fact right : maybe there was free oxygen produced at the earlier date , and it went away for a time due to some mysterious event , and then came back 700 million years later as cyanobacteria rediscovered how wonderful oxygen is .
I 'm just talking out of my hat there .
Usually in science , when there are two contradictory sets of data , one turns out to be wrong .
Misinterpreted or dated incorrectly .
But not always .
The fun part of this will be the arguing that goes on between scientists as they try to figure this one out .
My advice for them : before arguing , take a deep breath .
And whoever turns out to be right , remember just why you can take that breath .
There 's no way that , all those eons ago , those little bacteria could have known that their distant descendants would ponder their very existence .
But life 's funny that way .
The real reason all the good air went away .

Nuit de la Glisse
Norwegian skier Fred Syversen was filming a ski moviewith his crew last year .
While he was approaching the grand finale , the big drop in the end of the line Fred Syversen went too right and dropped the wrong cliff .
Unintentionally he skied a line that lead to his 107 meters cliff drop .
His speed was estimated to be over 80 km/h when he jumped .
Fred is lucky to be alive .
A 107 - meter fall is absolutely staggering .
It ’s incredible that he survived .
Fred even landed close to the rocks , and he was buried more than 2.5 meters in the snow .
He was flown to hospital where they found minor damage in his liver .
He was ordered to take it easy for the next few weeks .

Ten years ago , William Fenical of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography isolated from an ocean - living fungus a compound that has since shown the ability to kill cancer cells in the lab .
Now , for the first time , MIT chemists have synthesized the compound , an advance that could open the door to new drug treatments for cancer .
The compound , known as (+ ) - 11,11 '- Dideoxyverticillin
A , is one of the most structurally complex members of a family of naturally occurring alkaloids .
Mohammad Movassaghi , associate professor of chemistry , graduate student Justin Kim and former postdoctoral associate James Ashenhurst reported the synthesis in the April 10 issue of Science .
Their 11 - step synthesis , which starts with commercially available amino acids , provides ample quantities of the natural alkaloids and gives access to a wide range of related compounds , enabling thorough biological evaluation of these types of alkaloids as anticancer agents .
" If you want to only rely on the natural substance , you often have to go back to the natural source and extract more material for further study .
Â
This is certainly OK if getting to the natural source is easy and if the extraction yield is acceptable , " said Movassaghi .
" However , with a chemical synthesis you can rely on commercially available starting material , scale up the synthesis as needed , and make designed derivatives of the compound of interest . "
Movassaghi said his team was drawn to the compound not just for its anti-cancer potential but also for its fascinating chemical structure .
The (+) -11,11 '- Dideoxyverticillin
A molecule has 10 rings and eight stereogenic centers , or carbon atoms that have four different chemical groups attached to them .
" Because of the interesting structures , these compounds provide an ideal arena for exploring and developing new chemistry , " said Movassaghi .
" As you try to make the molecule , you become aware of its chemistry and oftentimes it 's very informative in terms of it's possible mode of action . "
When carbon atoms have four different groups attached to them , they can take on two possible arrangements , which are mirror images of each other .
Producing the correct arrangement for all stereocenters was particularly challenging , said Movassaghi .
As large chemical structures are attached to each carbon , it also becomes more difficult to perform additional reactions at the same carbon atom , because the extra bulk makes the carbon less accessible .
Movassaghi says that while each step of the synthesis was difficult to figure out , the hardest task was designing the overall order of the synthesis .
The molecule has several bonds that are very sensitive to oxidation or cleavage , so each reaction must occur in a precise order that will not expose those bonds to degradation .
" Justin and James had the solutions to each of the independent steps much earlier , but the major challenge was recognizing what would be the optimal sequence for each of these events to occur , " said Movassaghi .
Now that the chemical synthesis has been demonstrated , researchers can tinker with it to produce similar compounds that may also have potential pharmacological activity .
The natural function of (+ ) - 11,11 '- Dideoxyverticillin
A is not known , but it is likely to be involved in either natural defense or signaling mechanisms -- Â " chemical warfare at the microbial level , " as Movassaghi describes it .
In other words , a colony of fungus might secrete the substances , toxic to competing species , to prevent invaders from stealing the same food and other resources .
" While the natural source may use this compound for defense or signaling , other scientists have shown this compound as having potential for treatment of cancer due to its antiangiogenic activity and efficacy against human breast cancer cell lines , " Movassaghi said .
Movassaghi is an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow and a Beckman Young Investigator .
The research was supported in part by non-restricted funds from Amgen , AstraZeneca , Boehringer Ingelheim , GlaxoSmithKline , Merck and Lilly .
A version of this article appeared in MIT Tech Talk on April 29 , 2009 ( download PDF ) .
A mother of four is facing up to five years in a Thai prison after allegedly stealing a bar mat from an Aussie - theme bar in Phuket .
Annice Smoel , 36 , of Montrose in Melbourne 's outer east , says she spent two nights in a four - by - four - metre jail with three other inmates before being released on bail .
Annice Smoel says the bar mat ' theft ' was a prank .

She says she was arrested by undercover police on May 3 after leaving the Aussie Bar .
" I get very scared when I see police .
I 'm just trying to keep it together , so I can get home , " she said .
14 - hour making - of video for Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea also discussed
The third - party GhibliWorld.com website reports that Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki said that studio co-founder Hayao Miyazaki is planning his next project .
Suzuki made the comments during this past weekend 's Ghibli Asemamire radio show on Tokyo FM .
Suzuki noted that Miyazaki , the director of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind , My Neighbor Totoro , and Spirited Away , has not told Suzuki all the details of the next work .
Suzuki had indicated last June that Miyazaki is planning anime shorts for the Ghibli Museum as his next projects and that Miyazaki was looking at a classic Japanese folk tale about sumo - wrestling mice .
Miyazaki himself said at the Venice International Film Festival last August that he thinks that the next anime he will oversee is at least three more years in the future , when he will be over 70 .
Suzuki also revealed that there will be a 14 - hour making - of documentary for Miyazaki 's latest film , Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea ( pictured at right ) .
The documentary will include footage that already aired on NHK Professional and other programs , as well as other footage that the Japanese public broadcaster NHK filmed over the past two years .
The similar Mononoke Hime wa Kōshite Umareta documentary was six hours , 40 minutes long .
The Nikkei financial news source reported last month that Ghibli plans to open Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea in North American theaters this summer .
Miyazaki's longtime friend and colleague , Pixar and Disney 's John Lasseter ( Toy Story , Cars ) , will produce the North American release as he had for Miyazaki's Howl 's Moving Castle and the Oscar - winning Spirited Away .
Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki announced last June that co-producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy ( E.T. the Extra - Terrestrial , Back to the Future , Jurassic Park ) are also handling the North American release .

Gallup : 8 in 10 Americans favor some form of legal abortion
2 hours ago ago
Sept. 30 ( UPI ) -- Eight in 10 Americans approve of legalized abortion in some form -- but the vast majority also believe there should be at least some restrictions on the procedure , a new Gallup survey shows .
We ’ve got an inside scoop on Ubisoft ’s upcoming title , Assassin ’s Creed II , and it looks like the team in Montreal really went all out this time around .
As you may know , the main character in this installment is Ezio Auditore di Firenze .
He ’s a much better swimmer than Altair ever was , and apparently more of a “ ladies man ” .
We ’ll let you speculate on the gameplay possibilities there .
What the developers really wanted with this game though is to give the player a greater sense of freedom than before , as well as increase the number of missions you can take part in .
Repetitiveness was a big complaint with the first Assassin ’s Creed , so hopefully that problem has been eliminated in the sequel .
The swimming mechanics have dual usage , as Ezio can hide himself underwater , or hide his victims in water cases .
Diving is also possible , and definitely implies some hairy situations that Ezio will have to get out of .
Though there are weapons at your disposal , Ezio can also use his fists to fend off enemies with both offensive and defensive moves .
The last interesting tidbit is that Ezio ’s attire comes from the noble families of Italy , so he may have a much bigger agenda than what the developers are letting on .

SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) -
The financial crisis has slashed industrial output and trade but it will be months before there is an accurate picture of how much the downturn has curbed greenhouse gas emissions , two leading scientists said on Friday .
Migrant workers dig a trench in front of a power station on the outskirts of the town of Xichuan in Henan province February 20 , 2009 .
REUTERS / David Gray
Preliminary data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) shows carbon dioxide levels rose last year to a global average of 384.9 parts per million , an increase of 2.2 ppm over 2007 .
But since then , the financial crisis has deepened , and analysts have been hoping the long - term growth in emissions will slow or stall now that many big economies are in recession .
So far though , preliminary trends do not show this and it could be 2010 before an accurate picture emerges .
“ To see the effect of this recession , if it ’s reducing emissions , I ’d say it would take one to two years to see that signal properly in the atmosphere .
I do n’t think we ’ve seen any signal yet , ” said Paul Fraser of Australia ’s state - backed Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation .
CSIRO runs one of a global network of monitoring stations that measure atmospheric concentrations of planet - warning greenhouse gases including CO2 , methane and nitrous oxide .
California - based Scripps Institution of Oceanography is also part of the network .
CAPE GRIM
Measurements are done about every two hours at the site at Cape Grim in the far southern Australian state of Tasmania .
“ You already have a huge bank of these gases in the atmosphere so the changes you ’re making to the emissions each year have a relatively small impact on current concentrations , ” said Fraser , chief research scientist at CSIRO ’s division of Marine and Atmospheric Research in Melbourne .
“ You ’re looking for subtle changes and there are lots of process that can contribute to those and sometimes it takes years to see the underlying pattern that you might think should have been there earlier , ” he told Reuters .
A major task was filtering out “ synoptic noise ” from weather patterns moving the gases around locally and across the planet .
He said his team studying the stream of data from Cape Grim regularly checked for trends .
“ We keep saying one of the huge drivers of these CO2 increases is the 1 to 2 percent growth that ’s been going on for a long time in the global economy and clearly that ’s not happening at the moment .
“ So you would expect to see a signal , yes .
I just do n’t know how quickly we can resolve that from the noise . ”
Preliminary data from a NOAA monitoring station at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii shows CO2 levels at 386.66 ppm in January this year , compared with 385.16 ppm a year earlier and 382.62 ppm in January 2007 .
Ralph Keeling , director of Scripps ’ CO2 program , said stopping a CO2 rise would require roughly a 57 percent drop in fuel emissions .
“ What we would expect to see eventually is a slowing in the rise of CO2 tied to the reduction in emissions , not a cessation of the rise , ” he told Reuters in an email .
“ But it will probably take a year or more to clearly pick out this change .
Our records suggest that CO2 is still rising , as expected . ”
Britain 's failure to protect its citizens from secret surveillance on the internet is to be investigated by the European Commission .
The move will fuel claims that Britain is sliding towards a Big Brother state and could end with the Government being forced to defend its policy on internet privacy in front of judges in Europe .
The legal action is being brought over the use of controversial behavioural advertising services which were tested on BT 's internet customers without their consent .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Yesterday , the EU said it wanted " clear consent " from internet users that their private data was being used to gather commercial information about their web shopping habits .
Under the programme , the UK - listed company Phorm has developed technology that allows internet service providers ( ISPs ) to track what their users are doing online .
ISPs can then sell that information to media companies and advertisers , who can use it to place more relevant advertisements on websites the user subsequently visits .
The EU has accused Britain of turning a blind eye to the growth in this kind of internet marketing .
Yesterday , the EU telecoms commissioner , Viviane Reding , said : " I call on the UK authorities to change their national laws and ensure that national authorities are duly empowered and have proper sanctions at their disposal to enforce EU legislation . "
Last year , BT tested the Phorm technology to track its customer 's internet searches without their knowledge , provoking complaints from users and from UK members of the European Parliament .
Because it is considered lawful to intercept data when there is " reasonable grounds for believing " there is consent , the issue falls outside the UK 's wiretapping laws .
Linda Weatherhead of Consumer Focus said : " While phone tapping is clearly illegal and unacceptable , it seems that spying on the digital communications and activity is not . "
Richard Clayton , treasurer of the Foundation for Information Policy Research ( FIPR ) – which described Phorm as " illegal " last year – said : " The laws are fit for purpose , but it seems that Whitehall have misunderstood their own laws . "
He said that users at both ends need to have consented to the system , which is not the case here and so contravenes the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act from 2000 .
The Commission is also critical of the Government 's implementation of the European electronic privacy and personal data protection rules .
They state that EU countries must ensure the confidentiality of communications by banning the interception and surveillance of internet users without their consent .
Ms Reding said : " We have been following the Phorm case for some time and have concluded that there are problems in the way the UK has implemented parts of EU rules on the confidentially of communications . "

She added that the enforcement of the laws " should allow the UK to respond more vigorously to new challenges of e-privacy and personal data protection such as those that have arisen in the Phorm case .
It should also help reassure UK consumers about their privacy and data protection while surfing the internet . "
The EU 's intervention was welcomed by privacy campaigners .
The Open Rights Group recently wrote to some of the world 's biggest websites including Google , Yahoo and Facebook , asking them to block Phorm .
Its executive director , Jim Killock , said yesterday : " There are big legal questions surrounding BT 's use of Phorm , so we welcome the EU taking the Government to task .
It 's a pity our own Government have n't had more backbone and stood up for their voters ' rights . "
The UK has two months to reply to the EC 's formal notification .
Should no satisfactory response be made , the Commission could issue a reasoned opinion , before the case moves to the European Court of Justice .
Last year the Information Commissioner 's Office passed the Phorm technology as legal .
Advertisers are particularly keen on this form of marketing as the more targeted it becomes , the more value for money they feel the advert offers .
One consultant said : " It is basically a very fine line between advertising that helps people and those that intrude . "
Phorm boss Kent Ertugrul has been increasingly forced on to the back foot over the issue of privacy , fending off a series of questions over the issue last week at a " town hall " meeting .
He said that the technology does not store information to identify a user ; that all participants can opt out of it ; and that it complies with data protection and privacy laws .
The group added yesterday that the Commission 's statement did not contradict that its technology was fully compliant with UK legislation and EU directives .
It is illegal in the UK to unlawfully intercept communications , but this is limited to " intentional " interception , the EC said yesterday .
This is also considered lawful when those intercepting have " reasonable grounds for believing " consent has been given .
There is no independent national supervisory authority dealing with such cases .
Several bodies including FIPR have blamed the Government and the UK regulators for playing " pass the parcel " with the issue , which has left it hanging with no one wanting to enforce it .
The Commission received its first complaints over the issue in April last year following BT 's trial .
Other providers including Virgin and Carphone Warehouse 's TalkTalk are also interested .
Users complained to the UK data protection authority and the police .
The Commission wrote to the UK authorities in July and upon receiving the answers " has concerns that there are structural problems in the way the UK has implemented EU rules " .
Simon Davis , director of Privacy International , believes the row has erupted more over " sovereignty than substance .
It is almost entirely political " .
' Big Brother ' Britain : Private data under threat
* The mobile calls , emails and website visits of every person in Britain will be stored for a year under sweeping new powers which came into force this month .
The new powers will for the first time place a legal duty on internet providers to store private data .
* Privacy campaigners warn that all this information could be used by the Government to create a giant " Big Brother " super - database containing a map of everyone 's private life .
The Home Office is expected shortly to publish plans for the storage of data which it says will be invaluable in the fight against crime .
* Facebook , one of the world 's biggest internet sites , faced a privacy backlash when thousands of members signed a petition calling on the website to remove an advertising programme called Beacon , which can be used to track the spending habits of its users ' visits to other websites .
* Google also courted controversy this year when it launched Street View , the controversial 3D mapping feature , in the UK .
In one village householders stopped a Google vehicle from taking pictures of their street .
OTTAWA–International Trade Minister Stockwell
Day is holding out hope that Canada can avoid a disastrous trade war with the United States sparked by protectionist Buy American provisions in President Barack Obama 's proposed economic stimulus package .
" I 'm cautiously optimistic that something can be worked out , " Day said in a telephone press conference from Davos , Switzerland , where he is attending the World Economic Forum .
Fears of protectionist measures in Obama 's $ 820 billion ( U.S. ) pro-growth plan were a source of widespread concern at the annual gathering of international business leaders and political figures at the Swiss ski resort .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper and other world leaders have expressed alarm about proposals before the U.S. Congress that could require that all steel or manufactured goods purchased with money from the stimulus package be made in the United States .
But Day said his talks in Davos with Peter Allgeier , the acting U.S. trade representative , led him to think that Canada , America 's biggest commercial partner , might be exempted from the Buy American stipulation .
" In no uncertain terms they 're telling us : ` We hear you , we recognize you 've got concerns with this , we 're doing some work .
Keep talking to us , and stay tuned . ' "
That , said Day , " is sort of the message I 'm getting from the U.S. trade representative . "
Legislation containing Obama 's stimulus package has passed the House of Representatives .
It contains a rider requiring iron or steel used in projects funded under the $ 820 - billion plan be made in the United States .
A version of the bill that goes to the Senate this week expands the stipulation so that most foreign - made manufactured goods would be barred from these projects .
The issue presents Obama with his first major dilemma .
While the Buy American provision would be seen around the world as an abandonment of Washington 's traditional support of free trade , it could be a domestic political winner among protectionist lawmakers and the unions that helped Obama capture the White House .
So far , the president has not taken a position on the Buy American strategy , but a White House spokesperson said on Friday that the new administration is examining how to handle the issue .
Day said he is encouraged by the White House 's willingness to consider Ottawa 's interests .
" Their awareness of our concern , and wanting to do something , appears genuine at this point .
And we 'll just keep working closely with them , " Day said .
" The last thing we need now is a retaliatory trade war . "
But he cautioned that he could not guarantee that Canada would be spared the impact of the protectionist rules being considered in the economic stimulus package .

And Day hinted that the trade issue , if unresolved , has the potential to cast a shadow over Obama 's visit to Canada on Feb. 19 .
The trip , the first foreign foray by the president , will come just a few days after Obama hopes to rush the economic stimulus package into law .
Asked if that could be an irritant when Obama meets Harper in Ottawa , Day said : " You can clearly make suppositions from there that if it's not resolved by the time the president arrives here , I know how concerned our PM is about this .
" You can do your guesswork from there . "
Day also said Canada is preparing for the worst by assiduously examining its legal options under the open - trading regimes of the Canada - U.S. - Mexico NAFTA agreement and the World Trade Organization .
Finance Minister Jim Flaherty , also in Davos , told reporters the United States should expect stiff resistance from its trading partners around the world if the Buy American provisions remain in the stimulus package .
" There is a clear consensus here that protectionism needs to be avoided , that protectionism is a direction we need not go , " Flaherty remarked .
But he said it 's obvious that , in the midst of a recession with plummeting employment , protectionist measures can be " populist and popular in the short term . "
However , such beggar - thy - neighbour policies create long - term damage to the world economy , he added .
Both Flaherty and Day warned that protectionist polices could spur retaliation around the world and choke off economic growth in a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s .
Flaherty said that , with the world mired in a recession , the mood at Davos this year was " quite sombre . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A post -9/11 law that sets federal standards for state driver 's licenses and identification cards is under fire from the head of the agency enforcing that law , the Department of Homeland Security .
Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano , here last week in San Pedro , California , wants to replace the Real ID .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano this week said she is working with governors to repeal the Real ID Act , which was passed in 2005 and went into effect last year .
The bill is popular in Washington , but is scorned by many governors who bear the responsibility and cost of validating that holders of driver 's licenses are citizens or legal residents of the United States .
Napolitano , former governor of Arizona , said she has met with governors of both parties recently " to look at a way to repeal Real ID . "
She said she wants to substitute the federal law with " something else that pivots off of the driver 's license but accomplishes some of the same goals .
And we hope to be able to announce something on that fairly soon . "
Napolitano made her remarks Tuesday in response to a question at a conference of the Anti-Defamation League .
On Wednesday , Rep. James Sensenbrenner , R- Wisconsin , a sponsor of the law , said he was " angered " by Napolitano 's comments .
" Real ID is a necessary program for keeping America safe .
It is the will of Congress and also a recommendation of the 9/11 Commission , " Sensenbrenner said .
" When the Democrats took over the majority in the 110th Congress , they said they wanted to implement all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations .
I am highly disappointed that they are going back on their word by repealing this important recommendation , and substituting it with a weaker , less safe program that provides terrorists with too many avenues to attack . "
While Napolitano is looking for ways to repeal Real ID , her department 's Web site continues to espouse the law 's merits .
" Raising the standards of state - issued identification is an important step toward enhancing national security , " the Web site says .
" Because a driver 's license serves so many purposes [ access to federal buildings , nuclear power plants , boarding aircraft , etc. ] , terrorists actively seek fraudulent state - issued identification .
The Real ID rules will make it more difficult for them , while making it easier for law enforcement to detect falsified documents , " it says .
The law , which requires all states to enforce specific identification requirements for driver 's licenses and identification cards , went into effect last year , but the federal government has given states until the end of this year to implement it .
States can get extensions until May 2011 for implementation if they meet certain benchmarks .

yes .
First of al hymen has nothing to with it , You cannot really know whether it broken or not , it has holes in it in the first place ( for menstrual blood to get out ) and it can break at any time in childhood - before the girl ever has sex ( but she is still a virgin until she has sex )
Second , any contact of the penis with the inside or even OUTSIDE of the vagina - whether the man ejaculates or not - can result in pregnancy because there can be " pre -*** " that some men do not even feel , but it may cause conception .
So please , use protection ALWAYS !
" Pre -*** or pre-ejaculatory fluid is released when a guy gets an erection .
It cleans out the inside of the urethra , which is the tube that carries semen and urine out of the penis .
But , if there are live sperm inside a guy 's urethra ( because he has ejaculated recently ) , the pre-*** can " pick up " the leftover sperm on its way through the urethra and out of the penis .
If a guy pees after he ejaculates , that would kill leftover sperm .
So , say a guy has sex and cums at 9 p.m .
He does n't go to the bathroom after he has sex .
At 10 p.m. , he gets another erection and pre-*** fluid is released .
That can have live sperm in it .
Is it enough sperm to get a girl pregnant ?
But pre-*** can carry sexually transmitted diseases , so a guy should put on a condom as soon as he gets an erection "

Can sperm cross the hymen membrane ?
Answer
Yes , it 's a fact .
The sperm will wait till the eggs are released and you are still able to get pregnant .
It 's not common , but you could be a virgin and be pregnant .
Answer
Yes , if any semen " leaked in " her vaginal opening , there is a chance she could become pregnant .
Answer
Yes , because there is normally a opening in the hymen of a girl to release the menstrual blood .
Through this opening the semen can come into the vagina . "
Editors Note :
This article was originally published in April 2009 .
We have re-featured it now for the World Cup , however it has not been updated to keep up with the latest in hot WAGdom .
Back in 2002 , ITV launched a television drama titled Footballers ’
Wives , whose main subject matter concerned a fictional English Premier League club , its players , and of course their wives .
Influenced by the lifestyles of some prominent real - life wives , such as Victoria Beckham , the characters were scandalous , often cold - hearted , and the show featured more gold diggers than California circa 1849 .
Although the label WAG had yet to come into the lexicon , the kind of stereotypes these women portrayed was nothing new .
Footballers ’
Wives was simply a medium to showcase these concepts to a larger audience .
The show lasted five seasons , and even managed a few spin - offs including a failed American pilot .
All in all it helped make athlete ’s significant others a more mainstream topic .
Fast forward to 2006 , when the term WAG took off .
For those not familiar , it ’s an acronym for Wives And Girlfriends .
The phrase was n’t a new one , having been kicked around for at least a few years , but the British Tabloid Press helped take it mainstream .
Technically , the term is pretty self - explanatory , but practically it is a loaded phrase .
If conjures visions of a woman who is a particular sort of predator and whose sole purpose in life is to bag a rich footballer and live to excess off the back of his income .
Stereotypical characteristics of a WAG include notably fake tans , extraordinarily large sunglasses , expensive boutique fashion , and a compulsion to live life in the public eye .
Soon the Internet joined in , and websites were dedicated to these women , appreciating the beauty they bring and mocking the crazy that comes along with it .
We here at Gunaxin claim to be no different .
While we realize that many of these women are vapid and shallow , many still manage to look incredible .
What follows is our ranking of the Top 100 Footballer Wives and other girlfriends from the world of soccer .
To annoy both sides of the Atlantic , I will continually alternate between calling the sport football and soccer .
The criteria to qualify is simple , just date a professional soccer player .
While I ’d love to restrict the rankings to current WAGs , its too hard to keep up with all the comings and goings with the various relationships across many countries .
That , and the fact I really do n’t care about such information .
Celebrity gossip is best left to others actually interested in such stuff .
What I ’m here for are the beautiful ladies .
And while I made a good faith effort to keep the relationships listed below up to date , I offer no guarantee on their accuracy .
To account for this , the Top 100 below includes current and former girlfriends .
All you need is to have dated a footballer , past or present .
As the saying goes , “ Once a WAG , always a WAG . ”
But that ’s where I draw the line .
Fictional relationships , like how Chelsea ’s Joe Cole tried to seduce Keeley Hazell does n’t pass the standard .
So as much as it pains me , Keeley is not a WAG .
Although the Joe Cole story does have a nice ending ( allegedly ) , as apparently another potential suitor was n’t too thrilled with Cole ’s advances and decided to pummel him until he escaped out a window .
Anyhow , here ’s our Top 100 Footballer Wives and Girlfriends :
100 . Victoria Beckham
Significant Other : married to David Beckham ( A.C. Milan on loan from Los Angeles Galaxy )
I was tempted to not include Posh Spice at all .
On one hand , she ’s gone all Jenna Jameson on us , and that ’s not good .
When you look like you hail from another planet , something ’s gone wrong .
But she still has her moments , and she ’s an important historical figure from the World of WAGs , often dubbed the Queen of WAGs .
So she gets some credit for that .
Plus by cracking the list , I can forego all the comments about “ where ’s Posh ? ”
The less talked about she is , the better ( except I just talked about her ruining that whole point ) .
99 . Andreea Raicu
Significant Other : dated Cristian Chivu ( Inter Milan )
This Romanian model and television hostess got her start by winning the prestigious International Elite Model Look Contest .
Since that time she ’s been twice voted the sexiest woman in Romania , so she ’s doing something right .
In order to maintain her slim figure she supposedly does without fat , pork , and many breads .
Instead she favors fish and natural juices .
Does n’t she know that you do n’t win friends with salad ?
Like any good WAG , she ’s done television hosting as well , presiding over the first two seasons of Big Brother in Romania .
You can find out more about her and possibly do some cyber - stalking on her Facebook page .
98 . Martina Stella
Significant Other : dated Adrian Mutu ( Fiorentina )
Although married , the Romanian striker has been seen on the town with the Italian television and film actress .
Her mistress role makes her a dubious WAG , but we ’re willing to bend the roles a bit .
As an actress , Stella ’s roles have mainly been in Italian , but she at least seems to be an actual , legit actress ( as opposed to a showgirl who takes her boobs to a movie ) .
She even landed a small role in the Hollywood hit Ocean ’s Twelve ( even if it ’s considered the worst of the trilogy ) and can be seen in award - winning director Rob Marshall ’s upcoming film Nine .
One reviewer even compared her to “ a young Reese Witherspoon , ” which I assume was meant as a compliment and not an insult about her chin .
97 . Carly Zucker
Significant Other : fiancée of Joe Cole ( Chelsea )
Zucker literally means sugar in German , and Carly certainly looks sweet .
She makes her living as a fitness trainer , and does n’t carry around the typical WAG baggage .
But I ’ll admit that she just does n’t do it for me looks wise .
At least not as much as these other girls .
However , she has a number of supporters , and I simply could n’t leave her off this ranking .
The picture above is from her Lynx campaign ( with the questionable ad slogan “ Unleash the Man Leather ” ) , where she did her best Raquel Welch cavewoman impression .
96 . Daniela Fontani
Significant Other : girlfriend of Alessandro Gamberini ( Fiorentina )
Fontani competed in the Miss Italia pageant last year , which you ’ll quickly notice is a common theme among Italian WAGs .
She did n’t win the crown , but she did land Alessandro Gamberini .
At 20 , she ’s at the young end of the women on this list , which probably means she ’s just getting started dating footballers .
Could Pippo Inzaghi be in her future ?
I ca n’t wait until she starts showing up on bizarre Italian programming or shedding her clothes like any good Italian WAG .
95 . Isabel Figueira
Significant Other : ex-wife of César Peixoto ( Sporting Clube de Braga )
Full name Ana Isabel Teixeira Laranjo Figueira , the Portuguese model and TV presenter managed to tame playboy César Peixoto , at least for a little while .
Married in 2005 , they were divorced by 2007 after the birth of their first child .
At least Peixoto ’s colleagues noticed the engagement had a significant effect on his focusing abilities .
how he gets by these days is anyone ’s guess .
94 . Diana Chaves
Significant Other : dating César Peixoto ( Sporting Clube de Braga )
And this is why Peixoto left Figueira .
Diana Morais Rosado Quintela
Chaves is an ex-professional swimmer , who ’s apparently developed a taste for footballers .
She ’s been linked to Cristiano Ronaldo ( who has n’t ? ) and seemed to have some sort of relationship with Sporting ’s Miguel Veloso .
When not chasing down athletes , she can be seen on Portuguese television , where her roles have included a turn on the soap Morangos com Açúcar ( “ Strawberries with Sugar ” ) and the drama A Outra ( “ To Another One ” ) .
I ca n’t say I ’ve seen either of these programs , but a soap opera and a WAG is a good combo .
Just wait until the Hollyoaks girls come around .
93 . Kate Lawler
Significant Other : dated Jonathan Woodgate ( Tottenham Hotspur )
Here ’s something anyone can appreciate : Lawler ran the 2008 London Marathon .
Not impressive enough ?
She did it in lingerie .
Although not because she wanted to , it was part of an effort to raise money for a Cystic Fibrosis charity .
A former IT Support worker , Lawler rose to fame after winning the third British season of Big Brother .
Since then she ’s worked as a television presenter and personality , a model , and mostly as a disc jockey .
Her MySpace page claims she ’s “ unquestionably one of the most in demand and popular female DJ ’ sinthe UK today . ”
I ’d rather hire her than some sweaty overweight dude .
92 . Alessia Fabiani
Significant Other : dated Alessio Tacchinardi ( Brescia most recently )
Being Italian is often pretty good .
There ’s great food , solid weather , and apparently and endless supply of hot women .
Alessia Fabiani is what ’s I ’ll call Exhibit B .
The presenter of Italy ’s Champions League coverage , she became famous as Letterina on the Italian comedy Passaparola .
And like many of the Italian WAGs , she seems to have little problem losing her clothing .
Viva l’Italia !
91 . Maggie Q
Significant Other : dated Hidetoshi Nakata ( retired )
Full name Maggie Denise Quigley , moviegoers might recognize her from her various films , which include blockbusters like Live Free or Die Hard and Mission : Impossible III .
Despite her recent success , it did take her a while to make it in Hollywood .
The American born actress got her start modeling in Japan , and eventually branched out into Taiwan and Hong Kong .
Her transition into acting was almost coincidental , starting with Hong Kong cinema and later adding other locales in East Asia .
She had become a big name in Hong Kong , along with garnering a certain amount of fame across Asia , before making a name for herself in the States .
It was during this time that she dated Japanese superstar footballer Hidetoshi Nakata , one of the most famous Asian footballers of his generation .
90 . Caroline Celico
Significant Other : married to Kaká ( A.C. Milan )
Celico met Kaká back in 2001 , and married the golden boy of soccer in 2005 .
The two meet as teenagers , so kudos on the lasting relationship .
Not so much kudos for Kaká robbing the cradle and marrying an 18 year old ( you do the math on her age when they met ) .
Or for the fact she looks a bit like a female version of him .
Celico ’s not the typical WAG , and she does n’t have the drop dead curves of some others on this list , but she ’s damn cute and from all reports surprisingly normal compared to her contemporary soccer wives .
89 . Susana Werner
Significant Other : married to Júlio César Soares Espíndola ( Inter Milan )
In addition to her current husband , Werner was famous for dating the toothy Ronaldo ( now at Corinthians ) for a few years bracketing the 1998 World Cup .
When she meet him , she had already started to make a name for herself as an actress and a model , so she was n’t just leeching off his fame .
They split in 1999 , but apparently Werner was destined to be an Inter Milan WAG .
Ronaldo was playing for the club at the time she was dating him , and now her husband plays for the same squad .
88 . Abi Titmuss
Significant Other : dated Lee Sharpe ( retired )
Titmuss parlayed her good looks and willingness to benaked into fame after her then quasi- famous boyfriend John Leslie was embroiled in a rape scandal .
Nice !
Although mainly seen as a glamour model , Titmuss has done some serious acting work in recent years .
And to think she was a nurse before fate stepped in .
You can find more pictures of Abi over here .
87 . Louise Redknapp
Significant Other : wife of Jamie Redknapp ( retired )
Redknapp was a WAG before being a WAG was cool .
First known as a member of the girl group Eternal , she went solo in the mid-1990s and managed to sneak in some television work to boot .
She married footballer - turned - pundit Jamie Redknapp way back in 1998 , and they ’re still together to date .
Besides her singing successes , another title she can put on the mantle is that of ‘ Sexiest Woman of the Decade ’ , which FHM bestowed on her in 2004 .
86 . Michela Quattrociocche
Significant Other : dating Alberto Aquilani ( A.S. Roma )
Aquilani may , or may not have , stolen the 20 year old Quattrociocche ( sound it out : Kwah - tro - chee - oh - kay ) from her fiancée , singer Matteo Branciamore .
Although even if he did , seeing your fiancée become a WAG is probably not an indicator of a long - term relationship .
Quattrociocche is an up and coming actress , so I wish her well in her endeavors .
If the acting does n’t work out , I would n’t count on sticking with Alberto for long , as he usually has a different girl every week .
85 . Tatjana Batinić
Significant Other : dated Ivan Rakitić ( Schalke 04 )
Also known as Miss Austria 2006 , Batinić may or may not stil be dating Ivan Rakitić .
If not , it ’s his loss as Tatjana is so beautiful that they put her face on a plane .
For more of this sexy model , check out her Facebook page .
84 . Amaia Salamanca
Significant Other : dating Sergio Ramos ( Real Madrid )
When he ’s not out shopping for man bags , the long haired Spanish defender Sergio Ramos is on the prowl for the ladies .
This time he ’s landed Salamanca , a Spanish actress best known for her roles in “ SMS , sin Miedo a Soñar ” and “ Sin Tetas no hay Paraíso ” .
Not that I ’m all the familiar with such programming .
But I ’m sure it ’s top notch .
83 . Elisabeth Reyes
Significant Other : dated Sergio Ramos ( Real Madrid )
Speaking of Ramos , here ’s what he passed up .
The Spanish model and 2006 Miss España used to be on his arm , which is a pretty impressive feat for the defender .
Now that she ’s sans crown ( and Ramos ) , what does Reyes do ?
Basically she poses almost nude in men ’s magazines .
But no matter what she does , she looks spectacular .
And that ’s with and without her crown ( but mostly without ) .
Check her out and find out more about her on Facebook .
82 . Jaciara
Significant Other : Assorted
Famous for being the ex-wife of Deco , she was last seen dating the recently retired Fernando Couto .
Many might view that as a step down in the WAG hierarchy , as Deco is the first player to win the UEFA Best Midfielder Award with two different clubs .
And Fernando Couto is , well … Fernando Couto .
Of course , when you consider Deco was caught with a prostitute , maybe it ’s not such a bad thing .
And considering Deco already had an ex-wife and two sons when they met , maybe she should have seen this coming .
81 . Yésica Toscanini
Significant Other : dating Juan Román Riquelme ( Boca Juniors )
When news broke that Yésica Toscanini was Juan Roman Riquelme ’s new girlfriend , you would n’t think that would matter too much .
That is , unless you were the Boca Juniors midfielder ’s wife .
You see , Riquelme was married ( with three kids ! ) , so it might come as sort of a revelation that he also had a mistress .
When Mrs. Riquelme discovered the affair , she allegedly threatened to destroy their home .
Common sense or a lawyer likely got to her , maybe in anticipation of all the assets one might seize upon a divorce .
When not wrecking homes , Toscanini can be seen modeling , such as her appearances in the 2006 and 2007 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issues .
She also played Enrique Iglesias ’s sweetheart in his video “ Do You Know ? ”
80 . Oksana Andersson
Significant Other : dated Christian Wilhelmsson ( Al - Hilal )
In her finest Jennifer Lopez impression , the Russian - born Swedish model ( and reality television contestant ) originally worked as a dancer for the musical group Sunblock .
That is until she discovered her passion was to be in front of the camera .
She dated the perpetually - on - loan midfielder Christian Wilhelmsson for almost two years , during which she appeared as a contestant on the Swedish version of Paradise Hotel .
That short - lived appearance was noted for her heated argument with a fellow contestant and a week one departure .
Good to see her show her top WAG form despite a minimal appearance .
79 . Clio Pajczer
Significant Other : married to Boudewijn Zenden ( Olympique Marseille )
Voulez - vous coucher avec moi ce soir ?
The French lingerie model can often be seen posing with her husband , but thankfully she does a fair amount without him as well .
You can check out her website for more photos .
78 . Claudine Palmer
Significant Other : married to Robbie Keane ( Tottenham Hotspur )
Mrs. Robbie Keane is a former Miss Ireland contestant , and arguably the most famous one this side of Miss World 2003 Rosanna Davison .
Although newer to the WAG scene and a rare Irish gal in a sea of English women , she ’s had no problem fitting it .
She ’s already being noted for her hair extensions , regular spray tans , fake nails , and high fashion .
Guess she got her hands of the WAG manual .
77 . Julieta Spina
Significant Other : dating Diego Simeone ( retired )
Simeone is a former Argentine player and recent manager who decided to trade in his model wife for a younger model .
Pun intended .
Spina is a green - eyed Argentine model who ’s often seen modeling some underwear .
Here ’s some more photos to oogle .
76 . Tanya Robinson
Significant Other : dating Steven Taylor ( Newcastle United )
Robinson was the winner of FHM ’s inaugural “ High Street Honeys ” competition in 2002 , and she ’s been a regular on their “ 100 Sexiest Women in the World ” list ever since .
Although she ’s currently dating Newcastle ’s Steven Taylor , it was n’t her first brush with the English club .
In 2005 she was romantically linked with former Newcastle star Paul Gascoigne .
Except the entire relationship was fabricated by Australian paparazzo Darryn Lyons , who used the story as an excuse to promote Tanya ’s girl band , Mrs. Robinson ( the group was originally named Twisted Sisterz , until Dee Snider and company told them to quit it ) .
The band was n’t successful , but here ’s a salacious YouTube clip of Robinson covering the Pussycat Dolls .
75 . Alessia Merz
Significant Other : married to Fabio Bazzani ( Pescara Calcio )
Stop me if you ’ve heard this one before .
Merz is a model and TV personality , and like many Italian women on this ranking , she ’s none too fond of clothing .
There ’s barely a picture of her on the entire Internet where she has them on .
Or at least as much as one might expect to wear in public .
74 . Evangelina Anderson
Significant Other : fiancée of Martín Demichelis ( Bayern Munich )
Anderson did n’t exactly make a great impression on former boyfriend , one time Barcelona flop Maxi López ( currently on loan to Grêmio from F.C. Moscow ) , who called in an Argentinian chat show to bad mouth her .
Turns out her was none too happy she left him , in this case for Demichelis .
I ’ll let you decide if that constitutes an upgrade .
In addition to her promiscuous ways , she ’s made an appeance on her country ’s version of Dancing with the Stars , doing a strip dance against Victoria Vanucci .
73 . Elena Bonzanni
Significant Other : dating Valon Behrami ( West Ham United )
This Italian TV presenter and model claims to enjoys gymnastics , dance , and cinema .
At least when she ’s not out modeling or cheering on West Ham and her boyfriend ( who ’s been nicknamed the Swiss David Beckham .
Not sure if that ’s an insult or a complement ) .
Here are some more photos of Elena .
72 . Klára Medková
Significant Other : engaged to Radoslav Kováč ( West Ham United on loan from Spartak Moscow )
As if West Ham was n’t doing well enough with Bonzanni , they also get Klára Medková .
She ’s a Czech model who ’s engaged to the multi-talented Radoslav Kováč .
Among her various modeling gigs , Medková has appeared in the Czech version of Playboy .
If you want to see more of her , check out these photos .
71 . Alice Bregoli
Significant Other : fiancée of Alberto Gilardino ( Fiorentina )
These two may already be married or maybe not , I do n’t know .
They had planned to tie the knot after EURO 2008 , although the two were reportedly having problems regarding the distance between Milan ( where Gilardino played ) and Piacenza , where she studies and her family is from .
That issue did n’t exacly resolve itself when Gilardino transfered to Fiorentina and signed a five - year deal .
Florence is a bit farther away than Milan .
70 . Dani Behr
Significant Other : Assorted
She may look like your typical WAG , but Dani Behr also has a brain .
She graduated from the Sylvia Young Theatre School in London , and embarked on a doomed musical career .
During such time , she also enjoyed the companionship of Welshman Ryan Giggs and alleged Blue Peter garden vandal Les Ferdinand .
Dissed by the music industry , Dani instead has made a career out of being a presenter .
In 2002 , she was named Maxim ’s female presenter of the year .
To Americans she ’s best known for her work on Extra , although she did narrate a show about the Vivid Girls ( who also put out the Kim Kardashian sext tape ) called Porno Valley .
Dani has also done some acting , including a role in The Vagina Monologues for New York and London .
I sense a theme here between Porno Valley and The Vagina Monologues .
69 . Valentina Zambrotta
Significant Other : married to Gianluca Zambrotta ( AC Milan )
I ’m not familiar with professional downhill rollerblading , but apparently Valentia is one of some amount of them .
There may be ten , there may be ten thousand .
I have no idea .
Although , her more than ample chest probably does n’t help her wind resistance in such a sport .
Such a genetic disadvantage .
When not seen rollerblading , she ’s often seen at the beach , often with Milan and Azzurri defender Gianluca Zambrotta .
The Italians do have a difficult life .
68 . Pamela Camassa
Significant Other : dated Alberto Aquilani ( A.S. Roma )
A Miss Italy finalist , Pamela was chosen to represent her country in the 2002 Miss World Pageant held in Nigeria .
Except she boycotted the event for human rights reasons ( she was protesting societies who still carry out stoning executions ) .
She also stepped out with manwhore Alberto Aquilani in his pre-Quattrociocche days .
Chillemi won Miss Italy , where as Camassa was merely a finalist .
You can see the need for an upgrade .
Like many WAGs , she ’s also made an appearance on the local Dancing with Stars show , in this case Italy ’s Ballando con le Stele .
67 . Joanna Taylor
Significant Other : married to Danny Murphy ( Fulham )
Hollyoaks is a British soap centered aroundthe fictional Hollyoaks Community College and its late teens or early twenties characters .
It ’s also a breeding ground for future WAGs .
Enter Joanna Taylor , who won the role of Geri Hudson on the show in 1999 .
She ’s continued acting on and off , plus goes a little more sophisticated by contributing a weekly column to The Times newspaper about her life as wife of vagabond footballer Danny Murphy .
66 . Kristina Liliana
Significant Other : married to Lothar Matthäus ( retired )
When you have three failed marriages and are still short of fifty , it ’s not a good sign .
Undettered , ex-German star Lothar Matthäus has moved on from wife number three to Ukranian model Kristina Liliana .
It ’s an odd and disturbing pairing of a late 40s man and a young 20s model .
What ’s weirder is that Liliana was living with her mother when she met Matthäus .
Although I should n’t feel too sorry for Kristina , she looks like she can hold her own from the photo above and I kind of dig that .
65 . Nives Celzijus
Significant Other : married to Dino Drpić ( Karlsruher SC on a loan from Dinamo Zagreb )
The definition of a classy WAG , she has admitted to having sex with her hubby right on the midfield pitch of Maksimir Stadium .
Oddly , her husband was loaned to another team shortly afterwards .
The Croatian singer / model / socialite / writer / some other tacked on title recently wrote an autobiography , Gola Istina ( translated to the Naked Truth ) , where she describes her life before her marriage to the Croatian footballer .
I suspect it ’s pretty much the same as it is now , you know , R - Rated but sans Drpić .
You can check out one of her music videos over here .
64 . Magdalena Graaf
Significant Other : ex-wife of Magnus Hedman ( retired )
Hedman ’s been kicked aside by a few soccer clubs , and apparently he ’s been kicked aside by his wife too .
Or maybe it was the other way around ?
For Hedman ’s sake I hope it was her that did the dumping , otherwise I ’d question his decision making .
Graaf is a Swedish model , singer , and author who became popular with her sister Hannah in the aptly named group , The Graaf Sisters .
Their hit song “ You Got What I Want Baby ” gave them a brief modicum of fame like other Euro one - hit wonders like Aqua .
In addition to her vocal skills , Graaf released a biography , Det ska bli ett sant nöje att döda de ( or in English , It ’s Going to be a Pleasure to Kill You ) .
Supposedly the title is not in reference to Magnus , but upon further review maybe he was smart to get out of the relationship .
63 . Letizia Filippi
Significant Other : dated Cristiano Ronaldo
Cristiano reportedly met Letizia while being on a holiday with then girlfriend Nereida Gallardo ( more on her later ) .
One Italian newspaper claimed Letizia stole his attention with , “ a gaze that melted him like an icicle in the sun . ”
Not the visual I was going for .
Filippi came in third in the 1994 Miss Italy competition , and rose to fame on the show Buona Domenica ( “ The Good Sunday ” ) .
In addition to Ronaldo , Filippi is a Winter Olympics WAG , having dated Italian playboy / skiing champion Alberto Tomba for two years .
62 . Manuela Arcuri
Significant Other : Assorted
Owing to her relationships with countless high profile celebrities , Arcuri simply can’t keep out of the tabloids in her native Italy .
Think of her as an Italian Danielle Lloyd .
With more talent .
And less evil .
She apparently used to date Francesco Totti , as well as retired Italian and possible gay player Francesco Coco .
Like the vast majority of the Italian soccer WAGs , Arcuri ’s background of showgirl and model has prepared her perfectly for the life of a WAG .
At least after she decided that her degree in sociology was n’t worth pursuing .
61 . Anara Atanes
Significant Other : Assorted
She ’s managed to date both Fredrik Ljungberg and Kieran Richardson , the latter after the Sutherland bad boy stole her away from the sweet Swede .
You can check out her finest broken English and some more photos over at her blog .
60 . Anna Falchi
Significant Other : dated Matteo Ferrari ( Genoa )
Born Anna Kristiina Palomäki in Finland , but raised in Italy , she chose the surname Falchi to better fit in with her Italian surroundings .
She ’s a model and a film actress , and eventually landed serial WAG - rutter Matteo Ferrari .
To date she remains relatively well - known for her modeling , and rather less so for her acting .
Although she has worked with famous director Federico Fellini , albeit in a commercial for an Italian bank .
If you ’ve ever seen the film Cemetary Man ( a.k.a. Dellamorte Dellamore ) , you might recognize Falchi from her role in it .
But I ’m guessing you have n’t seen it and probably no one has .
59 . Belén Rodríguez
Significant Other : dating Marco Borriello ( A.C. Milan )
This is a story to tell the grandkids .
Rodríguez shot to “ fame ” when boyfriend Marco Borriello tested positive for steroids .
Except Borriello did n’t take steroids , instead he came into contact with the banned substance when he rubbed an ointment onto his private parts .
Ointment that he needed thanks to Rodríguez giving him an STD .
“ I advised him to use the ointment , but forgot it contained cortisone .
Our sex session proved fatal , ” stated Belén .
She got fame , he got crabs , everyone knows she ’s a shank .
Winners all around !
But the pair is reportedly still together , so it ca n’t be all bad .
58 . Romanela Amato
Significant Other : dating Javier Saviola ( Real Madrid )
Amato just turned eighteen last month , but in her finest Lolita impression managed to snag Saviola at age sixteen .
Hey , it worked for Celico who snagged Kaká at an even earlier age .
That ’s how they roll in South America .
At one point there were reported to be engaged , but now I ’m not even sure they ’re dating .
57 . Debora Salvalaggio
Significant Other : engaged to Vitor Hugo Gomes Paços ( Portsmouth on loan from F.C. Porto )
She may be engaged to Paços a .k.a.
Pelé ( no , not that one ) , but she ’s also dated Filippo Inzaghi , Christian Vieri , Matteo Ferrari , and Simone Inzaghi .
It ’s inevitable that the conquests of two of Italian football ’s greatest man-whores ( Inzaghi and Vieri , not to mention Ferrari ) would overlap , and model / showgirl Debora Salvalaggio is the meeting point .
I should construct a WAG Frak map similar to this Battlestar Galactica one , I could make Salvalaggio a hub and trace her conquests .
Considering the laundry list of her footballer boyfriends , you should n’t be surprised she ’s crossed paths with any footballer , and she ’s probably only a couple of degrees from most people in the world .
Forget Kevin Bacon , anyone might only be a couple degrees from Salvalaggio .
And it probably says a lot about her .
Not that we judge around here .
56 . Lauren Pope
Significant Other : dating Shaun Wright Phillips ( Manchester City )
The British Page
Three model and actress was once seen in a nightclub dancing with Prince Henry of Wales and was alleged to be his “ girlfriend ” .
I guess that ’s enough for fame in England .
Since then she has been linked to other celebrities , most notably robot dancing extraordinaire Peter Crouch .
She eventually landed on a The Weakest Link WAGs special , where she got into it with Linsey Dawn Mckenzie .
And in true WAG fashion , she started her own buisness , Hair Rehab London , which sells hair extensions .
It ’s always good to know one ’s product .
55 . Sophie Anderton
Significant Other : Assorted
An admitted prostitute , which seems perfect for the World of WAGs , which is often filled with gold diggers and the sort .
She ’s bounced from boyfriend to boyfriend , and among her conquests include a tumultuous relationship with footballer Mark Bosnich and an alleged relationship with Crystal Palace F.C. chairman Simon Jordan .
Matt Graham , a previous boyfriend , told of Anderton , “ I was trapped in a nightmare relationship with the girl .
It was simply two years of hell .
The sex was amazing , really steamy , some of the best I ’ve ever had .
But it was n’t worth having to put up with all her emotional baggage . ”
Sounds about right .
54 . Adelina Elisei
Significant Other : married to Cristian Chivu ( Inter Milan )
The Romanian model and TV personality managed to succeed where Maria Marinescu and Andreea Raicu failed , by bagging Cristian Chivu .
She apparently has a sorted past that includes a striptease club owner , but we do n’t want to dwell on those details .
53 . Saba Wesser
Significant Other : dating Francesco Coco ( retired )
Half - Italian and Half - Ethiopian , Wesser is a descendent of Ethiopian royalty .
Although with the abolition of the monarchy in 1975 , I ’m not sure that means a whole lot .
Just ask the Italian royal family how that ’s working out with a defunct Italian throne .
You can learn for about Saba over at her website .
52 . Jamelia
Significant Other : engaged to Darren Byfield ( Doncaster Rovers )
Jamelia Niela Davis is a Jamaican - English R&B singer / songwriter , rapper , and occasional model who despises the WAG label .
She said recently , “ I have no desire to be a WAG and I hate being called one . ”
Guess I should n’t tell her about this website .
She later add that WAGs have “ pathetic , empty lives . ”
We ’ll leave it that she ’s hot and move on .
51 . Danielle Bux
Significant Other : engaged to Gary Lineker ( retired )
This Welsh lingerie model and former Virgin Atlantic air stewardess got her start as a rugby WAG , before crossing over to the world of soccer .
In addition to her Ringo Starr look - a- like current fiancée , she also has a six - year - old daughter with ex-Coventry City player Adam Willis .
50 . Alessia Ventura
Significant Other : Engaged to Filippo Inzaghi
Filippo Inzaghi has enjoyed more than his fair share of beautiful Italian women , so has Ventura finally tamed his wayward promiscuous ways ?
Probably not in the long term , though Inzaghi states she “ ticks all the boxes in what I ’d like my partner to be as a person . ”
I think those boxes are limited to : breathing , female , big boobs , and model .
And make no doubt , Alessia is an Italian model .
She caught her big break when she was hired as the Italian equivalent of a Barker ’s Beauty on their version of The Price is Right .
She later went on to act in the soap opera Cento Vetrine , and appeared on Italy ’s version of The Mole .
49 . Nereida Gallardo
Significant Other : ex-girlfriend of Cristiano Ronaldo
European gigolo Cristiano Ronaldo is the Premiership ’s top goal scorer and he also helped this Spanish model become a minor Internet sensation .
Very multi-talented .
Opinions vary widely on this model , and I ’ll admit that the quality of photos you find on Gallardo can vary from awesome to somewhat scary .
The same person should n’t have that much variance from shot to shot .
It ’s kind of like looking good , then turning on the fluorescent light and seeing all your faults .
I need to just pick a side , hot or not .
Instead , we ’ll take the middle ground and place her smack in the middle of this Top 100 .
You can find more Nereida over here .
48 . Melanie Slade
Significant Other : girlfriend of Theo Walcott ( Arsenal )
Walcott plucked Slade from obscurity at the WestQuay shopping mall , and now she ’s among WAG royalty hanging out with the big names from the English national team .
All this before she hits twenty .
She has her fans , probably because she does n’t come across as a typical WAG .
For one , she ’s studying at one of London ’s prestigious colleges to become a physiotherapist .
She ’s also been the face of a recent cancer research campaign and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro for charity .
Still , while proclaiming she ’s not a typical WAG , she ’s often seen with expensive goods , wearing designer clothes , and getting fancy haircuts all in between photo shoots .
You make the call .
47 . Milene Domingues
Significant Other : ex-wife of Ronaldo
She is the first of what could be many ex-wives of Brazilian star Ronaldo .
But she ’s not just a pretty face , this ex-model is a footballer too .
Sexy and athletic , I like the combination .
Read into this as much as you like , but she apparently holds the record for ball juggling ( seriously , she kept a soccer ball off the ground with 55,198 consecutive touches ) .
Insert ball juggling joke here .
46 . Elisabetta Gregoraci
Significant Other : married to Flavio Briatore ( owner Queens Park Rangers F.C. )
I ’ll admit we ’re cheating a bit here including the wife of an owner of a footbll club .
But look at her , it ’s a worthwhile inclusion .
Gregoraci is an Italian fashion model and television personality , but became most famous when she offered sexual favours in return for a job as a showgirl for the Italian national public television company RAI .
Not exactly the kind of thing you want as your legacy , but I ’m sure she ’s crying herself to sleep on her enormous piles of money .
45 . Sara Tommasi
Significant Other : Assorted
Another graduate of the much - lauded Miss Italy pageant , she was runner up in 1998 .
And while she did n’t win , she ’s hot enough to have dated West Ham ’s Valon Behrami and an obligatory turn as Filippo Inzaghi ’s shag partner .
After discovering she was ridiculously good looking , Tommasi dumped her college economics courses for a calendar photo shoot and to make television appearances in high quality fare such as L’isola dei Famosi ( the Italian I ’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here ) .
44 . Melina Pitra
Significant Other : dating Fabián Assmann ( Independiente )
Seriously , she ’s dating a guy named Assmann .
Seinfeld would be proud .
And at least Melina can fit his type .
She ’s a Argentinian model and television hostess , and she ’s dated a few footballers in her brief time , but you probably do n’t hear much about her because she ’s doing it in Argentina .
Here ’s a little behind the scenes with her .
43 . Aída Yéspica
Significant Other : girlfriend and baby mama of Matteo Ferrari ( Genoa )
Soccer fans may recognize Ferrari as that ugly guy that usually sat on the bench , and some times in the stands , for A.S. Roma .
Not only that , but every time they sent him out on a loan , he was a complete disaster .
How can he get Yéspica , I have no farkin clue .
Although after seeing her , no wonder Ferarri is n’t ever fit enough to play .
The Venezuela model did n’t capture the Miss Venezuela crown when she entered , but she ’s still got plenty going on .
She now does most of her work in Italy , including reality appearances on L’isola dei Famosi ( the aforementioned Italian Celebrity Island ) and Supervivientes ( Spain ’s Survivor ) .
She ’s also noted for getting former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in hot water with his wife .
Apparently offended by his open flirtation with Yéspica and another woman , his wife published a scathing front page letter to the editor in La Repubblica , the largest circulation Italian daily general - interest newspaper .
42 . Anine Bing
Significant Other : dated Anders Svensson ( IF Elfsborg )
Despite her good looks and modeling career , Bing has always had a passion for music .
Recently she ’s been writing and recording songs .
If that does n’t pan out , she ’s always got her looks to fall back on .
For example , the City of Birmingham banned a billboard of Bing for being too distracting , as numerous drivers got flustered by her ample bossom .
The billboards were part of a “ For Play ” campaign by Italian sportswear company , Ellesse .
She ’s also adorned the pages of the most sophisticated of all pornographic publications , Playboy magazine .
Her relationship with Svensson did n’t last , mainly because of her rumored infidelities with hockey star Peter Forsberg and / or actor Jim Carrey .
Not sure if that ’s a step up or step down for Svensson , who separated from his last girlfirend after she enjoyed a steamy lesbian kiss with a fellow housemate on Big Brother .
Anine is currently blogging at Swedish news site Nyheter24 .
41 . Adriana Karembeu ( née Sklenaříková )
Significant Other : married Christian Karembeu ( retired )
This vegetarian is a Slovak fashion model , becoming very popular in Europe for her Wonderbra billboards .
She and her 49 - inch legs also landed a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records for the longest legs in supermodel history .
That ’s a pretty nice catch for Karembeu , who met his future wife on an airplane of all places .
40 . Amii Grove
Significant Other : was engaged to Jermaine Pennant ( Portsmouth on loan from Liverpool )
Was engaged is a bit of an understatement .
The English glamour model and Page Three Girl had been dating Pennant off and on for years in a quite tumultuous relationship .
Things turned sour , however , when she caught the footballer cheating on her via the CCTV cameras in his mansion .
Grove promptly caused £ 200,000 worth of damage , including throwing his belongings out of a window , and profited by selling her story to any newspaper that would listen .
Pennant is quite the prize apparently .
In addition to infidelity , he has the distinction of becoming the first Premiership player to wear an electronic tag during a match after serving a jail stint for drunk - driving .
You ’d think things might have been over , but the couple somehow kissed and made up .
And then broke up again .
The “ Kop Love rat ” would find a way back into the heart of Miss Bikini World 2004 , following the tragic death of Amii ’s bother .
Tennant discovered that the best way to get a lady to forgive a man for cheating is to catch her at her weakest possible moment .
He proposed in the graveyard following her brother ’s funeral , and The Bum from Brum said yes .
Alas , it did n’t last .
She ’s now auctioning her £ 32,000 engagement ring on eBay after splitting again .
Although that seems like a cash grab , Grove reportedly offered the ring back to Pennant , but he refused to accept it after using her Mercedes as part of an exchange for a new Ferrari .
The model states that part of the eBay earnings will be donated to a charity set up in memory of her brother .
39 . Jennifer Metcalfe
Significant Other : dated the very same Jermaine Pennant
Here ’s the third part of the Jermaine Pennant love triangle .
When not dating Grove , Pennant was often seen on the arm of this English actress and model .
Metcalfe has a degree in Health and Fitness , and even worked as a fitness instructor , before realizing acting and modeling was her forté .
She can be seen on the British soap Hollyoaks , making her the second star of the show to crack this Top 100 .
38 . Rachel Cole
Significant Other : dated Jonathan West ( Ilford F.C. )
Presumably no relation to Ashley Cole , Joe Cole , or even Nat King Cole .
In addition to her modeling work , Cole represented Great Britain as a gymnast .
37 . Sarah Brandner
Significant Other : girlfriend of Bastian Schweinsteiger ( Bayern Munich )
Schweinsteiger trends on the fugly side of the scale , making his landing of Brandner a bit curious .
Although not that curious once you remember how much soccer players make .
The “ Queen of the German WAGs ” apparently derailed his transfer to Juventus , prompting club President Giovanni Cobolli Gigli to blast Schweinsteiger and all but call him a pussy .
You can check out more photos of Sarah over here , including one where she appropriately is wearing a crown .
We know who rules this relationship .
36 . Nicola McLean
Significant Other : engaged to Tom Williams ( Peterborough United )
The English glamour model and media personality was once an Army Cadet .
Given the choice of being a career Army girl or being sans clothing , she chose the latter .
It seems to be a smart decision , as she ’s been one of the most successful Page 3 girls ever .
She also lists one of her role models as Jessica Rabbit , and seems to have an obsessive compulsive disorder with looking good .
She ’s proud of the fact that when giving birth to the couple ’s child , she “ had my full face on , hair straightened , and perfect nails . ”
So you could say she ’s high maintenance .
Still , her fiancée is not a high profile player , and does n’t even play in England ’s Premier League .
Known for a bubbling personality , she ’s often covered topics such as the best porn shows in Amsterdam and what outfit would be best to conduct a public execution in .
Fans of her cleavage might also want to know that she has been chosen by Ultimo to model their range of D - G cup bras .
35 . Lindsey Strutt
Significant Other : dating Alex Bruce ( Ipswich Town )
Affectionately known as “ The Strutter ” , this Page Three regular has received the title of “ Britain ’s Best Brunette ” .
Often seen photographed with other big - bust models like Lucy Pinder , she seems to have a serious clothing phobia .
That fact was probably noticed by current beau Alex Bruce .
You can find more Lindsey over here .
34 . Gemma Hiles
Significant Other : ex-girlfriend of Daniel Alston
Hiles is another Playboy bunny and Page 3 girl hailing from England .
She has joined up with Fiona G and Jamie Leigh to form
The Diamondettes , a threesome of glamour girls working to be the new “ it ” girls .
Here ’s their Facebook page .
For more Hiles just by herself , you can check out her MySpace page .
33 . Elena Santarelli
Significant Other : girlfriend of Bernardo Corradi ( Reggina )
Italian ?
Check .
Model ?
Check .
Dated Christian Vieri ?
Check .
When you see all the half - naked pictures of Santarelli online , you might understand why Corradi had been pushing for a move back to his home nation .
In addition to her extensive modeling work , she has appeared on the Italian reality show , L’isola dei Famosi ( yep , another WAG on the same reality show ) and done some work for Italy ’s Total Request Live .
I would assume you ’d be getting bored with such similar bios after awhile , but that would mean you were actually reading them .
Which I ’m pretty sure you are not .
32 . Jennifer Ellison
Significant Other : former girlfriend of Steven Gerrard ( Liverpool )
Let ’s see if I can hit all the bases here .
Ellison is an actress , glamour model , television personality , dancer , and singer .
I think that covers it .
Although she ’s got that great body and is not afraid to model it , she is perhaps best known for playing Emily Shadwick in the television soap opera Brookside ( Sorry , no Hollyoaks ) .
She has done numerous television shows , such as Jennifer Ellison does Thailand .
As Nelson Munz would say , “ I can think of at least two things wrong with that title . ”
American audiences might also recognize her from the film adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera .
She has real talent , and can also be seen acting on London ’s West End .
You can find more Jennifer over here .
31 . Melissa Satta
Significant Other : ex-girlfirend of Christian Vieri
If you ’re tired of seeing Italian women , please note that Satta was actually born in Boston , although she shuttled between the U.S. and Sardina throughout her life .
In between trans -Atlantic flights she picked up karate and was good enough to finish third in the Italian Karate Championships .
By age 17 she managed to win the Miss Muretto pageant and a modeling career was born .
She also got noticed for her desk dancing on the show Striascia la Notzia ( Strip the News ) .
Our friend Moondog has plenty of additional photos .
30 . Helen Svedin
Significant Other : married to Luís Figo ( Inter Milan )
The Swedish model has been maried to Portuguese legend Figo for many years , even having three kids .
But that has n’t stopped her from appearing on the cover of magazines like GQ or Elle , or her apparent distaste for wearing any kind of clothing .
You ’ll find many picture of Svedin in her birthday suit lurking around the tubes of the Internet .
29 . Imogen Thomas
Significant Other : Assorted
Thomas was crowned Miss Wales 2003 , and it ’s not hard to see why .
She became famous for appearing on Britain ’s version of Big Brother and currently works as a Nightclub hostess in London .
This despite a degree in psychology and health studies .
In her spare time , she ’s been romantically linked to a bevy of Premiership and sub-Premiership footballers , including Reading ’s Ibrahim Sonko , Manchester City ’s Mexican winger Nery Castillo , Bristol City ’s Lee Trundle , and Sunderland ’s Dwight Yorke .
Lately she ’s been spotted with Swansea City ’s Matthew Collins .
She ’s also allegedly taken a tussle with the infamous Cristiano Ronaldo .
If that does n’t scream class , maybe her 7 minute home sex video that appeared on the Internet does .
Despite it all , she was voted the Sexiest Woman in Wales not that long ago , defeating the likes of Catherine Zeta Jones .
28 . Alex Curran
Significant Other : wife of Steven Gerrard ( Liverpool )
Once described as an “ über - WAG ” , the former nail technician turned model and fashion columnist has branched out on her own with a fragrance line .
To feed the ego it was named “ Alex ” , although it has been one of Britain ’s top sellers .
She ’s also reportedly had breast implants , prompting many to joke the enchancement was Gerrard ’s greatest success .
Furthermore , Curran ’s been noted for her brushes with the law .
This includes an accusation of assault when she was involved in a fight in Liverpool where a teenage girl was jammed in the face with a glass bottle .
Reports are that it was n’t Alex and charges were later dropped .
She was also a victim of a high profile robbery in late 2007 that appeared to be part of a series of high profile footballer thefts .
27 . Coleen Rooney ( née McLoughlin )
Significant Other : married to Wayne Rooney ( Manchester United )
In fairytale fashion , Coleen met Wayne when she was 12 and began a relationship at the age of 16 .
If you want to feel old , know that Rooney took Coleen to see Austin Powers 2 on their first date .
Although she landed a small part in Hollyoaks ( third Hollyoaks alum ! ) , Colleen is a bit atypical for a WAG .
She ’s not a model ( although she did put out Coleen McLoughlin ’s Brand New Body Workout ) and she writes for a living .
She wrote a column in the celebrity magazine Closer until leaving to write for OK !
magazine .
I ’m not saying the columns have much substance , but it is writing .
Kinda like this website .
26 . Radka Kocurova
Significant Other : dating Tomáš Rosický ( Arsenal )
Giving new meaning to the phrase “ Stand by Your Man , ” the former Miss Czech Republic apparently got past the fact Rosický was caught partying with six hookers .
However that happened , I ’d prefer not to know .
What I do know it that the Czech model and TV personality has a very big following in her native land , so she ’s kind of a big deal .
People know her .
25 . Edita Hortová
Significant Other : ex-girlfriend of Milan Baroš ( Galatasaray )
Baroš has seen his career go downhill for a while , but at least he had Hortová to keep him company for part of the freefall .
Edita won Miss Europe in 2005 , which I suppose led to her honor as 2005 ’s Tourism Queen .
If you happened to pass through Prague , maybe you saw her .
24 . Francesca Chillemi
Significant Other : Assorted
Miss Italy 2003 is latest of many WAGs that got their start in the realm of competitive goodlookingness .
Except she actually took home the crown , so that puts her a step up from many others .
The model / actress / TV personality has been seen with Vincenza Marruocco and more recently A.S. Roma ’s Alberto Aquilani .
23 . Amanda Harrington
Significant Other : ex-girlfriend of crazy Joey Barton
The former hot girlfriend of Newcastle United ’s Joey Barton , she captured the title of Miss Liverpool at the tender age of sixteen .
According to her now deleted MySpace page ( see link for cached version ) she ’s 99 years old , so apparently she won the crown in 1925 .
The profile also says she ’s three feet tall , so time has not been kind .
Barton has a detailed rap sheet , including break a pedestrian ’s leg when he ran over him with his car , so maybe it ’s better Harrington moved on when she did .
At least she gave him something ( not STDs ) , she found a friend in fellow WAG Alex Curran .
22 . Elena Barolo
Significant Other : Assorted
Another Italian , she ’s the second WAG graduate of Striascia la Notzia ( Strip the News ) following Melissa Satta .
A third , Giorgia Palmas , is yet to come , but know that Palmas and Barolo are quite friendly , including a few risqué photoshoots together .
She ’s had the Filippo Inzaghi experience and more recently was seen on the arm of Torino striker Roberto Stellone .
She seems to follow the typical Italian WAG progression which usually goes something like this : ( 1 ) thinly veiled television show to show off assets ; ( 2 ) nudie calendar ; ( 3 ) a few disreputable B -movies .
If you want more Elena , check out her MySpace page .
21 . Eva González
Significant Other : dating Iker Casillas ( Real Madrid )
A former Miss España from 2003 , González also represented her native land at the 2003 Miss Universe pageant ( she finished 15th ) .
After her reign , she predictably entered the world of modeling , walking the runway for Spain ’s high fashion designers and doing many photo shoots for magazines .
She ’s also combined the two WAG staples of reality televsion and television personality into one by hosting Dímelo al Oído .
20 . Martina Colombari
Significant Other : married to Alessandro Costacurta ( former A.C. Milan star and current A.C. Mantova manager )
Color me shocked , but Colombari was crowned Miss Italy in 1991 .
I guess it was fate that she become a WAG , as she ’s now married to former footballer Alessandro Costacurta .
And like any good Italian WAG she has shed her clothing for the cameras .
Oh yes , she does topless shots .
Lots and lots of topless shots .
She ’s also starred in the show Carabinieri ( Police Officers ) , just like fellow Miss Italy and WAG Francesca Chillemi .
And for good measure , she dated Alberto Tomba just like Letizia Filippi .
It ’s like the career path for these women are just laid out well in advance .
19 . Sapphira O’Shannon
Significant Other : dating Paolo Vernazza ( Woking )
Living proof that not all the WAGs go for the top shelf players in the premier leagues .
O’Shannon is another model and TV presenter , who also likes to write her own poetry online .
You can check out some on her work on her MySpace page .
18 . Nicola Tappenden
Significant Other : engaged to Simon Walton ( Blackpool on loan from Plymouth Argyle )
The English glamour model won the first ever Page 3 Idol competition , and has since been known by the moniker Nicola T . For about two years she dated Fulham striker Bobby Zamora , during which time Zamora applied a blown - up picture of Nicola ’s chest to the ceiling above his bed .
She ditched Zamora due to alleged infidelity , although it ’s unknown whether he took the picture down .
She can thank his relationship for an appearance on WAGs Boutique , a reality show where two teams of WAGs compete to run rival fashion boutiques over a three month period .
American audiences might recognize her from her small role as Red Light District Girl in Deuce Bigalow : European Gigolo .
17 . Danielle Lloyd
Significant Other : Assorted
Where to begin with Danielle Lloyd ?
This serial WAG first began dating Teddy Sheringham in 2006 , but since the split , has been linked with Peter André , Marcus Bent , Armand Traoré , and most recently in an on and off relationship with Tottenham Hotspur Jermain Defoe .
She ’s a former beauty queen , having been crowned Miss England in 2004 and Miss Great Britain in 2006 .
Of course , she was stripped of the latter title after posing for nude pictures in Playboy magazine combined with an alleged affair with one of the judges ( which was Teddy Sheringham ) .
She ’s also known for her racist comments to Indian beauty Shilpa Shetty ( Shetty appeared in our Bollywood Sex Symbols article ) on her ill - fated appearance on Big Brother .
Although she may be the devil incarnate , Lloyd remains pretty good looking and you can find more pictures over here .
16 . Rosaria Cannavò
Significant Other : dating Christian Panucci ( A.S. Roma )
In addition to Panucci , this Italian bird was also on the arm of the short tempered and Wilt Chamberlain wanna - be Antonio Cassano .
For those familiar with Cassano , it might make you question her judgment .
And yet you still probably do n’t care given her looks .
She ’s famous in Italy for her skills as a ballerina and her appearances on a number of their very strange television shows .
On example is where Cannavò plays a game called “ Surf ” on Buona Domenica ( Good Sunday ) .
The goal of surf is to balance on a moving surfboard while wearing a very skimpy top and a very short skirt .
Rosaria is very good at Surf .
On an unrelated note , current boyfriend Christian Panucci has an intersting tale .
Part of the 1996 Olympic squad , Panucci was forced to leave the games early due to injury .
The flight Panucci was scheduled to leave on was TWA Flight 800 , but a last - minute change forced him on to another flight .
Good thing , because TWA Flight 800 made an unscheduled stop at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean .
15 . Elisabetta Canalis
Significant Other : Assorted
This Italian model and actress is just one of many women Christian Vieri ’s left in his wake .
At least she looks no worse for the wear .
She ’s also been linked to Didier Drogba and most recently Parma ’s Reginaldo .
And guess what else ?
She was on Striscia la Notizia .
No fooling .
Make that four alumni on this ranking .
Like all good Italian WAGs , she ’s a popular personality on whatever passes for Italian television and is no stranger to removing her clothing .
And she can claim actress on her résumé too , as she had a minor role in the Deuce Bigalow : European Gigolo playing Lady in Castle .
Maybe she can compare notes with Nicola Tappenden on Rob Schneider .
14 . Giorgia Palmas
Significant Other : girlfriend of Davide Bombardini ( Bologna )
I mentioned earlier how Palmas was good friends with Elena Barolo and appeared in Striscia la Notizia , and now we finally reach her in the rankins .
She ’s been dating Bologna ’s Davide Bombardini for several years , so at least she has n’t crossed passes with Vieri or Inzaghi .
But that might be all that seperates her from most Italian WAGs .
Another beauty pageant queen , she narrowly lost Miss World 2000 to Priyanka Chopra .
Chopra was also on our Bollywood Sex Symbols article , creating a second Bollywood - WAG crossover .
Apparently Palmas has recovered from the loss , carving out a nice career as model .
13 . Francesca Lodo
Significant Other : Assorted
This former Miss Italy ( yes , another one ) enjoys footballers and apparently constant nakedness .
In the picture above , Lodo is wearing just about the most clothing she is in any photos of her .
She ’s run through a number of footballers , including Cristiano Zanetti and Francesco Coco , although there is no current significant other that I know of .
She ’s done the requisite Italian reality shows and nudie calendars , and as an added bonus , her cousin is Giorgia Palmas .
Clearly , hotness runs through her veins .
12 . Raica Oliveira
Significant Other : ex-girlfriend of Ronaldo
The Brazilian top model dated Ronaldo during his more ballooned out days , which either says alot about his game or a lot about Oliveira ’s gold digging .
Not that she needs the money .
In 1999 , Raica won the Elite Model Look contest , besting 30,000 other girls .
She was then sent to France for the international competition , placing second .
Reports say she can now command up to $ 50,000 for a fashion show .
Not bad .
She ’s done plenty of modeling around the world , one example is her appearance in the 2007 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition and Calendar .
She ’s also good friends with Victoria ’s Secret supermodel Adriana Lima .
That ’s a nice visual .
11 . Noémie Lenoir
Significant Other : married to Claude Makélélé ( Paris Saint - Germain )
Noémie Lenoir was briefly discussed on this site in our 2008 Victoria ’s Secret Fashion Show Models Power Ranking , but has otherwise escaped mention .
We do n’t have much to add this time around either .
She ’s hot , a model , somewhat down to earth , and an actress .
Lenoir has appeared opposite Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayek in the film After the Sunset , as well as in Rush Hour 3 , for which she shaved her head .
10 . Michelle Marsh
Significant Other : married to Will Haining ( St. Mirren )
If you ’re breathing and have ever searched the Internet for women , odds are you ’ve come across Mrs. Marsh .
The Page Three girl had appeared in numerous men ’s magazines , ranging from Maxim to Zoo to Playboy .
She ’s also formed a successful modeling partnership with fellow busty Brit Lucy Pinder .
Their photoshoots often make it seem like they ’re more than just friends .
In addition to being naked in front of a camera , Marsh has done the usual reality television , plus she released a single titled “ I Do n’t Do ” .
You can check out the video on YouTube , and can check out more pictures of Michelle over here .
9. Bianca Kajlich
Significant Other : married to Landon Donovan ( Los Angeles Galaxy )
There have been a lot of WAGs on this list , but you might have noticed the dual absensce of American soccer players and American women .
Here ’s an exception .
Kajlich is an American actress with Italian and Slovak heritage .
She can currently be seen on the CBS comedy Rules Of Engagement ( assuming people actually watch that show ) , but has had plenty of supporting roles in movies and television .
My personal favorite of the Kajlich oeuvre is the guilty pleasure Bring It On where she plays big bad Carver .
8. Lorena Bernal
Significant Other : dating Mikel Arteta ( Everton )
Bernal was born in Argentina , but moved to Spain as a child .
Argentina ’s loss is Spain ’s gain , as she was crowned Miss Spain in 1999 .
She mainly models , but also dabbles in television work .
And that includes stuff you ’ve actually heard of , like guest spots on Chuck and CSI : Miami .
7. Ilary Blasi
Significant Other : married to Francesco Totti ( A.S. Roma )
The better half of Francesco Totti , she started her career at the age of three in a TV commercial .
She followed that up with a number of television and movie appearances , before gradually moving over to modeling .
Like any good Italian girl , she has showed no aversion to being photographed in the nearly - nude .
Once the Miss changed to Mrs. , however , she exited the modeling word for more honest work like hosting Italia 1 ’s hit show Le Iene with Luca Bizzarri and Paolo Kessisoglu .
6. Alena Šeredová
Significant Other : married to Gianluigi Buffon ( Juventus )
She may work in Italy , but this model is Czech - born .
Hence the Miss Czech Republic title in 1998 , which led to a fourth place finish at Miss World .
She ’s done plenty of classy modeling work , you know for stuff like Penthouse Europe and Playboy Europe .
I guess she is a good old fashioned Italian girl after all .
This was reinforced when she married Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon .
She even has a connection to Christian Vieri , she co-owns the Italian clothing - line Baci e Abbracci with him .
5. Gemma Atkinson
Significant Other : ex-fiancée of Marcus Brent ( Birmingham City )
Atkinson always seems to be involved with one footballer or another .
Just give it some time , and she ’s bound to be dating some athlete again .
She ’s been linked in the past to the infamous Cristiano Ronaldo , Newcastle ’s Alan Smith , and was once engaged to Marcus Bent .
As an English lady you might guess she got her start on the soap Hollyoaks , and you ’d be right .
Atkinson rose to fame playing Lisa Hunter on the Channel 4 teenage soap .
She parlayed that into the usual reality show and glamour / lingerie model gigs , and even added in the voice work for Lt. Eva McKenna in EA ’s Command and Conquer : Red Alert 3 video game .
You can find more Gemma over here .
4. Sylvie Françoise van der Vaart
Significant Other : wife of Rafael van der Vaart ( Real Madrid )
Sylvie Meis had decided by her 18th birthday that she wanted to be a model .
It was a smart move .
In 2003 , after being elected Holland ’s Sexiest Female , she started a relationship with then - Ajax soccer player Rafael van der Vaart .
The rest as they say , is history .
Now known as Mrs. van der Vaart , Sylvie has turned her attention to television hosting , including doing the honors at the 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year ceremony .
Whatever she does , she looks great in .
Even former Hamburg manager Huub Stevens would agree .
In his autobiography he revealed that van der Vaart once deliberately got booked so he could go and party with his lovely lady .
I can understand .
3. Federica Ridolfi
Significant Other : engaged to Giuliano Giannichedda ( Livorno )
Ridolfi has a nasty habit of covering up her chest just as the photographer is getting the shot .
But at least she can still claim the standard Italian WAG occupations of dancer , television hostess , showgirl , and model .
Included in that body of work is the show Quelli che … il calcio , which is a live sport , comedy , and music TV show that announces goals in real time from Italian soccer .
She also continues the WAG tradition of wearing exceptionally small clothing and posing in provocative ways .
2. Cheryl Cole ( née Tweedy )
Significant Other : married to Ashley Cole ( Chelsea )
The British pop singer can be seen in the all - girl band , Girls Aloud , and as a judge on the reality show , The X Factor .
She is married to the Chelsea and England football player Ashley Cole , who seems to be a complete tool .
In addition to earning the nickname Cashley , he ’s been caught cheating on Cheryl with various bar hags and earned himself a drunk and disorderly arrest .
Not that Cheryl is a paragon of virtue .
She was once found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against a nightclub toilet attendant , Sophie Amogbokpa .
But at least she tries to do good .
Like Melanie Slade , she climbed Mount Kilimanjaro for charity .
You can find more Cheryl over here .
1. Abigail Clancy
Significant Other : girlfriend of Peter Crouch ( Portsmouth )
Crouch is possibly the missing link between men and horses , but at least he ’s self - aware of it .
When someone once asked him what he would be if he was n’t a footballer , Crouch replied , “ A virgin ! ”
Even with all his money , how he got Clancy I ’ll never know .
I could look at her all day and never get bored .
Yeah , she ’s high maintenance .
And of course , she has a cocaine habit to fund .
But the lingerie and catwalk model is simply stunning .
You can find more Abbey over here .
Also we ’d like to give Honorable Mention to the following women .
There were simply too many to choose from : Adriana Maldini , Agathe de La Fontaine , Alessia Marcuzzi , Aline Domingos , Anastacia Kosenkova , Annemarie Warnkross , Cassie Sumner , Chanelle Hayes , Chantelle Houghton , Charlotte Mears , Chelsea White , Christina Cindrich , Clair Meek , Claire Merry , Claudia Albertario , Coralie Robinson , Coutney St. John , Daniela Cicarelli , Elle Isaac , Emma Rigby , Fernanda Lessa , Gina Pistol , Giulia Siegel , Gogo Mastrokosta , Hedvika Koller , Jo Guest , Julia Gödecke , Kartika Luyet , Keira Jones , Keyla Espinoza , Kira Eggers , Kristen Pazik , Laure Manaudou , Leah Newman , Leilani Dowding , Lisa Lazarus , Lisa Munday , Lisa Ryzih , Livia Lemos , Louis White , Louise Owen , Luciana Salazar , Magda Gomes , Manuela Harðardóttir , Maria Fowler , María José López , Maria Marinescu , Maria Mazza , Marta Cecchetto , Martina Cech , Merche Romero , Michaela Henderson Thynne , Monika Puchalski , Nadine Coyle , Natalia Fassi , Nicola Chapman , Olalla Dominguez , Pamela Diaz , Raluca Zenga , Renata Langmannova, Salome Onyewu , Samantha de Grenet , Sara Varone , Sarah Maxwell , Saskia Boxford , Sonia Amoruso , Sylwia Klose , Tamara De Rossi , Tatiana Golovin , Tereza Franková , Vanessa Perroncel , Verena Kerth , Vincenza Cacace , Wanda Nara , and Zaira Nara .
Yeah , that ’s a lot of names .
Hopefully we can profile more in the future .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton warned in unusually bleak terms Wednesday that Pakistan ’s fragile government is facing an “ existential threat ” from Islamic militants who are now operating within a few hours of the capital .
Clinton told a House committee that the government in Islamabad is ceding territory and “ basically abdicating to the Taliban and the extremists ” in signing a deal that limits the government ’s involvement in the war - torn Swat Valley .
“ I think we cannot underscore [ enough ] the seriousness of the existential threat posed to the state of Pakistan by the continuing advances , ” said Clinton , adding that the nuclear - armed nation could also pose a “ mortal threat ” to the United States and other countries .
Clinton spoke as militants expanded into new territory adjacent to the Swat Valley and 60 miles from Islamabad , and top U.S. officials continue to make regular visits to Pakistan .
Adm. Michael G. Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , is visiting now .
A special U.S. envoy , Richard C. Holbrooke , was there this month .

Clinton ’s comments to the House Foreign Affairs Committee underscored increasing U.S. alarm at how the militants ’ strength has grown even as the Obama administration has begun trying to implement a new strategy for stabilizing the country .
U.S. officials are worried not only about the stability of Pakistan , but also about neighboring Afghanistan , where they are committing an extra 21,000 troops this year to try to stanch the advances of the Taliban and allied insurgents .
U.S. officials have grown increasingly critical about the deal giving control in Swat to militants , who intend to impose Sharia , or Islamic law , and the prospect that the militants will use the Swat Valley to press closer to the capital .
Before Clinton made her remarks , Maulana Fazlur Rehman , chief of Jamiat Ulema -e - Islam - Fazl , a religious party within the ruling coalition , told parliament on Wednesday that the Taliban was heading toward Islamabad .
“ You talk about Swat and Buner , but according to my information they have reached much closer , ” he said .
“ And if they continue advancing , there will soon be only Margalla Hills between them [ the Taliban ] and Islamabad , ” he said .
Margalla Hills is the dividing line between Islamabad and the North - West Frontier Province .

Also on Wednesday , the main opposition party , which had initially supported the Swat deal , openly criticized the agreement .
“ The last few days show that gun-carrying Taliban are spreading to more areas and eventually want to capture the whole of Pakistan , ” said Khawaja Asif , a leader of the Pakistan Muslim League - N .
U.S. officials are concerned as well about other developments , including a recent decision by the Pakistani Supreme Court to release Maulana Abdul Aziz , an anti-American cleric who is accused of ties to terrorists and has sought to impose Islamic law in the Islamabad region .
The country also has been shaken by a series of urban shootouts between authorities and militants .
In March , militants attacked the Sri Lankan cricket team , and an assault on a police academy near Lahore left 20 people dead .

On the ground , analysts said , many Pakistanis in the lower and even middle classes have a romantic view of Sharia because they are increasingly worried about their personal security and have been badly served by government courts and police .
These Pakistanis also do n’t tend to view the nation as out of control , said Fasi Zaka , an academic , journalist and critic living in Islamabad , because most still have enough to eat and do n’t have the luxury of worrying about conceptual threats .
The elite sector of society tends to be more pessimistic .
But they also have the ability to move their families and savings overseas .
“ And I think that ’s part of the problem , ” Zaka said .
“ Their ability to migrate capital without suffering helps explain why the elite , businessmen , civil servants are letting go and not doing their jobs , not making tough decisions , which would entail sacrifice . ”
Pakistan ’s ambassador to the United States , Husain Haqqani , said Clinton ’s assessment was incorrect .
Advertisement
He said in a CNN interview that the Swat Valley is ringed by mountains and isolated .
He said the government was trying to bring peace by reaching accommodations with tribal groups , just as the U.S. forces did in Iraq .
“ To think that that strategy somehow represents an abdication of our responsibility towards our people and towards the security of our country and the region is incorrect , ” Haqqani said .
But Clinton ’s concern was echoed by Rep. Howard L. Berman ( D - Valley Village ) , the committee chairman , who said he was alarmed by predictions “ that Pakistan could collapse in as little as six months . ”
Clinton called on Pakistanis , Pakistani Americans and others in the diaspora to “ speak out forcefully ” in an effort to change the attitudes of the Pakistani government .
Advertisement
“ I do n’t hear that kind of outrage or concern coming from enough people that would reverberate back within the highest echelons of the civilian and military leadership , ” she said , in her first appearance before the committee since her confirmation hearing this year .
U.S. officials have been trying to strengthen their ties with Pakistani officials .
Last week , they presided at a donor conference in Tokyo that raised as much as $ 5 billion in aid for Pakistan .
Next month , Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari will travel to Washington to meet with President Obama .
The Obama administration ’s strategy for Pakistan and Afghanistan includes tripling the amount of economic aid for Pakistan in the hopes of strengthening its economy and civil society .
Yet the relationships with both the civilian and military officials have been complex .

Clinton said that some Pakistanis are open to the return of Sharia law in the tribal regions because their national judicial system is “ corrupt ” and does not function in the countryside .
“ If you talk to the people in Pakistan , they do n’t believe the state has a judiciary system that works , ” she said .
She said that if the government does n’t set up a functioning system , it will lose out to militants who “ claim they can solve people ’s problems and then they will impose this harsh form of oppression on women and others , which we find unacceptable . ”
Testifying on another subject , Clinton signaled that the administration was in no hurry to further ease relations with Cuba , despite the flurry of seemingly positive signs between the two countries .
Advertisement
“ We ’re going to proceed very carefully in this process , ” she said , recalling that the Cuban government had abruptly ended a thaw during the Clinton administration by shooting down two unarmed private American planes that were distributing anti-Castro leaflets .
She said the administration wanted a “ change in attitude ” from the Cubans , and “ so far we do n’t really see any movement . ”

The flexible solar module is as small as the page of a book .
In the race to renewable energy , organic solar cells are now really starting to take off .
They can be manufactured easily and cheaply , they have low environmental impact , and since they are compatible with flexible substrates , they could be used in many applications such as packaging , clothing , flexible screens , or for recharging cell phones and laptops .
Teams at the Université d’Angers and at the Université Strasbourg have recently obtained record conversion efficiency with solar cells based on organic molecules .
Their work has been published online on the web site of the Journal of Materials Chemistry .
Photovoltaic solar energy works by transforming a fraction of solar radiation into electricity by means of solar cells , which are connected together to form a photovoltaic solar cell module .
The solar cells currently on the market are made up of inorganic materials such as silicon .
A great deal of international research is aimed at developing solar cells made up of organic ( carbon - compound based ) semiconductors .
Although their performance is still considerably lower than that of cells based on crystalline silicon ( around 5 % efficiency as compared with 15 % for silicon cells ) , they present numerous advantages .
Unlike crystalline silicon , which has to be produced at very high temperatures , they can be manufactured cheaply with low energy cost and environmental impact , arguments which are by no means insignificant when it comes to renewable energy .
Moreover , the fact that they are made using solution processes ( for instance from inks or paints ) makes it possible to cover large areas and flexible substrates such as films and fabrics .
Organic solar cells are not intended to compete with silicon , but rather to be used for specific applications , such as packaging , clothing , flexible screens , and recharging cell phones and laptops .
However , in the longer term , they could make a significant contribution to the photovoltaic conversion of solar energy , as long as there is major investment in research into new , more efficient and stable materials .
Over the past ten years or so , most research has focused on developing organic cells in which the active light - absorbing material is made up of long conjugated polymer chains .
Although these cells are the most efficient yet discovered , the use of polymers poses a certain number of problems : synthesis , purification , control of the molecular structure and mass , and the distribution of different lengths of chain ( polydispersity ) .
In order to overcome these obstacles , Jean Roncali ’s team of researchers at the Université d’Angers has developed a novel approach based on replacing polymers by conjugated molecules with a clearly defined structure .
Whereas the conversion efficiencies of the initial prototypes published in 2005 were of the order of 0.20 % , a collaboration between the Angers team and Raymond Ziessel ’s team at the Université Strasbourg , supported by CNRS ’s Energy program , has recently succeeded in reaching conversion efficiencies of 1.70 % , which are among the highest known for this type of cell until now .
New classes of active material specifically adapted to such cells are currently being synthesized in these laboratories .
In this way , the researchers are hoping to improve their results very rapidly .
Industry will no doubt be keeping close watch on their progress .

If you ’re a game developer , and you want to go for a conference , then this week ’s Game Developer Conference in San Francisco may well be a good place to head .
Everyone is going to be there including the 3 big manufacturers : Sony , Nintendo & Microsoft , and a whole host of developers and publishers from Activision to Zynga Game Network and everyone inbetween .
Even SCEE are getting in on the act , so let us hope they ’re not late .
The itinery for the GDC is available online , and God Of War developers , Sony Santa Monica , are holding 3 lectures throughout the week :
Practical SPU usage on God of War III – Wednesday 4 pm ( 11 pm UK )
Self Limiting Rigging Methodology used GoWIII – Thursday 1.30 pm ( 8.30 pm UK )
Drop -In COOP for Open World Games – Friday 9 am ( 4 pm UK )
Now obviously everyone ’s got their eyes on the Self Limiting Rigging Methodology lecture , but I wonder what Sony Santa Monica know about drop - in co-op ?
A quick look through their back catalogue reveals they ’ve only prinicipally been responsible for the God Of War series , how could they know enough about drop - in co-op to give a lecture on it to other game developers if they ’ve not been working on it for a forthcoming title they ’re working on , eh ?
It was almost a couple of months ago that we shared the rumours that GoWIII will feature online play , and the rumours around the Internet have n’t stopped since then ; this lecture , then , could be the proof of online co-op coming to God Of War .
Is There Anything to the Claim that Texas Can Secede ?
Mr. Lust is a PhD Candidate in history at the University of Houston .
Texas cannot secede from the United States .
Rick Perry is wrong .
Ron Paul is wrong .
All of the teabaggers ( hilarious by the way ) are wrong .
First and foremost , the United States and the Confederate States fought a little war in the 1860s .
While the cause of rupture was the protection of slavery , a point of contention from a political standpoint was can you secede simply because you do n't like the government duly elected .
When Robert E. Lee surrendered on April 9 , 1865 , that question from a practical standpoint was answered .
Anti-slavery , pro-free wage labor , pro-capitalist , pro-Union policy prevailed .
Nonetheless , it took a Supreme Court decision four years later , Texas v White , to settle this from a legal standpoint .
In that case , dealing with whether bonds had been transferred illegally by the government of the Confederate States , in an attempt to stay clear of federal involvement , one of the defendants ( John Chiles ) claimed that the Supreme Court did not have jurisdiction , because Texas was no longer a state but essentially a conquered province .
Salmon Chase , the chief justice of the United States Supreme Court wrote the majority opinion ( one that disagreed with Chiles ) and said in part :
The Union of the States never was a purely artificial and arbitrary relation .
It began among the Colonies , and grew out of common origin , mutual sympathies , kindred principles , similar interests , and geographical relations .
It was confirmed and strengthened by the necessities of war , and received definite form and character and sanction from the Articles of Confederation .
By these , the Union was solemnly declared to " be perpetual . "
And when these Articles were found to be inadequate to the exigencies of the country , the Constitution was ordained " to form a more perfect Union . "
It is difficult to convey the idea of indissoluble unity more clearly than by these words .
What can be indissoluble if a perpetual Union , made more perfect , is not ?
Chase continued that by incorporating itself into the United States , Texas could not claim that they had formed " a compact , " but rather they were part of that indissoluble body .
In short , there is no such thing as " a compact " and secession was ( and is always ) counter to the laws of the United States .
This standard was upheld in 1905 's so called insular cases - essentially states that were brought in via treaty , conquest , or agreement , were subject to the same law - once they are duly incorporated , secession is off the table .
Period .
The supporters of Texas secession , most significantly Perry , have pointed to Texas State Constitution of 1845 as a rationale .
At a " teabag " protest in front of the Alamo on April 16 , Perry said , " When we came into the Union in 1845 , one of the issues was that we would be able to leave if we decided to do that . "
His supporters hollered and screamed their approval .
The problem is , they are all wrong .
Brutally wrong .
There is nothing in the 1845 Constitution that says Texas may leave if dissatisfied .
But let 's give the chowderheads the benefit of the doubt and assume that on the basis of the preamble * you could ( sort of ) see where they might have gotten this misguided notion .
It would be all well and good if Texas were actually governed under the provisions of the 1845 Constitution .
The problem is we 're not .
After that little war in the 1860s I referred to earlier , Texas had to write a new constitution in 1876 , which is the guiding document .
And , here 's the surprise - it too says nothing about the right to secede .
One would think that the governor of Texas would know under which document he governs .
But maybe that is expecting too much .
Aside from the governor not knowing his own state law , two other points argue against this notion of the 1845 Constitution allowing secession .
The doctrine of acquisitive prescription ( cited in the so - called insular cases ) runs counter to Perry 's claims , as Texas transferred its sovereignty to the United States .
Similarly the principle of estoppel would also run counter to the idea of secession .
Texas desired statehood from the moment it seceded in 1836 ( this time from Mexico ) , supported and encouraged by Sam Houston .
While many Texans point with pride to the nine - year republic period , they conveniently forget that in 1837 , the Texas minister plenipotentiary , at the direction of the Texas legislature made application to the United States for annexation .
The US rejected this application , but made it clear to the minister , Memicun Hunt , that it was solely because Texas technically remained at war with Mexico , and that once this were resolved , the path to statehood was open .
Texas once again went down this road in 1838 , as former President John Quincy Adams filibustered the annexation and killed the prospect of Texas statehood .
Only then did Texas resign itself to being a republic for the time being ( for reference see " The Speech of John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts , upon the Right of People , Men , and Women , to Petition on the Freedom of Speech and Debate in the House of Representatives of the United States ; on the Resolutions of Seven State Legislatures , and the Petitions of More than One Hundred Thousand Petitioners , Relating to the Annexation of Texas to this Union " ) .
At issue here is the following : Texas desired statehood , moved to accomplish statehood , and ultimately attained statehood .
Texans can't claim now in 2009 ( just as they could n't in 1845 , or in 1861 , or at any other point ) that they did not wish to be a state under the U.S. Constitution , or the U.S.'s " rules " more generally .
Finally , the principles of these proponents of secession have already unraveled .
Never mind that all of this recent talk of secession began as a protest against federal interference in the form of economic stimulus dollars .
The Texas governor and legislature all stood unified , saying we will not accept federal interference , promising that they would hate to discuss it , but secession was certainly on the table .
Apparently their principles vanished .
On April 17 ( 2 days later ! ) the Texas House unanimously passed a $ 178.4 billion budget that contained a $ 10 billion shortfall offset by -- wait for it -- the federal stimulus package .
Speaker Joe Straus said of the apparent contradiction , “ I ’ve been critical of the stimulus approach from Washington , but I have to say that it is helping us balance our budget ” ( Houston Chronicle , “ Texas House Unanimously Okays $ 178.4 Billion Budget Plan , ” 18 April 2009 ) .
So can we please get a grip ?
I understand that the Republicans are upset that President Obama is “ forcing ” them to accept a stimulus package with which they disagree .
Whether those of us on the left like it or not , the job of the opposition party is to oppose .
And there should be no problem with opposing .
Political conservatives lost , and that ’s all there is to it , just like the " liberals " lost in 2000 and 2004 .
But get over it -- create an agenda .
Focus on policy .
Fix your own house .
Oppose all you want .
But stop with the secession talk .
It is over -- it 's counter to the law and the people proposing secession have already sold their principles to balance the budget .
*" We , the people of the republic of Texas , acknowledging with gratitude the grace and beneficence of God , in permitting us to make a choice of our form of government , do , in accordance with the provisions of the joint resolution for annexing Texas to the United States , approved March first , one thousand eight hundred and forty - five , ordain and establish this constitution .

Actually , any state can fly its flag equal with the U.S. Flag .
Most scholars agree that Texas CANNOT be divided into five states .
Finally , great article !
R.R. Hamilton - 5/9/2009 Prof .
Lust seems to know .
I do n't .
So , what is it and why is it " hilarious " in this context ?
Buddy Lehde - 5/2/2009
I ’ve read both sections of the U.S. Constitution , the Supremacy Clause ( Article VI , paragraph 2 ) and the 14th Amendment , to which you refer .
I admit that I read them from a lay mans point of view , but I believe all laws should be written so anyone who must abide can understand .
Article VI :
“ All debts contracted and engagements entered into before the adoption of this Constitution , shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution , as under the Confederation . ”
( It is my assumption that Confederation in this context refers to the Articles of Confederation ) .
“ This Constitution , and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof ; and all Treaties made , or which shall be made , under the Authority of the United States , shall be the supreme Law of the Land ; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby , any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding .
( It is my assumption that this refers to Treaties made prior to adoption of the Constitution . )
Paragraph 3 refers to Oath to support the Constitution .
14th Amendment
Section 1 refers to rights granted to all citizens of the U.S. and individual States may not abridge those rights
Section 2 refers to apportionment
Section 3 refers to qualification for office
Section 4 refers to public debt
Section 5 refers to enforcement of the 14th Amendment ( further amending by the 26th Amendment ) which refers to voting age .
Perhaps I ’m missing something but I read nothing in here to override State laws except those concerning prior contracts , treaties , or the rights of citizens of the United States .
If I am wrong , please direct me .
Oscar Chamberlain - 5/2/2009 " Two , THE PERPETUITY OF THE UNION DEPENDS on the UNIMPAIRED right of local self - government . "
The problem is the supremacy clause : it clearly makes national law superior to state constitutional provisions .
The doctrine of enumerated powers and the tenth amendment provides some grounds for appeal by states to the courts concerning federal laws that may violate state sovereignty .
Given the scope of those enumerated powers , as expanded by the 14th amendment , there are not many aspects of state governmental authority that are beyond the reach of the national government .
Buddy Lehde - 5/2/2009 " SB 83 requires that students , once during each school day , recite the pledge of allegiance to the United States and Texas flags followed by one minute of silence .
During that one minute , students may choose to reflect , pray , meditate , or engage in any other silent activity not likely to interfere with or distract another students . "
Looks like a pledge to BOTH flags .
Be it known that BOTH fly from my house daily .
If you 've read any of my other posts , you should know that I am not anti-American , but have been writing as pro-U.S. Constitution .
Buddy Lehde - 5/2/2009
Ahh , you speak of a FLAG pledge .
There is another : " Honor the Texas flag ; I pledge allegiance to thee , Texas , one state under God , one and indivisible . "
The original pledge of 1933 , amending in 1965 , was again amended by House Bill 1034 during the 80th Legislature with the addition of " one state under God . "
The revised wording became effective on June 15 , 2007 .
I have yet to research the Perry signing in 2003 and about which pledge he made into law .
Buddy Lehde - 5/2/2009
You are correct in my confusion of aurthors .
My apologies .
len hildebrandt - 5/2/2009 In 2003 , Gov. Perry signed a law requiring the recital of the Pledge of Allegiance each day in Texas schools .
There was much ado about " under God " at the time .
Apparently , " indivisible " has too many syllables .
len hildebrandt - 5/2/2009
It 's an insult to Hemingway to allege that he would ever have put his name on the sloppy , self - indulgent patter packaged under the title " Travels with Charley . "
That was done by another once - great writer in full decline , John Steinbeck .
Maarja Krusten - 5/2/2009
Thanks !
I 've read your other postings under the article , very interesting .
We have n't moved far from my original thread but are far removed from some of your other postings here .
Although addressed to you , some of my comments were meant for Mr. Lust and to my fellow historians as a whole .
In public forums , I do n't think we as a profession take into account that when we appear in public , we 're ambassadors .
Ambassadors for our professional values or , for those who choose to interject personal opinion into history essays , for political parties .
It probably jumps out at me more than for others because I 'm affiliated with no party .
I hope you continue to follow HNN and continue to share your knowledge and insights .
You may even be lucky enough to find some authors of main page essays here who engage with you and other readers !
Best ,
Maarja
Buddy Lehde - 5/2/2009
I believe that you and I have strayed far from the original topic of secession and more specifically , the Texas v White case which triggered my initial response .
If you have read my posts to others on this site I think you will find that I ’ve stayed a little more focused on the subject .
Not withstanding , I too have enjoyed our discussion .
With you a government historian and me on the opposite end of the spectrum , I believe we could both benefit in discussing other issues that are not a part of this forum .
I have tried to steered clear of politics , parties , policies and other things that are burning issues today .
I ’ve a couple of engineering projects that are in the closing stages and that has afforded me time to enter into such discussions .
Besides , I ’ve a lot of time to burn at home .
I ’m new to commenting via the internet and do n’t know how to take discussions off - line .
I have no disregard of scholars except they do not seem well - suited to keep the project schedules on which my contracts are based .
In their realm , I ’m sure that they do a superb job .
I do , however , hold those in a teaching role to a higher standard .
Facts , complete and thorough .
It ’s a proven fact that if you teach the young to believe as you , the future is yours .
The apology still stands .
Buddy
Maarja Krusten - 5/2/2009
Thank you for your interesting and thoughtful response !
No need to to apologize to me for your assessment of scholars .
That I myself am an historian by profession does not mean I cannot accept assessments of scholars by those who have worked with them or have read their articles .
The profession benefits from such assessments and certainly is not so weak that it cannot handle them .
Thank you for telling me more about your background , as well .
I can understand why an engineer especially would look for factual presentations in an history article here on HNN .
And express surprise when personal opinions appear in such a piece .
Not all historians write that way .
From my experience , few authors who post articles on HNN actually use this web 2.0 forum for respectful dialogue with readers , even those who offer constructive criticism .
I think it will take some time before scholars become accustomed to the idea that sites such as this have the potential to offer much more than places to drop articles in a hit and run fashion , so to speak .
Many learning opportunities missed here , in my view .
As someone who successfully has made a career of history in Washington , D.C. , under Republican and Democratic administrations alike , I find HNN 's greatest value to be the way it offers glimpses into how people ( writers and readers alike ) view and frame issues .
I myself am an Independent although I called myself a Republican in earlier times .
( I voted straight Republican throughout the Cold War . )
Most of my career has been spent in working with Presidential ( White House ) records .
My sense now under a Democratic administration as in the past during a Republican one is that , as we often heard commentators say during the Bush administration , law abiding citizens have nothing to fear from the government 's efforts to keep the nation safe .
But I understand that people 's perceptions are formed due to many factors , which obviously are going to differ , depending on where they sit .
Academics play a part in those factors , in my view .
I 'm fascinated by the fact that academics , or at least those who clearly support one party or another , do not always seem to consider that when speaking in public , they are acting as ambassadors for the party they support .
Sometimes they even feed into stereotypes and potentially harm rather than help the side they support .
It 's one reason why I keep saying to them , look at the big picture , respect where others are coming from even when you disagree with them politically , and try to think more strategically !
Presentation matters as much as the facts one recites .
I 've enjoyed chatting with you here ,
Maarja
Buddy Lehde - 5/1/2009
Yes , it is an interesting subject and reading on the subject helps fill my idle time .
I think a symposium on the subject would rapidly turn into a shouting match for the issue is very emotional .
Thanks to the internet , there is so much not found in modern history books .
The history of secession extends long before the War Between the States , even to the founding of the Union .
The New England Secession movement started , I believe , around 1804 and lasted a decade .
As secession is not mentioned in the Constitution , President Jefferson opined to let them go .
Only with Lincoln did it become a serious issue .
For all the good we think of Lincoln , for all practical purposes , this was Lincoln ’s War .
And , what most know or are taught comes from books written by the Victors .
Let me state that there is nothing in the Annexation Treaty between the Republic of Texas and the United States of America or in the current Texas Constitution that EXPLICITLY gives Texas the right of withdrawal from the U.S.
As a result of the War , the Treaty is probably null and void anyway .
Only a lawyer could answer that question .
One could only state IMPLICITLY on the phrases “ subject only the Constitution of the United States ” and “ the perpetuity of the Union depends on the unimpaired right of local self - government . ”
The Federal government has been shredding the Constitution since FDR and the current Stimulus Package states that State Legislators can override a Governor who refuses to accept the whole or any part of the package .
If that is not an impairment of the right of local self - government by the Federal government , I do n’t know what else is .
That is the gist of what Governor Perry said .
Section 29 affirms that the law is null and void .
Why is Texas in the news when other states , notably Vermont , speak of secession ?
I suggest you read Ernest Hemingway ’s “ Travels with Charley ” where , I quote , “ Texas is a state of mind , Texas is an obsession .
Above all , Texas is a nation in every sense of the word ” and “ I sense I witness those who love Texas and those who hate it . ”
You will find both kinds in these posts of Texas secession .
As the Union was formed in 1775 out of grievances with King George and the English government , the Republic of Texas was born in 1836 out of Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana usurping the 1824 Constitution of Mexico , which created a federal republic , into one of a military dictatorship .
We take constitutional issues serious .
Alyssa Conti - 5/1/2009 Mr
Winningham , I found your response to Mr Walker incredibly disrespectful and uncalled for .
Not only did you not answer any of his questions , you made him seem like an unintelligent nuisance .
If you had no intention of answering his questions or no knowledge with which to do so , you should not have wasted space with a response .
The question has nothing to do with Texas desiring or not desiring annexation , only the process that it occured under .
I myself do not know the answer to that and therefore will make no attempt at enlightening either of you on the issue .
As to your second response , obviously Mr Walker is referring to the US constitution as he states that Texas as well as any other state has the ability to remove itself from the senate .
Why would the Texas constitution have an article that allows New York to remove itself from the senate ?
It would n't .
Whether or not the US constitution does in fact allow for this , I do n't know .
However I do find it very rude and immature that rather than trying to understand fully the questions being posed , you chose to assume ( incorrectly ) that Mr Walker was ignorant as to the constitution that governs Texas .
Additionally , it has been proved in the very first set of comments in response to this article that the current Texas constitution does in fact allow for Texas secession , however since it is obvious that you did not read this post , I have copied it into this post as well
" Concerning the 1876 Texas Constitution ( current ) , Article 1 is the Bill of Rights .
Section 1 of Article 1 reads : “ Texas is a FREE and INDEPENDENT State , subject ONLY the Constitution of the United States ; and the maintenance of our free institutions and the perpetuity of the Union depend upon the preservation of the right of local self - government unimpaired to all of the States . ”
To me , two things are key in this statement .
One , it states subject only to the Constitution , not the Articles of Confederation , not the US Congress and not the Presidency .
Two , THE PERPETUITY OF THE UNION DEPENDS on the UNIMPAIRED right of local self - government .
Section 2 states that the People have the right to alter , reform or abolish their government .
And lastly , Section 29 reads “ To guard against the transgressions of the high powers herein delegated , we declare that everything in this “ Bill of Rights ” is excepted out of the general powers of government , and shall forever remain inviolate , AND ALL LAWS CONTRARY THERETO , OR TO THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS , SHALL BE VOID . ” "
So there you have it .
The cold hard facts are actaully being posted instead of ignorant interpretations of other people 's misinformed rants .
Buddy Lehde - 5/1/2009 Maarja
So nice to hear a reasoned response .
The subject is a highly charged emotional issue and sometimes it is difficult hold back and not enter the fray with those who operate on the surface , not delving into serious thought .
If I have offended your profession by my comments about the article author , you have my sincere apologies .
It ’s just that I abhor revisionist history .
I always try to remember that history books are written by the victors , as is the case of the War Between the States .
My career has been in engineering and , since I ’m an old codger , covers many years .
Fact , my user name is OldTexasGent .
As an engineer , so many times I ’ve needed to review forensic data to determine what happened so as to make my designs safer and better .
Safety is foremost in what I do for , oftimes , lives depend on my decisions .
That has turned my into somewhat a history buff and I do my research .
I have traveled many places on this Earth and know that the U.S. is the greatest of all .
My love for the U.S. is exceeded only by my love for my Lord and Savior , my family and Texas ( in that order ) .
Also , having been a Cold Warrior ( standing the line in Germany during the days of MAD ) , I have sworn an irrevocable oath the defend the Constitution against all enemies , foreign AND domestic .
I guess all of the above make me a prime candidate for DHS scrutiny .
Defending the Constitution , as it is written , is my reason for entering these discussions .
If my opinions expressed here are in error , I will willingly listen to counter arguments .
I am extremely analytical and will only be convinced with strong data .
Concerning academes , I understand the necessity of research and deep thought .
I am , however , continually amused with their listing of letters , degrees , publications , etc. in order to show their importance .
Looks sorta pompous to me .
From my experience , they do have a problem with thinking out of the box , something I do every day .
Donald Wolberg - 5/1/2009
Thank you for the added remarks .
The subject remains very interesting , certainly worth a symposiumd and volume of analysis .
Maarja Krusten - 5/1/2009
I actually do believe that academically trained professionals can succeed in adding value to products in the corporate world or the governmental world .
If they are historians , it helps if they have open minds , respect people from other disciplines and are willing to learn how they fit in to a corporation 's or a agency 's decision making process .
An historian 's training in critical analysis can help add value to products or processes .
Not all academically trained historians are theorizers , only .
I 've actually worked in positions in some of my past jobs where I had to make up - or - down decisions and to learn to live with the consequences !
As to the latter , although military departments are best known for valuing after action examinations and lessons learned , they have their place in civil agencies , too .
Maarja Krusten - 5/1/2009
Thank you for the information , I had not looked up anything about Clayton Lust .
As to the history profession ( where I make my living ) , I actually do n't know where I fit in among historians in arguing that public presentations carry more weight and reach a broader audience when they focus on the historical rather than personal opinion .
This is n't the first time I 've made that argument here on TNN .
Part of my reason for doing so is to urge historians to be more self aware and to think more about strategic and tactical choices .
I think I 'm fighting a losing battle on that on HNN , however .
My career as a historian has been in civil service with the federal government ( 36 years and counting - - I started federal service while Richard Nixon was President ) , rather than in the academy or in the private sector ( where you work ) .
In offering advice to other historians , I ’m reflecting my civil servant 's training which is to look at issues in terms of problem solving .
Hence my tendency to try to trigger brainstorming , starting with examination of causes and conditions and leading to consideration of strategies and tactics that might lead to better outcomes .
Brainstoriming is welcome within the government , where , despite some stereotypes to the contrary , the concept of product improvement and actually does exist .
My colleagues and I did a lot of it when I worked at the U.S. National Archives , for example .
My experiences on HNN suggest to me that brainstorming about tactics and strategies and strengths and weaknesses within the profeswsion is much less welcome in academe .
It certainly seems to be " undiscussable " in public .
I think we 're as likely to see historians discuss how they come across on HNN as we are to see Bill Clinton discuss how meandering meetings that stretched out for hours affected decision making within the White House during his term .
( I somewhat share Clinton 's tendency to get drawn into side issues during discussions here on HNN , it 's a weakness of mine to which I 'll readily admit . )
Or Dick Cheney address the questions that former Bush advisor Michael Gerson raised in his book about compassionate conservatism and how things played out after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans .
Former Presidents and Vice Presidents rarely " do " public introspection .
I rarely see academic historians do it either , although there are some exceptions ( Timothy Burke is a great example of an out of box thinker among scholars ) .
But you , with your private sector perspective , offered me some interesting things to think about .
So I thank you for responding to my initial comment .
Buddy Lehde - 4/30/2009
It is a fact that the Articles of Confederation refer to the “ perpetual ” nature of the Union no less than five times .
In light of such importance , it must be considered intentional that the Constitution has not eve one reference to the Union being “ perpetual . ”
Remember , the Constitution was written to REPLACE the Articles and to make it more palatable or agreeable to the States to ratify .
Concerning the 1876 Texas Constitution ( current ) , Article 1 is the Bill of Rights .
Section 1 of Article 1 reads : “ Texas is a FREE and INDEPENDENT State , subject ONLY the Constitution of the United States ; and the maintenance of our free institutions and the perpetuity of the Union depend upon the preservation of the right of local self - government unimpaired to all of the States . ”
To me , two things are key in this statement .
One , it states subject only to the Constitution , not the Articles of Confederation , not the US Congress and not the Presidency .
Two , THE PERPETUITY OF THE UNION DEPENDS on the UNIMPAIRED right of local self - government .
Section 2 states that the People have the right to alter , reform or abolish their government .
And lastly , Section 29 reads “ To guard against the transgressions of the high powers herein delegated , we declare that everything in this “ Bill of Rights ” is excepted out of the general powers of government , and shall forever remain inviolate , AND ALL LAWS CONTRARY THERETO , OR TO THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS , SHALL BE VOID . ”
( All caps are mine ) .
Donald Wolberg - 4/30/2009 Mr. Ledhe makes a fascinating analysis and enhancement of this very interesting issue from a number of prspectives .
The discussion of the possibility is certainly worthy and one might wonder if " perpetual union " from the Articles of Confederation were instituted , would not a new and rather loose federation of Texas with the rest be possible as an outcome .
Would this allow any opening for a regional " disunification " to be replaced by the " perpetual union " in the sense of the Articles ?
cherish henning - 4/30/2009
I obviously was n't around when all these documents were drafted , and argued in court , but I was at the San Antonio Tea Party , and I know for a fact that Perry was n't .
This detail , falsely represented in this article is easy to verify , and only took place 15 days ago .
How then can we trust the opinion of this person about what happened decades ( or centuries ) ago .
By logic and reason the rest of the article can't be trusted .
I prefer to read the opinion of those who fact check , and verify their opinions prior to posting , rather than say whatever sounds good at the time .
Buddy Lehde - 4/30/2009
Your comment sounds like a knee - jerk reaction and not very well thought out .
Since it could be taken as “ tongue - in - cheek ” , I would like to also supply a little insight as to what may happen ( not quite tongue - in - cheek ) .
Are we going to have Texas Currency ?
Who will take it .?
Of course we will need to print and coin our own currency .
As to who would take it , it would be backed up in the same manner as the present U.S. currency .
( Do you think that dollar bill in your pocket is worth gold ?
No , it ’s backed by the “ good will ” of the U.S. )
Will oil companies want to be headquartered in Texas ?
They would be fools if they did n’t as the bulk of North American oil expertise is based in Houston .
We will be having the Annual Offshore Technology Conference here next week which has world - wide attendance .
You are welcome to attend .
Will I need a passport to go to Oklahoma ?
No , Oklahoma is with us .
No more money for schools and roads from D.C. , right ?
Right .
Texas would need to implement a tax ( probably flat or consumption based ) as we currently do not have a state income tax .
Schools are a local issue anyway and of no business to D.C .
Who would the Cowboys play ?
Well , in addition to the Texans , we could start the San Antonio Vaqueros , Austin Liberals , maybe the Waco Baptists .
We have enough football talent in the state to do so .
Since Oklahoma would go with us ( and probably Louisiana ) , there could be the Oklahoma Okies and the Saints .
That ’s seven and , if any other states as sympathetic to us , we could probably pick up a few more .
NCAA title game is political anyway so it would n’t matter .
There is the old Southwest Conference schools plus others in states mentioned above .
We would manage .
Javier Ramirez - 4/30/2009
Thanks for the response , Mr Chamberlain .
In regard to the question of force and secession what I meant to convey was that if a legal question is settled by the force of arms then sure it may be " settled " all right but its settled in the same way that a bully settles on the fact that you are going to give him your lunch money every day .
Yes many things are settled by force but as the saying goes " might does not make right " .
Even your example of nations coalescing is not without controversy over the legitimacy of some nations .
Im in general agreement with your other comments .
Buddy Lehde - 4/30/2009
The ‘ 70 ’s “ Let ’s secede and join OPEC ” was about the same time bumper stickers appeared that read “ Let the Yankees freeze in the dark ” and “ I was n’t born in Texas but I got here as soon as I could . ”
All in jest although the later was probably more true .
We have as much aversion to OPEC at the rest considering the company they keep .
I cannot imagine an independent Texan sitting across the board room table from Chavez of Venezuela .
As far at the freeze in the dark comment , that too would not happen for we do help our neighbor – it ’s the Christian thing to do .
We are living in tremulous times and a solution needs to be found .
The recent “ Tea Parties ” , ridiculed by some , are only the tip of the iceberg in what ’s to come .
From my point of view , these protests are not so much as the tax rate , but more on wasteful Federal government spending and the transferring of debt to later generations .
They were not just in Texas but nationwide .
We are not the only ones fed up .
Secession ?
Not really in favor but if all else fails , it could happen , and not just with Texas .
Oscar Chamberlain - 4/30/2009
" It should be axiomatic to all would be historians that a legal question settled by force ( i.e. civil war ) is a question left unanswered . "
Actually , in human history a number of legal questions have been settled by force .
How do you think that other nations coalesced ?
Did that always happened in accord with law and tradition ?
I do concede that one cannot absolutely rule out a change in our nation so profound that secession would begin to gain a new legitimacy beyond the fringe .
As one of the other posters notes , drastic change does happen .
I see no sign of it at this time .
Certainly , the discussion of it in Texas is no sign of a national trend .
It comes out of the local political tradition .
The " right of secession " and the perhaps clearer right to sub - divide into as many as five states , is a strong part of the local lore , often reinforced with various degrees of accuracy , in the public schools .
That it is one of the few states that , in terms of size and geographic location , could make a go of it alone helps to maintain what is essentially a sometimes pleasing fantasy .
I know I sort of liked the mid-1970s " let 's secede and join OPEC version " when I lived there .
So I have no particular aversion to the rightwing variant that 's out there , unless it starts inspiring people to take up arms .
Bob Buzzanco - 4/30/2009
Yeah , let 's secede , but first we need to get in line to get our Tamiflu from CDC , then get on a federal highway out of town .
Texas , like most southern states , is a net recipient of federal aid .
Northern states are in deficit .
So the north subsidizes the south , but Texans want to secede .
Are we going to have Texas currency ?
Who will take it ?
Will oil companies want to be headquartered in the " country " of Texas ?
Will I need a passport to go to Oklahoma ?
No more money for schools and roads from D.C , right ?
And the Cowboys can't play in the Superbowl - - but they 'll have 16 games against the Texans -- and UT can't win the NCAA title .
Sounds like a winner of a plan to me .
Buddy Lehde -

I am in agreement with your post .
History is a study of events ; politics is a study of how those events affected , or will affect , future events .
The study of events is a study of facts and should be presented as such ; re-writing , or teaching , history to be politically correct or to inject personal bias does not change the fact that the event happened .
What an instructor thinks of these events should have no bearing on how they are presented .
Although I do not hold a PhD , I ’ve had a number of them work for me .
As a group , I ’ve found them to be non-productive , preferring to spend their time theorizing rather than producing .
Being in private enterprise and not having the luxury of government grants , I am bound to produce quality work , on - time and within budget .
In my recent reply to Mr. Lust ’s post on secession , I mentioned that I do not hold to his position on the Texas v White decision .
I was unaware of his teaching position until I placed my reply .
Thanks to Mr. Ramirez ’s post , I was able to view Mr. Lust ’s web site .
I was appalled .
From his emphasis placed on certain events , the personal bias shown , it appears evident that Mr. Lust has an axe to grind ( along with a tremendous ego ) and wants to shape others opinions to match his , whether factual or not .
I suggest Mr. Lust vacate his teaching position and run for political office , starting with State Representative .
There , he can free - wheel all he wants without causing much damage to young minds .
Per Fagereng - 4/29/2009
Historians should know by now that anything that 's been done can be undone .
Empires rise and fall , nations are made and unmade .
The logic put forth by Mr. Lust is like that of a church that allows marriage but not divorce .
A foolish choice is sealed forever .
Nevertheless men and women do go their own ways with or without court approval .
Here 's a possible future : Rising oil prices shrink long - distance trade and travel .
Almost all the problems of our economy are dealt with at a local and state level .
The federal government is mainly preoccupied with futile wars that no sane person wishes to fight .
In such a case , states go their own way .
They do n't call it secession .
They do n't fight the federal government , they just ignore it .
Javier Ramirez - 4/29/2009 " Of course " ?
Spare us the bad comedy .
Read my reply to Mr Lust .
Javier Ramirez - 4/29/2009 Mr.
Lust thinks he is original in referring to Americans who attended the tea party as " teabaggers " , " chowderheads " , and " hilarious " .
If this ad hominem writing is Lust 's modus operandi than academia is in worse shape than I thought .
You really should stop watching MSNBC .
First his treatment of secession was needless to say superficial .
The issue of a state 's right to secede is no more settled by a Supreme Court decision or civil war than the question of slavery was settled in the mid 19th century by Taney 's court .
It should be axiomatic to all would be historians that a legal question settled by force ( i.e. civil war ) is a question left unanswered .
The White decision under the extreme political partisan Chief Justice Chase was / is an example of a pathetic piece of legal reasoning .
Its main and often paraded statement " The union between Texas and the other States was as complete , as perpetual , and as indissoluble as the union between the original States .
There was no place for reconsideration or revocation , except through revolution or through consent of the States " is to any lay person self - contradictory .
If it is " complete " " perpetual " , and " indissoluble " then why claim that a state can leave with the consent of the other states ?
Nonetheless , this is the same perpetual language used under the Articles and yet that union was clearly dissolved when Rhode Island refused to enter the new union for three years after it had been made .
Clearly no one thought that this meant that the union was a binding one .
John Quincy
Adams stated nicely that " the indissoluble link of union between the people
of the several States of this confederated nation
is , after all , not in the RIGHT , but in the HEART "
I do not believe we Texans should secede , but we should defend an early form of federalism in which state 's kept the federal gov't in check and not the other way around .
I want to make clear that my argument is that secession is historically and logically part of the earliest American tradition that Texas inherited .
I do n't believe that what is referred to as the " Legal Status of Texas " is relevant to it .
I personally agree that Texas did not enter by treaty but by a joint resolution of the US congress and by convention in Texas .
While not in my opinion strictly legal it 's nonetheless a moot point now .
However the idea that " perpetual " and " indissoluble " would have been understood as meaning unbreakable is on shaky historical grounds defended by a minority early on .
The idea as Mr Lust says that Texas ' constitution says nothing of secession is equally pathetic reasoning .
He has no understanding of secession .
Secession is understood in law as a right inherit in the nature of a state .
In other words this " it has to be spelled out " argumentation is another example of sloppy thinking .
Mr Lust , for all his grandiose claims to being the " Greatest Historian Ever " http://www.claytonlust.com/index.html
( no doubt tongue and cheeky but given some of his grandiose verbiage you have to wonder ) , is uninformed concerning the nature of constitution making .
Not everything has to be or even should be spelled out in a written constitution .
If you recall Mr Lust there were debates about that early on in the federal constitution convention .
Secession is inherit in the nature of sovereign states .
Texas like the original colonies were sovereign and contrary to Mr Lust never surrendered such quality .
What he and others confuse is the DELEGATION of certain powers but not the attribute of sovereignty .
I directly challenge Mr Lust to point out anywhere in the Texas Constitution where such sovereignty is spelled out as being " surrendered " as he claims .
He can't that 's why he remarkably invokes the insular cases and the idea of " acquisitive prescription " .
But the insular cases dealt with US holdings acquired by force mainly after the Spanish War ( i.e. Phillipines , Cuba , Puerto Rico , Guam , etc ) .
This is NOT the situation with Texas annexation into the US .
Does Mr Lust want to seriously defend the idea that a Republic voluntarily coming into the US is the same as being conquered ?
Be my guest .
Perhaps that 's why even those on Lust 's side almost never resort to the insular cases in this regard .
If he wants to say that Texas was conquered after the War then what happens to his precious
White decision which he used to point out Texas was n't a conquered province contra Chiles ?
This is amazing that someone working on Ph.D in history would make such an embarrasing argument .
I could go on but others have made rigorous legal , historical , and philosophical arguments for secession .
It is a legal doctrine that is rooted in the great western political tradiition and inherited by the 13 colonies that excercised it in its break with Britain .
It was first threatened not by the Deep South but by the deep north when New England threatened to withdraw in the early nineteenth century .
The response by President Jefferson ?
" Let us separate " .
Its rooted squarely in his Declaration of Independence and Kentucky - Virginia Resolutions , and the federalist papers , etc .
As a side and irrelevant personal note , I too received my BA in history from UofH .
Ron Paul is on the side of solid history whereas Mr Lust is in left field somewhere in the business of misinformation .
My advice for your students is one given by the greatest of American philosophers of homegrown truths Mark Twain , if I may paraphrase , " Do n't let Mr Lust 's class interfere with your education "
Buddy Lehde - 4/29/2009 Mr. Lutz
I ran across your article on Texas secession where you mentioned the issue of secession was settled with the Supreme Court case of Texas v White ( 1869 ) .
I differ with you on the following accounts :
You are correct that the case was about the transfer of bonds and the ruling settled the transfer .
However , the case was not about the legality of secession and no decision on secession could be rendered thereof .
The opinion of Chief Justice Chase that Texas never left the Union was a justification for the Court to hear and rule on the case of bond transfers .
This opinion is based on the phrase “ perpetual union ” as found in the Articles of Confederation , a document that preceded the U.S. Constitution .
The Law of the Land is the U.S. Constitution , not the Articles it replaced , and is , or should be , the basis for all Supreme Court decisions .
The Constitution is silent on the subject of States withdrawals and “ perpetual union . ” “ More perfect ” does not translate to “ perpetual . ”
Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase had been a member of Abraham Lincoln ’s cabinet .
Lincoln also believed in the “ perpetual union ” as found only in the Articles .
This view differed from the prevailing view at the time by all the States , prominent legislators , newspapers and even earlier , the Founding Fathers .
Virginia , New York and Rhode Island ratified the Constitution with the right of withdrawal and that right was accepted .
Considering this , the opinion on secession given by Chase in the Texas v White case , sounds like a personal or political opinion , not legal one .
It is also noted that the previous year , 1868 , the treason case against Jefferson Davis was dropped .
Such a trial would certainly have settled the secession issue .
Jefferson Davis wanted the case to go forward to put secession on trial .
The case was dismissed by the Federal government as the same judge , Salmon Chase , said they would lose because nothing in the Constitution forbids secession .
A couple of other twists in the notion that Texas v White settled the secession issue .
In June 1863 , the northwestern portion of Virginia seceded from Virginia to form the State of West Virginia .
This secession was allowed as it suited the northern cause .
How can one section secede and another not ?
Also , Texas was readmitted to the Union in 1870 after the U.S. Congress ( northern states only ) approved the Federal military coerced Texas Constitution of 1869 .
If Texas v
White was valid ; that is , Texas never left the Union , why did it have to be readmitted ?
The surest way this can be put to rest is by Constitutional Amendment .
I seriously doubt if three - quarters of the States would ratify .
I await your answers .

Donald Newton Langenberg - 4/29/2009
Given a little time , I believe I could persuasively demonstrate that our Union would be better off without Texas .
I suspect I 'm not the only American who could do that .
That then raises the question , " Even if Texas cannot legally secede , could the rest of us eject it from the Union ? "
I 'd be interested in Mr. Lust 's view of history and the law on that question .
Frank Couvares - 4/29/2009
Of course , the arguments for secession are without historical merit .
But do n't tell `em -- please .
Oscar Chamberlain - 4/29/2009
Texan 's have been discussing secession ever since they entered the Union .
Heck , there was something of a movement in the mid-1970s , with the idea that the new nation could then join OPEC .
That the governor says that it 's constitutional is only a source of alarm if he tries to call out the militia .
Otherwise this is well within the peculiarities of the Texas political tradition .
My one regret : I do wish that Molly Ivins was still around to provide the accompaniment that all of this so richly deserves .
And if there is a heaven for her where she can look down , she 's popping a beer open and laughing right now .
James Lee Winningham - 4/28/2009
As to your first query , Texas desired annexation from the beginning of its days as an independent republic .
They were only a republic to pass time until they could become a state .
The author makes this clear , so you question about under what terms does the Constitution allow for the Congress to " annex " property of an independent nation is irrelevant as I see it .
It is equivelant to paying someone who desires to give you his vehicle .
As to your second adn third query , article V in which Constitution I ask you ?
The authors ' point is that the 1845 constitution is not the governing document of Texas .
It is the 1876 constitution , so any reference to the 1845 constitution is wrong and misguided and it is scary that the governor to Texas does n't appear to know this .
Bill Walker - 4/28/2009 Query :
As Texas was a republic for nine years , it follows it was an independent nation for that period of time .
Query :
Under what term of the Constitution is Congress allowed to " annex " property of an independent nation unless it is under eminent domain ?
If so , could the author please inform me of the price or amount that Congress authorized to the Republic of Texas for the purchase of its territory ?
I refer the author to almost all other property which the Congress purchased as proof that this principle is the only way the nation can legally expand ; i.e. , the Louisiana Purchase , the purchase of Alaska , Florida .
But I am unaware of any Texas purchase .
Query :
Given that Article V allows for Texas or any other state , with its own consent , to remove itself from the senate , does this not in fact mean Texas can succeed from the government as it clearly is authorized by its own consent to do ?
I point out Texas v
White did not address this issue .
Query :
if Texas negotiated a treaty with the United States and if such document allowed annexation then it follows Texas , as with all independent nations , has the authority to renegotiate its treaty does it not ?
For the treaty to remain viable , it must be continuous and if it is continuous does that not imply that two parties that made the treaty still must exist in order for the treaty to remain viable ?
James Lee Winningham - 4/28/2009
The author did refute this .
He sourced the 1845 Constitution and said there was nothing in the preamble that stated Texas could leave the Union .
He also went on to say that even though they could perhaps interpret the 1845 constitution that way , Texas is now in the Union under the Constitution of 1876 that we had to write after the Civil War .
The author refuted the Texas entering and being governed by Treaty argument .
Maarja Krusten - 4/28/2009
My preference here on HNN is for ( 1 ) historical analysis or ( 2 ) straight up political advocacy .
This article would have been ok as a history piece if the author had focused on the historical angles he covered but left out chacterizations such as " hilarious " for the tea party events .
I would have found it useful if a political scientist had written an overview article about how citizens have protested policies they do n't support and the extent to which taxes have played a part in that .
( Did anti-Vietnam or anti-Iraq war protestors yell about not using taxes to fund wars they did n't support , for example ?
If so , what was the response from the supporters of wartime Presidents , be it LBJ , RN , or GWB ? )
Or if a writer had examined the percentage of people from all parties who have grumbled " I want out " after elections .
( How serious was the talk of moving to Canada by those who did not support GWB 's policies , for example ? )
There are any number of ways to look at dissent or the differing ways that individual members of the losing party work through their reactions after an electoral defeat .
By examining issues over a period of time , from all angles , an historian or a political scientist or a communications expert could write a fine article about tactical moves or how to handle opposition or whatever .
Mixing a few political or personal asides into what generally is a history article of this type does n't work for me , however .

Right around two years ago , we spotted a LED - filled light bulb that used " just " nine watts and cost a staggering $ 65 .
Now , we 've got yet another option that sucks down even less power and costs nearly twice as much .
C. Crane Company has been working on its so - called GeoBulb for a solid three years now , but at long last the device is shipping to affluent homeowners and headstrong Earth lovers .
The bulb can provide as much light as a traditional 60W incandescent with just 7.5W , and it features a 30,000 hour ( 10 years ) lifespan with typical usage .
Now , the hard part : choosing between cool , soft and warm white .

Underground Waterfall Ruby Falls
source : here
Ruby Falls is a 145 - foot high underground waterfall located within Lookout Mountain , near Rock City and Chattanooga , Tennessee in the United States .
The cave which houses Ruby Falls was formed with the formation of Lookout Mountain .
About 200 to 240 million years ago ( in the Carboniferous period , at the end of the Paleozoic era ) the eastern Tennessee area was covered with a shallow sea , the sediments of which eventually formed limestone rock .
About 200 million years ago , this area was uplifted and subsequent erosion has created the current topography .
The limestone in which the cave is formed is still relatively horizontal , just as it was deposited when it was below sea level .
The Lookout Mountain Caverns , which includes Ruby Falls Cave , is a limestone cave .
These caves occur when slightly acidic groundwater enters subterranean streams and eats away at the relatively soft limestone , causing narrow cracks to widen into passages and caves in a process called chemical weathering .
The stream which makes up the Falls entered the cave sometime after its formation .
The Falls are located at the end of the main passage of Ruby Falls Cave , in a large vertical shaft .
The stream , 1120 feet underground , is fed both by rainwater and natural springs .
It collects in a pool in the cave floor and then continues through the mountain until finally joining the Tennessee River at the base of Lookout Mountain .
While Ruby Falls Cave combines with Lookout Mountain Cave to form the Lookout Mountain Caverns , the two caves were not actually connected by any passage .
Ruby Falls
Cave is the upper of the two and contains a variety of geological formations and curiosities which Lookout Mountain Cave does not have .
Electric lights were installed in the cave , making it one of the first commercial caves to be so outfitted .
Motorists travelling on I - 75 in the 70’s were subjected to dozens – maybe hundreds – of billboards along their route with the words “ VISIT RUBY FALLS ” beginning hundreds of miles north and south of the falls itself .
Ruby Falls remains a staple of Chattanooga tourism , operating daily .
Ruby Falls is owned by the Steiner family of Chattanooga , Tennessee .
In 1997 , Jack Straw arrived at the Home Office with a stark agenda .
The police were in dire need of " modernisation " , along with those other behemoths of the public sector , health and education , and this could only be achieved by " new thinking " .
The key driver for police reform was , and remains , the exorbitant cost of paying and equipping police officers .
Linked to this was the pensions " timebomb " .
The Home Office recognised that something had to be done , but its policy options were constrained .
New Labour , elected on a strong law and order ticket , could not reduce police numbers - that was unacceptable in presentational terms .
The only option was to introduce a new cadre of lower paid , low - skill auxiliaries , known as police community support officers , with minimal pension entitlements .
This new body would give the impression that there was a police presence on the streets , while a smaller core of fully trained officers would provide a response service .
Because it is not regarded as real policing , constables dislike patrolling beats , despite the fact that this is what the public expect .
Over the past decade , supine management has compensated them with various " toys and fripperies , beads for the Indians " ( in the words of a very senior officer at a meeting I attended in 1997 ) , including extendable batons and Tasers .
Increasingly , British policing morphed into a faux - US style of operation .
Uniforms were made to look overtly military .
The public were regarded , almost uniformly , as suspects , with any hint of dissent interpreted as anti-police .
To this must be added the post - 9/11 and 7/7 atmosphere .
A succession of intrusive powers under the various terrorism acts convinced many officers that they are frontline combatants in the war on terror .
The concept of officer safety has assumed a life of its own .
It started in the late 1990s with the laudable aim of designing a stab - proof vest for officers as a response to a small number of knife attacks .
The concept has now moved from a defensive posture to an aggressive model .
Officers are trained to be on guard against attack , to regard every situation , no matter how seemingly benign , as a threat situation .
The lesson is that the public are your enemy .
That mindset appeared to dominate at the G20 protests .
Video footage showing officers with steel batons raised shouting " Back off ! " is a classic example of officer - safety training .
Indeed , the G20 has become a tipping point .
With a number of equally concerned former Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) colleagues , I am preparing a contribution to Denis O'Connor 's review of public order policing .
I know him to be a man of firm principle and I hope that he will accept the issues that we have identified .
At the core of the crisis in policing is a crisis of leadership .
The only effective way to command public order situations is by visible and accountable leadership .
In recent years the concept of supervision has disappeared from the lexicon of the Met. Supervisors no longer supervise .
Constables refer to sergeants as " PCs with stripes " ; most are addressed by their Christian names .
Inspectors do not inspect anyone , as standards of appearance and behaviour at the G20 confirm .
By ignoring their responsibilities , sergeants and inspectors are failing their own senior officers , but more importantly , they are in breach of the duty of care that they owe to the public .
Blame must also be laid at the door of superintendents and Acpo members who claim a public order pedigree but are noticeably absent when problems arise .
A rigorous reappraisal of how to supervise personnel is long overdue .
Integrity is non-negotiable .
Police officers are rightly held to a higher standard of behaviour than the general public .
All officers , irrespective of length of service , experience or rank need to be aware that if their integrity is flawed , they cannot remain in the service .
This is not new thinking - the Police ( Conduct ) Regulations 2008 leave no room for doubt .
The standards are binding ; it would be disingenuous for any officer to claim not to know what is expected .
An audit trail can be drawn between misconduct at the G20 protests , such as concealing identity and unprovoked assault , and each standard in the regulations .
The responsibility to " challenge and report improper conduct " was clearly honoured in the breach .
In circumstances reminiscent of the death of Blair Peach in a 1979 anti-racism demonstration , it must be assumed that misplaced loyalty within groups such as the Met 's Territorial Support Group has a bearing on the situation the force faces .
There is also a case for a programme to change the mindset of today 's young officers , some of whom will be the police leaders of the 2020s and 2030s .
They must recognise that the right of lawful protest is inalienable .
If they cannot accept this , then perhaps we should consider looking outside the service for the senior officers of tomorrow .

From FreeThoughtPedia
" I will not attack your doctrines nor your creeds if they accord liberty to me .
If they hold thought to be dangerous - if they assert that doubt is a crime , then I attack them one and all , because they enslave the minds of men . "
- Robert G. Ingersoll
Each and every year , usually when there 's a popular public festival , there 's also a contingent of fundamental evangelical religious people there to scream and judge people according to their dogma .
Many people ignore these public nuisances , others may squabble with them , but more and more people are choosing to counter - protest these obnoxious groups .
It 's bad enough they believe what they believe , but many of us feel it crosses a line when they go public and start condemning others for not following their particular doctrine .
So what do you do in these situations ?
Ignore them ?
Argue with them ?
We here at FreeThoughtPedia think one of the most effective ways to combat these self - righteous hypocrites is through public ridicule and mockery .
They often can't be reasoned with .
They subscribe to the idea that the more they 're persecuted , the more righteous their cause is .
Public embarrassment seems to make the most sense , as it addresses their own insecurities , inferiority complexes and places their propaganda within the proper public context .
Plus it 's fun and it deflates the otherwise vicious nature of their hateful fearmongering .
How to counter - protest religious groups
Some people like Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church invite controversy and attention .
So when people make a big stink about them , it plays into their hands .
Some might argue it 's best to ignore them .
In some cases this is helpful , but while the Phelps clan is outrageous , there are many more evangelicals that are n't so provocative but are still preaching the same message .
Ignoring many of these people just makes them scream louder .
And contrary to what you think , there are ways to reach these people , indirectly .
Direct confrontation
Most of these guys cannot be easily reasoned with .
Nonetheless , you can try if you 're inclined .
It can be fascinating sometimes to delve into the mindset of what would prompt someone to take to the streets and berate other people .
Some of these guys are engaging and polite ; some are downright hostile and wo n't touch " heathens " or anything they hand out .
If you want to engage them , the best thing to do is argue their own doctrine against them :
First pick up some tenet they 're preaching , such as certain types of sins .. most of them are going to be old testament - based when they involve anti-homosexuality and other more liberal religious groups .
Then play their own scripture against them .
You can find some really good counter - passages at Bible rules .
For example , if they 're against homosexuality , you can ask them if they wear clothing of two or more fibers or eat shellfish , which are mentioned as abominations in the same section they cite to justify their homophobic crusade .
Hit them philosophically -
There are a number of loaded questions you can ask fundies that cause them to retreat into the special pleading fallacy :
If god is all - knowing why did he create man knowing he would fall ?
If god gave man free will , why did he force him to choose between reward ( heaven ) and punishment ( hell ) ?
That 's not much of a way to exercise freedom of choice .
Tell them about natural selection and how evolution works
Talk to them about the story of Abraham ...
Ask them if they heard a voice in their head telling them to murder their first - born son , would they do it ?
What kind of " all loving " god would demand something so sadistic from a loyal follower ?
These kinds of philosophical questions can tear at the root of a person 's religious fabric .
They wo n't acknowledge the moral dilemma in front of you , but you can plant a seed that will grow later .
Mockery
One of the most effective methods of nullifying public religious propaganda is through the use of nonsensical confrontation .
Here 's a great example :
Here 's a great example of musician Eric Schwartz protesting at the protesters at the American Atheists conference :
Passive confrontation
One of the best tactics is to use scripture against them , but not to them directly -- at them or at their audience .
Rather than confront these people directly , disrupt their ability to effectively preach .
You can do this passively by handing out fliers or holding up signs where they 're trying to influence others , or you can actively engage them .
I saw a group that carried around their own bullhorn to combat the fundies yelling into their bullhorns .
It 's a bit crass , but it sends them the message that nobody appreciates their noise .
When they 're preaching fire and brimstone into an amplified device , they 're invading other peoples ' spaces and jamming the signal is an appropriate response .
Counter protest signs
Making up funny or thought - provoking signs is a very effective tactic .
In addition to images and words making fun of them , a more - direct counter - attack is to go after the basis of their ideology with phrases like :
" I gave up superstitious mumbo jumbo for Lent . "
" Christian Terrorists "
" Jesus was a liberal socialist "
" Worship me or I 'll torture you forever - Love God "
" Jesus Saves ( you from thinking for yourself ) "
" The Spanish Inquisition - the original ' Faith - based initiative ' "
" Intelligent Design - Making stupid people feel smart since 1987 "
" If God wanted people to believe in him , then why did he invent logic ? "
Using a simple word processor you can print out small signs and hold them up , or larger ones to make a strong point .
They 're very effective in belittling the religious protesters into wanting to pack up and move elsewhere .
Freethought Hand-outs
The fundies have their " Chick Tracts " - what does a Freethinker have ?
We have our own hand - outs .
Here we will feature a number of pieces of counter - propaganda that we recommend passing out in places where the fundamentalists are preaching their gospel of intolerance .
atheist / agnostic / anti-fundy pamphlet -
This is our custom hand - out for Mardi Gras 2009 , injecting both humor , ridicule and history and philosophy into a powerful pamphlet that counters the religious message .
atheist pamphlet : " Why Believe In God ? " - Created several years ago , this is a general - purpose , polite inquiry into religion , exposing many preconceived notions about the origin of morality and goodness .
Take these to your favorite copy center and print up a bunch of them and hand them out the next time the evangelicals raid your campus or public square .
It 's not enough to ignore them , not when they are preaching a philosophy of hatred and intolerance , and the basis for their moral superiority is questionable at best .
The public needs to know the truth .
Internet hoaxes are numerous – they may take different forms .
They can be spread for malicious purposes : to steal your personal information or spoil someone ’s reputation .
Or they may be absolutely innocent and created for God knows what reasons .
This post is meant to look into those hoaxes that are no harm to anyone .
Well , some people might be still ripped off but that was not intended .
Here are most creative and sensational Internet but harmless hoaxes of all times :
Fake Photos :
Fake photos are spread around the Internet faster than anything .
Some of them are remembered for years and never stop provoking rumors and discussions .
Two most long - lasting photos which are still traveling from blog to blog are pictures of a giant cat , a shark attacking the helicopter and the accidental tourist photographed on top of the World Trade Center right before the terrorist attack of September 11 , 2001 .

Fake Videos : Google TV
2007 was the year when the Internet users were fooled into believing that Google was going to launch “ Google TV ” – the service in beta that allowed to watch all your favorite TV shows online for free .
The video posted on Youtube provided the instruction on how to sign up for the private beta – the idea was eagerly supported by bloggers who start spreading the word .
Google TV was rumored to be supported by major TV channels .
Additionally , the video featured the tutorial on how to use the service and what it looks like inside .
The video was surprisingly convincing and easy - to - believe :
Fake Characters : Lonelygirl15
A fictional teenage girl named Bree , whose YouTube username is the eponymous “ lonelygirl15 ” , achieved massive popularity posing as a real 16 - year - old video blogger .
To further the initial illusion that Bree was a real girl , a MySpace page was set up for her and she was corresponding with many of her fans .
In reality , the whole team of professional filmmakers was behind the online character :
Fake Twitter Accounts
Since Twitter became popular , many celebrities and famous people joined it to communicate with fans and followers .
Many of those accounts are fake – funniest hoaxes among them are :
@cnnbreaking is the fake CNN account responsible for numerous fake news .
Too bad they do not update their stream frequently enough .
My favorite Tweets from them are :
“ Apple unveils ultra - fragile , overpriced new laptop . ”
“ No joke : Obama wins ! ”
Dalai Lama was found to have joined the micro-blogging service under the name @OHHDL , The Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama .
A few days later the hoax was discovered and the account was suspended as
“ Using Twitter to impersonate others in a manner that does or is intended to mislead , confuse , or deceive others is also cited in the Twitter Rules . ”
The self - proclaimed ‘ official ’
Twitter account of the Austin , Texas , police department @AustinPD was suspended on March , 25 , CNet.com reports :
“ Updates from the fake Twitter account included “ warming up my radar gun for SXSWi ” and “ we ’re looking to make more stops at SXSW this year than last , ” as well as references to police jargon codes that seemed to be stemming from a knowledge of gangsta rap lyrics rather than actual law enforcement . ”
Fake Websites :
Create a false website on some fake event or announcement and spread it around – you are most likely to get some attention .
Why ?
Because people love sensations and hoaxes no matter how lame and unbelievable they are .
Just one of the numerous examples : Christopher Walken ’s 2008 Presidential Campaign site that was mentioned by Washington Post as well as other reputable web resources .
The site is an obvious hoax but people were talking about it no matter what :
Funny Email Spam
I hate spam ( as well as anyone having an email address does , I guess ) .
However this type of spam makes you smile – so it ’s a good one , I suppose .
These messages are often sent out as a reaction to some notable event – they never steal your personal details or mean anything bad at all .
Here is one of the best examples : a humorous warning based on the story of the Trojan Horse ( via bored.com ) :
Hiccough : Hiccups happen when the diaphragm , the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen , suddenly contracts .
When that happens , air is taken in , and then the voice box closes shut , which is what causes the " hic " sound .
There are different types of hiccups , named after how long they last :
A " regular " bout of hiccups can last up to 48 hours
" Persistent hiccups " last longer than 48 hours and up to a month
" Intractable hiccups " last longer than a month
In most cases , hiccups go away on their own with no lasting effects .
But in some people , they can last a long time and lead to problems such as poor nutrition , tiredness , and reduced appetite .
Alternative terms for " hiccough " and " hiccups " include : " hickup " and " singultus " .

Tan insólita como absurda .
Así es la historia de Javier Quintero , un vecino de Recoleta que dejaba el auto en la calle , como muchos otros porteños , y ahora debe pagarle más de $ 2.200 a la empresa STO , que se encarga del estacionamiento medido y el acarreo con grúas , para volver a utilizarlo .
Es que el vehículo fue levantado por una grúa a mediados de diciembre en Beruti entre Laprida y Agüero , durante el período de prueba de los parquímetros , y ahora descansa en el playón que está frente a la Facultad de Derecho .
" El auto casi no lo usaba y estaba estacionado a metros de mi casa , pero me mudé para reducir gastos y luego me fui de vacaciones .
Cuando volví me enteré que en esa cuadra habían instalado parquímetros y que se lo habían llevado .
Fui a preguntar y ya debía unos $ 700 .
En ese momento no lo podía pagar y se empezó a acumular la deuda " , cuenta Quintero ( 43 ) a metros de su auto , un modesto Fiat Vivace 1995 .
La deuda incluye los $ 190 del acarreo más $ 26 diarios de la estadía en el playón de STO .
Al día de ayer ya superaba los $ 2.200 .
Y si la situación se mantiene , a fin de año podría se mayor incluso que el valor de mercado del vehículo , que ronda los 12 mil pesos .
Quintero dice que la deuda es un abuso .
" Me cobran $ 26 por día y el estacionamiento que funciona ahí mismo tiene una tarifa de $ 10 la media estadía " , se queja .
Una posible solución a su problema sería vender el auto , pero no puede porque comparte la titularidad junto a su ex mujer , que fue declarada insana por la Justicia .
" Lo tienen que autorizar el juez o la curadora " , explica , totalmente desanimado .
Por el mismo motivo , debe cargar con los gastos de la casa que compartía con su ex esposa .
El caso es único por cómo se dieron los hechos y despierta polémica por la legalidad de la deuda , a la que hay sumarle el costo de la multa .
Aunque es discutible , lo cierto es que hubo una infracción al momento del acarreo .
Como atenuante se podría decir que el sistema de parquímetros se levantó en Recoleta , al igual que en otros barrios , luego de un " período de prueba " de 90 días .
Por ese motivo , una asociación vecinal presentó un proyecto de ley en la Legislatura que busca condonar las multas labradas en ese período .
Ya hubo una reunión en la comisión de Transporte y los vecinos se entusiasman con la esperanza de una pronta aprobación .
Además , la Defensoría del Pueblo recomendó esta semana que se dejen sin efecto las multas .
Sin embargo , lograr un voto favorable de los legisladores no sería tan sencillo .
Es que Mauricio Macri , ya dijo públicamente que las multas se deben pagar y cuenta con la primera mayoría ( 26 legisladores ) en el recinto .
FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
Unless you 've been hiding under a rock , you have been bombarded with news coverage of the swine flu for several days now .
And when the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert to the second highest level - of 5 - yesterday , the media could n't get enough of it .
After all , this stuff sells newspapers and gets ratings .
But when you take a look at the numbers , it seems like the story might be overblown ...
The WHO has confirmed 257 cases of swine flu worldwide .
97 cases in Mexico , with seven deaths .
Mexican officials have reported much higher numbers - 2,500 cases and more than 150 deaths - but those numbers have n't been confirmed .
In the U.S. , the WHO says there are 109 confirmed cases with 1 death .
Out of a population of more than 300 million people , that hardly seems to be cause for alarm .
And scientists who are studying the virus say this strain of influenza does n't look as deadly as strains that have caused previous pandemics .
In fact , some suggest that the current form of the swine flu virus may not even do as much damage as the regular flu .
More than 13,000 people in the U.S. have died of complications from seasonal flu since January ; and it's expected to continue killing hundreds of people a week .
In total , about 36,000 people a year die from the flu in this country ; and worldwide , the annual death toll is somewhere between 250,000 and 500,000 .
One scientist tells the Los Angeles Times that just because the swine flu is being identified in more countries does n't mean it 's spreading especially quickly , saying : " You do n't ever find anything that you do n't look for . "
Here ’s my question to you :
Has the swine flu story been overblown ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Doug from Dallas writes :
Wow , that 's an understatement !
This is nothing more than a new strain of the flu that comes every year .
It is n't any more contagious than regular flu .
We do n't hear anything about the 36,000 people who die every year from the " normal " flu so what 's the big deal ?
If school systems shut down every time a kid got sick ( ie. Ft. Worth ) , they 'd never be open .
Danny writes :
Are you kidding me ?!
Hell yes , it is being overblown .
This has to be the rhetorical question of the century .
Richard from Orrtanna , Pennsylvania writes :
Hi Jack .
As it stands now , yes .
But , if it were to become a killer virus , then the answer is no .
You may be asking this question too early ; you may have to ask it again next winter .
Carrie from Seattle writes :
It 's been completely overblown .
I 'm ready for it to stop , now .
How about everyone learn to properly wash their hands , cover their mouths when they cough , etc. and we can tackle all the different flu bugs at once without mass hysteria .
It 's ridiculous .
Terence from Piscataway , New Jersey writes :
Jack ,
It ’s not overblown at all .
When a member of our family catches this disease , we will all know what to do to get well and not spread it around .
This is what makes our country so great .
We are well - informed about everything through the media and you , Jack .
Courtney from Connecticut writes :
Overblown or not , I 'm tired of hearing about it .
I was initially concerned ( my brother is getting married in Mexico in July ! ) and then frustrated .
Now I just want everyone , especially the hypochondriac in my office , to take a step back for five minutes and chill .
The sky is not falling , folks !
Mr Zuma is hugely popular with the ANC party faithful
By Farouk Chothia
BBC News
South Africa 's first democratically elected president , Nelson Mandela , promoted a " Rainbow Nation " ; his successor Thabo Mbeki an " African Renaissance " ; so what will be the overarching vision of a Jacob Zuma presidency ?
He has not yet outlined one , but the initial signs are that Mr Zuma will promote a new conservatism in South Africa , digging deep into the nation 's cultural and religious roots and threatening Western - styled liberal values enshrined in the constitution .
Mr Zuma 's supporters showed these traits throughout his long and bitterly fought presidential campaign , offering prayers to ancestors , denouncing same - sex marriage as a " disgrace to God " , promising a referendum on the death penalty , condemning political rivals as " witches " and " snakes " , and defending polygamy as " African " .
Of all the white groups in South Africa , it is only the Afrikaners that are truly South African
Jacob Zuma For Mr Zuma 's critics , he has mixed a deadly cocktail of religion , politics and ethnicity to quench his thirst for power .
" The genie is out .
He wo n't be able to put it back , " one critic said .
" Mbeki declared this to be the African century , but we now risk going backwards . "
Without singling out anyone for criticism , a stalwart of the governing African National Congress ( ANC ) , Zola Skweyiya , expressed a similar concern in the run-up to the party 's conference in 2007 .
" The demon of tribalism is rising from every corner and we ignore it at our peril , " Mr Skweyiya wrote in Johannesburg 's Mail & Guardian newspaper .
" We thought we would not go through what the rest of Africa has gone through , but we are just another African country .
There is nothing special about us . "
Not ' power - obsessed '
Mr Zuma 's supporters believed that a clique from Mr Mbeki's Xhosa ethnic group was determined to hang on to power and block him from becoming the first Zulu to lead South Africa .
Some believe Mr Zuma will take after Nelson Mandela Now , Mr Mbeki 's allies fear that they will be purged from key state institutions as a " Zulu Mafia " takes power .
But Johannesburg - based political analyst Sipho Seepe dismisses those fears .
" Zuma is not obsessed with power .
He is surrounded by people from different ethnic groups , and they are leaders in their own right , " he says .
" Just look at the ANC Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe or the Treasurer General Mathews Phosa .
They are not Zulus . "
But there is no doubt that ethnicity is creeping into South African politics .
A pro-Mbeki faction denounced what they called the tribalism of Mr Zuma and launched a new party , the Congress of the People ( Cope ) , to contest the election .
But Cope was soon hit by ethnic tensions of its own , with a Xhosa faction accused of orchestrating the appointment of one of their own , Bishop Mvume Dandala , as presidential candidate ahead of the Sotho - speaking party leader Mosiuoa Lekota .
Senior Cope member Mlungisi Hlongwane , who rejoined the ANC , said : " It became abundantly clear to me that the selection of the presidential candidate was a well - orchestrated tribal plan . "
Just like Mbeki ?
The rise in tribalism comes at a time when South Africa has been hit by xenophobic violence , and continues to be affected by racial tensions .
More recently , Mr Skweyiya said : " I feel strongly that we have not solved the national question - not just between whites and blacks but among ourselves as Africans .
I know this is not a popular view but it's a fact . "
Zuma is comfortable with his identity , and he has an instinctive connection with the masses - that is why he outsmarted Mbeki
Sipho Seepe
Political analyst
On the campaign trail , Mr Zuma caused dismay in some quarters when he seemed to doubt the patriotism of English - speaking whites .
" Of all the white groups in South Africa , it is only the Afrikaners that are truly South African , " he said .
For Justice Malala , a columnist with the Johannesburg Sunday Times newspaper , Mr Zuma has shown the traits of his predecessor .
" This is exactly the sort of divide - and - rule tactic used by Mbeki to alienate some sections of the country , " he said .
" It implies that there is a hierarchy of South Africanness : that some among us are more patriotic , more African , more deserving , than others . "
But political analyst Mr Seepe argues that Mr Zuma 's presidency will be similar to Mr Mandela's .
" There is no need for fear - mongering ; to create the notion that a Zuma presidency will mean the end of civilisation .
If you look at his speeches , he promotes nation - building ; a rainbow nation , " he said .
' Good listener '
Mr Seepe argues that South Africans of all racial and ethnic groups will find it easier to deal with Mr Zuma .
" Mbeki had an identity crisis .
He lived in Europe [ as a political exile ] and he felt he had to say that he was an African and he had to show that he was fighting racism , " says Mr Seepe .
" Zuma is comfortable with his identity , and he has an instinctive connection with the masses - that is why he outsmarted Mbeki , who has a Masters degree from Sussex . "
In Mr Seepe 's view , Mr Zuma will strive to be a " caring president for a caring nation " .
" He will improve the lives of the ' great unwashed ' ; those whom the upper - classes look down upon , " Mr Seepe says .
Mr Zuma also won the endorsement of senior ANC member and businessman Cyril Ramaphosa , who authored South Africa 's democratic constitution and who was outmanoeuvred by Mr Mbeki in the battle to succeed Mr Mandela .
In an interview with Johannesburg 's Sunday Times newspaper , Mr Ramaphosa said : " He [ Zuma ] is a team player .
You are not going to see him go off on a limb .
I see him more in a Mandela mode . "
Mr Seepe says Mr Zuma will not display the perceived arrogance of his predecessor .
" He knows he 's not educated , so he 's a good listener , " he says .

people sometimes ask me why I dislike Microsoft .
The answer is simple : I do n’t —
I ’ve just been disappointed with much of what it has done in the past decade .
This disappointment stems from the 1990s , when I was a big fan of many Microsoft products ( and incidentally , could not stand Apple products ) .
But over the past ten years , I ’ve slowly transitioned away from almost everything made by the company .
It ’s not what I set out to do , it ’s just happened that way because better products have come along — products not made by Microsoft .
And it ’s frustrating , because with billions of dollars spent each year in research and development , it ’s not like the company does n’t have the means to innovate and make great products .
So what does it lack ?
The vision ?
Well , if the video below is any indication , no .
This video is a clip from presentation given yesterday by Microsoft ’s Business Division president Stephen Elop at the Wharton Business Technology Conference .
It shows what Microsoft thinks the world may look like in a decade from now , in 2019 .
While obviously , all of the products in this video are very much concepts , they show a Microsoft that seems to have a vision for the next decade .
Carrying out that vision will be a whole other matter , of course , and so Microsoft needs to focus .
And it quickly needs to realize that focus does n’t include wasting huge amounts of time and money on fights it will never win .
Fights like the ones it ’s bogged down in with Google for Internet search and advertising , and with Apple in portable media players .
Products like its Surface computer show that Microsoft has the potential fulfill the promises made by the video above .
And if it does that , I ’ll have no problem once again using Microsoft products in my life .
I ’ve said it about Apple before , and the same applies to Microsoft : it ’s not about the company , it ’s about the product .--------------------------------------------------------If you like this post please Bookmark it and comment bellow .

The Poor Body
Take a look at photos of your average poor American from the 1930s and now .
What ’s different ?
The size of people .
Throughout time , obesity has not been the problem it is today .
And no clearer example of that can be seen than when looking at what it has historically meant to be poor .
Until the advent of corn syrup and fast food and vending machines , being poor and being too skinny were synonymous .
No longer .
For the first time in human history , poor people are fat .
No Rubenesque beauties grace the cover of Vogue .
Our supermodels and actresses are startlingly thin ( The stunning Marilyn Monroe would be “ full figured ” by today ’s standards ) .
Thin is in .
Gym memberships , chic yoga mats with designer totes , personal trainers , and expensive gourmet diets rich in brie and red wine are all glossy symbols of prestige and wealth .
A voluptuous wife is no longer a status symbol for a well - to - do man ; indeed , extra heft immediately implies poverty and lower class standing .
Thin is rich .
( It ’s almost humorous , except the health implications quickly dampen that comedic irony . )
Thin is generally healthier than obese , but not necessarily .
A person who is “ skinny fat ” – looking slender but suffering internally from inflammation , heart disease , or too much body fat – is worse off than a person who follows a healthy diet and gets regular exercise but happens to naturally be built a bit thicker .
Still , authorities are concerned about the burgeoning rates of obese poor Americans .
There are a few theories , some politically incorrect and some rather distasteful , in my opinion ( guess which ) :
– The poor people are stupid argument : poor people are busy working or doing poor people things and do n’t have access to the internet , health care , or other means of education regarding health and nutrition .
– The poor people are being kept in their place by The Man argument : junk food companies and lobbyists and the government are happy to fatten those poor people up to keep them in their place .
Addicted , unhealthy , overweight people are easier to control .
– The poor people are fat because it takes lots of empty calories to get adequate nutrients argument .
By far the most reasonable , in my opinion .
Poor neighborhoods are notorious for being replete with junk food convenience stores and fast food joints instead of grocery stores selling fresh produce or farmer ’s markets proffering affordable fresh fare .
Hunger is complicated , as this article discusses .
It ’s a fascinating survey , so please be sure to read it .
In short , it ’s not just about getting enough calories to feel “ full ” .
It ’s also about getting enough nutrients .
A jumbo candy bar with a huge soda and a bag of chips may be “ filling ” , but you ’ll need to eat ramen noodles or a burger afterwards to get a decent amount of protein , vitamins , and minerals .
Cheap food is what poor people can afford , but unfortunately it takes a lot more cheap food to meet minimum bodily requirements .
Of course , one can eat cheaply and healthily – for example , fresh veggies and beans are quite inexpensive – which brings us back to the distasteful Poor People Are Ignorant argument .
Why are the poor so fat ?
And what is the solution ?

A few weeks ago , in a large business hotel in Washington DC , a crowd of around 80 people had congregated outside one of the ballrooms when the double doors opened and a bald man in jeans and a lumberjack shirt backed out into the hallway .
He was bent almost in half , wedging the doors open .
" We 're almost ready to begin ! " he called out .
The crowd , who were waiting for a panel discussion on the future of the American right , entitled Conservatism 2.0 , paid only partial attention : the organisers had just started distributing sandwiches and cans of Coke , which interested them more .
Then the man stood up , and brushed off his hands on his jeans .
He smelled strongly of aftershave .
" Oh. My. God , " someone said quietly .
Slowly at first , then faster , the realisation began to spread through the crowd that the bald man in the lumberjack shirt was Joe the Plumber .
Within seconds he'd been mobbed .
The panel discussion was part of the 2009 Conservative Political Action Conference , or CPAC , an annual gathering of rightwing activists , and soon news of Joe 's arrival had filtered down the corridors to more of the 8,500 delegates .
Young women bounded up with mobile phones , demanding photos .
Young men in bow ties - there were a lot of young men in bow ties - thrust their hands forward .
Joe posed obligingly for every photo , shook every hand .
" Oh , man , this is going to be my Facebook profile picture , " one woman said to a friend .
" You can fix my pipes anytime , Joe ! " an older man yelled .
Joe smiled , pretending to find the remark ingeniously amusing .
True , he may not really be called Joe , and he may not really be a plumber , due to a few questions regarding his licence , and he may have come to symbolise the cheap populism and anti-intellectual rabble - rousing that helped lose John McCain the 2008 presidential election .
But let it be stated for the record that Joe the Plumber is an incredibly patient man .
The clamour around him , though , was only one example of a strange jubilation I kept encountering at CPAC .
Less than four months earlier , Barack Obama had won the election on a decidedly liberal platform ; one month earlier , he'd been sworn in as president , and swiftly reversed several key Bush administration policies .
Sarah Palin had returned to Alaska ; McCain was lying low ; media commentators were declaring the death of conservatism , and years of exile for the Republicans .
Yet inside the Omni Shoreham hotel , America 's conservative activists were in a state of frenetic excitement .
Perhaps it was nostalgia for the campaign just past , or the thrill of being surrounded by like - minded people , but nobody seemed remotely depressed .
Turning one corner , you 'd find a group of student campaigners distributing Palin 2012 stickers and enormous full - colour posters of the Alaska governor ; turning another , you 'd find a crowd of thousands in the main arena cheering as John Bolton , the neoconservative , predicted Obama would be a one - term president , or going wild as Rush Limbaugh declared , " I want Obama to fail ! "
In one room , the National Rifle Association was holding a raffle - imagine an English church fair , except with full - colour posters of semi-automatic weapons - while in another the Dutch politician Geert Wilders , recently banned from the UK because of an anti-Islam film he'd made , greeted an adulatory crowd .
Stopping at a water cooler , I almost collided with the blogger Pam Atlas , who led the campaign to prove Obama had forged his birth certificate .
She was delightedly hugging the author Jerome Corsi , whose book The Obama Nation , a hostile , error - filled attack on the Democratic candidate , had prompted a 40 - page rebuttal from the Obama campaign .
It was hard not to see the merriment as taking place in a looking - glass world .
Obama 's victory had been not just decisive , but transformative , with dire consequences for the rightwing : the coalition of voters carefully assembled by Karl Rove - low - tax fiscal conservatives , the religious right and the tough - on - crime , anti-immigrant , law - and - order types - had been blown apart .
Twenty per cent of self - described conservatives had voted for Obama , as had a quarter of evangelicals ; according to some analyses , a majority of the electorate had considered Obama , not McCain , the low - tax candidate .
Democratic canvassers reported incidents of racist voters - a reliably rightwing demographic if ever there was one - announcing their intention to vote for Obama because he was the more competent candidate , even though in the same breath they 'd sometimes call him a nigger .
The Republican party was in " a world of pain " , the centrist Republican columnist David Brooks argued shortly after Obama 's victory .
" It 's just a circular firing squad , with everybody attacking each other and no coherent belief system , no leaders .
You 've got half the party waiting for Sarah Palin to come rescue them .
The other half waiting for Bobby Jindal , the Louisiana governor , to come rescue them .
But no set of beliefs .
Really a decayed conservative infrastructure . "
In the wake of defeat , neither self - criticism nor introspection seemed to be on the agenda at CPAC .
Virtually the only negative emotion I encountered came from Joe the Plumber .
Plucked from obscurity after being filmed asking Obama a question about small business taxes , he 'd recently co-written a book , Joe The Plumber : Fighting For The American Dream , and had been dispatched to Israel as a war correspondent for the conservative website Pajamas Media .
But when , after the panel discussion , I asked if he was having fun , he thought for several seconds , then replied , " No. I 'm really not . "
Not at all ?
" No , man , no .
I look upon this as a responsibility .
It 's something I gotta do : try to change things , make a difference .
But , to be quite honest , I wish it had never happened . "
He looked out over the milling delegates , and sighed .
" I never asked for any of this , " he said .
A man with a clipboard approached , snapping Joe out of his reverie .
" Fox News is ready for you now , " he said .
Joe the Plumber extended his hand towards me .
" OK , brother , nice to meet you , " he said , then ambled obligingly off .
What does it mean to call yourself a conservative in America , or anywhere , in 2009 ?
The word , in its oldest sense , evokes a respect for tradition , a suspicion of radicalism and a preference for gradual , organic change by individuals rather than sweeping government projects .
Yet the Republicans lost in 2008 after eight years of rule by radicals , whose conservative ideology included the grandest of government projects - reshaping the Middle East by force - along with a historically unprecedented centralisation of power .
Very unconservatively , Bush implemented the largest expansion of health benefits in US history , then authorised the first multibillion - dollar bailout of Wall Street .
To be sure , many people at CPAC , like conservatives I met elsewhere , felt betrayed by Bush .
( " Karl Rove should crawl back to Texas , curl up beside a cactus and contemplate the ruin he has inflicted on the party , " a panellist told delegates . )
But they , too , had radical plans : to overthrow the legality of abortion , to close down America 's borders , to leave the UN , to impose a flat tax , to overturn the consensus on global warming .
And nobody could agree on who the " real " rightwingers were .
Moderate Republicans blamed Palin 's shrill attacks on " elitists " for destroying McCain 's credibility ; for those on the right of the party , choosing her was the only truly appealing thing the alarmingly liberal McCain ever did .
In British politics , the solution to such a muddle might be for a fresh - faced leader - a Blair or a Cameron - to take on his own party , forcing reform on the infighting members .
But it 's far harder for such a leader to emerge in the US if your party does n't control the White House , harder still if you 're a minority in Congress .
" In Britain , political change is always imposed from the top down - half a dozen people who have houses next door to each other in London come to an understanding , win a contest and impose their vision on the party , " says the former Bush speech - writer David Frum .
" In America , change tends to come from the middle up - from the activists . "
And the problem with activists is that they tend to prefer passionate commitment to pragmatism .
" I call them say - it - louder conservatives , " says Frum , in a coffee shop around the corner from the American Enterprise Institute , a neoconservative thinktank where he now has an office .
" If people do n't like what you 're saying , say it louder !
Then they 'll like it ! "
It 's odd that Frum has emerged as a figurehead of the moderate reformers - those calling for the American right to abandon its extremes and accept that issues from global warming to the financial crisis require a new approach .
In Europe , he 's probably best known as the person who coined the phrase " axis of evil " ( though his version was " axis of hatred " ) .
He co-authored a book with Richard Perle defending the Iraq war , and a book in praise of Bush , The Right Man .
But now he says US conservatism has suffered a " psychic defeat " - a disease of which the Palin - worship at CPAC was a symptom .
" One of the stages in the decline of a political movement is the moment when it comes to feel beaten .
And in that moment it becomes reactionary , because there 's a sense that to engage with the modern world in any way is to give up your beliefs . "
A big part of the problem , Frum argues , is precisely that American conservatism was so successful .
From this perspective , the popular revolution spearheaded by Ronald Reagan identified real problems - crime and chaos in American cities , rampant inflation , industries held hostage by unions - and implemented tough solutions , which worked .
" The things we promised to do , we did . "
Government shrank ; taxes were cut ; worker protections were reduced : the free market , in short , was given a freer hand .
Today 's conservative activists were in their 20s then , excited by the sense of change .
" But now 30 years have passed , and we 're 30 years older , and what happens to the mind as it approaches 50 is it tends to become more rigid , more reluctant to absorb new impressions .
We need to understand that the country has new problems , which require new solutions . "
Cutting taxes , for example , might have been the right thing to do in 1980 - but if you keep on blindly cutting taxes , as if always cutting taxes were a keystone of conservatism , you 'll reach a point where people think taxes are low enough ; they do n't want to lose the services the taxes pay for .
" It 's calcification , " Frum says .
" Our problem is we make principles of our policies .
Limited government is a principle .
The idea that income tax rates must always be cut , no matter what they are ?
That 's not a principle . "
Frum 's plan , outlined in his book Comeback : Conservatism That Can Win Again , calls for the Republican party to emphasise healthcare reform over tax cuts , to develop an environmental message , tone down the pro-life , anti-gay marriage rhetoric , and focus on the factor that drew so many conservatives away from McCain / Palin and towards Obama : not political ideology , but the sheer question of competence .
It goes without saying that this message does n't go down well with many activists - especially as it comes from one of the pro-war neocons , whom they blame for Bush 's slide into unpopularity .
Tax cuts work , goes their counter - argument , whereas " conservative environmentalism " is just an untested idea .
Commentators such as Frum , one prominent rightwing activist told me in disgust , " have never elected a dog - catcher , but they 've got theories about how the rest of [ us ] should spend [ our ] resources and time and energy ...
They should be resigned to the fact that those of us who actually work all day will be making the decisions . "
He chuckled derisively .
" There is no problem in America that requires more state power , more taxes , or more control over your life . "
In North Carolina ( which went for Obama although the state had n't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter ) , I meet Jeff Katz , until recently a flagship rightwing radio host , who blames Republicans ' naivety with the internet for their election defeat .
" People got lazy , " he says .
" And the party , not just here , was not really tied in to the way that modern campaigns had to be conducted . "
It was an argument I kept hearing .
At the Conservatism 2.0 event , there was a palpable sense of resentment - as if the web , with its free market spirit , ought rightfully to have been the preserve of the right .
In the days and weeks following CPAC , the divisions on the US right became only more pronounced .
The centrepiece was a public spat between conservative commentator and radio host Rush Limbaugh and the new chair of the Republican National Committee , Michael Steele , whose efforts to emulate the Obama campaign 's path - breaking tactics had a cringeworthy , your - dad - at - a - disco quality .
( What the party needed , he argued , was to apply its timeless conservative principles in " urban - suburban hip - hop settings " . )
Steele , radically for a Republican , called abortion " an individual choice " ; he dismissed Limbaugh as an " entertainer " , before recanting .
White House operatives actively encouraged the perception that the divisive Limbaugh , with his 13 m weekly listeners , was the unofficial leader of the party , too powerful for the official leaders to ignore .
As Democrats pressed ahead with Obama 's stimulus plans , and his $ 3.5 trillion budget , Republicans flailed .
Instead of calling for more modest expenditure , they proposed a spending freeze , attracting derision from economists .
And they played Obama 's stimulus for laughs , mocking , for example - in a speech by Jindal - an expenditure of $ 140 m on volcano monitoring .
( A month later , Alaska 's Mount Redoubt erupted . )
" The political philosophy of the GOP [ Grand Old Party ] right now seems to consist of snickering at stuff they think sounds funny , " wrote Nobel prize - winning economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman .
" The party of ideas has become the party of Beavis and Butt - head . "
It is far too early to tell which of the competing visions for the Republican party will prevail .
Much hangs on the success or failures of the Obama administration , and on the available choices to lead the party : to the horror of many moderates , Palin does seem to be in with a chance .
But there 's plenty of time for support to congeal round a less incendiary alternative : Jindal , an Indian American , to the right on all the key issues , whose early forays into national politics have been awkward but who might offer an Obama - esque mix of youth , competence and ethnic diversity ; Mitt Romney , beaten to Republican nomination for president by McCain in 2008 ; stimulus - hating South Carolina governor Mark Sanford ; or generally moderate Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty .
Such questions determine the future of a party that can no longer rely on the coalition constructed by Rove , playing off the conservative base against middle - ground votes .
What seems inevitable , though - and what even some of the reformists accept - is that the hardliners will dominate the party for the immediate future .
Within days of the election defeat , you could see them moving into position .
Key figures gathered in Virginia at the home of Brent Bozell III , founder of the Media Research Centre , a fierce opponent of abortion , " indecency " and the alleged distortions of the godless liberal media .
( The MRC coordinated the protest at Janet Jackson 's 2004 Super Bowl " wardrobe malfunction " . )
The meeting reached the conclusions you might have expected , given the attendees : that the defeat was n't the movement 's fault but McCain's , and it showed that , deep down , America was conservative .
Bozell is 53 , bearded , jovial and rambunctious ; he despises the American liberal media , but says he 's happy to talk to journalists from leftwing British publications because they do n't pretend to be neutral .
His headquarters is filled with banks of televisions and dominated by vast group oil paintings of rightwing media heroes : Limbaugh , Rupert Murdoch and someone who appears to be the online gossip - monger Matt Drudge .
Bozell 's argument is simple : America is conservative , but McCain was n't ; when it came to the economy , the public saw Obama as the careful , conservative candidate .
( Polls do provide modest support for this thesis . )
" We conservatives did n't play a role in this presidential campaign , " Bozell says .
" This was the most liberal Democrat in the Senate , versus the most liberal Republican running this year . "
Like the delegates at CPAC , he does n't seem troubled by the outcome .
On the contrary , he believes the 2008 election destroyed the credibility of McCain - style centrism , opening the gates for a resurgence of hardcore conservatism .
" The Republicans have surrendered their brand .
They 're in serious , serious trouble . "
He swings his feet up on to a coffee table and leans back with his hands behind his head .
" Conservatives can come away with great relief , and great optimism , that the American people are still on their side .
There was this terrible butchery of the Republican party , and a terrible candidate , with a terrible message - versus something that came out of central casting for the Democrats !
I mean , could you come up with someone better than a half - black , half - white person who sounds like Shakespeare and can convince the American public he believes what you believe in , no matter what you believe in ? "
Find a more telegenic candidate , a Palin or Romney , say , with a crystal - clear conservative message , to run in 2012 against a tired Obama , his honeymoon long over , and the next election is there for the winning .
The idea that the right should become more moderate , more accepting of a bigger government role in , say , healthcare and the economy , Bozell argues , is " foolish .
I mean , what the hell is that ?
It 's called liberalism !
What else do you liberals care about ?
You believe government can do great things for the public !
So when a conservative says it , how is that conservative ?
It 's liberal !
Fine , but do n't call yourself a conservative !
You might be a Rastafarian , for all I know , but you 're not a conservative ! "
The radical anti-tax campaigner Grover Norquist , another attendee at Bozell 's summit , argues that what reformers forget is that voters will tell pollsters they support things - like an expanded role for government in healthcare - then backtrack speedily if asked to pay for them .
In Norquist 's view , American politics consists of two coalitions .
One side , on the left , wants " to take things from people and give it to themselves " .
The other , on the right , may seem like a motley collection of gun-owners , home - schoolers , libertarians , religious devotees and anti-tax activists , but have one thing in common : " They want to be left alone . "
It is intriguing to speculate what effect Obama 's economic rescue package may have on the leave - us - aloners .
If it works , might they come to recognise the value of greater government activity ?
If it fails , will their numbers grow , as more Americans reject the notion of paying more in taxes to shore up the economy ?
( There were early signs of such resentment in the ecstatic response to a rant delivered by the CNBC journalist Rick Santelli , in which he attacked the idea of helping those unable to pay their mortgages , calling them " losers " who did n't deserve to be supported by those who'd managed their money better . )
The sense I found hard to shake at CPAC , though , was that most of those present were n't particularly interested in the story of economic catastrophe unfolding in the media and in hundreds of thousands of households .
True , there were plenty of attacks on Obama 's " European - style socialism " .
But mainly people were busy with their specialist interests : promoting the organisation Parents And Friends Of Ex-Gays , or Youth For Western Civilisation , fighting to eliminate the scourge of political correctness on America 's university campuses , laughing at " global warmists " , or cheering Wayne LaPierre , executive vice president of the National Rifle Association : " Our founding fathers understood that the guys with the guns make the rules ! "
Delegates wore NOBAMA T - shirts and shopped at stalls selling Obama Waffles .
They were enjoying themselves , hunkering down together , declaring their difference from the grudging consensus that was coalescing , just down the road on Capitol Hill , behind Obama 's vision for America .
I ran into Joe the Plumber one more time , at a book signing at the same moment that actor Stephen Baldwin , the rightwing brother of Alec , Daniel and William , strolled across to greet him .
The two burly men shared an awkward hug .
" I 've been prayin ' for ya ! " Baldwin told Joe .
Joe looked bemused .
" What are you doing here ? "
" I 'm trying to get the conservative thing to be a little hipper here , " Baldwin responded .
He gestured to indicate the room , the conference , perhaps the conservative movement as a whole .
" Because you guys could do with some help . "
D is a relatively new language that , like ObjectiveC , tries to address some of the more serious problems in C ++.
From our interview with Cristian Vlasceanu ,
In many ways D encourages the " right " behavior .
For example , in C and C++ , if you write " int i ; " the variable is uninitialized .
To do the " right thing " , the programmer needs to type extra keystrokes as in " int i = 0 ; " but D works the other way around : " int i ; " safely sets the variable to a default value ( that in this case is zero ) .
To make it uninitialized you have to spend extra effort and type " int i = void ; " expressing that the uninitialized variable is intentional and not due to laziness .
D.NET is an experimental port of the D language to the Common Language Runtime .
It consists of two parts , a front - end and a back - end component .
The front - end component handles the parsing of source code and the generation of abstract syntax trees .
The back - end compiler takes that and generates the actual machine code , or in this case IL code .
While the source for both are available on CodePlex , only the back - end is maintained there .
The front - end component is straight out of the D 2.0 Programming Language Compiler .
A word of caution ,
Scientists at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) have created lip - reading computers that can distinguish between different languages .
Computers that can read lips are already in development but this is the first time they have been ' taught ' to recognise different languages .
The discovery could have practical uses for deaf people , for law enforcement agencies , and in noisy environments .
Led by Stephen Cox and Jake Newman of UEA 's School of Computing Sciences , the groundbreaking research will be presented at a major conference in Taiwan on Wednesday April 22 .
The technology was developed by statistical modelling of the lip motions made by a group of 23 bilingual and trilingual speakers .
The system was able to identify which language was spoken by an individual speaker with very high accuracy .
These languages included English , French , German , Arabic , Mandarin , Cantonese , Italian , Polish and Russian .
" This is an exciting advance in automatic lip - reading technology and the first scientific confirmation of something we already intuitively suspected -¬ that when people speak different languages , they use different mouth shapes in different sequences , " said Prof Cox .
" For example , we found frequent ' lip - rounding ' among French speakers and more prominent tongue movements among Arabic speakers . "
Funded by the EPSRC , the research is part of a wider UEA project on automatic lip-reading .
The next step will be to make the system more robust to an individual 's physiology and his or her way of speaking .
An investigation is underway after Vancouver Police shot and killed a man outside a downtown office building Friday morning .
The incident started at about 10:30 a.m. Friday , when police got a call about two men breaking into cars on Granville Street .
A few blocks away , at Homer St. near Dunsmuir St. , they caught up with two men who they believed were the suspects .
Two officers approached , with guns drawn .
The man who was shot had an X - acto knife , which he waved at the officers .
Vancouver Police Const .
Jana McGuinness said the man did not comply with orders to drop the knife .
More than 50 people witnessed the shooting .
Some say there was no need for police to pull the trigger .
" This is not fair what the police do , " said Luis Zamor , who witnessed the scene .
" Police are supposed to come out and arrest the guy , stop the guy , but he just come straight out and shoot the guy . "
Vancouver Police Chief Jim
Chu is promising a fair investigation into his officer 's conduct , by bringing in another police force to lead it .
Even though Abbotsford Police is headed by a former Vancouver police veteran , Chu says he does n't believe it 's a conflict .
" In this case , it was available to do it and they are one of the larger police agencies , '' Chu said .
The Vancouver Police will investigate the actual crime scene and a coroner will do its own probe .
The officer who fired the shot has five years experience .
As for the victim , police say he appears to be in his 50s .
They have n't been able to identify him yet .
With a report by CTV British Columbia 's Renu Bakshi
Not long ago , in the clinic , a fellow pediatrician and mother asked whether we were still teaching our sons old - fashioned elevator etiquette : stand back and let the ladies off first .
We all protested that we do n’t particularly like it when men pull that elevator stunt  hospital elevators tend to be packed , and the best thing to do if you ’re near the door is get out promptly  but we had to admit we thought our adolescent sons should know the drill .
Once you start asking about whether there are special lessons that should be taught to boys , people jump pretty quickly from elevators to sex ( or maybe that ’s just the crowd I run with ) .
Sex , after all , is a subject on which pediatricians give plenty of advice .
And it becomes very tricky to formulate that advice without making some unpleasant assumptions about adolescent sexuality .
It has never been easy for adults to deal with young teenagers honestly and sensibly on this subject , and it is n’t easy now .
We live with an endless parade of hypersexualized images  and a constant soundtrack of adults lamenting children ’s exposure to that endless parade .
There ’s increasing knowledge of dating violence , including well - publicized celebrity incidents .
And there ’s always a new movie to see about how adolescent boys are clueless , sex - obsessed goofballs .
Pat Bowlen is fed up .
And as Broncoland has come to understand during this tumultuous offseason , when Pat Bowlen has had it , people pay with their jobs .
The most important of people .
Jay Cutler , the Broncos ’ star quarterback , is all but gone .
Frustrated at what he perceives as Cutler ’s unwillingness to communicate , Bowlen announced Tuesday that he has given his front office permission to begin the process of working on trading Cutler .
“ Numerous attempts to contact Jay Cutler in the last 10 days , both by head coach Josh McDaniels and myself , have been unsuccessful , ” Bowlen said in a statement .
“ A conversation with his agent earlier today clearly communicated and confirmed to us that Jay no longer has any desire to play for the Denver Broncos .
We will begin discussions with other teams in an effort to accommodate his request to be traded . ”
This is no April Fool ’s joke .
Bowlen was referring to a conversation Tuesday morning between Bus Cook , Cutler ’s agent , and Broncos general manager Brian Xanders .
According to a source close to Cutler , Xanders told Cook he had better get in touch with his client because Bowlen wanted to speak to his quarterback .
By Tuesday evening , Bowlen had reached his breaking point .
Thus , Bowlen , in the 25th anniversary of owning the club , has dismissed iconic head coach Mike Shanahan and is about to dump his franchise quarterback in the same offseason .
Shanahan , who had been the Broncos ’ coach the previous 14 seasons , was fired Dec. 30 and replaced 12 days later by McDaniels .
Here ’s a twist — while Bowlen was declaring the end of the Cutler era , Shanahan sank a hole - in - one , according to his former attorney Harvey Steinberg .
Shanahan got his first hole - in - one soon after getting fired by the Oakland Raiders in 1989 .
Cutler had heard about Bowlen ’s statement Tuesday but said by text message , “ I ’m not talking about it . ”
A source close to Cutler said the quarterback was surprised by Bowlen ’s declaration .
In recent days , Cutler had packed up his car in Nashville and had it shipped to Denver , where he intended to show up for the team ’s first minicamp April 17 - 19 .
The source added that Cutler said he has not received phone calls from the Broncos since he received a text from McDaniels a week ago Tuesday .
Whatever the interpretation , Bowlen decided to exercise his ownership powers and end all confusion .
He ’s the boss , and he says the team will trade Cutler .
The Washington Redskins are among the leading candidates to pull off a deal for Cutler .
The Redskins have a proven young quarterback in Jason Campbell and would meet the Broncos ’ preference of dealing Cutler outside their American Football Conference .
The Redskins also have the No. 13 selection in this year ’s draft on April 25 , one spot behind the Broncos .
The New York Jets also have been aggressive in their pursuit of Cutler .
The Jets , who have extra picks in the third and fourth rounds , are better stocked for the upcoming draft than the Redskins , who do n’t have picks in the second and fourth round .
Four other National Football Conference teams — Tampa Bay , Chicago , Minnesota and Detroit — have previously expressed interest in Cutler .
Suddenly , a situation that was both unthinkable and inevitable is about to occur .
Unthinkable because Cutler is only 25 years old and was voted to the Pro Bowl during only his second full season as a starter .
A young , franchise quarterback is considered the rarest of commodities , to the point of almost becoming untouchable for trade .
Almost .
For as the trading period opened late on Feb.
26 , McDaniels discussed a proposed three - team deal that would have sent Cutler to Tampa Bay and former New England quarterback Matt Cassel to Denver .
The deal never materialized , and McDaniels said discussions never got serious .
But Cutler was disappointed upon learning his coach had thought about dealing him .
More significantly , Cutler came to distrust McDaniels to the point that two subsequent clear - the - air conversations between the two only intensified the young quarterback ’s displeasure .
On March 15 , a day after Cutler and Cook met personally with McDaniels and Xanders and a day before the Broncos began their offseason conditioning program , Cutler formally issued a trade request .
The stormy relationship seemed to calm a week ago Tuesday .
McDaniels repeatedly reiterated to a large media gathering at the NFL owners meetings in Dana Point , Calif. , that he was n’t going to trade Cutler .
They would work it out .
He ’s the Broncos ’ quarterback .
After that press gathering , Cutler , who has been staying in Nashville through most of the offseason , told The Denver Post he and McDaniels were going to talk that night .
The two exchanged text messages , but both sides agree a conversation never took place .
McDaniels had said last Tuesday that he had received messages from other teams inquiring about Cutler , but the team was not responding .
It appeared then that the Broncos would wait until its first minicamp before reaching its breaking point with Cutler .

The Pentagon sponsors a war game that examines how hostile nations might seek to cripple the U.S. economy .
Pentagon preps for economic warfare
The Pentagon sponsored a first - of - its - kind war game last month focused not on bullets and bombs — but on how hostile nations might seek to cripple the U.S. economy , a scenario made all the more real by the global financial crisis .
The two - day event near Ft. Meade , Maryland , had all the earmarks of a regular war game .
Participants sat along a V - shaped set of desks beneath an enormous wall of video monitors displaying economic data , according to the accounts of three participants .

“ It felt a little bit like Dr. Strangelove , ” one person who was at the previously undisclosed exercise told POLITICO .
But instead of military brass plotting America ’s defense , it was hedge - fund managers , professors and executives from at least one investment bank , UBS – all invited by the Pentagon to play out global scenarios that could shift the balance of power between the world ’s leading economies .
Their efforts were carefully observed and recorded by uniformed military officers and members of the U.S. intelligence community .
In the end , there was sobering news for the United States – the savviest economic warrior proved to be China , a growing economic power that strengthened its position the most over the course of the war - game .
The United States remained the world ’s largest economy but significantly degraded its standing in a series of financial skirmishes with Russia , participants said .
The war game demonstrated that in post - Sept. 11 world , the Pentagon is thinking about a wide range of threats to America ’s position in the world , including some that could come far from the battlefield .
And it ’s hardly science fiction .
China recently shook the value of the dollar in global currency markets merely by questioning whether the recession put China ’s $ 1 trillion in U.S. government bond holdings at risk – forcing President Barack Obama to issue a hasty defense of the dollar .
“ This was an example of the changing nature of conflict , ” said Paul Bracken , a professor and expert in private equity at the Yale School of Management who attended the sessions .
“ The purpose of the game is not really to predict the future , but to discover the issues you need to be thinking about . ”
Several participants said the event had been in the planning stages well before the stock market crash of September , but the real - world market calamity was on the minds of many in the room .
“ It loomed large over what everybody was doing , ” said Bracken .
“ Why would the military care about global capital flows at all ? ” asked another person who was there .
“ Because as the global financial crisis plays out , there could be real world consequences , including failed states .
We ’ve already seen riots in the United Kingdom and the Balkans . ”
The Office of the Secretary of Defense hosted the two - day event March 17 and 18 at the Warfare Analysis Laboratory in Laurel , MD .
That facility , run by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory , typically hosts military officials planning intricate combat scenarios .
A spokesperson for the Applied Physics Laboratory confirmed the event , and said it was the first purely economic war game the facility has hosted .
All three participants said they had been told it was the first time the Pentagon hosted a purely economic war game .
A Pentagon spokesman would say only that he was not aware of the exercise .
The event was unclassified but has not been made public before .
It is regarded as so sensitive that several people who participated declined to discuss the details with POLITICO .
Said Steven Halliwell , managing director of a hedge fund called River Capital Management , “ I ’m not prepared to talk about this .
I ’m sorry , but I ca n’t talk to you . ”
Officials at UBS also declined to comment .
Participants described the event as a series of simulated global calamities , including the collapse of North Korea , Russian manipulation of natural gas prices , and increasing tension between China and Taiwan .
“ They wanted to see who makes loans to help out , what does each team do to get the other countries involved , and who decides to simply let the North Koreans collapse , ” said a participant .
There were five teams :
The United States , Russia , China , East Asia and “ all others . ”
They were overseen by a “ White Cell ” group that functioned as referees , who decided the impact of the moves made by each team as they struggled for economic dominance .
At the end of the two days , the Chinese team emerged as the victors of the overall game – largely because the Russian and American teams had made so many moves against each other that they damaged their own standing to the benefit of the Chinese .
Bracken says he left the event with two important insights – first , that the United States needs an integrated approach to managing financial and what the Pentagon calls “ kinetic ” – or shooting – wars .
For example he says , the U.S. Navy is involved in blockading Iran , and the U.S. is also conducting economic war against Iran in the form of sanctions .
But he argues there is n’t enough coordination between the two efforts .
And second , Bracken says , the event left him questioning one prevailing assumption about economic warfare , that the Chinese would never dump dollars on the global market to attack the US economy because it would harm their own holdings at the same time .
Bracken said the Chinese have a middle option between dumping and holding US dollars – they could sell dollars in increments , ratcheting up economic uncertainty in the United States without wiping out their own savings .
“ There ’s a graduated spectrum of options here , ” Bracken said .
For those who had n’t been to a Pentagon event before , the sheer technological capacity of the Warfare Analysis Laboratory was impressive .
“ It was surprisingly realistic , ” said a participant .
Still , the event conjures images of the ultimate Hollywood take on computer strategizing : the 1983 film “ War Games ” in which a young computer hacker nearly triggers a nuclear apocalypse .
The film and the reality had one similarity :
The characters in the movie used a computer called WOPR , or War Operation Plan Response .
The computer system used by the real life war - gamers ?
It was called WALRUS , or Warfare Analysis Laboratory Registration and User Website .
Here ’s how the NBA Playoffs are going to go …
Sure , with its seven - game format , the NBA Playoffs are n’t quite as consistently dramatic as March Madness , but there are a number of compelling storylines as we head into this year ’s postseason .
Will KG return in time to help the Celtics try to repeat ?
Will LeBron and the Cavs ride home court advantage to the Finals ?
Can Chris Paul and the Hornets put a less - than - stellar regular season behind them and make a run ?
Can Kobe finally win a title without Shaq ?
The Playoffs start on Saturday , and looking at the matchups , I think I have a pretty good idea how things will play out .
Granted , I ’m likely to make a few mistakes along the way , but that ’s part of the fun , right ?
EASTERN CONFERENCE FIRST ROUND
# 1 Cavaliers vs. # 8 Pistons
Let ’s see – the Pistons limped into the playoffs , going 8 - 9 in March and 3 - 5 in April .
Earlier in the season , they traded away arguably their best player ( Chauncey Billups ) and the guy they got in return ( Allen Iverson ) is ( rumored to be ) spending his time getting banned from the local casinos .
If Detroit had held onto Billups , maybe they ’d be able to make this a series , but without him , they ’re floundering .
I hope Joe Dumars has fun with that cap space !
# 4 Hawks vs. # 5 Heat
Here ’s a first round battle between two teams that do n’t have a legitimate chance of making the Finals .
If the NBA were to adopt a single - elimination format ( or even three - game series across the board ) , maybe … .
maybe…one of these teams could get hot and make a run .
As it stands , the winner will have the right to face a determined Cavs team in the second round .
Not that it matters , but I ’m going with the Hawks here .
They have home court advantage , have won three of four against the Heat this season and are simply a better team .
Hats off to Dwyane Wade for willing the Heat this far , but I do n’t think we ’re going to see a LeBron / D - Wade matchup in the second round .
( Not unless Jermaine O’Neal discovers the Fountain of Youth by this weekend . )
# 2 Celtics vs. # 7 Bulls
Do n’t look now , but the Bulls are ( kind of ) hot .
They ’ve won 12 of their last 16 games , including home wins against Boston and New Orleans .
Normally , I ’d take the C’s and not think twice , but with Kevin Garnett out for the foreseeable future , this is suddenly an interesting series .
Boston is 18 - 7 without Garnett ( 8 - 5 against playoff teams ) , so the Celtics are still a solid team without their star forward .
I think home court should be enough to allow Boston to move on , but do n’t be surprised if Chicago springs the upset .
# 3 Magic vs. # 6 Sixers
The Sixers were 12 - 15 with Elton Brand and 29 - 26 without him .
Ouch .
Philly had lost six straight games before beating a Cavs team that was resting its starters .
The Magic swept the season series .
Despite the Orlando ’s mediocre play in April , the Magic should advance .
WESTERN CONFERENCE FIRST ROUND
# 1 Lakers vs. # 8 Jazz
Utah gave L.A. some problems last year , taking the Lakers to six games .
Moreover , every game in the series was competitive .
The Jazz have the tools to cause headaches for the Lakers , but Utah is 2 - 7 in its last nine , so I do n’t see an upset here .
# 4 Trail Blazers vs. # 5 Rockets
Houston is 16 - 7 in March and April , but just 7 - 6 against playoff teams .
Portland is 18 - 6 ( and 6 - 6 ) over the same span .
What does this tell us ?
Not much , but I already counted up the wins so I did n’t want the work to go to waste .
Something tells me that the Blazers are going to have a tough time matching Ron Artest ’s mental toughness , but I ’m rooting for a Portland win so they can move on and face the Lakers ( whom they ’ve beaten twice in the last 39 days ) .
The Blazers have home court , so let ’s hope that ’s enough .
# 2 Nuggets vs. # 7 Hornets
At the start of the season , I thought these seeds would be reversed .
I ca n’t believe how well Denver has played since Chauncey Billups ’ arrival ( and without Marcus Camby ) .
New Orleans limped into the playoffs ( going 3 - 6 in April ) and they just do n’t look like the same team that took San Antonio to seven games in last year ’s Western Conference Semifinals .
Meanwhile , the Nuggets have won 14 of their last 17 and have home court advantage .
It ’s going to be a great battle at point guard between Billups and Chris Paul , but Denver is just playing better ball right now .
I ’m going with the Nuggets , but I would n’t be shocked if the Hornets pulled the upset .
# 3 Spurs vs. # 6 Mavericks
With Manu Ginobili sidelined , the Mavs have a real shot to upset the Spurs , but I do n’t think Jason Kidd can handle Tony Parker ’s quickness .
TP is averaging 31.3 points ( on 52 % shooting ) and 7.3 assists his four regular season games against Dallas .
Parker should go nuts , so if Tim Duncan ’s knees hold up , the Spurs will advance , and there will be several shots of Mark Cuban looking unhappy in the stands .
( Anyone want to pool some money together and pay for Devin Harris to sit in the same section ?
That would be awesome . )
EASTERN CONFERENCE SEMIFINALS
# 1 Cavaliers vs. # 4 Hawks
Atlanta does have the personnel to give the Cavs some problems , but LeBron seems destined for a Finals appearance this season and the Hawks have really struggled to slow him down in the two team ’s four meetings this season .
( Cleveland is 3 - 1 in those games . )
Mo Williams averaged 23.3 points and shot almost 54 % against the Hawks this season , and with the way LeBron is playing defense right now , I do n’t see Joe Johnson carrying the Hawks to more than a couple of wins .
Cavs advance .
# 2 Celtics vs. # 3 Magic
Anyone who followed my March Madness picks knows that I ’m not optimistic when it comes to pre-tournament injuries .
( Damn you , Ty Lawson ! )
Such is the case with KG ’s knees – according to Doc Rivers , he may not be able to play again this postseason , and if he ’s not at or near 100 % , the Magic have the advantage in this series .
It ’s true that Orlando is without Jameer Nelson , but Rafer Alston has been an adequate replacement .
I ’d feel a lot better picking this upset if the Magic had played better down the stretch , but let ’s assume that they lost focus late in the season with virtually nothing on the line .
Orlando pulls the upset .
WESTERN CONFERENCE SEMIFINALS
# 1 Lakers vs. # 4 Trail Blazers
The Lakers won the first two meetings ( in L.A. ) by an average of 17 points , but the Blazers won the last two in Portland by 17 ( in March ) and by eight ( in April ) .
The Lakers have now lost eight straight at the Rose Garden , but with home court advantage , they do n’t have to win in Portland .
I expect the young Blazers to put up a fight , but ultimately lose this series in six or seven .
Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol provide a great one - two punch , but the Lakers will need some production out of Derek Fisher or Jordan Farmar somewhere along the line to reach the Finals .
Given the state of the teams in the other side of the West bracket , the Blazers ( or even the Rockets , if they advance ) could give the Lakers their toughest conference test .
This will be good experience for the young Blazers who look poised to dominate the West in the not - too - distant future .
# 2 Nuggets vs. # 3 Spurs
Ugh .
I ’m not a believer in the Nuggets , and I ’m not optimistic about the Spurs given Manu Ginobili ’s absence and Tim Duncan ’s knees .
The Nuggets have home - court advantage in this series thanks to a 2 - 1 regular season record against the Spurs .
Tony Parker did n’t play in either of the Spurs ’ losses , and he ’s going to have to come up huge for the Spurs to advance .
Without Ginobili , the Spurs are in a bad way , but I ’d feel worse about picking Denver to advance to the Western Conference Finals , so San Antonio it is .
CONFERENCE FINALS
# 1 Cavaliers vs. # 3 Magic
With Jameer Nelson in the lineup , the Magic would have had a shot , but they do n’t have anyone to contain LeBron on the wing .
James averaged 30.7 points in three games against Orlando , but did n’t shoot all that well ( 43 % ) .
Mo Williams has really struggled against the Magic , shooting 38 % from the field and scoring just 14.3 ppg .
The Magic were 2 - 1 against the Cavs this season , but both wins were at home .
Orlando will want to make this game a grind , but LeBron should be able to get to the line enough to give the Cavs the advantage in the clutch .
Given Orlando ’s struggles down the stretch , it will be an accomplishment to get this far , so let ’s hope that Stan Van Gundy does n’t give himself another ulcer on the sideline .
# 1 Lakers vs. # 3 Spurs
The Spurs could n’t beat the Lakers last year with Ginobili in the lineup and Andrew Bynum sidelined , so I do n’t see them beating L.A. without Ginobili and with Bynum back and looking pretty good .
Nothing to see here .
Lakers advance .
THE FINALS
# 1 Cavaliers vs. # 1 Lakers
With KG hobbled and the C’s looking vulnerable , this is the matchup that everyone wants to see .
Kobe wants a Shaq - less title so badly , he can taste it .
( No jokes about Shaq ’s freestyle rap , please . )
It has been his singular focus for the last few seasons , and he can sense that the window is closing .
His Lakers fell to the Celtics in last year ’s Finals in part because Garnett , Paul Pierce and Ray Allen had that same focus , while the rest of the Lakers simply did not .
The Cavs should have an advantage at point guard with Mo Williams who is quicker than Fisher and more experienced ( and more confident ) than Farmar .
The Lakers can throw Kobe and Trevor Ariza at LeBron on the defensive end , and have an advantage inside with Gasol and Bynum ( versus Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Anderson Varejao ) .
The Lakers swept the season series , and LeBron shot a combined 14 for 45 ( 31 % ) in the two games , so it looks like the Lakers might have his number from a defensive standpoint .
( Keep in mind that LeBron killed the Lakers in the two games last season , so who knows . )
The Cavs have better chemistry , but chemistry only gets you so far .
Unless LeBron can shake off his regular season struggles against the Lakers and post his usual 29 - 7 - 7 line , L.A. should be able to steal a game in Cleveland .
The only thing standing in the way is Kobe ’s relationship with his teammates .
How will he handle adversity ?
Will the Laker role players come up small when faced with the prospect of failing Kobe on his quest for another title ?
The Lakers have the personnel ( and coaching ) advantage , so I think they ’ll ultimately triumph , but assuming we do get this matchup , it ’s going to be interesting to watch the emotional side of this series .
More than 40 major British companies face legal action for allegedly buying secret personal data about thousands of workers they wanted to vet before employing them .
The information commissioner , Richard Thomas , will today publish a list of the companies he believes may have broken data protection laws , after an investigation by his office that was sparked by fears that many workers were being unfairly " blacklisted " .
The commissioner alleges that the firms , including Balfour Beatty , Sir Robert McAlpine , Laing O'Rourke and Costain , have , for many years , covertly bought details of workers ' trade union activities and their conduct at work .
Thomas believes that workers have been unfairly denied employment because they have had no chance of challenging any inaccurate information , some of which has been stored for decades .
Asked by the Guardian to respond to the claims , many companies refused to comment .
Others denied using the data to " blacklist " troublesome workers covertly , or said they had stopped buying the data .
The commissioner has already taken action rapidly to close down a private investigator who is accused of clandestinely compiling an " extensive intelligence database " of 3,000 workers with details that stretch back to the 1980s .
The commissioner is to prosecute the private detective , Ian Kerr , who is accused of selling the information to companies in the construction industry when they wanted to vet potential staff .
Thomas said he had seized documents which , he says , show that files on individuals included comments such as " communist party " , " ex - shop steward , definite problems , no go " , " do not touch " , " orchestrated strike action " and " lazy and a trouble - stirrer " .
David Smith , the deputy information commissioner , said : " This is a serious breach of the Data Protection Act .
Not only was personal information held on individuals without their knowledge or consent , but the very existence of the database was repeatedly denied .
The covert system enabled Kerr to unlawfully trade personal information on workers for many years , helping the construction industry to vet prospective employees .
" Kerr held information on thousands of construction workers and profited by checking names against his database .
" Trading people 's personal details in this way is unlawful and we are determined to stamp out this type of activity . "
Construction workers have long complained that they have been stopped from getting work because companies were covertly turning away people they believed to be active trade unionists .
Hard evidence has , until now , been hard to come by , and the construction industry has always denied it .
Steve Acheson , who believes he has been blacklisted , said he was " absolutely thrilled " by the findings of the commissioner 's investigation .
The electrician , 55 , from Denton in Manchester , said : " I 've been angry for so long .
It affects your character and demeanour - it 's the fact it 's so blatantly unjust .
I was disgusted that one man could make a living from denying other men the right to work " .
The Labour government has been criticised for passing a law banning the practice of so - called blacklists in 1999 , but then , in a U - turn , deciding not to take the final step of implementing the law on the grounds that " there was no hard evidence that blacklisting was occurring " .
Technically , therefore , " blacklisting " is still legal .
Last night , the Department for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform said it was prepared to review its position .
" The government is committed to monitoring any evidence that blacklisting is resurfacing in the UK , " said a spokesman for the department .
However , the information commissioner has powers to take action if he believes data protection laws have been broken .
His officials raided the offices of Kerr , the private investigator , in Droitwich , Worcestershire last week , seizing what the commissioner calls " an intelligence database " of 3,213 individuals .
Thomas said the " comprehensive card index system " held " sensitive " personal data , including details of trade union activity , employment conduct and personal relationships .
He added there was also information about whether the individual " may pose a threat to industrial relations between an employer and its employees " .
Some information was more than 30 years old , he said .
He has also seized invoices , which he says were issued by Kerr to companies for checking names on his database .
He said they showed that the companies had paid Kerr an annual subscription and then a fixed fee for each name they wanted him to run through his database .
The Guardian understands that , in what appears to be a system for centralising records in the construction industry , companies sent information to Kerr so that it could be pooled with other firms .
Kerr agreed to close his business after the commissioner ordered him to stop selling the contents of the database on the grounds he had broken data protection laws .
Yesterday , Kerr said he was not operating a " blacklisting " service as he never made any judgments about the individuals and instead left it up to companies to decide whether to employ them .
Thomas launched his investigation last summer after an article in the Guardian about alleged blacklisting in the construction industry .
The commissioner intends to order the construction companies to stop buying workers ' personal data .
A new attack that peppers Google search results with malicious links is spreading quickly , the U.S. Computer Emergence Response Team warned on Monday .
The attack , which has intensified in recent days , can be found on several thousand legitimate Web sites , according to security experts .
It targets known flaws in Adobe 's software and uses them to install a malicious program on victims ' machines , CERT said .
[ Learn how to secure your systems with Roger Grimes ' Security Adviser blog and Security Central newsletter , both from InfoWorld . ]
The program then steals FTP login credentials from victims and uses that information to spread further .
It also hijacks the victim 's browser , replacing Google search results with links chosen by the attackers .
Security experts started tracking the attack in March , when it had infected several hundred Web sites , but in recent weeks the number of infected sites has jumped dramatically .
The attack has been called Gumblar because at one point it used the Gumblar .cn domain , though on Monday it had switched to a different one .
Security vendor ScanSafe has counted more than 3,000 infected Web sites , up from around 800 just over a week ago .
That kind of continued growth is unusual , according to Mary Landesman , a senior security researcher with ScanSafe .
Attackers have launched many widespread Web attacks over the past few years , but after a few months the total number of infected sites usually drops as Webmasters clean up their servers .
With Gumblar , more and more sites are now being infected .
Landesman believes it 's because Gumblar 's creators have been good at obfuscating their attack code and making it harder to spot on infected sites .
And because they 've been stealing FTP login credentials , they 've been able to use a few new tricks to get their software onto the sites .
" They 're doing things like changing folder permissions … and leaving behind multiple ways that they can get back into the server , " she said .
Still ,
Web attacks have become so widespread that Gumblar remains a relatively small - scale phenomenon , according to Symantec Security Response Product Manager John Harrison .
Last year , Symantec counted 18 million online attacks against its customers .
With Gumblar , it has counted 10,000 .
" It 's really just another day with drive - by downloads , " he said .
" There really are so many of these . "
Security experts say that if you 're using a fully patched system with up - to - date security software , you should be protected from these attacks .
To date , they 've worked by hitting the victim with malicious PDF or Flash files .

Plastic bottles are produced , consumed , and trashed each and every day .
Of the 28 billion bottles of water bought by Americans each year , more than 22 billion sit in landfills .
Only 13 % of our plastic bottles are recycled .
Those statistics on plastic bottles do n’t include the ones that have been rescued for amazing reuse projects !
We ’ve discovered more than 340,000 plastic bottles in the creations below – from chic plastic vests to floating islands , the possibilities for reusing bottles are endless …

Cellar Door
Taking all of the hard work done regimenting society for the greater good and throwing it in the trash can in the name of productivity , success and happiness .
" To boldly go where no man has gone before " is a tagline that could scupper any director 's chances , and I 'm sorry to report that the new JJ Abrams attempt is n't the first Star Trek film to feature a Muppets - style singalong with a human - Klingon - Romulan chorus line .
What it is is a hugely efficient , fast - paced reworking with a spry turn by Chris Pine as James T Kirk – reminiscent of cocky , pre-Angelina Brad Pitt – that has 24 - carat star quality .
Abrams zeroes straight in to the heart of the teen demographic , pitching his version as Star Trek 90210 , the young crew meeting mostly at Starfleet Academy , Kirk nursing an asteroid - sized attitude problem after the death of his heroic captain father and Spock ( Zachary Quinto ) struggling with his mixed - race heritage .
There are some toe - curling childhood scenes – including an all - too - human episode of Vulcan playground bullying – and lots of soppy 21st - century homilies about realising one 's true self .
You imagine a look very like Spock 's frowning bemusement coming over the screenwriters ' faces every time it came to write a scene requiring our Earth emotions .
But it does n't matter at all : these moments are quickly forgotten at Abrams 's confident warp speed , so firmly set in breezy comic mode that even the appearance of the Romulans – restyled as a tribe of space Maoris led by Eric Bana , in a gargantuan , spiny craft that looks like Grace Jones 's headgear has been finally launched into space – can't stop the party .
Added to the mood are the film 's fabulous looks : especially in a stand - out sequence in which Kirk , Sulu ( John Cho ) and an ominously unnamed colleague who 's obviously not seen Galaxy Quest must sky - dive from orbit on to a small platform suspended 2 km above the surface of Vulcan .
What comes as the real surprise amid the multimillion - dollar storm are the gameness of the performances .
Cho and Anton Yelchin , as Chekhov , fit in seamlessly in small roles ; Simon Pegg 's Montgomery Scott , accompanied by a comedy cornflake - faced alien sidekick , feels like he 's been beamed in from Red Dwarf , but has the required impact ; Zoe Saldana , as Uhura , does her best in an underwritten role .
Perhaps Quinto is a little colourless , but he could n't exactly play Spock like Withnail , and he is the only junior cast member saddled with his elder counterpart , Leonard Nimoy , hanging around .
But Karl Urban 's unshaven McCoy and , especially , Pine 's Kirk , are unqualified successes : the latter ditching the infamous Shatner cadences but channelling the twinkly roguishness spot-on .
Combined , they , and this new voyage , have real optimistic force and uplift .
I am not one of the plaintiffs in this Vietnam Veterans of America , et al. v. Central Intelligence
Agency , et al .
I am one of the 7120 men used from 1955 thru 1975 , when the Army stopped the program upon the release of the 1975 Department of the Army Inspector general Report on Human Experimentation , that found the government was violating the Nuremberg Codes of 1947 .
I blame Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld as they both had seats at the National Security Council , Cheney as Chief of Staff and Rummy as Secretary of Defense .
To date the government still has failed to help these veterans and or their widows , more than 34 years after the last experiments was conducted .
You will notice in the lawsuit no one is asking for money , they are asking for healthcare , an apology , an admission we were lied to , and some want the medals we were promised .
( I have enough , and I damn sure do n't want one commemorating that I was a fool ) .
What This Case Is About
Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief only – no monetary damages – and Plaintiffs seek redress for 25 years of diabolical experiments followed by over 30 years of neglect , including : the use of troops to test nerve gas , psychochemicals , and thousands of other toxic chemical or biological substances and perhaps most gruesomely , the insertion of septal implants in the brains of subjects in a ghastly series of mind control experiments that went awry ;
the failures to secure informed consent and other widespread failures to follow the precepts of U.S. and international law regarding the use of human subjects , including the 1953 Wilson Directive and the Nuremberg Code ;
an almost fanatical refusal to satisfy their legal and moral obligations to locate the victims of their gruesome experiments or to provide health care or compensation to them ;
the deliberate destruction of evidence and files documenting their illegal actions , actions which were punctuated by fraud , deception , and a callous disregard for the value of human life .
The Complaint asks the Court to determine that Defendants ’ actions were illegal and that Defendants have a duty to notify all victims and to provide them with health care going forward .
What is left out of this case , is the fact that the scientists and doctors that worked at our defense agencies spent years traveling back and forth to Gagetown , Canada and Porton Downs , England , where our allies were doing similar experiments , sometimes jointly to see if the results were the same .
This web page on Porton Downs explains the English project since they have Universal Health care , the English paid each of the veterans a small stipend and publicly apologized to them for the betrayal .
This is the history of the Porton Down experiments written by Professor Ulf Schmidt Cold War at Porton Down : Informed Consent in Britain ’s Biological and Chemical Warfare Experiments as you can see they were as lax as the American doctors were .
Bottom Line is that the national Security Council in 1974 and 1975 had the opportunity to stand up and say you will NOT use American soldiers as human guinea pigs , they failed to do so , despite the fact that is exactly what they should have done .
I am appalled by what they approved in the past 8 years on detainees , but I am more sickened by what they approved in 1974 and 1975 it is way past time the government is held accountable for torturing foreign detainees and American soldiers more than 30 years ago .
In my opinion Liz Cheney is a apple who did not drop to far from her fathers tree , and for that matter she is her mothers daughter also .

__1870 : __President Ulysses S. Grant signs a bill creating what we now call the National Weather Service .
Forecasting models were simple but generally effective .
It had been obvious for centuries that weather in North America generally moves from west to east or southwest to northeast .
But other than looking upwind , that knowledge was little help in predicting the weather until you could move weather reports downwind faster than the weather was moving .
The telegraph finally made that possible .
The Smithsonian Institution in 1849 began supplying weather instruments to telegraph companies .
Volunteer observers submitted observations to the Smithsonian , which tracked the movement of storms across the country .
Several states soon established their own weather services to gather data .
Congress thought the nation needed a centralized weather office , and that the new system would be best served by military precision and discipline .
Hence , the resolution signed by President Grant in 1870 required the Secretary of War :
to provide for taking meteorological observations at the military stations in the interior of the continent and at other points in the States and Territories ... and for giving notice on the northern [ Great ]
Lakes and on the seacoast by magnetic telegraph and marine signals , of the approach and force of storms .
The War Department assigned the new function to the Signal Service Corps , where Brig . Gen. Albert J. Myer matter - of - factly named the new unit the Division of Telegrams and Reports for the Benefit of Commerce .
The network went online Nov. 1 , 1870 .
Observers at 24 stations in the eastern United States started taking synchronized readings at 7:35 a.m. and telegraphing them to the division 's headquarters in Washington , D.C .
Cleveland Abbe , a private forecaster who ( name notwithstanding ) operated out of Cincinnati , had a reputation for consolidating telegraph reports into top - notch weather maps .
The Army hired him as Special Assistant to the Chief Signal Officer .
Abbe began work in January 1871 and made his first official forecasts the following month .
He soon exceeded public expectations with daily weather reports like this :
Synopsis for past twenty - four hours :
The barometric pressure had diminished in the southern and Gulf states this morning ; it has remained nearly stationary on the Lakes .
A decided diminution has appeared unannounced in Missouri accompanied with a rapid rise in the thermometer which is felt as far east as Cincinnati ; the barometer in Missouri is about four - tenths of an inch lower than on Erie and on the Gulf .
Fresh north and west winds are prevailing in the north ; southerly winds in the south .
Probabilities :
It is probable that the low pressure in Missouri will make itself felt decidedly tomorrow with northerly winds and clouds on the lakes , and brisk southerly winds on the Gulf .
In 1872 , Congress extended the Signal Service 's weather responsibility to include the entire country .
The weather division was renamed the U.S. Weather Bureau and transferred to civilian control as part of the Agriculture Department in 1891 .
President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved it to the Commerce Department in 1940 .
The bureau was renamed the National Weather Service in 1970 , when it joined the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries in the Commerce Department 's newly created National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
Abbe served the government 's weather service in various capacities until 1916 , the year of his death , and is often called the " father of the U.S. Weather Bureau . "

In 2007 and 2008 two groups of theoretical physicists ( Hammer and Platter , and von Stecher , D'Incao , and Greene ) predicted the existence of universal four - body states that are closely tied to Efimov trimer states .
Now , a team of scientists of the Institute for Experimental Physics of the University of Innsbruck , Austria , has proven these states experimentally in an ultracold gas of cesium atoms .
At particular energy separations from an Efimov state , they found two four - body loss resonances , which are a strong evidence for the existence of a pair of four - body states closely tied to Efimov trimers .
„ Ultracold atomic clouds provide a very good system to study these few - body phenomena in experiments " , Francesca Ferlaino says , „ because we are able to accurately control the interaction conditions and , thus , the separation between the particles . "
Few - body problems are among the most difficult ones in physics and for centuries the cleverest minds have been engaged in looking for solutions to the problems that arise in this field .
Today it takes comprehensive experiments and an enormous numerical computing effort to solve the problems .
The scientific world has now made an important step towards finding simple laws for the complex relations between several interacting objects .
The starting point was the discovery of the Russian physicist Vitali Efimov at the beginning of the 1970s , who predicted the existence of an infinite series of universal three - body quantum states .
One of the remarkable properties is the fact that three particles bind to form a weakly bound entity – a trimer - while a dimer of the same particles is not formed .
In 2006 , 35 years after Efimov presented his paradigm , scientists led by Rudolf Grimm succeeded in proving the phenomenon experimentally and the research on Efimov states has now become a field of research in its own right in the physics of ultracold atoms .

Steve Ballmer is trash - talking Apple again .
No surprise there , as Microsoft 's famously loud - mouthed CEO has taken plenty of swings at Cupertino over the years , such as when he snickered at the iPhone back in 2007 .
Ballmer 's most recent shot came Thursday at the McGraw - Hill Companies ' Media Summit New York , where Ballmer was interviewed via webcast by BusinessWeek editor - in - chief Stephen Adler .
As reported by Todd Bishop of TechFlash , Ballmer offered his theory as to why Macintosh sales fell 16 percent in February , according to stats from market - researcher NPD Group :
" The economy is helpful .
Paying an extra $ 500 for a computer in this environment -- same piece of hardware -- paying $ 500 more to get a logo on it ?
I think that 's a more challenging proposition for the average person than it used to be . "
The Mac vs. PC argument is an old one , certainly , and Ballmer 's hardly an impartial observer in the debate .
But does Steve have a point ?
Take the MacBook , for instance .
The white 13 - inch model with a 2.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo chip , 2GB of memory and a 120 GB hard drive is still $ 999 .
Compared to similarly - equipped Windows notebooks , that 's awfully pricey .
The Apple faithful will counter that the Mac offers much more for the money .
But does it ?
While it 's difficult to draw an apples - to - apples ( insert Apple - to - PC joke here ) comparison , I decided to give it a shot by configuring a 13 - inch notebook at the Dell site .
For $ 640 , I could buy an Inspiron laptop with a 13 - inch glossy , widescreen display ( the premium screen ) , a 2.0 GHz Core 2 Duo processor , 3GB of memory , and a 250 GB hard drive .
The Dell Insprion cost $ 359 less than the MacBook , but offered a lot more memory and storage .
Ballmer 's estimate of a $ 500 Mac premium may be a tad high , but it's in the ballpark .
Let 's say the Mac tax is more like $ 300 than $ 500 .
Apple enthusiasts will counter that Mac users do n't have to fuss with security worries , and that 's true , at least for now .
They 'll point out that Macs do n't come with the crapware that infests so many Windows PCs .
And they 'll make the valid observation that the MacBook 's preinstalled software , including iLife , is superior to the so - so apps , including Microsoft Works , that ship with most consumer Windows PCs .
Fair enough .
But are those advantages worth a $ 300 - plus premium ?
In this economy , many consumers may think not .
Ballmer 's logo - tax theory does n't hold true for all Apple products , however .
The $ 199 iPhone 3G does n't cost more than competing smart phones , even when you add in the monthly AT&T service cost .
And iPods come in a wide range of competitively - priced packages , from the $ 79 Shuffle to the feature - packed $ 229 iPod Touch .
Laura Sweeney , a spokeswoman for the Justice Department , said the department ’s Office of Professional Responsibility is investigating the Siegelman case .

But she pointed out that a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit recently upheld Mr. Siegelman ’s conviction , and because he is appealing that ruling , “ the department will continue to litigate this matter in the courts , not in the media . ”
Mr. Kilborn wrote a letter to Mr. Holder on April 3 laying out several of his charges of misconduct by prosecutors .
He said Ms. Stemler sent a letter to lawyers on both sides concerning accusations that emerged in the appeals process that jurors had exchanged improper e-mail messages during the trial .
The letter revealed a private communication between United States marshals and the judge in the case that Mr. Kilborn characterized as inappropriate .
The letter from Ms. Stemler came so late in the process , he said , that it limited options for the defense .
Ms. Stemler ’s letter stated that the communication between the judge and the marshals had no effect on the case , however , and that it was only being revealed “ out of an abundance of caution . ”
Mr. Kilborn scoffed at that logic , saying that any private dealings with the judge should have been noted at the time .
In the interview , but not in the letter , he noted that William Welch , chief of the department ’s public integrity section , and his principal deputy , Brenda Morris , were held in contempt in the Stevens case and had a measure of involvement in the Siegelman case , though he did not offer evidence of misdeeds in his case .
Mr. Siegelman ’s conviction centered on a donation by the former chief executive of HealthSouth , Richard M. Scrushy , to help retire a campaign debt .
Prosecutors said that the donation was a deal for Mr. Scrushy ’s appointment to the state hospital licensing board ; Mr. Siegelman said it was nothing of the sort .
Of 37 sales for his office in January , only two had been above $ 500,000 .
" If that 's not enough evidence for you then I do n't know what is , " he said .
" Every buyer we have now is a first - time buyer and I would say 90 per cent of them are doing it because of the government incentive .
" That extra $ 7000 may not sound like a lot but it's all about sentiment and I can tell you , the whole property market will crash here .
It 'll be disastrous . "
First - time buyers now receive $ 14,000 for established properties and $ 21,000 for new properties .
However , the grants will revert to $ 7000 on July 1 .
A record 26.5 per cent of new home loans went to first - home buyers in January .
The scheme has been credited for reversing a five - year decline in the home building industry and softening the effects of the financial downturn .
The Real Estate Institute of Queensland ( REIQ ) is working with interstate bodies to lobby the Federal Government to extend the higher grants beyond June 30 .
REIQ chairman Peter McGrath said the ramifications of the grant were huge , both for the property market and any businesses connected to it .
" I can not stress how important first - home buyers are to the overall health of the property market as well as to their local economies , " he said .
" The property market is like a ladder .
You can cut off the top of the ladder and it still stays up .
" But if you cut off the bottom of the ladder , the whole thing comes crashing down . "
Mr McGrath said first - time buyers not only kept the real - estate market going but also supported other jobs .
The flow - on included fields such as conveyancing , valuing , lending , building and pest inspection , furniture removal , hardware retail and nurseries .
" So not only do first - home buyers allow existing homeowners to upgrade , they also inject funds into their local economies through buying ancillary products and they also use local tradesmen such as plumbers , electricians and builders , " he said .
" We have to try to make the Government understand how serious this really is and what dire straits the Queensland property market will be in if this grant is not extended . "
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Caterpillar
Inc , the world ’s largest maker of construction and mining equipment , notified an additional 2,454 workers in three states on Tuesday that they were losing their jobs as the company continues to try to bring production in line with plummeting demand .
The bulk of the job cuts -- nearly 1,600 in all -- will come in Illinois at the company ’s plants in East Peoria , which makes track - type tractors and pipe layers , and Aurora , where it makes hydraulic excavators and wheel loaders .
The company also said it is closing a fuel systems factory in Jefferson , Georgia , and moving production to two other Caterpillar plants .
It is also cutting jobs in Indiana .
In January , Caterpillar announced 22,000 layoffs and in February , the company offered voluntary early retirement packages to another 2,000 production workers .

SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) --
Getting a drink in Utah will no longer require the equivalent of a permission slip .
Gov. Jon Huntsman signed the most sweeping changes to the state 's liquor laws in 40 years into law on Monday , eliminating a much criticized system where customers must fill out an application and pay a fee before being allowed to enter a bar .
" In the name of economic development and the name of travel and tourism , and so that we do n't have to explain whenever a company comes into town for the first 30 minutes of our discussion why we have some of these onerous rules on the book , we 're going to sign , " Huntsman said at The New Yorker , an upscale bar and restaurant downtown that is a private club .
Utah is the only state in the country with such a maze of liquor laws -- and Huntsman appeared to have inadvertently broken them Monday .
Huntsman , who does n't drink and is n't a member of The New Yorker , did n't have a member at the door waiting to sponsor him in and did n't fill out a temporary membership form or pay a fee on his way to signing the bill .
Scores of bars have been punished with hefty fines and closures for allowing the very same thing to happen .
" In a case like today , I think everyone was sponsored by the owner , " said Huntsman spokeswoman Lisa Roskelly .
" But that 's the kind of situation we will eliminate with the bill today . "
Bars will no longer have to worry be private clubs beginning July 1 , eliminating a decades - old headache for anyone who has ever sought a cocktail here .
The move is being made in an effort to make the state seem a little less odd to outsiders and boost the state 's $ 6 billion a year tourism industry .
Tourism officials have long complained that Utah 's notoriously quirky liquor laws have given Colorado a competitive advantage in luring the lucrative ski and convention market .
Tourists in search of a beer and a bite to eat after hitting the ski slopes frequently walk out of bars once told they 're for members only .
A separate membership , costing at least $ 4 , is required at every bar .
" It 's always been the knock on Utah .
We 've got the best snow , we 've got the best access , we have the nicest people .
There 's nothing that compares to our product .
The only knock that anybody could ever come up with is that ' Your liquor laws are strange , quirky , weird , ' " said Nathan Rafferty , president of Ski Utah , the ski industry 's marketing arm .
" Instead of putting us at a disadvantage , this levels the playing field . "
The new law will also allow restaurants to take down partitions known as " Zion Curtains " that separate bartenders from customers in restaurants .
Currently , bartenders or servers must walk drinks around the bar before they 're allowed to serve them .
The name " Zion Curtain " is a reference to the state 's religious heritage as the home of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , which tells its members to abstain from alcohol .
The Mormon church counts about 60 percent of the state 's population among its members
The private club system and the Zion Curtain as they 're known today got their start in 1969 after the Mormon church told its members to vote down a proposal that would have allowed the sale of liquor by the drinks in restaurants .
The church is still highly influential here and the changes to the state 's liquor laws would not have happened if the church had opposed them .
As part of a compromise , the state will impose tougher DUI and underage drinking penalties .
Utah will also become the first state in the country to require bars to scan the ID of anyone who appears younger than 35 before being allowed to enter .
Information obtained through the ID scan , including name , age and address , will be kept on site for seven days so it can be accessed by law enforcement , despite concerns that keeping the information is a violation of privacy .
The compromise Huntsman signed into law will also prohibit new restaurants from mixing cocktails in public view because some lawmakers are worried that children will be enticed to drink alcohol if they see it poured from bottles .
The display of bottles , the serving of cocktails and their consumption will still be allowed in public view .
The Utah Restaurant Association has said the new requirement will keep many chain restaurants from opening in Utah and wants to remove it in future legislative sessions .
" We do n't add to underage consumption and we 're not part of the problem of overconsumption , " said association president Melva Sine .
" So in terms of those two problems they 're trying to solve , there 's no purpose to that portion of the bill that says we need to hide that .
There 's no problem .
It does n't exist . "
Huntsman has also called the requirement a step backward for the state , but agreed to it in order to make the other changes .
It 's a tactic he 's used on liquor laws before .
Huntsman was able to increase the maximum amount of liquor allowed in the standard cocktail from one ounce to 1.5 ounces last year by agreeing to other changes that are unique to Utah .
Among them , customers can't have more than 2.5 ounces of liquor before them at any time , down from the 2.75 ounces the law previously allowed .
Customers in Utah also can't order a margarita and a shot of tequila at the same time because it contains the same primary liquor , but they could order a margarita and a shot of bourbon , for instance .
In exchange for getting the larger standard pour in a cocktail , Huntsman agreed to ban the sale of flavored malt beverages in grocery and convenience stores .
The beverages are now only sold in state liquor stores at an 86 percent markup and at room temperature .

The heir to the throne has always prided himself on his alternative views , establishing himself as something of a royal iconoclast who gives voice to public fears over GM foods and nanotechnology , while pioneering a simpler vision of society based on championing organic agriculture , local produce and traditional architecture .
But this time , Prince Charles 's embrace of the alternative has led to him being accused of peddling " outright quackery " .
Britain 's leading academic expert on complementary medicine has warned that the Duchy Herbals Detox Tincture - a food supplement , which combines artichoke and dandelion and promises to rid the body of toxins while aiding digestion - is based on notions which are " implausible , unproven and dangerous " .
The heir to the throne , says Edzard Ernst , professor of complementary medicine at Exeter University , is deliberately ignoring science , preferring to rely on " make - believe and superstition " .
Ernst said : " Prince Charles contributes to the ill - health of the nation by pretending we can all over - indulge , then take his tincture and be fine again .
Under the banner of holistic and integrative healthcare he thus promotes a ' quick fix ' and outright quackery .
" It is implied that we can all over - indulge a bit and put it all right with detox tincture .
It is encouragement of an unhealthy lifestyle .
All the people I have talked to see it in the sense that you can get rid of your own bad habits in that way . "
Even if detox potions did not encourage overindulgence , Ernst says it would be wrong to sell them during the recession - because they simply do n't work .
" Nothing would be easier than to demonstrate that detox products work , " Ernst said .
" All one needed to do is to take a few blood samples from volunteers and test whether this or that toxin is eliminated from the body faster than normal .
But where are the studies that demonstrate efficacy ?
They do not exist , and the reason is simple : these products have no real detoxification effects . "
Ernst , whose career is devoted to accumulating and assessing scientific evidence to prove or disprove the worth of alternative therapies , was reviewing the evidence on the increasing number of products sold as detoxification agents at the time that the Duchy launched its own .
The Prince 's products are on sale in Boots and Waitrose .
" It 's one of those big subjects like anti-ageing and slimming remedies where there is so much quackery , " he says .
" I thought somebody has to make a sober analysis . "
The Prince also faces the prospect of official censure , after the Advertising Standards Authority confirmed yesterday it was investigating the claims made on behalf of the detox tincture , following a separate complaint .
Other scientists share Ernst 's scepticism on detox .
In January , a group called the Voice of Young Science , part of the charity Sense About Science , produced a study claiming consumers were being misled .
While manufacturers used the word detox to " promote everything from foot patches to hair straighteners " , they were unable to provide reliable evidence or consistent explanations of what the detox process means , said the scientists .
The study followed a denunciation from the British Dietetic Association , which represents 6,000 UK dieticians , which said there was no " potion or lotion " to " magically " rid the body of chemicals .
They dismissed the idea that dangerous toxins build up in the body , saying the body was more than capable of cleaning itself .
Andrew Baker , chief executive of Duchy Originals , said the tincture was a legitimate food supplement .
" It is a natural aid to digestion and supports the body 's natural elimination processes .
It is not - and has never been described as - a medicine , remedy or cure for any disease .
" Duchy Herbals Detox Tincture contains globe artichoke and dandelion , which both have a long history of traditional use for aiding digestion .
There is no ' quackery ' , no ' make believe ' , no ' superstition ' in any of the Duchy Originals herbal tinctures .
We find it unfortunate that Professor Ernst should chase sensationalist headlines in this way rather than concentrating on accuracy and objectivity . "
Ernst counters that there is some evidence that artichoke can lower cholesterol , but statins do a better job , and that there is no proof dandelions do any good at all .
Ernst and the Prince have crossed swords before .
Ernst believes he nearly lost his job in 2005 , after Clarence House wrote to Exeter University alleging he had broken a confidentiality agreement .
Ernst had signed the agreement before giving an interview for a report commissioned by the Prince 's Foundation for Integrated Medicine , which was investigating whether alternative therapies such as acupuncture would save the NHS money .
When a newspaper approached him for comments on a draft of the report , which suggested the NHS could save up to £ 3.5 billion if it embraced alternative therapies , Ernst said the initial findings were " outrageous and deeply flawed " .
A subsequent complaint by Clarence House embroiled Ernst in a year of disciplinary hearings .
He was later cleared of all wrongdoing .

The drillers have gnawed through a mile of rock here , almost down to a 600 - million - year - old layer of sandstone where they hope to bury about 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide -- equal to the annual emissions of 220,000 automobiles .
The $ 84 - million project , of which $ 66.7 million comes from the Energy Department , will help determine whether storing greenhouse gases underground , so - called sequestration , is a viable solution for global warming .
The project by Archer Daniels Midland Co. , in which greenhouses gases from a corn mill will be buried beneath shale , is important because it ’s the furthest along of the seven federally sponsored partnerships nationwide to study the matter .
Near the drilling derrick are steel drill bits caked with mud and worn to nubs .
Drillers have already burrowed 5,300 feet deep , and they have 2,700 feet left to go .

The idea is that by burying emissions , coal power plants and factories would cause less damage to the environment .
“ The day has to come when we can remove coal from the ground and return carbon dioxide ” to the ground , Sen. Richard J. Durbin ( D - Ill . ) said at the official groundbreaking Monday of ADM ’s project .
Durbin has been a proponent of sequestration on Capitol Hill , having included $ 1 billion in the stimulus package to potentially restart FutureGen , an experimental coal power plant to be built in Mattoon , Ill. , that would use sequestration .
The Bush administration had pulled the plug on FutureGen .
Yet environmental groups say the government should not fund sequestration projects because of the risk of leaks .

“ It is complete hubris to believe we can sink carbon dioxide into the ground and think there will be no leakage , ” said Carroll Muffett , a Greenpeace deputy campaigns director .
“ We see carbon capture as a serious distraction from real solutions .
It ’s certainly not where public money should be going . ”
A gushing leak not only could release the emissions back into the atmosphere , it might also pose health risks to people in the form of “ immediate death from asphyxiation ” or prolonged exposure to high amounts of carbon dioxide , said David Gerard , executive director of the Center for the Study and Improvement of Regulation at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh .
The major question is whether shale will stop the waste from escaping .
Shale resembles a series of overlapping flat plates that contain no room for the gases to pass through ; the shale is a rock layer just above the sandstone at the ADM site .
“ Right now we ’re evaluating the shale to make sure it will hold the carbon dioxide , ” said Jared Walker , a supervisor on the site for Schlumberger Carbon Services .

“ With carbon dioxide , it ’s important that if we put it in the ground , it stays in the ground , ” said Scott Marsteller , a project manager for Schlumberger Carbon Services .
“ We ’re doing a lot of monitoring . ”
Also at stake with the ADM project is whether similar geological formations around the country and world can be used for sequestration .
If storage cannot be duplicated on a widespread basis , “ it ’s not the option we ’re going to pursue , ” said Scott Klara , director of the Energy Department ’s Strategic Center for Coal .
The key to sequestration is dealing with different types of rock beneath the Earth ’s surface .
Sandstone is porous , sort of like a box of marbles , explained Robert Finley , director of the Energy and Earth Resources Center of the Illinois State Geological Survey .

ADM plans to inject a liquid form of carbon dioxide waste from its mill into the space between the “ marbles . ”
Beginning about a year from now , ADM would deposit 1,000 metric tons of emissions each day , shooting them about 8,000 feet into the ground .
The injections at the ADM project would stop in 2013 with about 1 million metric tons , at which point the partnership would continue to study the site for potential leaks .

TROMSOE , Norway ( Reuters ) -
An area of an Antarctic ice shelf almost the size of New York City has broken into icebergs this month after the collapse of an ice bridge widely blamed on global warming , a scientist said Tuesday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
“ The northern ice front of the Wilkins Ice Shelf has become unstable and the first icebergs have been released , ” Angelika Humbert , glaciologist at the University of Muenster in Germany , said of European Space Agency satellite images of the shelf .
Humbert told Reuters about 700 sq km ( 270.3 sq mile ) of ice -- bigger than Singapore or Bahrain and almost the size of New York City -- has broken off the Wilkins this month and shattered into a mass of icebergs .
She said 370 sq kms of ice had cracked up in recent days from the Shelf , the latest of about 10 shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula to retreat in a trend linked by the U.N. Climate Panel to global warming .
The new icebergs added to 330 sq kms of ice that broke up earlier this month with the shattering of an ice bridge apparently pinning the Wilkins in place between Charcot island and the Antarctic Peninsula .
Nine other shelves -- ice floating on the sea and linked to the coast -- have receded or collapsed around the Antarctic peninsula in the past 50 years , often abruptly like the Larsen A in 1995 or the Larsen B in 2002 .
The trend is widely blamed on climate change caused by heat - trapping gases from burning fossil fuels , according to David Vaughan , a British Antarctic Survey scientist who landed by plane on the Wilkins ice bridge with two Reuters reporters in January .
Humbert said by telephone her estimates were that the Wilkins could lose a total of 800 to 3,000 sq kms of area after the ice bridge shattered .
The Wilkins shelf has already shrunk by about a third from its original 16,000 sq kms when first spotted decades ago , its ice so thick would take at least hundreds of years to form .
Temperatures on the Antarctic Peninsula have warmed by up to 3 Celsius ( 5.4 Fahrenheit ) this century , Vaughan said , a trend climate scientists blame on global warming from burning fossil fuels in cars , factories and power plants .
The loss of ice shelves does not raise sea levels significantly because the ice is floating and already mostly submerged by the ocean .
But the big worry is that their loss will allow ice sheets on land to move faster , adding extra water to the seas .
Wilkins has almost no pent - up glaciers behind it , but ice shelves further south hold back vast volumes of ice .
The Arctic Council , grouping nations with territory in the Arctic , is due to meet in Tromsoe , north Norway , Wednesday to debate the impact of melting ice in the north .

While we ca n’t confirmed that any of the content in the video will be in the final product because it seem like the game is still in the early stages of development .

NEW YORK , April 6 ( UPI ) -- A New York teacher 's aide is suing an 11 - year - old boy , claiming he knocked her down and injured her back while running for ice cream .
Rosanna Tomack , 62 , is suing Joseph Cicack in a New York Supreme Court after an incident that took place in 2006 , when the boy was 8 years old , the New York Post reported Monday .

Edmond Chakmakian , Tomack 's lawyer , said his client required spinal fusion surgery and has been unable to return to work since Cicack ran into her and knocked her down at the city 's Public School 94 .
" It 's a legitimate case , " Chakmakian told the Post .
" It 's not silly . "
The lawyer said his client is seeking damages from the insurance policy covering the boy's parents ' home .
For all his efforts he could not get his balance , and over he went .
With my face over the brink , I saw him fall for a long way .
Then he struck a rock , bounded off , and splashed into the water .
If you thought Bernard Madoff 's Ponzi scheme was bad , wait until you hear about the inverted pyramid scheme the federal government is working on .

Here 's how the British government describes the risk of a smallpox outbreak .
" We are currently at alert level O. Smallpox remains eradicated .
No credible threat of a smallpox release . "
So , in response to this non-existent threat , it has published 122 pages of central plans .
Each of the nine English regions maintains a Smallpox Diagnosis and Response Group , which in turn supports five Smallpox Management and Response Teams , one of which is on duty at all times .
There are smallpox centres all over the country and lists of doctors , nurses and support staff prepared to run them , laboratories ready to multiply vaccines , and planning committees involving scores of different agencies .
The plans , in other words , must have cost millions .
They use thousands of hours of specialist time every year .
But step forward the man or woman who believes the government should abandon them .
The chances that this extinct disease might break out here are extremely remote - one in a million perhaps - but they cannot be dismissed while the US and Russia disgracefully refuse to destroy their stockpiles .
Stealing , weaponising and distributing the virus would require capabilities beyond those of any known terrorist group .
The government 's plans are almost certainly a waste of time and money .
But they are a waste of time and money that makes sense .
This is what government is for : to prepare for the worst , however unlikely it may be .
The UK , like all rich nations , maintains an elaborate network of agencies to defend us from unlikely events : the ministerial sub -committee on protective security and resilience , the Civil Contingencies Secretariat , the domestic horizon scanning committee , the National Risk Register , the Research Capability Programme , the National Recovery Working Group , the Regional Resilience and Emergency Response Division , the Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response , and endless departmental and regional bodies .
But this great state safety net is full of holes .
The government has a strangely unbalanced approach to risk , overemphasising some contingencies - terrorism , anarchy , attacks by rogue states - while underplaying , even promoting , others .
It was Gordon Brown , for example , who told the bankers of the City of London in his Mansion House speech of 2004 that " in budget after budget I want us to do even more to encourage the risk - takers " .
There is one respect in which the government 's approach seems utterly bonkers : a threat with a high likelihood of occurrence , for which it refuses to make any plans at all .
I 've been banging on about this for a while , with my usual absence of results .
But now I 've received a letter that makes its dismissive response look like outright lunacy .
There is nothing certain about the hypothesis that global supplies of conventional petroleum might soon stop growing and then go into decline .
There is a large body of expert opinion , marshalling impressive statistics , which is convinced that peak oil is imminent .
There is also a large body of expert opinion , marshalling impressive statistics , which insists that it 's a long way off .
I do n't know who to believe .
The key data - the true extent of reserves in the Opec nations - is a state secret .
Anyone who tells you that oil supplies will definitely peak by a certain date or definitely wo n't peak ever is a fraud : the information required to make these assessments does not exist .
In February 2008 I sent a Freedom of Information request to the Department for Business , asking what contingency plans the government has made for the eventuality that global supplies of crude oil might peak between now and 2020 .
The answer I received astonished me .
" The government does not feel the need to hold contingency plans specifically for the eventuality of crude oil supplies peaking between now and 2020 . "
As it revealed in a parliamentary answer , the government relies primarily on the International Energy Agency for its assessment .
When I made my first request , its cavalier attitude chimed with the IEA's .
But at the end of last year the agency suddenly changed tack .
Its World Energy
Outlook report upgraded the annual rate of decline in output from the world 's existing oilfields from 3.7 % to 6.7 % .
Previously it had relied on guesswork .
This time it had conducted the world 's first comprehensive study of decline rates , covering the 800 largest fields .
The report also contained a word the agency had hitherto avoided : peak .
It proposed that " although global oil production in total is not expected to peak before 2030 , production of conventional oil ... is projected to level off towards the end of the projection period . "
When I interviewed the IEA 's chief economist for the Guardian , he tightened this up : " In terms of non -Opec , we are expecting that in three , four years ' time the production of conventional oil will come to a plateau , and start to decline ...
In terms of the global picture , assuming that Opec will invest in a timely manner , global conventional oil can still continue , but we still expect that it will come around 2020 to a plateau as well ... I think time is not on our side here . "
He told me that we would need a " global energy revolution " to avert this prospect .
Nothing of the kind is happening .
So I sent the British government a new request : in the light of what the IEA has revealed , what contingency plans has the government made ?
The response has now arrived .
" With sufficient investment , the government does not believe that global oil production will peak between now and 2020 , and consequently we do not have any contingency plans specific to a peak in oil production . "
I just do n't get it .
Let us assume that there is only a 10 % chance of the IEA , and everybody else predicting that global oil supplies will soon peak or plateau , being right .
That still makes peak oil about 100,000 times more likely than an outbreak of smallpox in the United Kingdom .
As the report by Robert Hirsch - commissioned by the US department of energy - shows , the consequences of peak oil taking governments by surprise are at least as devastating as a smallpox epidemic .
" Without timely mitigation , the economic , social and political costs will be unprecedented . "
Hirsch estimated that to avoid global economic collapse , we would need to begin " a mitigation crash programme 20 years before peaking " .
If he 's right and the IEA is right , we are already 10 years too late .
But my conversations with government officials suggest to me that they wear the absence of plans almost as a badge of honour , like the Viking berserkers who went into battle without armour to show how mad they were .
The only explanation I can suggest is that the concept of insufficient oil cannot be accommodated within the government 's worldview .
Its response to a smallpox epidemic accords with its messianic tendencies : government as superman , defending us from crackpots carrying vampire pathogens .
The idea that we might be undone by an issue as mundane and unresponsive as resource depletion just does n't fit .
But at least we know where we stand : we 'll have to make our own contingency plans .
Does anyone have a spare AK - 47 ?

Jobs are getting tight out there !
I work in New York City and I hear a new story every day about some company laying people off .
Sometimes it ’s a whole department or division that I hear is getting the axe .
If you ’re lucky you get some type of severance pay but that ca n’t be expected these days .
What makes it worse is that a lot of companies are tightening their belts so you have all these people out of work competing for fewer jobs .
I ’ve been in a few meetings already where we had to justify our jobs and the work of our staff .
That ’s why I say you have to :
Fight for your right to work !
Here ’s what I mean :
You ’re no longer working for a raise– Yeah , I know that does n’t sound too appealing .
A lot of companies have frozen raises and promotions .
But the truth of the matter is you are working for your job !
All of that work you ’ve been doing to prove that you deserve that raise or promotion is now really working to prove you should keep your job .
You have to prove to your employers that they need to keep you the next time they consider a round of cuts .
You have to keep on protecting your right to work .
More work , same pay – Yeah , this is fun is n’t it ?
But when people get cut who makes up the work ?
That ’s right , the people left .
Even if no one has been laid off at your job there are pretty good chances they are n’t looking to hire new people ( unless you ’re in a lucky industry that ’s growing ) .
You are going to be expected to do more with less .
That ’s it .
No pleading for help .
No getting out at five every day .
You may even have to do the work of two people but get used to it .
Remember your job may be on the line .
Do n’t be a robot – Some people do what they are expected and that ’s it .
They may do a lot but they just do it .
No thought about why or consideration of the big picture .
These types of people are great when you need specific work done .
But sometimes they work like robots who ca n’t think outside of the box .
Know what happens to robots ?
They get outsourced !
Do more .
Get involved in your work .
Make sure your higher ups understand that you are adding value to the job and having someone else do your work wo n’t be enough .
You are the right person for the work and cannot be easily replaced .
Suck it up and be happy –
We had a person at my job who kept telling everyone the sky was falling and could only talk about how bad the economy was and how could the company ever keep us .
Honestly , we could n’t be happier when she finally found another job !
She brought morale down so much that management had to talk to her .
Do n’t be that person .
No one wants to work with them and when cuts come this person is going to be near the top of the list of those to go .
Suck up the extra work and hours .
You still have a job .
Be happy .
It might just be a brave face but managers remember those people who do their work and do n’t grumble about it .
They look for those people who are up for a challenge .
Which leads me to my last point …
Come through and be the hero – The recession will end .
Good companies will prosper .
Who is management going to remember ?
Those people who stepped up when times were tough and held things together !
This is the time to be the hero employee ; to be the go - to guy .
Now is when you do overtime to make sure a project is finished .
Yes , it ’s work but it just may pay off in the end .
Who knows , when all is said and done you may still get that big raise and promotion !
It ’s not a fun time in the economy .
And who wants to do more work for the same pay or less and work more hours ?
But you ’re not working for the extras these days .
You ’re working for your job !!
It is up to you to do everything you can to fight for your right to work .

Pitz is my open - source , distributed , plain - text , command - line , very flexible issue tracker .
I just started working on it and I ’m looking for feedback and contributors .
This post describes a little of what I ’ve gotten done so far .
I have n’t written any interface yet other than from within an interactive python session .
Deal with it .
Getting started
You have to make a bag to keep all the tasks and then you make tasks with any keywords you can dream up .
>>> from pitz import Bag , Task
>>> b = Bag ( '.pitz ')
>>> b.append ( Task ( title= ' Wash the dishes ' , creator= ' Matt ' , importance = ' Not very ' ) )
>>> b.append ( Task ( title= 'Clean the cat box ' , creator= ' Matt ' , importance = ' Not very ' ) )
You can add tasks to the bag by using the append method on the bag , or by passing in the bag as the first argument to the task :
>>>
Task ( b , title= ' Set new high score on Sushi - go - round ' , creator= ' Matt ' , importance=' critical ' )
Printing a bag really prints the title of each task in the bag :
>>> print( b )
Clean the cat box
Set new high score on Sushi - go - round
Wash the dishes
Running queries
I ’m proud of this one .
This is the main reason I ’m working on ditz .
Bag instances have a feature called matching_pairs that can filter the tasks down to a smaller new bag .
You can filter by a single pair like this :
>>> critical_tasks = b.matching_pairs ([ ( ' importance ' , ' critical ' ) ] )
>>> print( critical_tasks )
Set new high score on Sushi - go - round
Or you can filter by multiple pairs and the filtered tasks must satisfy ALL the pairs .
>>> print ( b.matching_pairs ( [ ( ' creator ' , ' Matt ' ) , ( ' importance ' , ' Not very ' ) ] ) )
Clean the cat box
Wash the dishes
Dumping and loading
Use the bag that holds all the tasks to quickly write all the tasks out to your hard drive like this :
>>> b.to_yaml_files ( )
[ '.pitz/task-07e1af97-0ac6-4904-9187-0c2fd61692b6.yaml ' , '.pitz/task-6a7af07c-d0 fb-4a77-9347-8dc78ef490fe.yaml ' , '.pitz/task-5ce725dc-c1db-4eca-a74c-55cd0e910786.yaml ']
The returned stuff is a list of files that pitz just wrote .
Loading from the hard drive is pretty simple too .
Just tell the bag where to load from .
>>> b2 = Bag ( '.pitz ')
>>> print ( b2 )
Clean the cat box
Set new high score on Sushi - go - round
Wash the dishes
Task details
Printing a task by itself gives all the details on the task .
>>> t = Task.from_yaml_file ( '.pitz/task-4d9c1db2-fef3-4b50-8095-b2339384e118.yaml ')
>>> print(t )

You can use bags as iterators to go through the tasks one - by - one :

Also notice that tasks are really just subclassed dictionaries ( UserDict , actually ) with some extra methods bolted on .

日本発の仮想マシン・ソフトウエアBitVisor 1.0が2009年3月30日，オープンソース・ソフトウエアとして正式リリースされた。政府の情報セキュリティ基本計画「セキュア・ジャパン」の施策の一つとして，政府機関への導入を目指し開発した，暗号化機能などを備える仮想マシン・モニターである。
開発を担当したのは筑波大学を中心とした産学のチーム「セキュアVMプロジェクト」。そしてCPUの仮想化を行うコア部分を一人で開発したのは，3年前のプロジェクト発足当時は大学を卒業したばかりの大学院生だった榮樂英樹氏である。榮樂氏は，中学生でIBM
PCのエミュレータを，大学2年生で仮想マシン・モニターを作ったという経歴を持つ。
製品化に備えすべて独自開発
BitVisorの概要 [ 画像のクリックで拡大表示 ]
BitVisorは，クライアント・パソコンからの情報漏洩を防ぐ目的で開発されたクライアント・パソコン向けの仮想マシン・ソフトウエアだ。OSより下の，仮想マシン・モニターのレベルでディスク上のデータやネットワークの通信データを強制的に暗号化，IDカードがなければOSもデータも利用できないようにすることでセキュリティを確保する。
ゲストOSとして はWindows XP ，Windows Vista，Linuxが稼働する。VMwareなどと同様，ハードウエアのエミュレーションを行う，ゲストOSを改変する必要のない完全仮想化（Full Virtualization ) 方式に含まれる。ただし，最低限必要なI/Oだけを監視，仮想化して，それ以外のI/Oは実マシンにそのまま実行させる方式をとっている。これにより仮想化のオーバーヘッドを軽減できるとともに，仮想マシン・モニター自体をシンプルにすることができる。同時に実行できるゲストOSは1個に制限されるが，クライアントのセキュア化という今回の目的には支障がない。
プロジェクトは約3年という限られた期間だったが，既存のソフトウエアを改良するのではなくゼロから書き上げた。将来の製品化に備えたためだ。「著作権をすべてプロジェクトが持つことで，メーカーが製品に組み込んだりする場合に問題が発生しないようにした」（プロジェクト・リーダー
筑波大学 大学院システム情報工学研究科 教授 加藤和彦氏）。ライセンスは，改変してもソースコード開示義務が発生しないBSDライセンスを採用した。
BitVisorのアーキテクトである筑波大学 大学院システム情報工学研究科 講師 品川高廣氏がベンチマークを公開している 。BitVisor上 のWindows XPは多くのテストで仮想マシンを使わないネイティブのWindowsとそん色ない実行速度を示しているという（Xen
Summit Tokyo 2008 での発表資料）。
セキュアVMプロジェクトは筑波大学が中心となり，富士通，日立製作所，NEC，NTTデータ，インテル，NTTコミュニケーションズ，ソフトイーサ，イーゲル，電気通信大学，慶應義塾大学，東京工業大学，奈良先端科学技術大学院大学などが参加している。
前述したように ，CPUの仮想化（エミュレーション）を行う仮想マシン・モニター（VMM）コアは榮樂氏が開発。デバイスの仮想化機構は保理江高志氏など，プロジェクトに参加した他のメンバーにより開発された。VPN機能は，ソフトイーサ会長で筑波大学の大学院生でもある登大遊氏が開発している。USBの仮想化はイーゲル

I watched closely all the tea parties all over the country Wednesday .
What a showing of national pride and solidarity .
What a showing of subservient compliance and casual indifference .
What a joke .
In Lafayette Park , Washington D.C. , of all places to protest , the plan was to dump one million tea bags in the park , but the brave dissidents never did it because they forgot to get the proper permits .
Are you kidding me ?
What is civil disobedience without civil disobedience ?
They even went so far as to say that they were willing to put down plastic tarps and clean up after themselves .
That ’s like saying we do n’t agree with your oppressive , unconstitutional despotism of our nation and to show our ire in no uncertain terms we ’re going to break public law and disrupt the peace so take that , nah- nah - ne - boo - boo .
But do n’t worry because we ’ll put everything back when we ’re done as if nothing happened cuz we do n’t want any trouble !
Videos on the Internet of Lafayette Park show people standing around in their trendy turtlenecks and Tommy Hilfiger and North Face jackets , chatting , socializing , drinking coffee and talking on their cell phones .
Some dressed in colonial garb ( how cute ) and waving flags .
Others even break into a rendition of the Star Spangled Banner followed by a chant of " USA , USA , USA . "
What a terrific show of meaningless symbolism .
Who are they chanting to ?
The buildings in front of them ?
The birds in the trees ?
Themselves ?
What was this supposed to do , because it does n’t take a rocket scientist to surmise that it did NOTHING !
All the politicians were inside , smugly and comfortably seated in their expensive leather chairs that we paid for .
They were discussing their next round of special interest pandering and deficit spending at our expense while we mingled as if at a , well , tea party .
But not the sort of 1773 but rather more like the sort at 4 p.m. in England that is served with crumpets .
The politicians could have cared less about the goings on outside and NO ONE took it to them .
Shame on us .
No one made sure they took notice .
No one was put out one bit .
No economic loss to the government whatsoever , as was the purpose of the original tea party , so why should they notice ?
Is this like giving to a charity ?
You write a check to feed a starving child for 10 cents a day in some far off , nameless , faceless country and you feel better about yourself ?
I attended a " tea party " in the Midwest on Wednesday and there were only about 200 people there .
And it was literally a tea party : people came with their coffee mugs and sandwiches , holding signs and standing around and chatting and socializing and then everyone went home .
No passion .
No signs of real frustration or discontent .
No real commitment to changing anything .
You know why ?
Because nobody wants to fire the first shot !
Everybody wants change , but only if they do n’t have to pay for it .
Only if their comfortable lives do n’t have to be disrupted for their freedom .
What a bunch of crap .
Then I see all these political pundits ( idiots ) on CNN talking about how the tea party movement is nothing more than a partisan , Republican , conservative movement against the Obama administration and how the majority of Americans agree with the taxing and borrowing and spending .
Some numb - nuts CNN political ( anal ) yst named Jeff Toobin says that the Texas state legislative resolution to reaffirm their state ’s sovereignty is a fantasy .
Are you kidding me ?
State ’s sovereignty is a fantasy ?
Well I guess that says it all .
Come on everyone , down the rabbit hole .

One pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small …
Welcome to the other side of the looking glass everybody .
My name ’s Alice and I ’ll be your host for the mad tea party today .
Let me introduce some other guests : the Hatter , March Hare , Dormouse , Chris Dodd , Barney Frank , Ted Kennedy , John McCain , Rod Blagojevich , Al Sharpton , Hillary Clinton all the AIG executives and many , many more .
Do n’t worry you ’ll have time to get to know them all since you ca n’t leave no matter what you do so might as well just get used to it .
Resistance is futile .
No doubt the majority of Americans did n’t want to go to war against the British in 1776 .
But would anyone say now that it was the wrong thing to do ?
No doubt the majority of Americans did n’t want a civil war .
Both those wars were , at their core , about state ’s rights .
About oppressive governments trying to overreach their authority and impose unlawful mandates on the states .
It was about their freedom to do what they wish with their lives .
I think we have met the enemy and it is us .
We ’re a bunch of fast food nourished , MTV anesthetized , shopping mall , plug - in - drug ( aka television ) addicts who will do anything to preserve that way of life at least until we die .
After that who cares ?
We ’re a clinically obese , socially disconnected , politically inept and intellectually bankrupt nation of douche bags who deserve everything they get .
The movement has no leader .
When I listen to anyone other than Ron Paul , Peter Schiff or Lew Rockwell speak about the issues we discuss on LRC I might as well be listening to any other political party spokesperson .
They sound just the same .
They dress just the same .
They say the same old tired things .
Ron Paul has even mentioned at times that the Libertarian party has become just another political party interested more in their political posturing rather than liberty .
They have all the same sorts of infighting and power struggles that are symptomatic of the fact that they have lost their way .
Rallying the troops to vote more like - minded individuals into office wo n’t work .
That ’s an old , failing strategy .
When will someone step forward with the courage , character , wisdom and intelligence to lead our nation into the 21st century the way our forefathers led it into the 19th century ?
Will it be Texas governor Rick Perry ?
Perry is using rhetoric about seceding from the union .
That is EXACTLY the kind of thing we need .
I believe , given the other states with similar resolutions in their legislatures , that it would begin a domino effect .
It would give people a chance to actually have a clear reason to fight : their state ’s rights of sovereignty and they would know that they have the state ’s resources behind them .
Unfortunately , even though it ’s clear what a boost Texas seceding would be in uniting us , I have no doubt that Perry is not up to the task and is using the issue as nothing more than a rallying point for reelection .
Where have all the heroes gone ?
Where are all the pioneers ?
Where are the visionaries ?
Where are the true statesmen ?
Where are the defenders of freedom ?
What has happened to the American Spirit of life and liberty ?
I guess they ’re all at the mall or Starbucks and are too fat to get up out of their chair and fight .
Or they ’re looking forward to retirement and the " good life " after spending their life being a good soldier and playing by the rules and saving for the " golden years " while their real golden years of youth were passing them by .
Certainly they ca n’t be asked to risk all that for something as silly as their children ’s futures .
How selfish of me .
Or maybe we do n’t want to risk our children ’s well - being now , so we defer it until they ’re adults and let them deal with the fact that they ca n’t afford college or health care or a home without going into enormous debt and we never teach them the importance of things like : character , honor , integrity , truth and freedom but rather teach them how to live in fear and how important it is to get a " good job " and play by the rules and to go along to get along and that will be safe .
We ’re pathetic .

First a little flashback :
Now this disgusting business , two days before the anniversary of mass murder : " U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder ( L ) kisses former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno ( R ) after she was awarded with the Justice Award by the American Judicature Society at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center April 17 , 2009 in Washington , DC .
The award is the highest honor given by the society for Reno 's devotion and dedication to the administration of justice in the United States .

You know that a studio - released movie has attained true mainstream status when the adult movie industry does a knock - off about it .
Prepare yourself for the latest example of the porn industry riding on the coattails of Hollywood with next month 's release of This Ain't Star Trek XXX , the home video creation of Hustler Entertainment .
Unlike the marketing tagline that Paramount Pictures is using to promote their new film , this may very well be your father 's Star Trek -- the one he keeps tucked away at the back of his closet and that you 're not supposed to know about .
What 's surprising about this dirty movie Star Trek film is that its creators seem to be honest - to - goodness fans of the original Star Trek and are striving for a higher than you typical porn quality copy job .
Not only do the sets of This Ain't Star Trek XXX look surprisingly faithful to the original Star Trek sets but the storyline for the porno mirrors the classic TOS episode " Space Seed " , the one that introduced perhaps the greatest villain ever to challenge Captain Kirk , Khan Noonian Singh .
You may have recognized actress Sasha Grey playing This Ain't Star Trek XXX 's equivalent of Lt. Marla McGivers in that photo with Khan .
Grey is the start of director Steven Soderbergh 's upcoming picture The Girlfriend Experience .
This Ain't Star Trek XXX 's storyline begins marching in step with " Space Seed " , showing Kirk and the Enterprise rescuing Khan from suspended animation .
Of course there are some differences , like for instance Khan has just two followers on his ship with him and they 're both beautiful women ( you can see where this is headed , right ? )
But shortly after the Enterprise picks up Khan things diverge from the source material and start getting real physical , real quick .
" Fire everything that you 've got , Mr. Sulu , " now starts to take on a whole different meaning .
This Ain't Star Trek XXX screenwriter Roger Krypton promises that there 's plenty of opportunities for the Enterprise officers to get it on with each other .
In one scene the actors playing Dr. McCoy and Nurse Chapel have to have sex because " it 's a life or death situation , " so that makes it all A - OK by Starfleet regs I suppose .
And yeah , there 's even an opportunity for Spock and Kirk to engage in a threesome with Uhura which , while it does n't go quite all the way that the Kirk / Spock slashfic writers had been hoping , it does get them naked and in the same room with each other .
It 's a start , right ?
Watch a clip from This Ain't Star Trek XXX on io9 .
Xfans has produced two behind - the - scenes videos about the production and the first one , which is embedded below , is , incredibly , safe for work !
If that whets your appetite for more , part two can be found here but it 's most definately not safe for work .
My goodness Nurse Chapel , that 's just nasty .
I seem to be getting into many conversations lately on the merits of keeping a sketchbook .
Almost everyone agrees they are a good idea , but surprisingly few actually do it .
The excuse I hear most often from non-sketchers is “ I ca n’t draw ” .
And now I ’ll tell you what I told them :
Sketchbooks are not about being a good artist , they ’re about being a good thinker .
Obviously , some people bring the practice of sketching to a higher art form , but to me it ’s always been about visual brainstorming and record - keeping in a format with a ridiculously low barrier to entry .
My drawings look like shit , but fidelity does n’t matter as long as I can convey my ideas to others or to my future self .
We should revel in not caring how good or bad we are , and by knowing that our means for thinking has improved with each stroke of our pencils .
The point is to keep doing , it ’s how you get stuff done .
And most certainly how you get better .
I ’m trying to get myself into the habit of filling up a page or so a day .
Sometimes this might just be a list of thoughts , other times it ’s a drawing or bunch of thumbnails .
I do n’t care if practice makes me perfect , I ’m happy if practice keeps me competent .
In the spirit of awareness , I ’ve set up a Flickr group for this very purpose .
Post one , and only one , spread / page from your sketchbook .
It ’s always fun to see how everyone else ’s mind works .
EAST HAMPTON , N.Y .
LIMELIGHT , at least the reflected kind , is again shining on Grey Gardens , a 10 - bedroom 1897 house near Georgica Pond here .
Thirty - four years after its former residents , Edith Bouvier Beale , known as Big Edie , and her namesake daughter , who was called Little Edie , were introduced to the world in the Maysles brothers ’ classic documentary , and three years after their life in the tumbledown raccoon - infested mansion on a wildly overgrown lot became the basis of a Broadway musical , HBO is rolling out a feature - length movie about them , also called “ Grey Gardens , ” this weekend .
The two Edies have become famous for the way they lived at Grey Gardens — the squalor of their home was especially striking given that Big Edie was an aunt and Little Edie a first cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis — and they will soon be even better known after being portrayed by Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore in the HBO film .
The house ’s current owners , who restored it after buying it from Little Edie in 1979 , are celebrities themselves : Sally Quinn , the writer and Washington hostess , and her husband , Benjamin C. Bradlee , the former editor of The Washington Post .
The couple have taken up residence at Grey Gardens every summer for decades , and have used it to entertain friends like Lauren Bacall and Norman Lear .

But one person intimately involved with the property is unlikely to be known to even the most hard - core Grey Gardens buff .
For 23 years , Victoria Fensterer , an artist who designed and maintains the current gardens , has worked year round to preserve something of the wild spirit of the Beales ’ Grey Gardens , on grounds that can nevertheless be navigated .
“ It is so lush , it ’s on the edge of becoming decadent , ” said Eden Rafshoon , a retired interior designer who has visited the Bradlees every summer for the last decade .
“ It ’s extremely romantic , it ’s very fragrant , and it ’s extremely sensuous .
It ’s full of secret garden rooms and mystery . ”

Spanish Flu is a bit of misnomer .
It ’s also known as the Great Influenza Pandemic , the 1918 Flu Epidemic , and La Grippe .
There ’s nothing to suggest it originated in Spain at all .
The name Spanish Flu seems to have arisen because the early stages of the illness received a lot more attention and media coverage in Spain than in the rest of the world because Spain had been neutral during the war , there were no other distracting major new stories , and no wartime censorship .
The Spanish called it the French Flu .
The first outbreaks of Spanish Flu noted as being definitely this illness were in America , rather than anywhere else .
In early March 1918 , cases were observed in Fort Riley , a military base in Kansas , and Queens , a borough in New York .
The strain at that time seems not to have been quite as dangerous as one which later emerged .
In August 1918 , a more infectious and dangerous strain appears to have appeared simultaneously in France , Sierra Leone , and Boston , America .
Neither the exact world population at the time nor the exact number of people who died from the Spanish Flu is known .
An estimated 2.5 to 5 % of the world ’s population may well have died of the illness , and over 20 % of the world ’s human beings caught the illness .
The Spanish Flu appears to have killed about 25 million people in the first six months after breaking into the human population , an interesting comparison with Aids , which killed 25 million people in its first 25 years after identification .
It struck some places much more viciously than others .
The countries thought to have had the highest infection and death rates are in the Pacific , with Western Samoa having 90 % of the population catching the virus , 25 % of adults and 10 % of children dying from the illness .
The island territory of Nauru also suffered a death toll of 16 % of the population .
Japan had a particularly low death rate , at about 0.5 % of the population .
American Samoa and New Caledonia , in the Pacific , prevented any deaths whatsoever from Influenza by imposing quarantines and block aids which prevented infected people from arriving on the islands .
Far more people died from the Spanish Flu than died in all the theatres of war in the First World War put together .
For example , an estimated 650 to 700,000 American citizens died of the Spanish Flu , which is ten times as many as died in the First World War .
Half the American soldiers who died in the European war theatres died of the Flu rather than of fighting .

Prior to the Shanghai Auto Show , Porsche wanted to showboat a little .
Their idea ?
Lift a Porsche Panamera to the 94th floor of the Shanghai World Financial Center .
In an elevator .

So how'd they get the Panamera and it's fat butt up there ?
Check out the images above and you 'll see it was quite the squeeze , almost mimicking what you 'd see if Santa Claus were real and he was shimmying up your chimney after eating all your cookies and making out with your Mom .
Wait a minute ...
Getting the Panamera , or any car for that matter , up to the 94th floor of the world 's second tallest building is no easy task .
Workers jimmied the 4 - door Porsche into the freight elevator using a motor ramp and some careful coordination to get it into an upright position for its ride up 1,394 feet to what is considered to be the world 's tallest event platform .
Question is —
How'd they get it down ?

Music to my ears , my friend .
I 'm glad to see people as excited about the project as I am .
It was the first new project I heard about after starting here at WF , and it's one game about which I was very sad upon hearing of its previous cancellation .
Now it 's not only coming out , but my company is producing it .
I can't really say anything about it , though ... not due to NDA , but because I have n't even seen anything other than some humorous drawings in the break room .

San Jose de los Perros , Nicaragua — Come and get it !
The slop is in the trough and the pigs are coming at a run .
An advertisement on the Internet tells the tale .
The Obama Stimulus Program is giving away  $ 10 billion a month in grants .
These grants never have to be repaid . 
 Finally , a taxpayer bailout ! it continues explaining how to get your government grant . 
Then , there is a photo of the purveyor of this scheme — standing in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris .
In other words , these government grants make anything possible — even a European vacation !
Then , there are a series of testimonials
 I got enough to buy a new car 
 I did n’t think it was true but I got my check today 
 These government grants are great just what I needed 
Soooo eeee !
We never heard that cry personally but that ’s how farmers used to call their hogs when it was time to feed them .
Just in the last few days , the Obama government has announced another $ 750 billion for bank bailouts and a $ 634 billion .
Where ’s all that money going to come from ?
Only a few months ago , the official budget deficit was projected to come to $ 800 billion then $ 900 billion then $ 1.2 trillion and now , get this , it ’s gone to $ 1.75 trillion .
The pols are taking advantage of the situation .
Capitalism has fallen down and ca n’t seem to get up .
So , the politicians get to march ahead and take charge .
General Motors just reported a loss for the fourth quarter of nearly $ 10 billion .
You can see what good it does to bail out failing companies the money just goes down the drain .
The government gave GM more than $ 13 billion — there goes the bulk of it .
And AIG is said to be nearing collapse — despite the government bailout of this past fall .
You ’ll remember that the Goldman boys got together with the government and decided to rescue AIG , but not competitor Lehman Bros .
AIG was reported to have owed $ 25 billion to Goldman .
We hope the firm stays alive long enough for Goldman to get its money
Sooo eee !
The Dow fell another 88 points yesterday .
Oil rose to $ 45 .
And gold fell 23 bucks .
Sales of previously owned houses fell 5.3 % in January from December .
There are now fewer sales than at any time in 10 years .
The median price of a used house is 26 % below its peak , we are told .
But despite the bad news , Americans are not quite in Depression Mode .
We have been trying to gauge popular sentiment .
Are investors throwing in the towel ?
Are consumers giving up ?
Is this the bottom of the downturn ?
Not likely
 Stocks face long road back after crash ,  is a headline in the Wall Street Journal .
 Bernanke says slump may end in ’09 ,  is how one paper reports on the Fed chairman ’s congressional testimony .
 Seven signs of an economic bottom ,  is a piece at Seeking Alpha .
And Jeremy Siegel , author of Stocks for the Long Run , says he has never seen such great bargains .
What this tells us is that people are still optimistic .
Still hoping .
Still thinking positive .
Like us , they make lemonade out of every cloud see a silver lining in every glass and every cloud is half full of lemons , rather than half empty .
Something like that .
 Yes , the markets have been hit hard ,  they tell themselves .
 But they ’ll recover . 
Unfortunately , this is not depression thinking .
This is the kind of thinking that happens at the beginning of a depression .
Even after recent losses , most stocks are still selling for 15 times earnings — or more .
When you get to the bottom , that multiple goes down to 5 — 8 .
And while stocks have lost 50 % of their value we remind readers that at the bottom in ’ 32 and Japan ’s bottom now stocks were down 90 % .
And when you get to a real bottom , you do n’t hear people talking about  the long road back  or what bargains you can get or signs of a bottom .
Instead , they ’re convinced that there is no going back that stocks are expensive at any price and that the slump will never end .
No , dear reader , we ’re not at the end of the slump we ’re not at the beginning of the end or even the end of the middle
we ’re only at the beginning of the middle .
We have our  Crash Alert flag flying because we believe there is another 50 % drop coming .
But it may not come right away .
It would n’t be at all surprising to see a major rally , such as happened following the crash of ’ 29 and the crash in Japan .
Stocks could rally to more than 9,000 on the Dow .
Mr. Market is a perverse old coot .
If he is going down he wants to take as many investors with him as possible .
So he fakes them out moving sharply to the upside in order to make them think the bear market is over .
And then he takes them all down
if we ’re right , this bear market wo n’t end until the Dow trades under 5,000 and possibly under 2,000 .
And it wo n’t end until the price of gold and the Dow are about the same number .

Rare Roman glass bowl found 1,700 years after it 's buried next to merchant in East London
This beautiful translucent dish belonged to a wealthy East Londoner living in Roman Britain 1,700 years ago .
The rare ' millefiori ' bowl - meaning ' one thousand flowers ' was unearthed by archaeologists in London and is thought to be the first find of its kind in the western Roman empire .
Researchers believe it will give fresh insight into life in Roman Britain .
The dish is made up of hundreds of translucent blue indented glass petals , bordered with white embedded in a bright red glass background .
A complete Roman millefiori dish found at an excavation site on Prescot Street , Aldgate
Millefiori is a glass working technique using glass rods with multi-coloured patterns that are only visible at the cut ends - like a stick of rock .
The delicate artefact has been painstakingly pieced together from the many fragments found during excavations in Prescot Street , Aldgate , in East London .
Glass experts say it is the first time such a complete dish has been found outside of the eastern Roman empire - where finds like this have been made in Egypt and surrounding areas .
Archaeology conservator at the Museum of London , Liz Goodman , holds the dish
It will go on display at the Museum of London in Docklands .
The dish was found in the grave of the Roman East Londoner whose cremated remains were uncovered , probably buried in a wooden container , in a cemetery in Londinium 's eastern quarter .
A number of other ceramic and glass vessels were also ranged along the sides of the casket , suggesting a rich and unusual burial .
The dish was found on Prescot Street in east London
Liz Goodman , Museum of London archaeology conservator , said : ' Piecing together and conserving such a complete artefact offered a rare and thrilling challenge .
' We occasionally get tiny fragments of millefiori , but the opportunity to work on a whole artefact of this nature is extraordinary .
' The dish is extremely fragile but the glasswork is intact and illuminates beautifully nearly two millennia after being crafted . '
The dish is made up of hundreds of translucent blue indented glass petals , bordered with white embedded in a bright red glass background .
The pieces were found with other ancient artifacts ( right )
Guy Hunt , director of the firm L - P: Archaeology , said : ' The dig at Prescot Street produced an amazing range of Roman cemetery archaeology .
' It is fantastic for us that one of the many finds is such an exciting and beautiful object .
It is great to be able to put an object such as this into context and to get a first - hand impression of a rather wealthy East Londoner . '
It 's hard times .
As our nation 's needs soar , and charitable donations plunge , it is taking its toll on the nonprofit sector .
Foodbanks , soup kitchens , and many other nonprofits that address the hunger issue are being hit by a triple whammy .
Cash and food donations are dropping , budgets are being cut , and with unemployment rising there is more demand than ever at food banks .
That 's why I 'm taking the pledge to end hunger because if we all do a little bit - it can go a long way .
And You can too !
PledgeToEndHunger.com , a website designed to shine a bright light on the very real problem of childhood hunger in America .
It is designed to make it easy for people to do something meaningful in the short - term and create a dialogue about solving the root issues .
I 'm honored to be serving as co-captain of the Wall of Champions campaign along with Chris Brogan .
Our goal is to encourage individuals , corporations , and non-profit organizations to help promote this website and help us obtain at least 1,000 pledges .
To become a Champion , all you need to do is :
Sign the Hunger Pledge
Write a blog post ( if you have one ) endorsing the Hunger Pledge
Encourage others to join you
One Click Feeds 140 Kids
To give you some incentive , by simply signing an online pledge to share the website with others , volunteer , and / or give , you will trigger a 35 lb food donation from Tyson of food products to the Capital Area Food Bank of Texas .
This will provide 140,000 meals for children in Austin .
That means every person who joins the movement will help feed 140 children .
With thousands of social industry folks coming together for South by Southwest 2009 ( SXSW ‘09 ) in Austin , we 're hoping to get 1,000 people to take the pledge , so we can make sure the Tyson semi- trailer will arrive in Austin during the SXSW ’09 interactive festival .
How This Can Help Your Community , Too
If we are successful in surpassing 1,000 pledges , Tyson has agreed to send up to two more truckloads of food to the states who generate the most pledges .
So by helping us send a semi- trailer truck to Austin , you might be able to get one sent to your home state , too .

Last week I showed you that it 's a really good idea to put a bio and homepage link in your Twitter profile if you want followers .
This week I 'm going to start drilling into the content of that bio .
The Twitter bio is yet another area of social media advice rife with guesswork ( " Do n't call yourself an expert or a guru ! " ) , but let 's look at the actual numbers and see what story they tell .
Using Twitter Grader data again ( we have over 1.6 million users in our database ) I compared the average number of followers of users with various common words in their bio .
If users with a certain word had 100 more followers than average I graphed it as positive 100 ( a blue line to the right on the graph ) , if they had 100 fewer followers I displayed that as a negative number ( a red line to the left ) .
In every case I only analyzed words that occured in more than 100 bios .
First up is the title you apply to yourself in your bio .
There are two big takeaways here : " official " Twitter accounts are popular and the words " guru " and " expert " do not do anything negative to the number of followers , in fact those users tend to have quite a few more followers .
Next , I looked at the words often used to describe a user 's occupation .
Again , there 's a clear story : Marketer 's and entrepeneurs tend to have more followers than the rest .
What happens when you specify the subject of your tweets in your bio ?
Here we see that marketing has lots of followers , while music does not .
Another surprising data point is self - declared political leanings :
It turns out that conservatives and Republicans ( especially those aligned with the # tcot hashtag ) have far more followers than not only liberals and democrats , but also the average Twitter user .
Since Twitter is popular with " mommy bloggers , " I also looked at the relationship between follower numbers and gender and family roles .
Here we see that spouses and parents have more followers than the average , while people who refer to themselves by the somewhat diminutive terms " boy " and " girl " have fewer followers .
While looking over the large list of commonly occuring words I noticed that lots of people use emoticons in their bio and nearly all of them have a negative relationship with follower numbers .
Kinky Sex Is on the Rise , Therapists Say Sex researchers : Sadomasochism , swinging and even bestiality are on the rise .
Feb . 11 , 2009  -- Eroticism is in the eye of the beholder .
In Japan , some women turn to electrically charged squid for sexual satisfaction .
In the American world of masochism , one man begged to be tied on a spit and roasted over sizzling coals .
His counterpart , a latex - loving dominatrix , reached ecstasy merely watching his pain .
What is abnormal may not necessarily be unnatural , according to sexologists who study the outer limits of the human psyche .
And , increasingly , as seen in a plethora of new books and films -- not to mention thousands of sites on the Internet -- kinky sex is getting more attention .
Click Here for the Latest Business Stories From ABC News
" To badly paraphrase Alfred Kinsey , [ who pioneered sex research in the 1940s and 50s , filming couples in flagrante in his Indiana attic ] , ' the only unnatural sex act is the one you can't perform , ' " said Robert Dunlap , a California sex therapist and filmmaker .
Paraphilias -- or socially unacceptable sexual practices -- are more common than most ordinary " vanilla " teleiophiles [ those who desire adults ] would imagine , according to Dr. Judy Kariansky , a sex therapist from Columbia University .
Though there is no hard data on what whether a spike in interest means a spike in actual activity , experts say anecdotally that couples are showing a marked interest in exploring new sexual intensity .
Dominatrix , Bondage , Flogging . . .
Barbecue
In his 2001 film , " Beyond Vanilla , " Dunlap interviewed more than 200 subjects who had one common denominator , some type of fetish -- bondage , flogging , knife play and fire , among others .
When asked " What is kinky ? " academics , doctors , lawyers and even a congressman , shared fantasies like , " sex with a taxi driver in the back seat , " " pouring candle wax on his testicles , " " arresting someone and patting them down on the bar , " " being gang - raped by many sets of twins , or better yet , triplets . "
The film was widely praised and used by the University of Minnesota medical department at conferences on human sexuality and development .
Today , Dunlap is in negotiations for release of his latest film , a biography of the life of Xaviera Hollander , the madam who brought kinky sex out of the closet in 1971 with her book , " The Happy Hooker . "
His documentary earned early acclaim at numerous film festivals .
Also out this year are two books that appeal to those interested in sex outside the normal boundaries and that explore a world where pain , pleasure and often guilt intertwine .
One , " The Other Side of Desire , " is a journalist 's exploration of " the far realms of lusting and longing , " including that reference to the pain aficionado who ordered her " servants " to barbecue her willing submissive .
Another , " The Adventurous Lover , " which is part of the new " Joy of Sex " series , is a handbook for couples who want to experiment in a safe environment .
Kinky Sex on the Internet , Books , Movies
" It 's a totally new revolution and it 's really exploded , " Dunlap told ABCNews.com .
" The Internet has changed everything .
So many people can go online and say , ' This is me .
I love this .
I am finding like types . ' "
And for those who think this phenomenon might encourage anti-social behavior , he counters , " I do n't think anyone was really damaged or hurt by book or movie . "
Columbia 's Kuriansky agrees that " what 's weird , sick or kinky for you is what practitioners defend as ' normal ' for them . "
" Credit , or blame , the Internet , making information available in such a level playing field that outrageous acts have become so accessible they seem mainstream , " she told ABCNews.com .
Throughout history kinky sex has emerged in myth , literature and in anthropology .
Urban legends still persist that Catherine the Great had a special relationship with her horse .
Dunlap cites studies that in some African cultures , older women guide younger boys into their manhood and are " revered . "
Couples Search for Sexual Intensity
But today , according to sex - perts , couples are looking for more intensity in sex lives , and interest in sado - masochism appears to be rising .
" After the pain threshold is crossed , they describe a type of ecstasy called ' flying , " Dunlap found in his research .
" It is no longer painful and gives an entirely sexual as well as psychological , transcendent place .
Flying is bigger than any drug . "
British relational therapist Susan Quilliam , whose revision of the 1972 classic , " Joy of Sex " sold 30,000 copies in three weeks when it was released this year in the U.S. , confirms , " A lot is changing culturally . "
" First of all , we live in a more sexualized society and there 's the Internet , " she told ABCNews.com .
" Interest groups communicate with each other and reinforce their identity . "
" It gives people permission and normalizes it and encourages them to explore the outer boundaries of their preferences , " she said .
And now , her spin - off book , " The Adventurous Lover , " is being billed as " perfect for the couple who want to push the boundaries : sections include fantasy , fetish , sex - clubs , foursomes and bondage . "
Quilliam , who doles out advice on her " Sex in the City " radio show , has seen an increased interest in BDSM – or bondage , dominations , sado - masochism , as well as " swinging . "
Creating a " safe " arena for experimentation is critical , she said , and couples should have special words , should they be uncomfortable , to call for " an immediate halt to the activity . "
Dangers of Swinging : Love
She also warns , " Be careful , very careful if have a fantasy and you 're putting it in to reality .
It often disappoints . "
" It has to be safe , sane and consensual , " she said .
Universal Taboo : Incest
According to Hani Miletski , a Maryland sex therapist and author of the 2007 book , " Mother - Son Incest : The Unthinkable Broken Taboo Persists , " a search for the words " mother son incest " yields nearly two million links on the Internet .
Clearly an abusive behavior , she said it " breaks down the natural development of boys ' sexuality . "
Miletsky wrote another book -- " Understanding Bestiality and Zoophilia " -- after one of her patients admitted a " love affair " with his dog .
She interviewed nearly 100 men who had indulged .
" People do it with all kinds of animals , " she told ABCNews.com .
" A lot of people are into dolphins and other sea animals . "
" We also found a minority who prefer animals to humans , " she said .
" It 's like a sexual orientation and they marry animals and treat like spouse whole love affair . "
Such was the case with one man who had a relationship with his horse , according to Daniel Bergner , whose book , " The Other Side of Desire , " just arrived in bookstores .
" I find I am closer to horses , " the zoophile told Bergner , citing the " trust factor . "
Guilt - Ridden Husband With Foot Fetish
Bergner said he sees his characters as " metaphors for our own states of longing " and explores whether sexuality is defined by genetics , as many neuroscientists believe , or through " cultural scripts . "
Studies by sexual anthropologist Gilbert Herdt of San Francisco State University reveal that in Papua New Guinea young boys are shepherded through their budding sexuality by engaging in ritualized homosexual oral sex with adolescents , ultimately embracing heterosexuality and siring children .
" Experience molds us , " Bergner told ABCNews.com .
" There 's a sense that a charged experience , whether it is shame , or the opposite -- and pain can easily get mixed with pleasure -- leaves a sexual imprint . "
Jacob , who was so ashamed of his foot fetish that he would not share the " monstrosity " with his wife , had struggled painfully through school .
One psychiatrist suggested that the fetish began fear , as Jacob looked down , away from the teacher 's gaze .
" That moment of terror got translated into an erotic sense of feet , " Bergner said .
" What we fear , we take control of . "
Sympathy for Some
" These two people have transformed each other 's lives , " he said .
" Lust and love here are inseparable and redemptive . "
Bergner and others who have interviewed those who cross boundaries most humans would regard as dark territory , say the compulsive power that compels them is part of the universal human story .
" No one wants to talk about Freud any more , " he said .
" One thing he knew that no scientist or psychologist displaces is that this drive is so central , so essential , and so powerful .
The fact that we are living with that kind of powerful drive within in us is inherently threatening . "
" Part of me thinks people are more receptive and comfortable taking risks sexually , " said Bergner .
" But part of me thinks we are pretty much afraid -- afraid because the force of the erotic is pretty strong and probably anarchic , and therefore , maybe we worry that if we step a little over the boundaries , we might not be able to step back . "
Through this whole thing , I keep wondering why it took so long for this to happen ?
I mean , the things have been on the roadside for YEARS and only now they 're being " hacked ? "
The Election Technology Council ( ETC ) , a trade group comprised of the most prominent electronic voting machine vendors , has published a paper that argues against mandating source disclosure for electronic voting machine systems .
The paper ( PDF ) , which broadly conflates source disclosure and open source software licensing , dubiously contends that enabling public scrutiny of voting technology would lead to compromised security .
The ETC 's position is viewed with skepticism by both election transparency advocates and computer security experts .
Dan Wallach — a Rice University computer science professor who has testified about voting security issues before various government bodies — wrote a rebuttal , which was published last week on the Freedom to Tinker blog .
He laments the " distinctive cluelessness " of the ETC report and accuses the organization of misrepresenting the voting machine security studies that are cited in the document .
The ETC attempts to argue that mandatory source disclosure for voting technology would be abusive to vendors and detrimental to the soundness of the election process .
The most controversial aspect of the report is its assessment of the potential security risks associated with disclosure .
The ETC argues that the potential long - term security benefits of source disclosure are not applicable to electronic voting software .
In an open source software project , the availability of source code makes it possible for contributors to detect and repair vulnerabilities through a collaborative process of incremental improvement .
The ETC , however , argues that election software development is not entirely conducive to participatory incrementalism , because major voting machine software updates have to go through the Election Assistance Commission 's certification process .
According to the ETC , the regulatory process would make it difficult to rapidly deploy fixes when members of the public detect vulnerabilities .
The ETC also argues that the machines would be vulnerable to malicious attackers until the software reaches the point where it has attracted enough well - intentioned scrutiny that the holes are collaboratively found and patched .
Open source communities do not emerge overnight , the ETC says , so it 's unclear that disclosure would immediately lead to improvements .
" It is conceded that a pure open source development model may yield comparable benefits in the long - term .
However , taking a software product that was once proprietary and disclosing its full source code to the general public will result in complete forfeiture of the software 's security , " the report says .
Wallach does n't buy the argument .
The consensus in the security community is that obscuring vulnerabilities does n't insulate software from being exploited .
" Disclosing the source code only results in a complete forfeiture of the software 's security if there was never any security there in the first place , " he insists .
He points out that vulnerabilities are regularly found and exploited in proprietary software , even without access to the source code .
All that is needed to compromise the security of any opaque software system is access to the executables and a few common debugging tools .
As we have reported on several previous occasions , the physical security of voting machines is not especially robust .
There are many reported incidents , for example , where machines have been left entirely unattended .
Security studies have also determined that standard voting machine physical security mechanisms — such as " tamper - proof " locks and seals — are extremely easy to circumvent without leaving a trace .
This means that attackers could have ample access with which to devise exploits regardless of source code availability .
Researchers have consistently been able to detect vulnerabilities in commercial voting machines and generally contend that the lack of source code availability has n't made the process a whole lot more challenging .
It 's also worth noting that proprietary source code can be leaked to malicious parties without the knowledge or authorization of the vendor .
On the basis of that alone , it seems like depending on secrecy to protect the integrity of voting machine systems is utter folly .
Diebold — now called Premier Election Solutions — has suffered several public source code leaks over the years .
The ETC paper also makes some highly questionable claims about intellectual property .
The authors contend that mandatory source disclosure could potentially be unconstitutional , an assertion that is deeply misleading .
" If policymakers attempt to strip the intellectual property from voting system software , " the report says , " [ it raises ] the issue of property takings without due process and compensation , which is prohibited under the United States Constitution . "
There is little basis for including such a statement in a paper about the implications of code disclosure and voting transparency .
Nobody is suggesting that the government should forcibly seize the code of electronic voting machines so it can be distributed under an open source license .
Legislative mandates for code disclosure would never take that form .
Instead , the government could potentially require code disclosure as a preqrequisite for consideration in the voting machine procurement process .
There is absolutely nothing unconstitutional or unethical about that .
Further , it is disingenuous to suggest that disclosure would necessarily require intellectual property rights to be ceded .
As Wallach points out in his blog entry , you can have mandatory source disclosure without requiring distribution under open source licenses — meaning that vendors could open their code to public scrutiny but still retain possession of the copyrights and patents that would allow them to protect their investment .
Even if all voting machine vendors did use a common open source code base , it would not eliminate the financial incentive to build voting machines .
The major voting machine vendors are fundamentally selling hardware appliances , not software .
Their business model would continue to be sustainable even if all of the software on the machines was broadly available under an open source license .
In light of the countless technical problems that have been uncovered by expert studies of voting machines , it 's possible that the ETC 's opposition to code disclosure is motivated chiefly by embarrassment about the poor quality of the source code in commercial voting machines — and by a desire to obscure other failings , such as alleged intellectual property misappropriations .
Public scrutiny could expose a large number of technical problems that the vendors want to keep hidden , despite the risk to election integrity that these pose .

The price of oil is too important to be left to market forces .
Since the early 1970s , the world oil market has repeatedly failed to send price signals that allocate economic resources efficiently .
Governments of oil - importing nations should correct this market failure by fixing oil prices in internal markets at target levels high enough to set in motion technological and structural changes in the way their economies use oil and gas , while incentivizing increased domestic production .
The result will be steadily declining imports , and greatly increased certainty for decision - makers in the internal oil and gas markets .
The policy tool for achieving this is simple : an excise tax on oil imports equal to the difference between the target price and the prevailing world market price .
For political reasons , it would be expedient to combine this with a windfall revenue tax to confiscate domestic producer revenue above the target price .
This is a guest post by Dan Badger , whose Oil Drum name is badgerd .
Dan has worked as a policy analyst at the US Department of Energy and at the IEA .
He is currently involved with independent power and renewable energy projects in Europe , working for Babcock and Brown in London .
What Is Broken
Unlike democracy , the free market is not an end in itself , but a means to achieving economic efficiency .
When a market fails to do this , as many often do , it must be fixed by government .
The whipsaw prices generated by oil market forces between July 2007 and December 2008 have drowned out with noise any meaningful signals that prices may be trying to send to guide decisions by individuals and businesses about what to consume and how to invest .
And it is not only short - term prices that are being whipped .
Here is how the futures market priced crude oil for delivery in July 2012 at different times over the last 20 months :
July 2007 $ 65 / bbl
January 2008 $ 87/bbl
July 2008 $ 141/ bbl
February 2009 $ 64/bbl
Nor is it not only in oil futures markets that long - term forward curves move up and down in lock - step with “ next - month ” prices .
The long - term oil price predictions of economists in oil companies , banks and prestigious energy - consulting companies all fluctuate in response to short - term fluctuations ( and generally in concert with each other ) .
The lead - times between decisions and consequences for the stock of capital that produces and consumes energy are between 3 and 10 years .
When long - term oil prices rise by 215 % and then retreat to their original level over a period of 20 months , how can these price signals possibly lead to efficient decision - making and resource allocation ?
These volatile signals confound decision - making by oil and gas producers , consumers , manufacturers of energy - using technology , electric power producers , developers of alternative energy projects and technology , and bank financiers to all of the above .
Market forces have produced destabilizing transfers of wealth from importers to exporters , with damaging political consequences in many importing countries , and with troubling geopolitical consequences in some exporting countries .
And 2007 - 8 is only the most recent episode in a pattern of market failure since the early 1970s .
How to Fix It
To correct the market ’s chronic failure to price oil efficiently , governments of oil - importing nations should fix the price in internal markets using a simple policy tool : an excise tax on oil imports equal to the difference between a target price that each government would choose and the prevailing world market price .
Where imports are the marginal source of supply to a market , the price of imports sets the price for all production and consumption within that market .
The oil excise tax will therefore fix a floor price for oil , and guarantee that producers and consumers in the internal market will never face a price less than that floor price .
The stable pricing environment that results will enable the rational decision - making that the market fails to provide when left to its own devices .
The target price should be high enough to set in motion technological and structural changes in the way economies use oil and gas , while incentivizing increased domestic production .
However , the target should not be so high as to have a meaningful braking effect on economies .
The evidence of the last 18 months suggests that such a target lies in the range of $ 80 - 100 / bbl .
However , to smooth adjustment paths , it would be wise to begin with a $ 50 / bbl target , and to increase this annually to reach the $ 80 - 100 / bbl range after five years .
The higher price – and the elimination of uncertainty as to the long - term evolution of prices -- will cause market participants to make decisions with long - term effect to reduce domestic consumption , boost domestic production , and reduce imports .
For the USA , a target price of $ 50 / bbl in 2009 rising to $ 90 / bbl by 2014 could easily result in 10 % less consumption and 10 % more domestic production compared to a “ do - nothing ” scenario in which American consumers and producers are left to guess how long it will take for the market to strengthen and begin lifting prices above the current range of $ 30 - 40 / bbl .
The result of a 10%/10 % response to an excise tax would be 2.5 million b/d less in 2014 .
At a world price of $ 40 / bbl , this would mean $ 36 billion less US consumer wealth transferred to oil exporters annually .
If in the “ do - nothing ” scenario exporters would have managed by 2014 to increase the price to their target of $ 80 / bbl , the wealth kept at home as a result of the excise tax would be $ 72 billion annually .
And if the domestic consumption or production responses to the target price are greater than 10%/10 % , the saved domestic wealth would be commensurately greater .
At the same time that the excise tax avoids wealth transfer out of a country , it would transfer wealth from oil and gas consumers to producers and taxpayers within the country .
The relative gains and losses would depend on the country ’s domestic production as a percentage of its consumption , and tax rates .
For the USA , where domestic oil and gas production currently represents around 50 % of consumption on a value - weighted basis , a target internal price of $ 50 / bbl in 2009 would transfer $ 23 billion annually from consumers to US oil producers , and perhaps another $ 5 billion annually to US gas producers .
It would also transfer approximately $ 47 billion annually from oil and gas consumers to taxpayers , assuming other taxes are reduced by equivalent amounts so that the net effect of the excise tax is neutral .
By 2014 , assuming the 10%/10 % response in consumption and production , and a world price of $ 80 / bbl , a target domestic price of $ 90 / bbl would transfer around $ 25 billion annually from US oil gas consumers to US producers , and $ 45 billion annually from US consumers to US taxpayers .
For political reasons ( the strength of which will depend on the share of domestic production in supplying each domestic market ) , it may be expedient to combine the excise tax on imports with a tax to confiscate domestic producer revenues above the target price .
This ” windfall revenue ” tax is neither necessary nor detrimental to achieving the economic security objective of the excise tax .
However , most would agree that confiscating domestic producers ’ revenue above the target price would be an appropriate quid pro quo for guaranteeing that it will never be less than the target price .
Some Bad Reasons
Why This Is Not a Good Idea
1 . No politician or bureaucrat can know what the " right price " is for anything .
Only the market can determine this .
Markets only find the right price in text - books .
Adam Smith explained how the “ invisible hand ” produced prices that allocated resources efficiently in the markets for food and clothing in 18th century Europe .
But it has been apparent since the 19th century that markets for capital , for example , cannot be efficient without strict regulation .
So why should we be surprised to learn that 20th and 21st century markets for energy fail to allocate resources efficiently ?
Nor is the extensive body of academic literature devoted to the question of the efficient long - run price of oil very helpful for policy - making .
The rules prescribed by that literature ( e.g. [ Hotelling ] ) produce prices very different from those we find in the market , so it is tempting to believe they might be useful for policy - makers .
But these rules depend on the usual abstractions ( e.g. the assumption of “ perfect knowledge ” ) and ignore a variety of “ externalities ” that policy - makers must consider .
In reality , there is no single " right price " for oil .
However , given where we are today , what we can say with some confidence is that any price high enough to set in motion technological and structural change in the way our economies use oil , but not so high as to cause short - term damage , is a right price .
2 . By setting a target price higher than the market price , we merely invite exporters to raise the market price to the target price .
If you believe this , you do n’t understand how the world oil market works .
Oil exporters ( OPEC , Russia , and other fellow - travelers ) have their own target price , which is now reportedly between $ 60 and $ 80 / bbl .
But they are currently struggling to achieve the cohesion needed to shut in production sufficiently to achieve this target .
The import excise tax we propose would make it still harder for the exporters to achieve their target because it will reduce demand for their exports .
Exporters will not see our target prices as an invitation , but as a challenge .
In order to raise their market price to match our target price , exporters will have to demonstrate more cohesion – and accept more sacrifice -- than would be necessary to control the price of oil if we simply leave the world market to its own devices ( and those of the exporters ) .
3 . The “ free - rider ” problem : importing nations who choose not to raise the internal price will enjoy the benefit of the lower world market price , thereby gaining a comparative advantage over nations who do choose to raise the internal price .
Oil importers who decide to ride free in this way will gain a short - term comparative advantage , and many will choose to do so ( e.g. China , India , Brazil ) .
But this is not the kind of game in which no - one wins unless everyone plays .
There are good reasons for countries to choose long - term economic security over insecurity , even if their neighbours do not .
The oil price spike of 2007 - 8 was far more destabilizing in the USA both economically and politically than in the EU .
This was because EU countries have always taxed oil consumption much more than the USA , giving rise to denser patterns of habitation , higher reliance on public transportation , a more fuel - efficient vehicle fleet and a much lower oil - intensity of economies compared to the USA .
But few in the EU see their higher internal energy prices as a “ comparative disadvantage . ”
4. With America diving into the worst economic downturn since the 1930s , this is not the time to hit the struggling American consumer with massive energy price hikes .
Using the assumptions described above , around 60 % of the wealth extracted from USA oil and gas consumers would in the short term be transfered to taxpayers , so the impact on economic activity would be neutral to a first approximation .
The remaining 40 % of the wealth transfer would be to domestic producers who , in response to long - term certainty of higher prices , can be expected to invest this revenue in exploration and production , stimulating the economy .
And if policy - makers see evidence that producers are returning an extraordinary share of the revenue to shareholders rather than investing in exploration and production , supplemental income tax levies on oil and gas producers would be justified .

Time to trotter off :
The pig that woke up to find a tiger in his cage
For this odd couple , a nap is n't complete without a snuggle .
The fact that one is a tiger and the other a pig does n't seem to matter one bit .
In fact , tigers and pigs cuddling together is a common sight at the Sriracha Tiger Zoo in Thailand .
Nap time : A piglet and a tiger cub snuggle together at the Sriracha Tiger Zoo in Thailand
Rise and shine :
The tiger cub yawns and the piglet stretches its little trotter as the pair begin to slowly awaken
The zoo , located near Pattaya , a popular Thai beach resort , is one of the largest tiger zoos in the world .
More than 400 Bengal tigers are housed there - in some very unusual circumstances .
The zoo promotes ' happy families ' of mixed species - often mixing tiger cubs with sows and piglets with tiger mothers .
Cute : Left , the piglet and cub are blissfully dreaming .
Right , a tiger cub at the zoo with its adoptive mother - a sow
The 100 - acre zoo , which opened in 1997 , also boasts 10,000 crocodiles - though apparently they are not mixed with the tigers or pigs .
The crocodiles do wrestle with brave female handlers , however , the zoo claims on its website .
Elephants at the zoo play basketball and take part in fashion shows , while the tigers are trained to leap through burning hoops and the pigs race one another .

Austrian economists have long been critical of the static , unrealistic models of neoclassical economics and instead take a dynamic , causal - realist approach .
Similarly , the role of government , while receiving heavy analysis from Austrians , is taken as a given in most neoclassical models and textbooks , used today in almost all university economics courses .
Laying aside the Austrian critique of neoclassical models , an analysis of the role and characteristics of government — within the neoclassical framework — will show that this institution most closely resembles the model viewed as least efficient in terms of production and allocation of scarce resources .
The government is not a deus ex machina .
The question of where the government fits into the neoclassical framework demands an answer .
It can not just be assumed that any market " inefficiencies " ( in the neoclassical sense ) could be limited or eliminated by government , when government itself is arguably the most inefficient of all institutions .
In the neoclassical view , there are four market models that can exist in a society , all of which are described as having degrees of costs and benefits .
Based on this analysis , the models could be ranked according to how efficiently goods are produced and allocated .
The role of government in such models is usually taken as a given — it is an existing institution , smuggled in with many ( false ) assumptions , unexamined , and excluded from economic analysis .
In this article , I will ( a ) briefly review the neoclassical models and ( b ) apply them to the US government in order to ( c ) analyze which model — perfect competition , monopolistic competition , oligopoly , or pure monopoly — corresponds most closely with characteristics of the federal government of the United States .
Neoclassical models can be analyzed by looking primarily at the following characteristics of each model : number of firms , control over price , and ease of entry .
The Four Models
In the neoclassical model of perfect competition , there is a relatively large number of firms offering a standardized product or service with no control over price .
Firms are " price takers " and face a horizontal demand curve , by which it follows that price equals marginal revenue .
Because of the extreme amount of competition , the rationale is that if an individual firm increases its price , consumers — possessed with perfect information and no switching or transactions costs — will turn to one of its many competitors .
The firm that raises its price will lack customers and , therefore , revenues .
It is very easy to enter ( and exit ) the industry , and there is no nonprice competition , e.g. , advertising or product differentiation .
Firms earn a " normal profit , " breaking even , where marginal revenue ( and price ) equals marginal cost and total revenue equals total cost .
This imaginary world may be labeled " ideal " due to its productive and allocative efficiency .
In monopolistic competition , there are also many firms , but with differentiated products ( through advertising , location , service , brand name , etc. ) .
Firms possess some control over price , but , unlike perfect competition , firms do face a downward - sloping demand curve .
It is relatively easy for new firms to enter and compete in this model .
Inefficiencies are typically " allowed " to exist because , although the model is not efficient , consumers benefit from product differentiation and choice .
In the oligopoly model , there are only a few large firms offering standardized or differentiated products .
These firms are constrained by mutual interdependence that may lead to collusive behavior , although this is illegal .
Collusion of firms may lead to a de facto monopoly , thus charging a monopoly price and producing a monopoly output .
In other words , this model , like monopoly , underproduces and overprices relative to pure competition .
It is also difficult to enter and compete in an oligopolistic industry .
The final model , pure monopoly , is where only one firm exists and sells a unique product with no close substitutes .
The firm is the industry because of its ownership of resources , patents , or economies of scale .
The pure monopoly firm has considerable control over price — although not absolute , as it also faces a downward - sloping demand curve — and can restrict product availability .
Entry barriers are very high ; it is essentially impossible for new firms to enter .
One identified failure of the monopoly model is that a monopolist will charge a price in the elastic portion of its demand curve ( where marginal revenue is positive ) .
A monopolist underproduces and charges a higher price ( relative to perfect competition ) .
Characteristics of Government
Having briefly explained the models , we can now attempt to answer the question , which model does government most closely fit ?
While Austrolibertarians knew the answer from the beginning , a review of government 's attributes will make the answer — or at least its justification — clearer .
One difficulty with analyzing the US government is that it consists of seemingly endless programs and bodies .
Therefore , in order to allocate government to one of the four models , its most - commonly - agreed - upon functions — judicial and military protection — will be used to analyze number of firms and ease of entry .
Taxation and control over ( monetary ) inflation will be used to consider control over price .
Number of Firms and Ease of Entry
In terms of judicial protection , the US Supreme Court has exclusive judicial power .
It is the " final arbiter of the law … [ and ] functions as guardian and interpreter of the Constitution . "
Competition in law and legislation is not merely difficult — it is illegal .
If a citizen has a dispute with the government , it takes place in a government court .
Although simplified , it should not be difficult to see the problem with one party holding its own proceedings and deciding the outcome .
Rothbard explained this in For a New Liberty :
[ W]e turn over all of our powers of ultimate decision - making to this deified group , and then we must jolly well sit back quietly and await the unending stream of justice that will pour forth from these institutions — even though they are basically judging their own case .
Not only does the US government claim ultimate decision - making authority in the court system ; it is in complete control of national defense , where it is also illegal to compete .
Individuals may not start up National Defense Firm B and attempt to lower costs through diplomacy , since war is costly in terms of lives and money .
This is the function Rothbard believed was
reserved most jealously by the State .
It is vital to the State 's existence , for on its monopoly of force depends its ability to exact taxes from the citizens .
Protection and defense services would surely be in demand in a free society , i.e. , without government provision of them .
Yet the utilitarian question of whether or not such services would be better provided by the private sector seems to answer itself with the number of YouTube videos exposing police officers abusing their power .
The apposite question is more likely to be , could private cops be any worse ?
Control Over Price
To analyze control over price , income tax will suffice as an appropriate measure .
According to the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution 's Tax Policy Center , " the individual income tax has been the largest single source of federal revenue since 1950 , averaging just over 8 percent of GDP . "
In 2008 , 45 % of federal tax revenue came from individual income taxes , or over one trillion dollars .
In terms of government 's control over " price " through taxation , government cannot necessarily set its price as high as it wants for fear of a potential revolution by the population .
However , with self - granted access to the unlimited printing of money through inflation , the less seen price — the hidden tax — may be almost as high as the government wishes .
The important point is that government is not a " price taker " as in the perfect - competition model ; its price is also not constrained by mutual interdependence as in the oligopolist model .
Similar to the pure - monopoly model , government , through tax and access to a printing press , can exercise great control over its " price " ; it is a price maker .
However , there is an important difference between government and pure monopoly .
Even in the neoclassical pure - monopoly model , individuals are making voluntary exchanges , with each party expecting to benefit .
In contrast , government force to extract taxes creates an " exchange " where one party benefits at the expense of the other .
This creates a conflict between classes of net taxpayers and net tax consumers .
Unlike even pure monopoly — that most dreadful of neoclassical models — it is only the government ( and a criminal gang ) that obtains its " revenue " through force .
Conclusion
This article sought to analyze the US government and place it into one of the four neoclassical models , leaving aside the Austrian critique of such models .
By now the obvious answer should be that government most closely corresponds to the pure - monopoly model , the model viewed as least efficient by neoclassical economists .
As demonstrated above , the government is in many cases worse than the pure - monopoly model .
There is only one " firm " ; it is illegal to compete ; and price is controlled through tax and , especially , the ability to print money .
Neoclassical economists would argue that government can correct for ( alleged ) " inefficiencies " in the market through legislation , subsidies , and taxes .
However , government itself cannot be excluded from economic analysis and assumed to be able to remove inefficiencies .
As shown above , it is the most inefficient model that exists .
Neoclassicals , instead of viewing the government as savior to " inefficient markets , " should realize it is the least productive , gaining all of its revenue from others ' labor in the private sector .
In Man , Economy , and State , Rothbard explains government 's monopoly ownership in the following way :
[ I ] n all countries the State has made sure it owns the vital nerve centers , the command posts of the society .
It has acquired compulsory monopoly ownership over these command posts , and it has always tried to convince the populace that private ownership and enterprise in these fields is simply and a priori impossible .
Fortunately , Austrian economists have shown that every product and service can be offered privately , without the use of monopoly force through government .
Typically , neoclassical models assume government as a given , and as a means to step in and overcome " market failure . "
This amounts to turning a blind eye to one of the most powerful and dangerous institutions in all of history : the state .
It is a monopoly in the purest sense .
Many people assume that marijuana was made illegal through some kind of process involving scientific , medical , and government hearings ; that it was to protect the citizens from what was determined to be a dangerous drug .
The actual story shows a much different picture .
Those who voted on the legal fate of this plant never had the facts , but were dependent on information supplied by those who had a specific agenda to deceive lawmakers .
You ’ll see below that the very first federal vote to prohibit marijuana was based entirely on a documented lie on the floor of the Senate .
You ’ll also see that the history of marijuana ’s criminalization is filled with : RacismFearProtection of Corporate ProfitsYellow JournalismIgnorant , Incompetent , and / or Corrupt LegislatorsPersonal Career Advancement and GreedThese are the actual reasons marijuana is illegal .
For most of human history , marijuana has been completely legal .
It ’s not a recently discovered plant , nor is it a long - standing law .
Marijuana has been illegal for less than 1 % of the time that it ’s been in use .
Its known uses go back further than 7,000 B.C. and it was legal as recently as when Ronald Reagan was a boy .
The marijuana ( hemp ) plant , of course , has an incredible number of uses .
The earliest known woven fabric was apparently of hemp , and over the centuries the plant was used for food , incense , cloth , rope , and much more .
This adds to some of the confusion over its introduction in the United States , as the plant was well known from the early 1600 ’s , but did not reach public awareness as a recreational drug until the early 1900 ’s .
America ’s first marijuana law was enacted at Jamestown Colony , Virginia in 1619 .
It was a law “ ordering ” all farmers to grow Indian hempseed .
There were several other “ must grow ” laws over the next 200 years ( you could be jailed for not growing hemp during times of shortage in Virginia between 1763 and 1767 ) , and during most of that time , hemp was legal tender ( you could even pay your taxes with hemp — try that today ! )
Hemp was such a critical crop for a number of purposes ( including essential war requirements - rope , etc. ) that the government went out of its way to encourage growth .
The United States Census of 1850 counted 8,327 hemp “ plantations ” ( minimum 2,000 - acre farm ) growing cannabis hemp for cloth , canvas and even the cordage used for baling cotton .

Saudi Arabia is ruled under an austere and patriarchal form of Sunni Islam Media reports say an arranged marriage between a Saudi girl aged eight and a man in his 50s has been annulled , in a case attracting worldwide criticism .
The Saudi Gazette says the divorce was agreed in an out - of - court settlement after a judge rejected two attempts to grant the girl a divorce .
The case prompted Saudi officials to say it would start regulating the marriages of young girls .
Rights groups say some Saudi families marry off young daughters for money .
The judge who first heard the case in the town of Unaiza refused to end the marriage at the request of the girl 's mother , but he stipulated the groom could not have sex with the girl until she reached puberty .
The girl 's father is said to have married her off against her mother 's wishes to a close friend in order that he could pay off a debt .
A new judge was appointed to oversee the case , who issued the annulment after the husband finally gave up his insistence that the marriage had been legal , reports say .
Saudi Arabia implements an austere form of Sunni Islam that bans free association between the sexes and gives fathers the right to wed their children to whomever they deem fit .
Saudi commentators pointed out that the marriage took place in the central province of Qaseem - the heartland of Saudi Islamic fundamentalism .
Earlier this year , the country 's highest religious authority , the Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz al - Shaikh , said it was not against Islamic law to marry off girls who are 15 and younger .
On 15 April , after this case generated considerable negative publicity , Justice Minister Muhammad Issa said he wanted to put an end to the " arbitrary " way in which parents and guardians could marry off their young daughters .
However , he he did not say that the practice would be banned .

Newt Gingrich thrashed the GOP for allowing Bush 's increased spending and not blocking Obama ’s early initiatives .
Gingrich : GOP - ers may form third party
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is warning fellow Republicans that conservatives may leave the GOP for a third party in 2012 .
“ If the Republicans ca n’t break out of being the right wing party of big government , then I think you would see a third party movement in 2012 , ” Gingrich said Wednesday during a speech at the College of the Ozarks in Missouri , the local television station KY3 reported .

Gingrich thrashed Republicans for allowing increased spending during the Bush administration and for not doing enough to block President Barack Obama ’s early initiatives .
“ Remember , everything Obama 's doing , Bush started last year , ” Gingrich said .
“ If you 're going to talk about big spending , the mistakes of the Bush administration last year are fully as bad as the mistakes of Obama 's first two , three months . ”
The former speaker also attacked the Democratic president on the economic stimulus package and for what he called his “ grotesque arrogance ” to oust Rick Wagoner as the head of General Motors .
“ During the period I was speaker , the U.S. government – for four years – total growth was 2.9 percent a year .
Under Bush , it was 6.1 percent .
...
This year , I think it will be 36 percent in one year , ” Gingrich said .
“ It is just literally irrational . ”
Here are the 10 tallest men to play the game of basketball in the NBA .
Some are lucky to be here just for their height and are hardly known to anyone not deeply involved with basketball , while others completed a very respectful and successful career in the NBA .
Here are those giants of the league throughout it ’s history , with recaps of their career and some highlights for those who did enough to deserve a highlight clip .
( hint : there ’s more than one player on this list that did n’t get one .
I guess when your career in the NBA carried on for a total of 3 minutes , you do n’t deserve one ) .
8th ( Shared ) – Ralph Sampson
Height : 7 ′ 4 ” ( 2.24 meters )
NBA career length : 9 seasons ( 1983 - 1992 )
Ralph Sampson to this day is still considered one of the greatest players in the college level , leaving Virginia with 3 ( !!!)
Naismith national player of the year awards .
He was expected to dominate the game once becoming pro and hyped as being an heir to Chamberlain and Russel .
He started out pretty well , winning Rookie of the year award for the 83 - 84 season after being picked 1st by the Rockets in the 1983 draft .
The 1984 draft added the Rockets with another big man phenom , Hakeem Olajuwon .
The two were nicknamed “ The twin towers ” and enjoyed a fruitful partnership their first 2 seasons together , reaching the NBA finals in 1986 , losing to the Boston Celtics .
Following the 1986 season Sampson began picking up injuries that riddled the rest of his career and never allowed him to return to the level of this first seasons , and after being traded to the Warriors in the 87 - 88 season never managed to become a significant contributor to any team he was on , finally retiring in 1992 after playing 8 games for Spanish club Unicaja Ronda .
Sampson left the game at the age of 32 , finishing a short and disappointing career as to what was expected of him when he came out of college .
NBA stats : 9 seasons , 456 games , 29.8 minutes per game , 15.4 points per game , 8.8 rebounds per game and 1.6 blocks per game .
He played for 3 All - Star teams .
8th ( Shared ) – Rik Smits
Height : 7 ′ 4 ” ( 2.24 meters )
NBA Career length : 12 seasons ( 1988-2000 )
The Dunkin’ Dutchman played his entire NBA career for the Indiana Pacers and is still one of the all - time fan favorites there .
He was drafted by the Pacers in the 1988 draft coming out of Marist College as the no.2 overall pick .
Despite starting his first season as back up for Steve Stipanovich he took over as starting center after Stipanovich ended his career with a terrible injury .
Smits took the chance with both hands and ended up on the All - Rookie first team that year , which was followed by a solid and successful career in which Smits scored in double figures each season he played , 95 - 96 being his best when he averaged 18.5 points per game .
Rik Smits went to the 2000 NBA Finals with the Pacers where they would lose to the Lakers in 6 games , and following that series Smits retired , stating his career long foot problems as the main cause .
NBA career stats : 12 seasons , 867 games , 26.6 minutes per game , 14.8 points per game , 6.1 rebounds per game and 1.3 blocks per game .
He participated in 1 all - star game .
8th ( Shared ) – Mark Eaton
NBA career length : 11 seasons ( 1982 - 1993 )
It ’s probably a freak accident that Eaton got to play in the NBA .
He preferred Water Polo to Basketball during high school and served as auto mechanic for a few years after high school , only to be discovered by an assistant coach from Cypress Junior College .
He played there before transferring to UCLA where he received very little playing time .
Despite not making any real impression with UCLA he was picked by the Utah Jazz in the 1982 draft , , going in the fourth round .
Eaton made an immediate impression showcasing his defensive abilities , and soon grabbed on to the starting center job for most of his career with the Jazz .
In his prime Eaton was an amazing shot stopper and defensive force , winning NBA defensive player of the year twice ( 1985 , 1989 ) .
During the 1985 - 1986 season Eaton blocked 5.56 shots per game , an NBA record .
His career average of 3.5 is higher than any other player who played in the NBA .
Eaton remained a premier shot blocker and defender during the late 80’s and early 90’s until injuries started taking their toll and forced Eaton to retire after the 92 - 93 season .
NBA career stats : 11 seasons , 875 games , 28.8 minutes per game , 6 points per game , 7.9 rebounds per game and 3.5 blocks per game .
He took part in one all - star game .
5th ( Shared ) – Slavko Vranes
Height : 7 ′ 5 ” – 7 ′ 6 ” ( 2.26 - 2.29 meters according to different sources )
NBA career length : 1 season ( 1 season is kinda exaggerating , we ’ll tell you about it later ) .
Vranes probably suffered from being so tall at such a young age , cause people actually expected him to be as good as he is tall .
At 18 was already snatched by Turkish giant Efes Pilsen but was moved around until the Knicks ( of course ) saw some sort of potential in him and decided to pick him in the 2nd round of the 2003 draft .
He did n’t get to play for the Knicks and was signed by the Portland Trailblazers , only to play one game for the team before his NBA career came to an end .
Since he has moved back to Europe , playing for Partizan Belgrade currently in Serbian League and the Euroleague .
NBA career stats : 1 season , 1 game , 3 minutes , 1 missed field goal , 1 personal foul .
Competes with Lauderdale for the worst player on this list .
5th ( Shared ) – Pavel Podkolzin
Height – 7 ’5 , 2.26 meters
The 21 overall pick in the 2004 NBA draft , Podkolzin amassed a total of six NBA games , scoring 4 points , playing for the Dallas Mavericks .
Since then , it ’s been the Russian League for him .
5th ( Shared ) – Chuck Nevitt
Height : 7 ′ 5 ” ( 2.26 meters )
NBA career length : 1982 -1994 ( 12 seasons )
There ’s an old basketball saying by Red Auerbach which said “ You ca n’t teach height ” and that ’s pretty much the story about Chuck Nevitt .
He was in and out of the league , he was on and off teams .
He got to play for the Lakers , Bulls , Pistons , Rockets and Spurs and even got to be on the 1985 Lakers championship squad .
If you add up his career minutes played total you get 18 total games played .
He never played more than 43 games in one season , about half an NBA season .
At least he got to be around some true legends .
NBA career stats : 9 seasons , 155 games , 5.3 minutes per game , 1.6 points per game , 1.5 rebounds per game .
3rd ( shared ) – Shawn Bradley
Height : 7 ′ 6 ” ( 2.29 meters )
NBA career length : 12 seasons .
Bradley got picked no.2 in the 1993 draft by the 76 ’ers and that probably hurt the beginning of his career , as he was expected to be a savior of a sick franchise at the time .
Bradley , like Eaton was a great shot blocker but was n’t as big as Eaton , thus suffering against strong inside men .
Bradley was notorious for picking up fouls very quickly which limited his playing time .
Only after moving to Dallas in 1997 it seemed Bradley was picking up and really getting comfortable with the NBA game , but after a few seasons , like every tall and lanky player , injuries started mounting up on his back and legs and his playing time and availability slowly started diminishing until he eventually retired after 2004 - 2005 season .
NBA career stats : 12 seasons , 832 games , 23.5 minutes per game , 8.1 points per game , 6.3 rebounds per game and 2.5 blocks per game .
3rd shared - Yao Ming
Height : 7 ′ 6 ” ( 2.29 meters )
NBA career length : 8 seasons
Recently retired , Ming hardly played any basketball after going down in the 2009 NBA playoffs against the LA Lakers .
Heading up to the 2011 - 2012 season , Ming announced his retirement , sparking debated about his eligibility regarding the NBA hall of fame .
Probably the most talented offensive player on this list , Ming , while certainly a game changer in terms of spreading NBA popularity across the globe , did n’t do enough in eight seasons with the Rockets to claim a berth in the Hall of Fame , in my opinion .
NBA career stats : 8 seasons , 486 games , 32.5 minutes per game , 19.0 points per game , 9.2 rebounds per game and 1.9 blocks per game .
He has taken part in 6 all - star games , usually receiving more votes than any other player because the vote is available on the Internet for users from all over the world .
1st Place ( Tied ) – Gheorghe Muresan
Height : 7 ′ 7 ” ( 2.31 meters )
NBA career length : 6 seasons
He shares the title of the NBA ’s tallest player ever with Sudanese born Manute Bol .
Muresan , born in Romania has a pituitary disorder that is the cause for his great height .
After playing for Cluj University he moved to France to play for Pau - Orthez , where he caught the eye of NBA scouts , and in the 1993 draft was picked by the Washington Bullets ( Wizards today ) .
Despite a promising start , injuries plagued his rookie season .
A good 94 - 95 season was followed by an even better 95 - 96 in which Muresan scored 14.5 points per game , grabbed 9.6 rebounds per game , blocked 2.3 shots per game and led the league in field goal percentage .
He won the most improved player of the year award in the end of that season .
96-97 Was n’t as good , and injuries plagued the rest of his career in which he was able to play only 32 games in the next 2 seasons for the New Jersey Nets .
He played another 3 seasons back in Europe before retiring and moving to live in the United States .
NBA career stats : 6 seasons , 307 games , 21.9 minutes per game , 9.8 points per game , 6.4 rebounds per game and 1.7 blocks per game .
1st place ( tied ) – Manute Bol
Height : 7 ′ 7 ” ( 2.31 meters )
NBA career length : 10 seasons ( 1985 - 1994 )
Together with Romanian giant Manute Bol is the tallest player to play in the NBA , and one of the nicest and popular among fans and teammates .
Manute Bol had a tough time before starting his NBA career , being declared ineligible to play after being picked in the 1983 draft .
It took him another 2 years before finally making it , being picked in 1985 draft by the Washington Bullets .
In his first season he set an NBA record for Rookies , blocking 397 shots , averaging just under 5 blocked shots per game .
Despite his blocking skills
Bol had many problems in the game because of his super - thin physique which troubled him against many of the stronger inside men of the league .
Later in his career Bol became fond of shooting 3’s , which in one season he hit 20 of them .
In blow out games it became a very popular habit for him and fans who enjoyed watching the giant chucking uncontested 3’s .
In the 92 - 93 , playing for the 76 ’ers , Bol hit 6 out of 12 in one game , with fans chanting “ shoot ” each time he touched the ball around the arc .
Like most players on the list , after the first few healthy years
Bol started missing large portions of the season due to injuries that eventually ended his career in the middle of the 94 - 95 season .
His final 2 seasons were more of a teacher job for him , mentoring Shawn Bradley and Gheorge Muresan as they developed into legitimate NBA Centers .
NBA Career stats : 10 seasons , 624 games , 18.7 minutes per game , 2.6 points per game , 4.2 rebounds per game and 3.3 blocks per game .
He is the only player in NBA history to block more shots than he has made , and is ranked 2nd behind Mark Eaton in Career blocks per game with 3.34 .
Here , courtesy of the Associated Press , is a morality tale for our age :
A man who says he desperately needed to use an airplane bathroom after eating something bad in Honduras faces a felony charge after being accused of twisting a flight attendant ’s arm to get to the lavatory , the F.B.I. said .
Joao Correa , 43 , told The Atlanta Journal - Constitution he had a bathroom emergency 30 minutes into a March 28 Delta Air Lines flight from San Pedro Sula to Atlanta but found the single coach aisle on the Boeing 737 blocked by a beverage cart .
He said he asked whether he could use the lavatory in business class but was told no .
When the cart was n’t moved after a few minutes , Mr. Correa said , he ran for the business - class lavatory .
He said the flight attendant put up her arm to block him and he grabbed it to keep his balance .
Well .
I should begin by saying I ’ve never been to San Pedro Sula so I do n’t know how bad the bad food there is .
I ’m sure Honduran cuisine — no oxymoron intended — is generally great , even though nobody has ever suggested to me : “ Hey , how about Honduran tonight ? ”
In a memorandum dated this Jan. 15 , five days before President George W. Bush left office , a top Justice Department official wrote that those opinions had not been relied on since 2003 .
But the official , Steven G. Bradbury , who headed the Office of Legal Counsel , said it was important to acknowledge in writing “ the doubtful nature of these propositions , ” and he used the memo to repudiate them formally .
Mr. Bradbury said in his memo that the earlier ones had been a product of lawyers ’ confronting “ novel and complex questions in a time of great danger and under extraordinary time pressure . ”
The opinion authorizing the military to operate domestically was dated Oct. 23 , 2001 , and written by John C. Yoo , at the time a deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel , and Robert J. Delahunty , a special counsel in the office .
It was directed to Alberto R. Gonzales , then the White House counsel , who had asked whether Mr. Bush could use the military to combat terrorist activities inside the United States .
The use of the military envisioned in the Yoo - Delahunty reply appears to transcend by far the stationing of troops to keep watch at streets and airports , a familiar sight in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks .
The memorandum discussed the use of military forces to carry out “ raids on terrorist cells ” and even seize property .
“ The law has recognized that force ( including deadly force ) may be legitimately used in self - defense , ” Mr. Yoo and Mr. Delahunty wrote to Mr. Gonzales .
Therefore any objections based on the Fourth Amendment ’s ban on unreasonable searches are swept away , they said , since any possible privacy offense resulting from such a search is a lesser matter than any injury from deadly force .
“ I can tell you I never want to see the movies that come by mail , ” is what Blockbuster chief executive Jim Keyes had to say during his company ’s most recent earnings call .
Well , apparently , someone does .
Netflix announced today that it has delivered its 2 billionth movie by mail — a huge number for a service that launched a decade ago .
Meanwhile , Blockbuster , a name that has been synonymous with movie rentals for much longer than that , is struggling to hang on to customers as they switch to over - the - mail options and more recently , over - the - Internet options for watching movies .
Truth be told , Blockbuster had tried ( and I guess still is trying ) to get into the rental - by - mail business , but it was too late to the game .
Now , Netflix has some 10 million subscribers , and is shipping two million movies a day , according to Reuters .
And , while most company ’s stocks have seen their values plummet in this weak economy , Netflix has seen its stock rise to all - time highs this year .
Compare that with Blockbuster ’s stock , which slipped below a dollar a share this year .
Blockbuster recently signed a deal with TiVo to distribute its movies digitally , but it ’s a place that again , Netflix got to well before Blockbuster .
And Keyes does n’t seem sold on the idea of digital distribution , noting recently that it is just the “ shiny new toy , ” and just a “ sliver of the industry . ”
Instead , Blockbuster seems much more bullish on the ideas of kiosks , which have worked well for Redbox , but again , Blockbuster will be coming very late to that game , and is doing so at a time when the shift is occurring to digital distribution .
Interestingly enough , Netflix ’s 2 billionth movie was a Blu-ray .
Netflix recently came under some fire for raising its Blu-ray rental rates .
And it ’s a niche audience , with some 90 percent of Netflix subscribers still on DVD - only rental plans .
The Blu-ray format itself is having trouble gaining a foothold , as people continue to balk at high Blu-ray player and disc prices , when compared to DVD .
A man in Alabama received the 2 billionth movie and won a lifetime membership from Netflix as a result .
Of course , he had to let everyone know that he rented Nick and Norah ’s Infinite Playlist .

The following is the third and final article in the series Psychiatric Drugging of Children .
The following is the third and final article in the series Psychiatric Drugging of Children .
Part 2 explains how a - year - old girl named Rebecca Riley died of an overdose after being diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar disorder by Dr Kayoko Kifuji , at Tufts New England Medical Center in Boston , and placed on a three - drug cocktail ....
Rebecca was betrayed on many different fronts .
She was betrayed by a doctor who diagnosed her with mental disorders without doing anything about her real - life situation -- a dysfunctional family .
Instead , Dr Kifuji took the " easy road " out and simply drugged her to death .
Drug companies also betrayed Rebecca by pushing their medications to achieve maximum profits , hiring " opinion leaders " to promote not only the drugs , but the fabricated " disorders " they say require medications .
" Promoting the idea that bipolar is a genetic disorder is causing extreme harm to lots of little children like Rebecca , " warns the director of Mindfreedom International , David Oaks .
In this case , he says , " the evidence seems to point towards her and her siblings having been abused and misdiagnosed as bipolar , considering that reports were filed against the father for child abuse .
" Mr Oaks faults the psychiatrist , " for failing to recognize that , when all of the children in a family exhibit a particular behavior , that it may not be because of some unproven genetic theory but because of the well proven idea that humans respond to the treatment they receive from other humans . "
" The bipolar diagnosis in young children is an absurdity and its drug cocktail treatment , an obscenity , when they prematurely close the door to otherwise potentially profound changes in family behavior , " says Dr Lawrence Diller , the author of " The Last Normal Child .
"
The Riley family is a truly tragic example of how the psycho-pharmaceutical complex operates .
The mental health professional provides each member with a diagnosis of a mental disorder serious enough to warrant a finding of disability , which makes them eligible for all pubic assistance programs , including medical coverage for office visits and drugs , and a family of life - long customers is created .
Michael and Carolyn were both unemployed , collected welfare , received disability benefits and lived in subsidized housing , according to a March 26 , 2007 Associated Press report .
" Michael Riley claimed to suffer from bipolar disorder and a rage disorder , " and " his wife told police she suffered from depression and anxiety , " the newspaper noted .
The drug companies alone were raking in close to three grand a month by drugging the three children in this one family alone .
According to Drug Store.com , the price of Catapres ( clonidine ) is $ 303 for 180 2 m tablets .
One hundred tablets of 100mg Seroquel sells for $ 388 , and 100 mg pills of Dapakote cost $ 289 per hundred .
Multiply the $ 3,000 by the 28 months that passed since Rebecca joined her siblings in the daily drugging regime and the total comes to about $ 84,000 .
Police reports note that Dr Kifuji saw all three children together in office calls -- how much she was billing Medicaid for those visits , God only knows .
Carolyn told police that she was taking Paxil for depression and anxiety and was also on prescription medication for migraines .
Paxil costs $ 309 for ninety 30mg tablets at Drug Store.com .
" There seems to be a clear correlation between the class of medication on patent and the diagnoses employed in psychiatry , " according to child and adolescent psychiatrist , Dr Peter Parry , senior lecturer at Flinders University in Australia .
In the 1980s , and especially the 1990s , he notes , when the new SSRIs ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants ) were the basis of the drug company profits and shareholder value , " we had an epidemic of ' depression ' and an explosion of antidepressant prescribing .
" Since the late 1990s , with SSRIs having some problems with suicidality and also coming off patent , he points out , " we have the emergence of a ' bipolar spectrum disorders ' epidemic including treating pediatric bipolar disorder with antipsychotics and anticonvulsants rebadged as mood stabilizers . "
The reports on Texas foster children covering the past several years provide support for this theory .
For instance , the top five most commonly prescribed psychotropic drugs to Texas foster children in 2007 , were Ritalin , Risperdal , Clonidine , Seroquel , and Adderall .
These five alone accounted for half of the $ 37.9 million spent on psychiatric drugs for foster children in 2007 , according to a report in the August 17 , 2008 Dallas Morning News .
The list for the top 10 diagnoses for children ages 6 to 12 in 2005 , shows bipolar disorder was diagnosed more often than depression .
Likewise , of the top ten drugs prescribed to this age group , Risperdal and Seroquel combined beat out the two antidepressants on the list by more than two to one .
There were 1,669 prescriptions for Risperdal and 1,103 for Seroquel , compared to 701 for Zoloft and 712 for Trazodone .
In fact , the only drug prescribed more often than Risperdal was Ritalin .
The antipsychotic Abilify also made the top ten list with 667 prescriptions .
In the three - year old toddler group , 25 were diagnosed bipolar and 23 with depression .
Combined , Risperdal and Seroquel , were prescribed 115 times , compared to 23 prescriptions for Mirtazepine ( generic Remeron ) , the only antidepressant on the list .
Risperdal also rated second highest in this age group , behind Clonidine .
Among the youngest children , age 0 to 2 , prescriptions for Risperdal and Seroquel had a combined total of 28 , compared to 8 for Mirtazepine .
The promotion of drugging " bipolar children , " has been enormously successful , says Dr Peter Breggin , author of the new book , Medication Madness .
Before the 1990s , doctors hardly ever diagnosed kids with bipolar .
In fact , Dr Breggin does not recall hearing of the diagnosis being given to children prior to the 1990s .
He points out that a recent survey showed a 40 - fold increase in children being diagnosed with bipolar disorder between 1994 and 2003 .
The survey also found that 90.6 % of the children were receiving psychiatric medications , including 60.3 % on mood stabilizers like Depakote and 47.7 % on antipsychotics like Risperdal and Zyprexa , with most kids on combinations , he reports .
" The advantages to the drug companies are obvious , " Dr Breggin says .
" If children get several drugs at once , several dozen over their childhoods , they transform from being patients into cash cows for psychiatry .
" The Drugs.com website reports that the more common side effects of Clonidine include : dizziness , drowsiness , fatigue , weakness , sedation , agitation , nervousness , nausea , and vomiting .
The side effects listed by Drugs.com for Depakote sprinkle capsules include : dizziness ; drowsiness , change in appetite , nausea , vomiting and trouble sleeping .
The site warns to seek medical attention right away if any of these " SEVERE side effects " occur when using Depakote sprinkle capsules : " Severe allergic reactions ( rash ; hives ; itching ; difficulty breathing ; tightness in the chest ; swelling of the mouth , face , lips , or tongue ) ; … changes in behavior ; … confusion ; … difficulty speaking ; difficulty urinating or other urination problems ; extreme tiredness ; … lack of energy ; loss of appetite ; loss of coordination ; … memory loss ; mental or mood changes ; … severe or persistent nausea , vomiting , … tremor ; … unusual weakness ; ...
" The FDA 's information sheet on Depakote has a back box warning for " Hepatotoxicity . "
" Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by non-specific symptoms such as malaise , weakness , lethargy , facial edema , anorexia , and vomiting , " the warning states .
" Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms , " the label warns .
" Liver function tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter , especially during the first six months .
" According to Pennsylvania psychiatrist , Dr Stefan Kruszewski , " Depakote is prescribed to many children for off - label uses such as mood disorders , anxiety , agitation , aggression . "
" We can anticipate a series of tragic outcomes from Depakote 's massive overuse , " he says .
" We can expect to see many patients with anemias , hepatic disease , diabetes type II , pancreatitis and other serious systemic and neurological dysfunctions .
" Some of the " less serious side effects " of Seroquel listed by Drugs.com include : dizziness , drowsiness , or weakness , anxiety , agitation , and nausea and vomiting .
The drug 's label contains a black box warning for Tardive Dyskinesia , which states : " A syndrome of potentially irreversible , involuntary , dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs .
" There is no known treatment for this disorder and the label warns that " Seroquel should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia , " and further states : " Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who appear to suffer from a chronic illness that ( 1 ) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs , and ( 2 ) for whom alternative , equally effective , but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate . "
" In patients who do require chronic treatment , the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought .
The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically . "
" Hyperglycemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics , including Seroquel , " the warning label states .
" Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia , and weakness , " it notes .
The safety and effectiveness of Seroquel for treating bipolar disorder even in adults has not been tested in trials longer than 12 weeks , according to the labeling information .
" The physician who elects to use Seroquel for extended periods in bipolar disorder should periodically re-evaluate the long - term risks and benefits of the drug for the individual patient , " the label warns .
"
The safety and effectiveness of Seroquel in pediatric patients have not been established , " it says .
" Anyone considering the use of Seroquel in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need .

In the Riley case , the police reports do not indicate whether Dr Kifuji ever ordered any medical testing for the children to check for potential harm caused by the three drugs .
On April 3 , 2008 , Boston attorney , Andrew Meyer Jr , filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against Dr Kifuji on behalf of Rebecca 's estate .
" This child was subject to mostly telephone prescriptions and a slipshod diagnosis , " he told the Boston Globe on April 4 , 2008 .
" They made her a 4 - year - old zombie , " he said .
" We do n't believe that she did suffer from bipolar or that this was the appropriate medication .
" Mr Meyer contends that even if a jury finds Rebecca 's parents guilty of murder , it does not alleviate Dr Kifuji of liability .
" The primary responsibility falls on this doctor , " he told the Globe .
" The failure of this doctor to respond to the warnings she was given and to thoroughly investigate the symptoms that her medication was causing ended with this very sad result here of a young girl dying , " he said .
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for the wrongful death and pain and suffering endured by Rebecca , as well as the loss suffered by her brother and sister , who are in foster care and have been named beneficiaries of her estate , the Globe reports .
On February 7 , 2007 , the day after Michael and Carolyn pleaded not guilty to murdering Rebecca , Dr. Kifuji entered into a voluntary agreement with the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine to not practice medicine pending an investigation .
" The Agreement entered into by Dr. Kifuji will remain in effect until further order of the Board , " according to a February 7 , 2007 press release by the Board .

Shortly after the expensive and clumsy nationalisation of Northern Rock I made a speech to a large dinner in London that we needed to move on from talking in billions about public finance .
I suggested we needed a new larger unit .
I proposed the “ Rock ” or £ 100 billion as the sensible unit for account , management and discussion .
We were clearly moving into an era of big government , where the odd billion was not worth discussing .
It was just small change .
A “ rock ” would buy you the NHS for almost a year , or a mortgage bank .
Strangely the government thought they could afford both .
In a few short months my proposal was blown out of the water by the terminal fascination this government has with RBS .
Now we all talk in trillions , if we wish to discuss the true and dreadful sate of the public finances .
I had come to the conclusion that the true liabilities of the state – including pension deficits , Northern Rock , PFI , PPP and Network Rail as well as the public debt the government recognises , reached about £ 2 trillion before the RBS adventure .
On top of this today we should add the £ 2 trillion of the RBS balance sheet , now that we own or about to own practically all the shares and clearly stand behind every last bad debt and foolish investment this wretched bank has ever made .
Or if you prefer not to consolidate this errant and overghty subsidiary , you need to account for the £ 0.5 trillion banking package last autumn which failed to work as intended , and the guaratees now being crafted for banks that will exceed another £ 0.5 trillion .
If you were being kind you would conclude the taxpayer in on the line for at least £ 3 trillion , or twice the National Income .
On private sector accounting rules it would be at least £ 4 trillion .
The public accounts are being shot to pieces .
Usual debate about whether to increase spending by a few billion or to cut taxes by a few billion have become futile against this huge move to mega buck spending on banks .
The government has developed a dangerous and expensive habit of propping banks in the dearest way imaginable .
I have not been blogging on the issue of Goodwin ’s pension pot , because it is a small diversion from the collosal waste of public money going on in subsidising and backing toxic debt
That is no surprise to friends of the first family .
The Obamas , after all , are city people , former community organizers who have long felt at home in the urban landscape .
Mr. Obama is the first president since Richard M. Nixon to be elected while living in a city neighborhood , in his case , Chicago ’s racially and economically diverse Hyde Park .
And the Obamas are now eager to explore the city beyond the White House walls .
“ They want their lives not to be confined solely to the White House but rather to become a part of the urban , vibrant fabric of D.C. , ” Valerie Jarrett , a senior adviser to the president and a close family friend , said in an interview .
Of course , the social schedule of the president and first lady is also a powerful political tool , a way to nurture political alliances and to cultivate political narratives .
The Obamas can enjoy their time out on the town while , at the same time , reaping potential dividends by reinforcing their promise to bring change to Washington and honing an image of openness and accessibility , some Washington watchers say .
“ Let ’s face it :
It ’s very good for getting re-elected , ” Letitia Baldrige , the White House social secretary to Jacqueline Kennedy , said of the Obamas ’ socializing .
“ It ’s a great bank of good will in which they ’re making deposits every day . ”
Political analysts say that the images of Mr. Obama hooting and hollering during a basketball game , eating a hot dog at Ben ’s Chili Bowl and watching the ballet with his wife and daughters  pastimes routinely broadcast to a national audience  may humanize a politician who is sometimes viewed as too cerebral and distant .
Dee Dee Myers , a former press secretary for President Clinton , said the outings allow Mr. Obama to project “ an accessible glamour ” and to convey a message of hope during bleak economic times .
( She said that even the gregarious Clintons never got out this much . )
It may not a good day to be a North Korean missile designer .
U.S. Northern Command announced today that North Korea last night launched a long - range Taepodong - 2 missile .
The missile 's first stage fell into the Sea of Japan , and the remaining stages – along with a satellite payload – landed in the Pacific Ocean .
" No object entered orbit and no debris fell on Japan , " the command said in a press release .
Not so , says North Korea .
The Associated Press quotes Korean Central News Agency as saying the missile successfully lofted its payload into orbit .
" The satellite is transmitting the melodies of the immortal revolutionary paeans ' Song of Gen. Kim Il Sung ' and ' Song of Gen. Kim Jong Il ' as well as measurement data back to Earth , " KCNA said , referring to North Korea 's founder and his successor .
Whether or not the experimental communications satellite Kwangmyongsong - 2 is in orbit – or in the ocean – this launch probably counts as more successful than a 2006 Taepodong - 2 test .
That missile disintegrated less than a minute after leaving the launch pad .
Over the next week , no doubt , we 'll see a lot of arguing about what North Korea 's launch test means .
For proponents of missile defense , it proves that North Korea is another step further to developing an ICBM capability .
And for missile defense critics , it shows that North Korea is still a long way from building a missile that could pose a credible threat to the United States .
UPDATE : That makes Kim & Co. " oh - for - three " on long range missile launches , Arms Control Wonk says .
" These guys really suck . "

When I come to work each day , whether as a commentator for TheStreet.com or a host of Mad Money With Jim Cramer , I have only one thought in mind : helping people with their money .
I fight to help viewers and readers make and preserve capital .
I fight for their 401 ( k ) s , for their 529s and their IRAs .
I fight for their annuities and for their life insurance policies .
I fight for their profits , trading and investing .
And in this horrible market , I fight to keep their losses to a minimum by having some good dividend - yielding stocks from different sectors , some bonds , some gold and some cash .
The lines are drawn pretty clearly :
If you can help people make money to be able to retire , enjoy life , pay for college , pay down debt , etc. , you are a " good guy , " so to speak .
If you take the other side of the trade , you are , well , let 's say , a less favored fellow .
And if you gun for the gigantic investor class that is out there that includes 90 million people in one form or another , whether it be 401 ( k ) s or individual stocks or pension plans , then you are on my enemies list .
Now some , including Rush Limbaugh , would say I am on another enemies list : that of the White House .
Limbaugh says there are only a handful of us on it , and if I am on it for defending all of the shareholders out there , then I am in good company .
Limbaugh -- whom I do not know personally , but having been in radio myself , know professionally as a genius of the medium -- says , " They 're going to shut Cramer up pretty soon , too , but he 'll go down with a fight . "
Limbaugh 's dead right .
I am a fight - not - flight guy , so I was on my hackles when I heard White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs ' answer to a question about my pointed criticism of the president on multiple venues , including the Today Show .
" I 'm not entirely sure what he 's pointing to to make some of the statements , " Gibbs said about my point that President Obama 's budget may be one of the great wealth destroyers of all time .
" And you can go back and look at any number of statements he 's made in the past about the economy and wonder where some of the backup for those are , too . "
Huh ?
Backup ?
Look at the incredible decline in the stock market , in all indices , since the inauguration of the president , with the drop accelerating when the budget plan came to light because of the massive fear and indecision the document sowed : Raising taxes on the eve of what could be a second Great Depression , destroying the profits in healthcare companies ( one of the few areas still robust in the economy ) , tinkering with the mortgage deduction at a time when U.S. house price depreciation is behind much of the world 's morass and certainly the devastation affecting our banks , and pushing an aggressive cap and trade program that could raise the price of energy for millions of people .
The market 's the effect ; much of what the president is fighting for is the cause .
The market 's signal can't be ignored .
It 's too palpable , too predictive to be ignored , despite the prattle that the market 's predicted far more recessions than we have .
Gibbs went on to say , " If you turn on a certain program , it 's geared to a very small audience .
No offense to my good friends or friend at CNBC , but the president has to look out for the broader economy and the broader population . "
How much I wish it were true right now that stocks played less of a role in peoples ' lives .
But stocks , along with housing , are our principal forms of wealth in this country .
Only the people who have lifetime tenure , insured solid pensions and rent homes but own no stocks personally are unaffected .
Sure that 's a lot of people , but believe me , they aspire to have homes and portfolios .
If we only want to help those who have no wealth to destroy , we are not helping the majority of Americans ; we are not helping the broader population .
You can argue , of course , that Obama inherited one of the worst hands in the world .
I had been a relentless critic of the Bush administration 's " stewardship " of the economy , calling repeatedly for changes to avert the disaster that I saw coming , although perhaps Gibbs has n't seen my CNBC meltdown .
Seemed pretty prescient to me .
I , like everyone else , have made less authoritative and wrong statements in the past , but that rant still stands as something that I am sure everyone in the Bush administrations '
Treasury and Fed listened to .
My calls to sell 20 % of your stocks in September at Dow 11,000 and then all of your stock if you need the money for the next five years at Dow 10,000 in October , might have eluded Gibbs , too .
But Obama has undeniably made things worse by creating an atmosphere of fear and panic rather than an atmosphere of calm and hope .
He 's done it by pushing a huge amount of change at a very perilous moment , by seeking to demonize the entire banking system and by raising taxes for those making more than $ 250,000 at the exact time when we need them to spend and build new businesses , and by revoking deductions for funds to charity that help eliminate the excess supply of homes .
We had a banking crisis coming into this regime , but now every area is in crisis .
Each day is worse than the previous one for this miserable economy and while Obama 's champions cite the stimulus plan , it 's really just a hodgepodge of old Democratic pork and will not create nearly as many manufacturing or service jobs as we hoped .
China 's stimulus plan is the model ; ours is the parody .
Sure there 's going to be some mortgage relief , but the way to approach that problem is to eliminate the overhang , which a $ 15,000 tax credit for existing home sales could have dented if not consumed .
I have offered a comprehensive plan of 4 % refinanced mortgages for all by the government , not just those many considered deadbeats , to eliminate moral hazard .
I have come up with a novel plan to cut the principal and spare the banks regulatory problems by offering them a certificate of equity , making them whole over time when the house appreciates in value , which will happen if demand is stoked and supply is shrunk .
I have offered a comprehensive bank plan to solve a systemic problem -- could all bankers really be malefactors of wealth , Mr. President , or given the endemic nature can't we just presume that it's an epidemic and finger - pointing is a worthless endeavor until things get better ?
Like after Pearl Harbor -- let 's win the war and then investigate , and even try and convict the bad actors , instead of demonizing everyone who works at a bank right now , when we need them to right themselves without too much taxpayer help .
Which leads me to the true irony of not being political : I do n't like talking politics .
It is personal , but some things are a matter of public record , including my substantial six figure donations to the Democratic Party before I was no longer allowed to contribute by contractual agreement .
I regard two Democratic governors as my friends , and helped back one of them in a major financial way and spoke and campaigned directly for the other .
I also made it clear in a New York magazine article that I favored Obama over McCain because I thought Obama to be a middle - of - the - road Democrat , exactly the kind I have supported all my adult life , although I will admit to being far more left - wing during my teenage years and early 20s .
To be totally out of the closet , I actually embrace every part of Obama 's agenda , right down to the increase on personal taxes and the mortgage deduction .
I am a fierce environmentalist who has donated multiple acres to the state of New Jersey to keep forever wild .
I believe in cap and trade .
I favor playing hardball with drug companies that hold up the U.S. government with me - too products .
But these are issues that we have no time for now , on the verge of a second Great Depression .
This is an agenda that must be held back for better times .
It is an agenda that at this moment is radical vs. what is called for .
I am proud to have voted for the Obama who I thought understood the need to get us on the right path , and create jobs and wealth before taxing it and making moves that hurt job creation -- certainly ones that will outweigh the meager number of jobs he 's creating .
Most important , I believe his agenda is crushing nest eggs around the nation in loud ways , like the decline in the averages , and in soft but dangerous ways , like in the annuities that can't be paid and the insurance benefits that will be challenging to deliver on .
So I will fight the fight against that agenda .
I will stand up for what I believe and for what I have always believed : Every person has a right to be rich in this country and I want to help them get there .
And when they get there , if times are good , we can have them give back or pay higher taxes .
Until they get there , I do n't want them shackled or scared or paralyzed .
That 's what I see now .
If that makes me an enemy of the White House , then call me a general of an army that Obama may not even know exists -- tens of millions of people who live in fear of having no money saved when they need it and who get poorer by the day .
Cicadas might have used their wily prime number scheme to dodge 2 and 4 year predators , but what about a predator with continual exponential growth ?
The microcircuitry industry has reliably doubled the density of transistors on a chip every 2 years , as observed by Gordon E. Moore in 1965 .
This exponential density growth trend is known as Moore ’s law , and satisfying it requires that nanofabrication techniques are constantly embraced , devoured , then cast aside .
Unlike fish and birds , Moore ’s law is n’t interested in the cicada ’s insect innards , but rather its wings .
The transparent wings of a cicada look anything but glassy under SEM magnification .
Cicada wings are covered in a surprisingly regular carpet of close - packed micropillars , approximately 400 nm high .
( For scale , E. coli bacteria is roughly 2,000 nm . )
To the cicada , these pillars are for reducing wing reflectivity .
To the nanofabrication industry , these pillars are a perfect geometry and chemistry to make high - resolution stamps .
Nanoimprint lithography , the use of stamps to create tiny features on wafers and chips , is an advancement of photolithography .
To make features using photolithography , UV light is shone through a computer - generated mask to create patterns on a photosensitive surface .
The light changes the surface coating ’s solubility so that parts of it can be washed away in a liquid developing solution .
This bares parts of the wafer ’s surface , leaving them vulnerable to etching with chemicals or plasma .
The resolution limit of photolithography is the wavelength of the UV light .
It generally can’t produce features smaller than 300 - 460 nm .
But Moore ’s law is a resolution glutton , and it surpassed the need for 400 nm features long ago .
To go smaller , we can use smaller beams like X -ray , or turn to different patterning strategies altogether .
By using tiny stamps to blot on protective coating , nanoimprint lithography is limited only by the size of the stamp feature .
The 80 - nm pillar - tips of the cicada ’s wing , along with its nonstick surface chemistry , make it an ideal tool for nanoscale templating .
Pictured below are microwells that were made with a process using cicada wing stamps .
Cicadas , there ’s a loophole for you to exploit .
The researchers ca n’t use a dirty cicada wing .
Normal stains on cicada wings stick their pillars together , making them useless for stamping .
A cicada wing has to be cleaned with acetone before stamping .
Savvy cicadas can coat their wings with superglue , since acetone does n’t do much to cyanoacrylates .
Godspeed !NOTE : I assume no responsibility for reduced flight capability due to heavy , crackly superglue wings .

Doctors were stunned when an Englishman awoke from a brain operation in the UK and started speaking with a thick Irish accent .
Chris Gregory was born and bred in Sheffield , Yorkshire , and has no family ties with Ireland .
But when he came round after three days on a life support machine in the intensive care unit , he spoke in a Dublin accent for almost half an hour .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Seeing his wife Mary standing at his bedside , the 30 - year - old landscape gardener said : " You 're the fabbest girl I know " , and sung her a version of ' Danny Boy ' .
But his accent had disappeared by the time relatives arrived at Sheffield 's Royal Hallamshire Hospital the following day .
Now totally recovered , Chris and his new wife are planning to take a trip across the Irish Sea for the first time .
Mary , 36 , said : " I just could n't take it in at first , it seemed so comical , but it did n't matter at all because I 'd been so worried about losing him altogether .
" Chris 's Yorkshire accent had vanished completely , and he was talking like an Irishman all the time . "
Specialists have linked the phenomenon to a little - known condition called Foreign Accent Syndrome which can affect the control of the lips , tongue and vocal cords in extremely - rare neurological cases .
Mr Gregory said : " I just do n't a remember a thing about it - I wish I 'd been able to listen to it all , but I do n't have any recollection of what happened when I came round .
" I 've never had any connection with Ireland or the Irish people , that 's what makes it so odd , but I 'm looking forward to going over there for the first time . "
The syndrome was first discovered and named in Norway in 1941 when a young woman injured in a bombing raid woke up speaking with a German accent .

VIENNA , Va. ( CNN ) --
The acting chief financial officer of mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac , David Kellermann , was found dead Wednesday morning , police said .
The death " may have been an apparent suicide , " said Lucy Caldwell , a spokeswoman for police in Fairfax County , Va .
Authorities said there were no signs of foul play when officers were called to Kellermann 's home in Vienna shortly before 5 a.m.
ET , Caldwell said .
A source familiar with the investigation said Kellerman apparently hanged himself .
" The Freddie Mac family is truly saddened by the news this morning of David Kellermann 's death , " Freddie interim CEO John Koskinen said in a statement .
" His extraordinary work ethic and integrity inspired all who worked with him .
But he will be most remembered for his affability , his personal warmth , his sense of humor and his quick wit . "
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner , whose office works closely with Fannie and Freddie , also offered condolences .
" On behalf of the Treasury family , we are deeply saddened by the news this morning of David Kellermann 's death , " Geithner said .
" Our deepest sympathies are with his family and his colleagues at Freddie Mac during this difficult time . "
Kellermann , 41 , who also served as a senior vice president , had been with Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) for more than 16 years .
He was named to acting CFO and senior vice president positions in September 2008 , and was responsible for the company 's financial controls .
This included overseeing financial reporting , compliance with tax requirements and regulations , and annual budgeting and financial planning .
Before assuming his current posts , Kellermann was corporate controller and principal accounting officer .
Kellermann held a master 's degree in finance from George Washington University and a bachelor 's in political science and accounting from the University of Michigan .
He has served as a volunteer board member of the District of Columbia Coalition for the Homeless .
Freddie Mac was established by Congress in 1970 to provide liquidity , stability and affordability to the nation 's residential mortgage markets .
Freddie Mac supports communities across the nation by providing mortgage capital to lenders .
The government took over Freddie Mac last year , as the nationwide subprime - loan crisis escalated .
In September , Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were placed under conservatorship by its regulator , the Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) .
" We at FHFA are very saddened by the death of David Kellermann , " the government agency said in a statement .
" As the acting chief financial officer of Freddie Mac during particularly challenging times , David was an inspiration to his staff and many others who were privileged to work with him . "
Both companies back mortgages held by private homeowners , and have received massive cash infusions from the government to keep them afloat .
According to a March 11 company filing , Freddie Mac was being investigated by U.S. Attorney 's Offices in New York and Virginia .
It subsequently was notified that the Securities and Exchange Commission was also launching an inquiry -- which has since evolved into a " formal investigation . "
The company was subpoenaed for documents relating to accounting , disclosure and corporate governance matters in September 2008 , October 2008 , January 2009 and February 2009 .
The filing also says that SEC staff was interviewing company employees .
In a statement , Freddie said that it " knows of no connection between David Kellerman 's death and the regulatory inquiries that were discussed in our recent SEC filing . "
A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment .
A Justice Department spokesman in Virginia also declined to comment .
As part of its rescue of Freddie and Fannie , the government made $ 100 billion available to each to cover future losses - amounts that President Obama has since doubled .
On March 11 , Freddie reported that it had asked the government for $ 30.8 billion after already receiving $ 13.8 billion last fall .
Freddie lost a total of $ 50 billion in 2008 , nearly all of it in the second half of the year , following the government takeover .
The company 's losses deepened as the housing market continued its decline .

For years , I have said much the same as this when I ’m asked what I think of cooking shows on TV .
Yes :
They make people aware that different , often better types of food exist .
But at a cost :
When you watch most celebrity chefs go to work on TV it is a ) baffling and intimidating , and b ) a charade .
Baffling and intimidating because nearly every ingredient is usually prepared in advance , and what is n’t is selected so that the chef can show off his ( almost never “ her ” ) knife skills , which are bound to intimidate nearly all of us who can never aspire ( and why would we , really ? ) to chopping an onion with our eyes closed ; his ability to make food fly in the air while cooking it ; and / or his skill at presentation , which has absolutely nothing to do with taste .
A charade because it ’s all taped , and therefore not only does n’t take place in real time but does n’t even give a sense of what “ real time ” might be .
And I ’m not talking about braising time or the like but the actual work involved .
A further charade because when it ’s taped , all sorts of egregious mistakes can be magically made to disappear .
I was at a taping of a Food Network star a couple of years ago when he put a piece of meat on a stovetop grill over obviously way - too - high a flame , and the thing immediately caught fire and was almost completely incinerated .
I say “ almost , ” because the taping stopped , the charred evidence was whisked off the set , and an assistant came on and grilled a new piece of meat properly .
After which time the chef returned , took it off the grill , and said “ There you have it , ” or something like that .
Witnesses : about a hundred , many of whom might not have even noticed .
Viewers : millions .
Hey .
Things catch fire sometimes , even in “ real ” kitchens .
Things overcook , they undercook , they look like something the cat dragged in , they ’re oversalted , underspiced , soggy when they should be crisp , dry when they should be moist . . . in restaurants , good restaurants , chefs do these over .
On TV , chefs gloss these over .
Rarely are you given a sense of what really goes on .
The home cook , especially the aspiring home cook , needs encouragement — not befuddlement .
Show people what actually happens in the kitchen , show people that mistakes are made ( “ The grand thing about cooking is you can eat your mistakes ” — Julia Child ) , show people that , just as you need not be Rafael Nadal to play tennis , you need not be Gordon Ramsay to cook a decent meal .
And a decent meal — one you can proudly but humbly serve to your family and friends , and happily eat yourself — knowing that it could be better but that indeed it ’s your creation , it ’s wholesome , and it is in every sense good — is , or should be , the real goal of every home cook .
How you chop an onion ?
It does n’t matter .
At all .
At least three men suspected of being gay were gunned down March 20 in the Iraqi city of Ramadi .
U.S. forces say they are concerned about the rising number of anti-gay killings in Iraq .

Yet another group who has found life even worse than it was under Saddam Hussein .
Nice going , BushCo !
Installing a theocracy usually does lead to the suppression of human rights - just in case you never noticed :
BAGHDAD -
The bodies of two gay men have been found in Baghdad 's Shiite slum of Sadr City after a leading cleric repeatedly condemned homosexuality , an Iraqi police official said Saturday .
The killings come after Shiite cleric Sattar al - Battat repeatedly condemned homosexuality during recent Friday prayers , saying Islam prohibits homosexuality .
Homosexual acts are punishable by up to seven years in prison in Iraq .
The two men were believed killed Thursday by relatives who were shamed by their behavior , said the official .
Police said they suspected the killings were at the hands of family members because no one has claimed the bodies or called for an investigation .
The killings come weeks after Iraqi police found four bodies in late March buried near Sadr City with the words " pervert " and " puppies " written on their chests , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information .
Puppy is a derogatory word used by residents in Sadr City to refer to homosexuals , the official said .
Sadr City , a slum of about two million people , is home to a large majority of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr 's Mahdi Army militia .
Al - Sadr 's forces launched several uprisings against American forces since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 , but fighting ended in Sadr City in May 2008 .
" When the Mahdi army was in control , such practices were banned , and homosexuals were afraid of declaring their tendencies , " the official said .
But that 's changed since the Mahdi Army militia cease fire took hold , the official said .
The official said some people claim a coffee shop in Sadr City has become a hangout for gay men .
Sheik Ammar al - Saadi , a cleric at al - Sadr 's office , denied any involvement by the Mahdi army in the killings .
He said the Mahdi Army was only urging people to stop practicing homosexuality .
" Such people have brought shame on Sadr city people , " he told The Associated Press .
" The blame falls on the security forces who do little to combat this phenomenon or to stop the flow of pornography materials into Iraq . "
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Do you know what the word “ income ” means ?
My large Webster ’s dictionary is able to provide a clear and comprehensive definition in a mere 52 words .
The shortest definition the Internal Revenue Service could provide in response to my request for its definition was 140 words - but the word income was included 10 times , missing the point that you do not include the word to be defined as part of the definition .
You may have read that President Obama has just appointed former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker to head a panel to make recommendations for tax reform .
Its mandate is to simplify the tax code , raise more revenue , close loopholes , reduce the so - called tax gap - and not raise taxes for American families making less than $ 250,000 .
The panel will fail !
It will fail for the same reasons former President George W. Bush ’s efforts and other presidents ’ attempts at tax reform failed , and that is because the complexity in the tax code cannot be lessened without a reduction in rates and the overall tax burden .
It will fail , too , because the income - tax code and regulations contain many inconsistent and even contradictory explicit and implicit definitions of the word income , leaving taxpayers both confused and endlessly at risk legally .
When I first came to Washington many years ago , I was fortunate to be befriended by the smartest tax lawyer I ever met , the late Edwin S. Cohen .
Mr. Cohen had been undersecretary for tax at the Treasury Department at the same time Mr. Volcker was undersecretary for monetary affairs .
Mr. Cohen for many years was a law professor at the University of Virginia and a partner in a major Washington law firm .
Around 1980 , we were discussing former President Ronald Reagan ’s proposals for tax reform , and Mr. Cohen said to me , “ Ultimately the income tax is doomed to failure because it will endlessly grow more complex in a futile effort to define income . ”
Mr. Cohen , arguably the best tax lawyer of his day , also said he did not understand much of what was in the tax code - at that time a mere 4 million words or so , as contrasted with the more than 7 million words ( almost 70,000 pages ) in today ’s code .
Last week , I was in a meeting with some of the nation ’s best and most experienced tax lawyers and tax economists , several of whom had served in the Treasury , and , again , there was the general lament that the tax code is so complex it is beyond their understanding and repair .
Those who claim that the government will be able to get a lot more tax revenue by increasing tax rates on the rich live in a fantasy world .
As can be seen in the accompanying table , over the past 40 years , maximum income tax rates have ranged from 28 percent to 70 percent , yet tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product have been remarkably constant , ranging from a low of 16.3 to a high of 20.9 percent of gross domestic product .
During the same period , the number of pages in the tax code has increased 2 1 / 2 times , which has only served to increase complexity , uncertainty and the dead - weight cost of the income - tax system , without improving compliance or raising more revenue .
Under the current tax law , the top 1 percent of taxpayers pay 40 percent of the tax , and the top 5 percent pay 60 percent of the tax , while the bottom 50 percent of taxpayers pay just 3 percent .
History - both American and that of other countries - clearly shows there is a limit to how much people are willing to pay in income tax , and even current rates are above those limits for many people .
The so - called rich have many options , including taking their income in nontaxable forms ( such as buying tax - exempt state and municipal bonds ) , not working or moving to a more tax - friendly country , as many of the British and Swedes did in the 1970s .
People always seem surprised that very rich people such as Warren Buffet , Sens. John Kerry , Edward M. Kennedy and Dianne Feinstein and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pay much smaller effective tax rates than many in the middle class .
One should not be shocked ; the politically powerful have always protected themselves and their friends .
That is why many of the tax - reform proposals being floated , such as higher marginal tax rates on small - business owners and even more restrictive depreciation limitations , are tax increases on the most productive and entrepreneurial people in society who have not yet amassed sufficient wealth to be part of the nonproductive political class .
Even though American corporations pay the highest corporate taxes in the world , the Washington political class wants to further restrict the deferral of foreign - source income and make it harder for them to operate across the globe .
The result of these reform efforts will be to force more companies to downsize or move to other countries in order to become internationally competitive .
The people who will be most hurt by those tax attacks on business will be the workers who will lose their jobs or face more limited future job opportunities .
In the meantime , the Washington political class will continue to amass a larger share of the nation ’s income for itself - a sign of a nation in decline .
Knowledgeable people know the present income - tax system is irreparably broken and must be replaced with a more consumption - based tax system .
More Band - Aids on the present income tax system will only result in more complexity , requiring even more police - state tactics in a futile attempt to enforce it .

I can confirm for each of you that the assassination ring does exist .
I spoke with one member of the Delta Forces on a regular basis .
I can not repeat anything that I was told , but I can tell you that even the so - called terrorist knew exactly where they were housed on our base at an undisclosed location in Iraq .
Laffy , i'm sure you know who I am .
I can not repeat anymore than what I have typed from fear of reprisal .
Which is also the reason why I never came back to you on what happened to my wife and me while being in Iraq last year .
[ W]e have people out there that can and will hunt me down . [...]
But those guys would have to come by our tent to pick up all their cargo that would be airlifted from random parts of the world .
I can tell you that I know for a fact that it truly does go on .
But I swore that I 'd never repeat anything that was ever told , or pictures that I saw with my own eyes .
Pictures that those guys could be severely punished for showing anyone out of their official channels .
One of our Commenters , who must remain anonymous , has generously shared what little information he is able to with me about Dick Cheney 's horrific " executive assassination ring " , originally reported by Seymour Hersh .
Anonymous and I have e-mailed back and forth for a few months now , and he was going to allow me to use some of his Iraq experiences for a series of posts .
However , things have changed for reasons that are explained below .
This is all Anonymous is now allowed to reveal :
Yes , I realize this is coming from an anonymous source , although I do know his name and have for some time , and have seen photos ( from his time in Iraq and other venues ) of him and his wife and even his friends .
I also understand that he is not saying any of this under oath , but neither was Sy Hersh ... yet .
It is all hearsay for the time being .
I posted this to buttress Hersh 's words .
And I wanted to buttress Hersh 's words to emphasize the following : Dick Cheney and George Bush must be prosecuted .
There must be a thorough investigation , and they must be prosecuted .
How many more posts about these criminals will I have to write before this will happen ?
What does it take ?
President Obama , I 'm a fan , but I strongly disagree with your belief that " we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards " .
That is a very bad precedent when it comes to dealing with very bad people doing very , very bad things .
Please , for the sake of your country , reconsider .
Let 's hope that Attorney General Holder has other ideas .
Carsten sez , " On May 5 , thus in only two weeks , the politicians in Brussels will vote on
a package of laws regulating the Internet in EU countries .
This is the so - called telecoms
package .
If the lobbyists ' and bureaucrats ' version is adopted , ISPs will be able to arbitrarily block sites to their customers , and governments will be able to impose three - strikes measures without involving the judiciary .
A group of MEPs , among them the Swede Eva-Britt Svensson , are proposing some amendments which will effectively table a set of digital ' Citizen 's Rights ' which will effectively prohibit filtering and cutoffs unless as decided in a courtroom with adequate cause / proof .
If the Citizens ' Rights amendments are accepted , Europeans will gain important safeguards , if not , lobbies and governments and Network Neutrality - bashing ISPs will get a free ride . "
Tell the European Parliament to vote against conditional access to the Internet !
( Thanks , Carsten ! )
A consensus now exists that America 's recession – already a year old – is likely to be long and deep , and that almost all countries will be affected .
I always thought that the notion that what happened in America would be decoupled from the rest of the world was a myth .
Events are showing that to be so .
Fortunately , America has , at last , a president with some understanding of the nature and severity of the problem , and who has committed himself to a strong stimulus programme .
This , together with concerted action by governments elsewhere , will mean that the downturn will be less severe than it otherwise would be .
The United States Federal Reserve , which helped create the problems through a combination of excessive liquidity and lax regulation , is trying to make amends – by flooding the economy with liquidity , a move that , at best , has merely prevented matters from being worse .
It 's not surprising that those who helped create the problems and did n't see the disaster coming have not done a masterly job in dealing with it .
By now , the dynamics of the downturn are set , and things will get worse before they get better .
In some ways , the Fed resembles a drunk driver who , suddenly realising that he is heading off the road starts careening from side to side .
The response to the lack of liquidity is ever more liquidity .
When the economy starts recovering , and banks start lending , will they be able to drain the liquidity smoothly out of the system ?
Will America face a bout of inflation ?
Or , more likely , in another moment of excess , will the Fed over - react , nipping the recovery in the bud ?
Given the unsteady hand exhibited so far , we cannot have much confidence in what awaits us .
Still , I am not sure that there is sufficient appreciation of some of the underlying problems facing the global economy , without which the current global recession is unlikely to give way to robust growth – no matter how good a job the Fed does .
For a long time , the US has played an important role in keeping the global economy going .
America 's profligacy – the fact that the world 's richest country could not live within its means – was often criticised .
But perhaps the world should be thankful , because without American profligacy , there would have been insufficient global aggregate demand .
In the past , developing countries filled this role , running trade and fiscal deficits .
But they paid a high price , and fiscal responsibility and conservative monetary policies are now the fashion .
Indeed , many developing countries , fearful of losing their economic sovereignty to the IMF – as occurred during the 1997 Asian financial crisis – accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves .
Money put into reserves is income not spent .
Moreover , growing inequality in most countries of the world has meant that money has gone from those who would spend it to those who are so well off that , try as they might , they can't spend it all .
The world 's unending appetite for oil , beyond its ability or willingness to produce , has contributed a third factor .
Rising oil prices transferred money to oil - rich countries , again contributing to the flood of liquidity .
Though oil prices have been dampened for now , a robust recovery could send them soaring again .
For a while , people spoke almost approvingly of the flood of liquidity .
But this was just the flip side of what Keynes had worried about – insufficient global aggregate demand .
The search for return contributed to the reckless leverage and risk - taking that underlay this crisis .
America 's government will , for a time , partly make up for the increasing savings of US consumers .
But if America 's consumers go from their near - zero savings to a modest 4 % or 5 % of GDP , then the depressing effect on demand ( in addition to that resulting from declines in investment , exports and state and local government expenditures ) will not be fully offset by even the largest government expenditure programmes .
In two years , governments , mindful of the huge increases in the debt burden resulting from the mega - bailouts and the mind - boggling deficits , will be under pressure to run primary surpluses ( where government spending net of interest payments is less than revenues ) .
A few years ago , there was worry about the risk of a disorderly unwinding of " global imbalances " .
The current crisis can be viewed as part of that , but little is being done about the underlying problems that gave rise to these imbalances .
We need not just temporary stimuli , but longer - term solutions .
It is not as if there was a shortage of needs ; it is only that those who might meet those needs have a shortage of funds .
First , we need to reverse the worrying trends of growing inequality .
More progressive income taxation will also help stabilise the economy , through what economists call " automatic stabilisers " .
It would also help if the advanced developed countries fulfilled their commitments to helping the world 's poorest by increasing their foreign - aid budgets to 0.7 % of GDP .
Second , the world needs enormous investments if it is to respond to the challenges of global warming .
Transportation systems and living patterns must be changed dramatically .
Third , a global reserve system is needed .
It makes little sense for the world 's poorest countries to lend money to the richest at low interest rates .
The system is unstable .
The dollar reserve system is fraying , but is likely to be replaced with a dollar / euro or dollar / euro / yen system that is even more unstable .
Annual emissions of a global reserve currency ( what Keynes called Bancor , the IMF calls SDRs ) could help fuel global aggregate demand and be used to promote development and address the problems of global warming .
This year will be bleak .
The question we need to be asking now is , how can we enhance the likelihood that we will eventually emerge into a robust recovery ?

Millard Kaufman , the Oscar - nominated screenwriter of “ Bad Day at Black Rock ” and the co-creator of Mr. Magoo who waited until he was 90 to become a first - time novelist , has died .
He was 92 .
Kaufman died of heart failure Saturday , two days after his birthday , at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles , said his son , Frederick Kaufman .
A former newspaperman who launched his screenwriting career after serving in the Marines during World War II , Kaufman quickly made a mark on pop culture by writing the screenplay for “ Ragtime Bear , ” the 1949 cartoon short directed by John Hubley that introduced the near - sighted Mr. Magoo .
The character , which was voiced by actor Jim Backus , was modeled in part on Kaufman ’s uncle .
“ My uncle had no problem with his eyes , ” Kaufman said in a 2007 National Public Radio interview .
“ He simply interpreted everything that came across his way in his own particular manner , and he could at times be a little bit difficult , but he would only see things the way they existed highly subjectively to him . ”
Kaufman wrote the screenplays for “ Unknown World ” and “ Aladdin and His Lamp ” before spending more than a decade as a writer at MGM , where he was known as a top script doctor .
His first screenplay for the studio -- “ Take the High Ground ! , ” a 1953 movie about Army basic training starring Richard Widmark -- earned him the first of his two Oscar nominations .
Then came his Oscar - nominated screenplay for “ Bad Day at Black Rock , ” the 1955 suspense - drama starring Spencer Tracy as a one - armed World War II veteran who finds more than he bargained for when he gets off the train at a tiny desert whistle - stop .
Other Kaufman film credits are “ Raintree County , ” “ Never So Few , ” The War Lord , ” “ Living Free ” and “ The Klansman . ”
Among his TV credits are “ Enola Gay : The Men , the Mission , the Atomic Bomb . ”
Early in his Hollywood career , Kaufman fronted for blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo on the 1950 film - noir crime classic “ Gun Crazy . ”
Kaufman did n’t know Trumbo , but they shared the same agent , George Willner .
When Willner asked Kaufman if he’d be willing to put his name on the script , Kaufman later recalled , “ I had sense enough to say , ‘ Let me talk it over with my wife . ’ ”
“ But we discussed it and we believed it was rotten that a man could n’t write under his own name , ” Kaufman told Daily Variety in 1992 , the year Kaufman officially requested that the Writers Guild of America
West take his name off the credits and replace it with Trumbo ’s name .
“ Any time I had speaking engagements where they included that film in my credits , I always set the record straight anyway , ” Kaufman said .
Christopher Knopf , a screen and TV writer who met Kaufman at MGM in the early ‘ 50s , said that “ the greatest facility for him was he was absolutely unafraid to face a blank page with no guarantee of anything . ”
“ A lot of writers today cannot write unless somebody will call up and say , ‘ You have an assignment , ’ and that was not Millard ; he wrote , ” said Knopf .
Kaufman had a major screenwriting assignment at age 86 , but then the project fell through .
“ I decided , knowing that nobody my age gets work in movies , and that I had to do something , otherwise I ’d get into terrible trouble , that I would try writing a novel , ” he told The Times in 2007 .
That was the year “ Bowl of Cherries , ” which a New Yorker writer described as “ equal parts ‘ Catcher in the Rye ’ and ‘ Die Hard , ’ ” was published .
Kaufman ’s second novel , “ Misadventure , ” is due out this fall .
Born March 12 , 1917 , in Baltimore , Kaufman spent two years as a merchant seaman after high school .
After earning a bachelor ’s degree in English from Johns Hopkins University in 1939 , he moved to New York City and worked as a newspaperman for the Daily News and Newsday .
In 1942 , he joined the Marine Corps and saw action on Guadalcanal , Guam and Okinawa .
In his later years , Kaufman wrote the screenwriting book “ Plots and Characters : A Screenwriter on Screenwriting . ”
Said Knopf , who met with Kaufman and other Hollywood veterans for weekly lunches at a Santa Monica restaurant : “ When you were around him , he elevated you about the craft that you were in and made you want to do the very best you could possibly do . ”
In addition to his son , Kaufman is survived by his wife of 66 years , Lorraine ; his daughters , Mary Carde and Amy Burk ; and seven grandchildren .

In a speech this week summarizing his administration 's economic policies , President Obama grossly overstated the support these policies enjoy by claiming , " economists on the left and right agree that the last thing the government should do during a recession is cut back on spending . "
There are a great many economists who were surprised to learn that , apparently , they now agree with the President .
Reading straight from the Keynesian playbook , Obama justified the creation of multi-trillion dollar deficits by asserting that the government must fill the spending void left by the contraction of consumer and business spending .
As one of those mythical economists who do not agree with the President , I argue that it is precisely this type of boneheaded thinking that got us into this mess , and it's the reason we are now headed for an inflationary depression .
We do not need , nor should we attempt , to replace lost demand .
As Obama himself pointed out in the same speech , Americans have been borrowing and spending too much money .
These actions created artificial demand , underpinned by the illusion of real wealth in overvalued stock and real estate markets .
Given his intelligence and rhetorical training , it is hard to fathom how President Obama cannot notice the inherent contradiction in his argument .
While Obama commended millions of American families for making the hard choices to reduce spending , pay down debt and replenish savings , he later outlined the government 's intention to spend every American household deeper into debt , thereby undermining all the good that personal austerity would have otherwise produced .
Obama also made the clear - eyed observation that the foundation of our economy was unsound and that a sturdier one needed to be laid .
To do this , he even asserted that we need to import less and export more .
This has been one of my fundamental points .
Our economy is unsound precisely because it is built on a foundation of consumer debt .
Instead of spending for today , we need to invest for tomorrow .
However , we can not save more unless we spend less .
Production requires capital , which only comes into existence when resources are not consumed .
However , by interfering with this process , Obama prevents the very transformation he acknowledges must take place .
When the government spends what individuals save , private investment is crowded out .
Society is deprived of the benefits such savings would otherwise have brought about .
How can we lay a solid foundation if the government takes away all our cement ?
This brings up an oft - repeated , but oft - forgotten , point : government does not have any money of its own .
It only has what it takes from the rest of us .
If individuals repay their debts , but their government takes on additional debt , we are all simply swimming against the tide .
All forward progress is lost as private debt is replaced by public debt , which must be repaid by private individuals .
Whatever gains individuals hope to achieve are negated by the higher taxes or increased inflation necessary to repay their share of a larger national debt .
Obama claims that much of the additional debt is not going to finance consumption , but rather " critical investment " .
This is a vain hope .
In the first place , much of what he categorizes as investment , such as additional spending on education , is not investment at all .
Yes , an educated workforce is important , but throwing more government money at education will do nothing to achieve this goal .
Spending money on education and calling it an investment squanders resources that otherwise would have financed real investments .
In the second place , to the extent some government money is invested , those investments will likely be less efficient than those the private sector might otherwise have financed .
There is absolutely no evidence that governments have the foresight or incentives to make investments that facilitate real economic growth .
" Five year plans " did n't work in the Soviet Union and they wo n't work here .
If the government simply builds bridges to nowhere , society gains nothing .
If we are going to rebuild our economy on a solid foundation , the market , not the government , needs to draw the plans .
When private citizens invest their own capital , those who invest wisely are rewarded with profits , while those who do not are punished with losses .
Bad investments are therefore abandoned , with capital reallocated to more successful ventures .
Conversely , when governments invest money , these checks and balances do not exist .
There is nothing to correct bad investments , as losses are endlessly subsidized by taxpayers .
In fact , the more a government plan fails , the more it tends to be funded in the hope that additional resources will finally achieve success .
Obama himself proves this by allocating still more funds to government - run schools and student loan subsidies .
Other examples , such as Amtrak , the New York MTA , the U.S. Postal Service , Fannie / Freddie , and countless others , prove this process is never - ending - until perhaps the bureaucracy collapses under its own weight .
When it comes to government making tough choices , Obama talks a good game , but refuses to actually make any .
However , once the dollar finally begins its collapse , he will have no choice but to match his rhetoric with action .
It 's unfortunate that we cannot make these tough choices on our own terms , rather than waiting for our creditors to force our hand .

Three British Muslims were today cleared of helping the 7 July bombers choose their targets by carrying out a reconnaissance mission in London seven months before the attacks that killed 52 people and injured almost 1,000 .
A jury at Kingston crown court unanimously found Waheed Ali , 25 , Sadeer Saleem , 28 , and Mohammed Shakil , 32 , all from Beeston , Leeds , not guilty of conspiring with the four bombers to cause explosions , after deliberating for eight days .
They are the only people to be charged over the attacks in 2005 , which prompted the biggest criminal investigation in British history – more than 18,450 statements were taken and at least 37,000 exhibits were collected .
Ali and Shakil were , however , convicted of conspiracy to attend a place used for terrorist training .
They were about to board a flight to Pakistan when they were arrested in 2007 .
The pair will be sentenced tomorrow afternoon .
The home secretary , Jacqui Smith , welcomed those guilty verdicts , which she said " clearly demonstrated the determined stance the UK takes against those suspected of involvement in terrorism " .
As the verdicts were read out , Ali smiled broadly , Saleem wiped his eyes and Shakil leant forward , mouthing " thank you " to the jury .
The trio had been retried after a jury failed to reach a verdict on the charges relating to the 7 July attacks last year after about three weeks of deliberations .
Survivors of the attacks and family members of those who died said today 's verdicts strengthened the case for an independent inquiry into the bombings .
The end of the trial clears the way for the publication of a long - awaited report into whether the attacks could have been prevented , which is expected to be critical of the way MI5 and West Yorkshire police responded to earlier intelligence linking some of the suicide bombers with a group who were plotting to explode a series of huge fertiliser bombs .
The two key bombers , Mohammad Siddique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer , crossed MI5 's radar several times in 2004 as the security service watched the gang that was later convicted of plotting to blow up Bluewater shopping centre in Kent and south London 's Ministry of Sound nightclub .
Ali was also present when Khan and Tanweer met the leader of that cell , Omar Khyam , and Shakil and Khan trained with him at a camp in Pakistan in 2003 .
But after the fertiliser plotters were arrested in March 2003 , Khan and Tanweer , who had been judged to be peripheral figures because they only seemed interested in committing fraud to fund overseas jihad , were not followed again by M15 and were not identified by the service .
Khyam was referred to as " Ausman " during the trial for fear that revealing his true indentity to the jury would prejudice the case .
Graham Foulkes , whose 22 - year - old son David worked for the Guardian in Manchester and was killed in the Edgware Road tube explosion , said : " For almost four years , we have been asking for an inquiry into what led up to 7/7 .
" We are not looking for people to blame , but we also know that we have not been told the whole truth .
We believe that crucial lessons need to be learned .
If mistakes have been made , they should be put right , not covered up .
This is not a witch - hunt , it is simply about saving lives . "
Police have said they know others were involved in the attacks and believe there are still people in Beeston with significant information who have never come forward .
Deputy assistant commissioner John McDowall , the head of the Metropolitan police 's counterterrorism command , said he believed others were involved in planning the attacks .
" I would urge anybody who has any information about 7/ 7 to come forward and contact police , " he said .
" I do understand that people may have concerns about the impact of giving us information , but it is the right thing to do . "
Speaking about Ali and Shakil , he said : " These two men learned to fight at training camps attended by other terrorists .
Mohammed Siddique Khan and Mohammed Shakil told other attendees that their aim was to fight in Afghanistan .
They were proficient in the use of , and handling of , terrorist weapons and were certainly not enjoying a day out in a beautiful and mountainous area of Pakistan , as was suggested in court .
" Shakil himself accepted that the camp at Malakand was a serious business , whose purpose was to train willing volunteers to fight and kill in Afghanistan on behalf of the Taliban , a cause to which both he and Ali were , and remain , sympathetic .
" Ali and Shakil clearly associated with , and shared the terrorist beliefs of , the London bombers . "
Ali , Saleem and Shakil spent two days in London with the bus bomber , Hasib Hussain , in December 2004 and were joined there by another of the attackers , Jermaine Lindsay , who killed 26 people on a Piccadilly line underground train .
The trio had denied the charges and said they were on a sightseeing trip .
They went on the London Eye and visited the Natural History Museum and the London Aquarium as they travelled around the capital .
The prosecution alleged they conducted a " hostile reconnaissance " of potential targets , claiming it was " an important first step in what was , by then , a settled plan to cause explosions in the UK " .
Interviewed by police shortly after the bombings , Ali , Saleem and Shakil distanced themselves from the bombers but , in the year that followed , DNA and fingerprint evidence linked them to the two bomb factories in the city and made them " persons of interest " .
Detectives first realised the trio may have been to London with Hussain and Lindsay while analysing the details of 4,700 phone numbers and 90,000 calls .
Cell site analysis , pinpointing the location of a mobile phone when a call is made , revealed that all five men had been in the capital on 16 - 17 December .
The analysis allowed the group 's movements across London to be mapped .
But there was no CCTV footage to show what they had been doing and no proof they had even been on the London underground , where three of the four bombs exploded .
The trio argued during the trial that the items carrying their DNA had been taken to the bomb factories by the bombers , not them .
The jury was warned not to think that they must be guilty just because they were friends with the bombers , with whom they attended the same mosques , gyms and community organisations growing up in Beeston .
The Crown Prosecution Service later defended its decision to prosecute the three men and to go for a retrial following the first court case , although it " fully respected " the jury 's verdict .
Sue Hemming , the head of the counterterrorism division , said : " Although there was no direct evidence that these men were involved in the terrible events of 7/7 , we felt there was sufficient evidence to show they were involved in reconnaissance and planning for an attack of some kind and it was in the public interest that such a serious matter should be put before a court .

Saleem , who was cleared of all charges , called for an inquiry into his prosecution .
In a statement read by Imran Khan , his solicitor , on the steps of Kingston crown court , Saleem said : " I have lost over two years of my life which I will never get back .
Even though I have been acquitted , some people will always connect me with these events .
" I want people to know I am totally innocent and I want there to be an inquiry into why I was prosecuted on the flimsiest of evidence .
Nobody should be put through what I have gone through . "
( CNN ) -- Sweden 's parliament on Wednesday approved same - sex marriage legislation , according to the parliament 's Web site .
Previously , two people of the same sex could register their partnership , but with this vote , sex will no longer matter when two people want to get married .
The new " sex - neutral " law will take effect on May 1 .
Couples who already had a registered partnership can now either stay in that union or transform it into a marriage if they wish , the Web site said .
The " yes " votes numbered 261 , while 22 members of parliament voted " no " and 16 chose not to vote .
The Christian Democrats was the only party opposed to the new law .
" Unfortunately this is not an April Fool 's Day joke , this is reality , " Yvonne Andersson , member of the Swedish parliament for the Christian Democrats , wrote on the party 's Web site following the vote .
The party had instead proposed a law that would remove the word " marriage " from Swedish law and replace it with a legally binding union between two persons , thus separating it from the Christian ceremony that the church conducts .
Asa Regner , secretary general of the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education , told CNN that Wednesday 's vote meant a very important change in Swedish law .
" This was the last area where same sex couples were treated differently , " she said .

For taxpayers in America , today is the deadline to pay their federal income taxes for 2008 .
With that chore behind them , they might now like to think about their future taxes — the ones that will pay for the $ 787 billion stimulus package , the $ 2 trillion commitment to prop up collapsing financial firms , and other programs that promise to deepen our $ 11 trillion national debt .
Of course , that does n’t count the $ 80 trillion to $ 100 trillion shortfall in funding for Medicare and Social Security .
According to Wharton insurance and risk management professor Kent Smetters , a former deputy assistant Treasury secretary and economist for the Congressional Budget Office , most Americans should not be worrying about having to pay higher taxes .
Why ?
Because even the biggest tax hikes will not raise enough money to pay off the debt and meet coming obligations .
Accomplishing the latter would require politicians to do something they fear even more than raising taxes :
Cut back on Medicare and Social Security benefits .
Smetters described the coming crisis in an interview with Knowledge@Wharton .
An edited transcript of the interview follows :
Knowledge@Wharton : Assuming China continues to invest in our Treasury bonds , when do we have to start backfilling the deep debt hole that we ’ve dug for ourselves , not even counting the much bigger shortfall for Medicare and Social Security that ’s heading our way ?
Kent Smetters : [ China is ] very nervous right now and … they ’ve thought about floating an international reserve that ’s no longer U.S. based .
But even given the assumption that under the Safe Haven hypothesis [ that United States Treasury bonds are the safest investments ] , U.S. debt is still viewed as the safe place [ for investors ] to go .
And we continue to get the ability to float debt at these very low rates , which is almost a topic unto itself because these rates are so unbelievably low .
But we face a very … significant short - term problem … because all this [ U.S. government ] debt is going to crowd out lots of private investment , and [ the stimulus package it is funding ] assumes that the government can do a better job at picking … the winners and [ losers with its ] investments .
Economists do n’t have a hard and fast rule that says , “ Here ’s your maximum debt ceiling .
And here is the most that you can go . ”
But given where we are in terms of paper debt — we ’re adding another $ 2.1 trillion just this coming fiscal year and we ’re going to be close to $ 11 trillion to $ 12 trillion in total , and on top of that … Social Security and Medicare — we really do face a very dire situation right now .
The U.S. economy has never faced this type of challenge in the past , even in World War II when our paper debt was high .
We just never faced the type of fiscal challenges that we face right now .
Knowledge@Wharton :
Do we have to dig ourselves out of the national debt before we can address Social Security or Medicare ?
Smetters : No .
In fact , ideally , it would be in some ways just the opposite .
Social Security and Medicare are much bigger problems , and the longer that we delay those , the more those problems [ will ] snowball .
In particular , every year that we delay reform on either of those programs it adds about another $ 2 trillion to the present value shortfalls of both programs .
So just a one - year cost of delay is about the size of the record deficit that we ’re going to have this year … .
Knowledge@Wharton :
So , whatever we do for Social Security , the bottom line is that it has to cost a lot less than it does now .
Smetters : Yes .
You can certainly raise some tax revenue in some places .
People have talked about increasing the maximum taxable wage cap [ currently $ 106,800 ] … .
That ’s not going to … help a lot in present value , because those people will eventually collect more benefits .
They ’re not going to collect as much … as they paid into the system , but it ’s still not going to be super - effective … .
People have [ also ] talked about taxing fringe benefits like health care and so forth .
But the fact of the matter is that these benefits are growing faster than inflation .
We have to bring Social Security benefit growth rate closer to [ the rate of ] inflation for it to be a sustainable system .
And that ’s the easy problem .
Medicare is the tough one .
Knowledge@Wharton : Medicare is tougher , why ?
Because … people [ are reluctant ] to give up benefits that have to do with their health care ?
Smetters : Medicare is tough for two reasons .
One , the shortfall in Medicare is six to seven times larger than in Social Security .
Social Security is a major problem ; Medicare is a crisis .
You add both of those … shortfalls together and you ’re getting something that ’s … between $ 80 and $ 120 trillion in total present value shortfalls .
…
People ca n’t even imagine how big that number is .
If you took the total value of the United States , except for the people ( all the land , houses , buildings , everything that ’s non-perishable , your washer and dryer , cars , and so forth ) , it has about a value of about $ 50 trillion .
So we ’re talking about a shortfall of twice the value of the value of the U.S. except for the people .
Now , the value of the people is about three times that .
We ’re just talking about biblically large shortfalls .
We ’ve never seen this type of problem .
Eighty percent of that is driven by Medicare .
And a lot of that is because of the way Medicare benefits are provided .
It ’s not a dollar benefit , it ’s an “ in kind ” benefit .
That is , they pay for operations .
And so how do you scale that back ?
A dollar benefit like Social Security is easier to scale back .
An operation , what do you do there ?
Do you say , “ Okay , we ’ll pay for half of it and you pay for the other half of it ? ”
People have talked about this , but it ’s more likely that we ’ll move to some type of rationing system unless we take kind of a long [ term ] approach and get people to save for their future medical costs .
Knowledge@Wharton :
The Obama administration asserts that reforming health care overall for all Americans the best way to address Medicare .
Do you agree ?
Smetters :
It will address some of it .
It is interesting that the Obama team is starting to lean more toward the [ Hillary ] Clinton proposal , [ raised ] during the [ Democratic primary ] campaign , for … mandatory coverage .
There ’s nothing I ’ve seen so far , however , that will fundamentally address the core issue , and that is that medical care costs are simply going up .
Increasing access is great for various social reasons , but it ’s not going to have a big impact on increasing costs unless we actually start making some hard choices .
Some of those hard choices are going to be very unpopular , especially when you start to ration care .
You basically say , “ You ’ve hit a certain age [ after which ] we ’re no longer going to do those triple bypasses , ” or something like that .
And that ’s obviously a tough choice .
I hope we do n’t get to that .
But the second approach is more of a long term approach , where you have to make people sensitive to how much … they spend on health care .
That ’s the core problem :
People always want the very best , even if the marginal benefit is much less than the marginal costs , because they do n’t bear the cost .
In Medicare , the government bears the cost .
And so people do n’t have any type of trade off between spending and benefits .
They always want the very best .
And … the innovators always come up with the better pill even though its efficacy may be just marginally better than the generic drug ; or the better operation , even though its efficacy will be just marginally better than the cheaper operation .
Knowledge@Wharton :
Is there a way to bring more sensitivity about marginal benefits and marginal costs ?
Smetters :
There are only really two things you can do .
The first is you say , “ Well , people still are n’t sensitized to cost and benefits .
We ’ll keep on paying for it . ”
And in that case the government then has to say , “ You know what , we ’ll keep on paying but for only some stuff . ”
And now the government is the one in charge of deciding who gets what .
The second approach is to actually make people directly sensitized to it .
And you do that with things like health savings accounts in which people have to pre-fund some of their future medical care .
They have to pay out the first several dollars of that care , and the government ’s only a back stop on a catastrophic case .
The problem with the health savings accounts , people say , is there ’s an equity issue — some people can’t accumulate a large savings account .
And so then how do you address that issue ?
Whatever you do to address that issue de-links people from being sensitized to benefits and cost .
So there ’s no silver bullet here .
Ultimately , the best package is some type of hybrid where you have people being sensitized to health care costs for routine care .
For catastrophic care you probably have a government back stop , but more of minimal back stop than we now have .
It ’s not always wise to pay for the best device that ’s out there .
It ’s really about taking into account cost benefits .
Medicare , by the way , will claim that it take costs and benefits into account .
But in effect they do not .
They will approve almost anything that has some type of marginal benefit and not really think very hard about the costs .
Knowledge@Wharton :
How does the government go about preparing people for this ?
Given the psychology that you just discussed , how does the government go about preparing people for those difficult choices ?
Smetters :
That ’s an interesting question because elected officials really have no incentive to do that .
The chance of them being around 20 to 30 years or even 10 years from now is pretty low .
So they have an incentive to always keep things going along .
History has shown that it takes a crisis before you get any type of reform .
And obviously that [ last minute ] reform is never the best possible reform .
So , we could talk about what things the government will do .
But we know the government wo n’t .
It ’s going to require a lot more action by citizen groups .
The Peter G. Peterson Foundation , for example , tries to educate people about some of these fiscal problems .
Certainly there are some “ blue dog ” Democrats and some Republicans who want to talk about this issue .
But for the most part this is an issue that [ causes ] you to lose re-election .
So , trying to have a sustainable , reasonable conversation is difficult .
And it ’s only becoming more difficult as the baby boomers start to age even more and they become even more sensitive to this issue .
Knowledge@Wharton :
So then what does the result of the crisis — when the crisis arrives , what does it look like in terms of taxes ?
If we have to raise them to some extent , along with cutting back benefits , what does the tax bill look like for Americans ?
Smetters :
We currently have a present value shortfall that ’s twice the value of the entire country , except for the human beings .
So , obviously , we ca n’t tax our way out .
So the real issue is , what type of hit are we going to give do to benefits ?
You ’re going to see benefits reduced , especially for higher income earners .
We got a hint of that in Medicare Part D , the newest part of Medicare that gave us our prescription drug bill .
They explicitly have some means testing in there , which basically says higher income people get a smaller benefit .
Social Security benefits are now taxed .
And in fact , they ’ve been taxed since 1983 .
But it ’s taxed on a progressive basis .
Higher income workers get more of their benefits taxed .
I think you ’ll start to see a lot of more of that .
And so what will happen is Medicare and Social Security will become more of a flat system , [ with ] fewer benefits to higher income people even though they paid in more .
But on the [ revenue ] side , I do n’t see a lot of room for continuously increasing taxes .
We ’ll see , I think , more taxes on higher income individuals .
And that will have long run implications because they ’re also the ones who create jobs and invest and innovate .
We already have the second highest corporate income tax rate in the world , even after you net in things like expensing and so forth .
So for us to remain competitive , I just do n’t see how … we can really do a lot on the tax side .
But I do think we will see taxes go up .
The thing I fear the most — and I think it is the most likely outcome — is that the government will print a lot of debt to pay off a lot of these shortfalls .
And then the international markets , in particular the fixed income markets , will figure it out .
They will realize the government is basically monetizing that debt through higher inflation .
And if you have an inflation rate that ’s 25 , 3 % more per year than the historic average , you can really eat away a lot of debt just through the law of compounding .
And so the market should figure that out and adjust the interest rates accordingly .
That ’s one reason why I believe that 30 year yields right now on Treasury [ bonds ] , especially to non inflation protected Treasuries , is really too low .
I believe Treasuries are in a bubble right now because everybody ’s flocked to the safety .
And there ’s just no way that those low yields of 3.5 % are going to cover the inflation rate over the next 30 years .
Knowledge@Wharton :
Why does n’t the rate respond to the reality of what ’s going on in the market ?
Smetters :
In theory it should .
I think what you have is a flight to safety going on right now , where people are basically saying , “ Where else do I hold my money ?
And I ’m nervous about the markets . ”
It ’s obvious that people are worried about even corporate fixed income , given the very high yield that those are earning right now .
So people are panicked .
And so they ’re moving toward was viewed as historically safe , and that ’s U.S. Treasuries .
The irony is that a whole herd of people moving into one security because they ’re scared creates a problem for those people because prices of those securities get bid up .
You ’re going to have a lot of people holding long duration , fixed income , government securities who are going to see pretty significant price declines over the next decade .
Knowledge@Wharton :
And it ’s not just China that is holding those bonds .
It ’s also American retirees or future retirees .
Smetters : Sure .
Knowledge@Wharton :
What is it that ’s keeping the Chinese government in that market ?
Smetters : China , Japan and the UK have over half of our debt … .
Traditionally the view was that U.S. debt is safe and there were some regulations , especially for Japanese pension funds , requiring investments in safe areas , and U.S. Treasuries qualified because of their safe reputation .
China is starting to question that now , as are other investors .
The question becomes , when does it kind of snap ?
What we know from fixed income markets and foreign exchange markets internationally is that things do n’t just gradually change .
Investor sentiment suddenly snaps and people start to panic .
We saw that in Asia and Latin .
One reason U.S. may face a different situation is that , in the case of previous crises such as in , South Korea or Thailand or Argentina , it was easy just to yank your money and put it elsewhere .
When you yank your money from the U.S. , you are not 100 % clear about where you put it .
And so that may create more of a gradual scenario for the U.S. .
But , you know , we ’re seeing growth in the BRIC countries [ Brazil , Russia , India and China ] .
It would not be surprising that you could see — not an Asian style currency crisis or anything of that magnitude — but certainly our own currency crisis in which investors would suddenly get nervous and start to pull out of U.S. Treasuries .
We could see yields increase quite a bit , and rates and prices decline .
Knowledge@Wharton :
Would it mean an absence of cash for the government to do what it does ?
Smetters :
It would mean that they would have to pay much higher interest rates to float the same debt .
That just makes it more difficult for them to continue to roll over the debt .
One reason why the Treasury can get away with holding so much debt is that at current yields , it ’s pretty cheap for them .
Japan during the 1990 ’s was facing yields of close to 0 % .
It ’s shocking that they , in some sense , were n’t floating even more debt than they were .
And they were floating quite a bit .
But the real lesson is not so much the cost of debt , because what Japan did during the 1990 ’s showed us is that the Japanese government was able to float debt for dirt cheap .
The real problem is that they diverted a lot of investments away from new , nimble financial institutions [ and propped ] up the very inefficient , old school finance institutions .
We ’re basically doing the same thing in the United States .
We ’re trying to prop up institutions that were too large to begin with , AIG and lots of the investment banks .
They were just too big to begin with .
That ’s why corporate risk management was never possible , because … they were just too big , too unwieldy to think about corporate risk management very seriously .
Somewhat ironically , [ the major banks ] actually lost more money buying some of the safer [ subprime - based ] collateralized debt obligations , than they did with their investments in hedge funds , which bought some of the higher risk stuff …
These old institutions , these investment banks and large insurers like AIG , they ’re just old , inefficient and too large .
And we ’re trying to prop them up .
We ’re trying to keep them alive .
And that ’s exactly what Japan did and that ’s why Japan had a recession that lasted a good decade .
I see that scenario playing out over the next five years in the United States .
Unless we ’re willing to allow for a good train wreck , to have some pain in the short run , we ’re going to have this train wreck screech out over many , many years .
And , as a result , we wo n’t clear the tracks very quickly .
I ’ve said it before and I ’ll say it again :
The one nice thing about a good train wreck is you clear the tracks quickly and you start over — but we just refuse to let that happen .
That ’s what Japan did .
Knowledge@Wharton : Would clearing the tracks quickly mean allowing some pain to occur sooner rather than later ?
Smetters : Yes .
There are a couple of dimensions .
One is what ’s going on in the subprime market and the banking market .
There , clearing the tracks quickly basically means creating the most transparent fiscal institution possible .
And [ procedure for doing ] that is called bankruptcy .
Everybody says we want to clean up the balance sheets of these institutions y quickly , and we want to do it in a cheap and efficient way .
Well there ’s a process already out there , it ’s called bankruptcy .
That ’s exact what it does .
It cleans it up very quickly .
And in terms of the entitlement programs [ Medicare and Social Security ] , there ’s no real equivalency of bankruptcy per se , rather we need to have this long discussion about exactly how we ’re going to scale back benefits — because we ca n’t raise taxes enough .
Social Security is the easier problem .
Again , it ’s a cash benefit and all you need to do is slow the benefit growth to something closer to inflation toward , closer toward inflation .
And that in particular means hitting higher income people a little bit harder in terms of their eventual benefits .
I would n’t tax them a lot more , but I would certainly decrease their benefits .
Do that and you can pretty much fix Social Security .
Medicare is much harder , obviously because it ’s a much bigger problem and because of the nature of its benefits .
So again , there your choices are , either have people pay for a lot of it themselves and therefore be sensitized to this tradeoff between benefits and costs , or the government takes a much more draconian approach and basically says , “ We ’ll still pay for it , but now we ’re just going to start rationing who we pay for and what we pay . ”

Barack Obama grew up learning how to slip in and out of different worlds  black and white , foreign and American , rich and poor .

More than a million people joined a nationwide strike in France Thursday , protesting against the government 's response to the economic crisis and disrupting public transit , postal services and hospitals .
The Interior Ministry put the figure at 1.2 million protesters , while union officials said it was closer to three million .
The biggest turnout was in Paris , where at least 85,000 people marched through the streets , police said .
Angry workers in 200 protest marches across the country demanded that President Nicolas Sarkozy do more to fight the crisis .
Sarkozy told ministers at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday that he " understood the worries of the French , " but said he had no plans for additional measures .
Former conservative Prime Minister Alain Juppe said that street protesters were numerous enough that " in one way or another , there must be a return to the table " for talks .
" There is real anxiety , " said Juppe , now mayor of Bordeaux .
Notwithstanding the turnout in Paris , the strikes were not widely felt in the capital , where buses and subways ran at nearly normal rates .
Strikers disrupted services at schools , hospitals and the postal service to varying degrees .
Almost a third of the country 's teachers did not go to school , national education officials said .
The SNCF train authority said 36 per cent of its employees joined the strike .
Some suburban Paris lines were seriously hobbled .
Flights affected
About one - third of medium - haul flights were affected at Orly , Paris 's second airport .
Rail traffic was disrupted throughout France , although the high - speed TGV trains that connect the country with European neighbours ran on time .
Meanwhile , energy workers cut off 10,000 megawatts of electricity production overnight leading into the protests .
The strike was also expected to cut refining output and block Marseille 's oil port .
" This march is legitimate and useful for the country , " former Socialist presidential candidate Segolene Royal told local media on Thursday .
" Perhaps as a result of this march , the authorities will finally move to respond to the preoccupations of the French . "
Special bonuses for the needy
A strike in late January drew between one million and 2.5 million people into French streets .
Weeks later , Sarkozy announced measures to help people affected by the financial crisis , including special bonuses for the needy .
Union leaders want further talks on more measures to help those in distress as a result of the crisis .
Budget Minister Eric Woerth said the measures already announced will increase social expenditures in 2009 by nearly 10 billion euros .
" I cannot believe that the government will stay immobile in the face of a phenomenon of this size , " Bernard Thibault , head of the CGT union , told France 2 television .
' Strong sense of injustice '
" A very strong sense of injustice is building up , " Jean - Claude Mailly , head of the Force Ouvriere Union said .
" I think the government will find it hard to ignore us . "
The demands by the unions include boosting salaries , protecting employment , halting job cuts in the public sector and a tax hike for high earners .
Opinion polls in the country indicate that more than 70 per cent of voters support the nationwide strikes .
Many French also feel , however , that the protests wo n't change government policies .
" The strike wo n't accomplish much but is useful nonetheless .
It 's necessary to express yourself , in any case , " said Beatrice Lobrot , a spokesman for a cosmetics company .
Jean Batis , a music producer , said : " It 's always the same game .
They give a little bit , we strike , they give a little bit , we strike . "
Economy shrinking at record pace
France 's economy is shrinking at the fastest pace in more than 30 years .
The economy 's contraction is expected to accelerate to 1.5 per cent in the first quarter , its worst performance since 1975 .
The jobless rate stood at 7.7 per cent in the third quarter and is expected to spike to 9.8 per cent this year , according to the European Commission , with some of France 's largest companies expected to cut their work forces this year .

The Cuban government , long the object of a U.S. economic blockade , is prepared to meet with the Obama administration , Cuba 's leader said .
Raúl Castro says Cuba is willing " to discuss everything -- human rights , freedom of the press , political prisoners . ''
" We 've told the North American government , in private and in public , that we are prepared , wherever they want , to discuss everything -- human rights , freedom of the press , political prisoners -- everything , everything , everything that they want to discuss , " Cuban President Raúl Castro said Thursday at a summit of leftist Latin American leaders in Venezuela .
The response came days after President Obama lifted all restrictions on the ability of American citizens to visit relatives in Cuba as well as to send them remittances .
Travel restrictions for Americans of non-Cuban descent will remain in place .
This week 's move represents a significant shift in a U.S. policy that had remained largely unchanged for nearly half a century .
The U.S. government instituted the embargo three years after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959 .
In Mexico City for meetings with Mexican President Felipe Calderon , Obama offered a carrot and a stick to Havana .
" What we 're looking for is some signal that there are going to be changes in how Cuba operates that assures that political prisoners are released , that people can speak their minds freely , that they can travel , that they can write and attend church and do the things that people throughout the hemisphere can do and take for granted , " he said .
" And if there is some sense of movement on those fronts in Cuba , then I think we can see a further thawing of relations and further changes . "
Obama 's gesture precedes a trip this week to Trinidad and Tobago for a key meeting of hemispheric powers -- the Summit of the Americas .

LIBERTAS HAS hit an unexpected hurdle in Britain because a close associate of a rival political party has already registered Libertas UK with the electoral commission .
Bridget Rowe , a friend of UK Independence Party chief Nigel Farage , is listed as the leader of Libertas UK on the electoral commission ’s website .
The party was registered on December 19th , 2008 and is expected to field candidates in England , says the commission .
An electoral commission spokesman said yesterday one of the criteria for successfully registering a political party in Britain was that no party with the same name already existed on the commission ’s list .
It is now unclear whether Declan Ganley ’s Libertas , which wants to field candidates in Britain in the upcoming European elections , will be able to compete under its Libertas brand .
A Libertas spokesman refused to comment on the registration issue yesterday .
Mr Ganley also moved quickly to distance himself from controversial Czech MEP Vladimir Zelezny , who last week registered Libertas as a party in the Czech Republic .
Mr Ganley , who wants to set up Libertas branches in all 27 EU states ahead of the June elections , issued a press release yesterday stating that he had not “ recruited ” Mr Zelezny .
Mr Zelezny is a controversial character in the Czech Republic , where he has been convicted of tax evasion and is the subject of several investigations by the authorities .
He told a Prague radio station last year he is a “ fierce eurosceptic ” , adding that the EU ’s “ over - regulated environment strongly resembles what we know from our communist past ” .
A Libertas spokeswoman in Brussels said this week the former media mogul Mr Zelezny had registered the Czech branch of the organisation “ with the knowledge ” of Libertas , a comment that was published by The Irish Times .
Mr Ganley said yesterday this was not true and accused this newspaper of trying to attach his name to “ a Eurosceptic agenda ” .
“ Mr Ganley said that while Mr Zelezny had registered the name Libertas in the Czech Republic , this action was not done on the request of Libertas in either Dublin or Brussels , and indicated nothing more than the enthusiasm of support for the Libertas project being expressed by people across the continent , ” said the statement .
“ Mr Zelezny had not , as implied in the report , been asked to stand in the European elections by Libertas , or in fact been the recipient of any specific request from Libertas in relation to its campaign , nor had he been the subject of any announcement made by Libertas , as reported , ” it added .
Asked to clarify what relationship Libertas and Mr Zelezny currently enjoy , or will have in the future , Libertas refused to comment yesterday .
The party also refused to speculate on whether it would run Libertas candidates under the party registered by Mr Zelezny .
Mr Zelezny also refused to return phone calls made by The Irish Timesyesterday .
Many longtime sailors have been mesmerized by the dazzling displays of green light often seen below the ocean surface in tropical seas .
Now researchers at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego have uncovered key clues about the bioluminescent worms that produce the green glow and the biological mechanisms behind their light production .
Marine fireworms use bioluminescence to attract suitors in an undersea mating ritual .
Research conducted by Scripps marine biologists Dimitri Deheyn and Michael Latz reveals that the worms also may use the light as a defensive measure .
The report , published as the cover story of the current issue of the journal Invertebrate Biology , provides insights into the function of fireworm bioluminescence and moves scientists closer to identifying the molecular basis of the light .
" This is another step toward understanding the biology of the bioluminescence in fireworms , and it also brings us closer to isolating the protein that produces the light , " said Deheyn , a scientist in the Marine Biology Research Division at Scripps .
" If we understand how it is possible to keep light so stable for such a long time , it would provide opportunities to use that protein or reaction in biomedical , bioengineering and other fields - the same way other proteins have been used . "
The fireworms used in the study ( Odontosyllis phosphorea ) are seafloor - dwelling animals that inhabit tropical and sub-tropical shallow coastal areas .
During summer reproductive events known as " swarming , " females secrete a luminous green mucus - which often draws the attention of human seafarers - before releasing gametes into the water .
The bright glow attracts male fireworms , which also release gametes into the bright green cloud .
The precisely timed bioluminescent displays have been tracked like clockwork in Southern California , the Caribbean and Japan , peaking one to two days before each quarter moon phase , 30 to 40 minutes after sunset and lasting approximately 20 to 30 minutes .
Deheyn and Latz collected hundreds of specimens from San Diego 's Mission Bay for their study , allowing them to not only examine live organisms but also produce the fireworms ' luminous mucus for the first time in an experimental setting .
The achievement provided a unique perspective and framework for examining the biology behind the worm 's bioluminescent system .
A central finding described in the Invertebrate Biology paper is that the fireworms ' bioluminescent light appears to play a role beyond attracting mates .
The researchers found that juveniles produce bioluminescence as flashes , leading to a determination that the light also may serve as a defensive mechanism , intended to distract predators .
Through experiments that included hot and cold testing and oxygen depletion studies , Deheyn and Latz found that the bioluminescence is active in temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius ( minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
Higher temperatures , however , caused the bioluminescence to decay rapidly .
The light also proved resilient in settings of low oxygen levels .
Based on these tests , the researchers believe the chemical process responsible for the bioluminescence may involve a specific light - producing protein - also called a " photoprotein . "
Further identification and isolation will be pursued in future studies .
" We were inspired by the work of earlier researchers who had studied the chemistry of fireworm bioluminescence , including Osamu Shimomura , one of the winners of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of green fluorescent protein from the jellyfish luminescent system , " said Latz .
" This new study showed that the fireworm bioluminescence also involves green fluorescence , originating from the oxidation product of the luminescent reaction . "
The study was supported by a grant from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research 's Biomimetics , Biomaterials and Biointerfacial Sciences program .
Mexico has ramped up its containment efforts Mexican authorities have taken drastic measures to contain a new strain of the swine flu virus that has killed 81 and prompted fears of a global pandemic .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) says the situation remains serious but " the picture is evolving " .
Several countries have reported suspected cases of infection - the latest were eight students in New York who were confirmed to have swine flu .
But US cases of infections had not had contact with pigs , the WHO said .
SWINE FLU
Swine flu is a respiratory disease found in pigs Human cases usually occur in those who have contact with pigs Human - to - human transmission is rare and such cases are closely monitored
Q&A : Swine flu UK monitoring swine flu outbreak H1N1 is the same strain that causes seasonal flu outbreaks in humans , but the newly detected version contains genetic material from versions of flu which usually affect pigs and birds .
The respiratory virus - which infects pigs but only sporadically humans - is spread mainly through coughs and sneezes .
The WHO has warned the virus has the potential to become a pandemic , and has urged all governments to step up surveillance .
Several countries in Asia and Latin America have begun screening airport passengers for symptoms .
Suspected outbreaks
Although all of the deaths so far have been in Mexico , the flu is spreading in the United States and suspected cases have been detected elsewhere : Susan Watts , BBC Science editor
The next few days and weeks will be crucial .
One possibly hopeful sign is that of the eight cases in the US there has been only one hospitalisation , and no deaths .
So it may turn out that there is some other kind of infection at work in Mexico , as well as the new flu virus .

In addition , eight suspected cases are being investigated at a New York City high school where about 200 students fell mildly ill with flu - like symptoms
Ten New Zealand students are among a group which travelled to Mexico have tested positive for influenza A - making it " likely " , though not definite , that they are infected with swine flu , said Health Minister Tony Ryall
In France , a top health official told Le Parisien newspaper there were unconfirmed suspicions that two individuals who had just returned from Mexico may be carrying the virus
Spain 's health ministry says three people who returned from a trip from Mexico with flu symptoms are in isolation and being tested
In Israel , medics are testing a 26 - year - old man who has been taken to hospital with flu - like symptoms after returning from a trip to Mexico
But a UK hospital conducting tests for swine flu on a British Airways cabin crew member said the tests proved negative .
Mexico shutdown
The Mexican government , which has faced criticism for what some see as a slow reaction to this outbreak , is now taking an increasingly hard line to try to contain the virus , says the BBC's Stephen Gibbs in Mexico City .
Public buildings have been closed and hundreds of public events suspended .
There is a sense of chaos in hospitals and we do not know what to do

People are being strongly urged to avoid shaking hands , and the US embassy has advised visitors to the country to keep at least six feet ( 1.8 m ) from other people .
Mexico's Health Secretary , Jose Cordova , said a total of 1,324 people had been admitted to hospital with suspected symptoms since 13 April and were being tested for the virus .
" In that same period , 81 deaths were recorded probably linked to the virus but only in 20 cases we have the laboratory tests to confirm it , " he said .
Mexico's President Felipe Calderon has announced emergency measures to deal with the situation .
They include powers to isolate individuals suspected of having the virus without fear of legal repercussions .

In New York , city health commissioner Dr Thomas Frieden said preliminary tests conducted on the ailing students showed they were possible cases of swine flu .
Further tests will clarify if it was the same strain that was detected in the other three states .
Following a meeting of its emergency committee on Saturday , the WHO said the virus had the potential to become a pandemic but it was too early to say whether that would happen .
FLU PANDEMICS 1918 : The Spanish flu pandemic remains the most devastating outbreak of modern times - infecting up to 40 % of the world 's population and killing more than 50 m people , with young adults particularly badly affected
1957 : Asian flu killed two million people .
Caused by a human form of the virus , H2N2 , combining with a mutated strain found in wild ducks .
The elderly were particularly vulnerable
1968 : An outbreak first detected in Hong Kong , and caused by a strain known as H3N2 , killed up to one million people globally , with those over 65 most likely to die WHO Director General Margaret Chan said recent events constituted " a public health emergency of international concern " and that countries needed to co-operate in heightening surveillance .
The WHO is advising all countries to be vigilant for seasonally unusual flu or pneumonia - like symptoms among their populations - particularly among young healthy adults , a characteristic of past pandemics .
Officials said most of those killed so far in Mexico were young adults - rather than more vulnerable children and the elderly .
There is currently no vaccine for the new strain but severe cases can be treated with antiviral medication .
It is unclear how effective currently available flu vaccines would be at offering protection against the new strain , as it is genetically distinct from other flu strains .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Tuesday it has the legal power to block permits for so - called mountaintop coal mines , a move that could affect hundreds of mining operations .
The EPA voiced concerns about the controversial mining practice and said it could veto permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers if the mines would permanently impair water quality by fouling valley streams .
This could affect hundreds of operations where mining permits have been sought or granted .
The environment agency made its position known in a pair of letters to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , which grants permits for this kind of destructive mining under the condition that mine operators rebuild the streams .
The EPA strongly questioned whether the human - made channels often used to replace natural valley streams meet this condition .
“ The two letters reflect EPA ’s considerable concern regarding the environmental impact these projects would have on fragile habitats and streams , ” Lisa Jackson , the agency ’s chief , said in a statement .
“ I have directed the agency to review other mining permit requests , ” she said .
“ EPA will use the best science and follow the letter of the law in ensuring we are protecting our environment . ”
The essential components of living streams -- microscopic animals and plants -- suffer downstream from mountaintop mining sites , compared with undisturbed sites , the EPA letters said .
The letters referred to two specific operations in West Virginia where mountaintop mining is proposed .
The EPA ’s move is a departure from the agency ’s stance during the Bush administration , which supported mountaintop mining .
Coal companies consider it an economical alternative to traditional underground mines in Appalachia , where production is declining .
More than half of U.S. electricity is derived from coal .
Environmentalists and community activists in coal country decry it as ecological devastation and went to court to prevent it in West Virginia , but a three - judge panel of the U.S. Appeals Court in Richmond , Virginia , overturned a ban on the practice on February 13 .
The appeal was brought by Massey Energy Co and the West Virginia Coal Association .
Joan Mulhern , an attorney with the environmental legal group Earthjustice , said the matter is still in flux and the plaintiffs have the right to ask the whole appeals court to hear the case .
But Mulhern said EPA was showing a “ seismic shift ” in U.S. policy .
“ The EPA is saying this is a significant transition from Bush policies on mountaintop removal to Obama administration policies , ” Mulhern said by telephone .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Chrysler LLC filed for bankruptcy Thursday .
But a deal has been reached to combine the company with Fiat in order to allow Chrysler to stay in business .
The bankruptcy filing , which was made in federal court in New York , comes after some of Chrysler 's smaller lenders refused a Treasury Department demand to reduce the amount of money the troubled automaker owed them .
In remarks at the White House , President Obama said that the bankruptcy filing is not a failure for the company but " one more step on the path to Chrysler 's revival . "
Obama vowed the bankruptcy process would be quick , efficient and controlled .
A senior administration official predicted it would be completed within 30 to 60 days .
The combination with Fiat is also due to close during that period of time .
According to government officials , a new company will be formed that will buy the assets of Chrysler - its plants , brands , land , equipment , as well as its contracts with the union , dealers and suppliers - from the bankruptcy court .
The company 's liabilities and an unspecified number of Chrysler 's 3,300 dealerships which now sell the Chrysler , Dodge and Jeep brands will be left behind in the bankruptcy court .
Administration officials said the Treasury Department will provide Chrysler with about $ 8 billion in loans on top of the $ 4 billion in loans it has already received to get it through bankruptcy .
Officials said $ 3.3 billion of the new loans will be used to fund operations during bankruptcy , while the remaining $ 4.7 billion will allow Chrysler to function normally once it exits bankruptcy .
In addition , the Canadian government will loan the companies $ 2.7 billion to help support Chrysler 's Canadian operations .
Jobs safe for now , but plants will close temporarily
While an administration official promised there will be no immediate job cuts for the company 's 39,000 employees or plant closings , Chrysler announced that most manufacturing operations will be temporarily shut down on Monday , May 4 .
Normal production is not due to resume until the transaction with Fiat is completed .
But some Chrysler plants , including truck assembly and stamping plants in Warren , Mich . , shut down earlier than scheduled on Thursday .
Following the bankruptcy filing , some suppliers worried about being paid stopped shipping parts to the plants .
" I was hoping we could get through this unscathed , " said Gene Behme , a production technician at the Warren stamping plant as he left work about an hour early .
" I 'm disappointed .
I would like to keep working .
Hopefully we 'll come through stronger . "
Chrysler President Tom LaSorda would not say how many plants would shut down early or how many suppliers had cut off shipments on the bankruptcy news .
" Hopefully most of the suppliers will continue to supply us , " he said .
Most of Chrysler 's hourly workers will receive about 80 % of their normal pay during the shutdown under unemployment benefits and supplemental pay in the union contract .
The employees whose jobs may be most immediately in danger are the 3,400 workers of Chrysler Financial , which provides loans to Chrysler customers and its dealers .
That unit is essentially going out of business .
As part of the reorganization , lending will now be provided by GMAC , the finance arm jointly owned by General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) and current Chrysler parent Cerberus Capital Management .
( Cerberus will end up with no stake in Chrysler once the bankruptcy is complete and is in the process of cutting its stake in GMAC to less than 15 % . )
Some of the 140,000 employees at Chrysler 's network of dealers could also be at risk .
Chrysler CEO
Robert Nardelli said that the reduction in the network of 3,300 dealers would not be a " catastrophic " but that it would be " noticeable . "
Nardelli , who joined Chrysler two years ago , will leave after Chrysler emerges from bankruptcy and completes the alliance with Fiat .
Fiat will be calling more of the shots after the combination as the deal calls for it to provide " management services " to Chrysler .
A successor for Nardelli will be named by the new Chrysler board of directors , which will have four members named by the Treasury Department , three named by Fiat , and one each by the UAW and the Canadian government .
Once the deal closes , Fiat will examine the cost structure of Chrysler to find additional savings .
Fiat has promised to use Chrysler 's existing plants to build the small cars it now sells in Europe for the U.S. market .
Last - minute deals ensured Chrysler 's survival
Chrysler faced a midnight Thursday deadline from the Treasury Department to reach deals with creditors who had loaned the company about $ 7 billion .
But the troubled 85 - year old automaker was able to avoid liquidation thanks to the deal with Fiat , concessions from the United Auto Workers union and agreements by major lenders to cut Chrysler 's debt .
The UAW announced late Wednesday night that its membership at Chrysler had overwhelmingly ratified the agreement reached between the company and union leadership on Sunday night .
As a result of that deal , the UAW will own 55 % of Chrysler .
Fiat will own a 20 % stake with the option of increasing it to 35 % .
The U.S. government will own 8 % and Canada will have a 2 % stake .
Major banks such as Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) agreed to reduce their portion of $ 7 billion in secured loans to a more manageable $ 2.25 billion , but talks with smaller lenders broke down Wednesday when they refused to meet a deadline set by the Treasury Department to accept pennies on the dollars for loans to Chrysler .
Nonetheless , the fact that Chrysler will not have a disorderly bankruptcy may prevent a rash of failures across the auto supplier industry that had the potential to disrupt production at other automakers .
Chrysler owes its suppliers about $ 7 billion , according to the latest figures available from the company .
Some of those suppliers could still be hurt by the bankruptcy filing .
And the auto industry 's woes are far from over .
Sales have plunged due to the global recession and tighter credit .
Major automakers are expected to report dismal April sales on Friday .
Chrysler has been among the hardest hit .
It has fallen behind Toyota Motor ( TM ) in sales , and is close to being overtaken by Honda ( HMC ) for the No. 4 spot for U.S. sales .
In addition , GM faces a government - imposed deadline to restructure by the end of May or it too could be forced into bankruptcy .

AROUND THE WEB
The deaths sparked angry protests in Kut and calls for an investigation A US raid in the south of Iraq , in which two people died , was a crime and those responsible should be tried , says Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki .
He said the raid in the town of Kut was a breach of the security pact governing US military actions in the country .
The US has said the raid was carried out in full agreement with the Iraqis .
The BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad says it is the most serious dispute between the US and Iraq since the agreement came into force at the start of the year .
One senior local official said the actions had rendered the pact " meaningless " .
US forces stormed buildings in Wasit province early on Sunday morning .
A policeman and a woman were shot dead and six people detained .
The US military said the raid , against a weapons smuggler and " network financier " , had been " fully coordinated and approved by the Iraqi government " .
They said soldiers had shot and killed " an individual with a weapon " outside the house and that the woman who died had " moved into the line of fire " .
Two senior Iraqi army officers were arrested for permitting an American operation to go ahead without the knowledge of the Iraqi authorities .
Pact ' meaningless '
In a statement read on state TV , Mr Maliki said he condemned the killings as a " breach of the security pact " .
He called on the US to " release the detainees and hand over those responsible for this crime to the courts " .
The incident caused uproar in Wasit , where provincial governor Latif Hamad al - Turfah echoed Mr Maliki 's condemnation .
He said local government and officials had been " surprised that these forces carried out the raid in breach of the agreement signed between the Iraqi and US governments " .
The chairman of the provincial council , Mahmud Abd al - Rida , said the raid had embodied the " meaning of the occupation " .
" Their claim of friendship and early withdrawal from our dear land , according to the security agreement signed by the two Iraqi and US parties , is meaningless , " he said .
The complicated Status of Forces Agreement was signed in November last year and came into force in early 2009 .
It requires all military operations in Iraq to have the government 's approval and allows for US soldiers to face trial if they commit crimes off base .
The US currently has more than 140,000 troops in Iraq , and combat troops are due to pull out of Iraq 's cities by the end of June .

It is , of course , a mere coincidence that the firm for which the spouse of the House Republican whip works has scarfed up a couple of hundred million bucks in the banking bailout .
Really .
( I can understand why you might wonder , considering Rep. Cantor 's role model seems to be the disgraced Tom DeLay . )
So for now , we 'll take them at their word .
But just imagine that this happened with the spouse of the House Democratic whip , and picture the heated Republican outrage !
The press conference , the cable TV talking heads frothing at the mouth !
The decrying of greed , the cries of pained incredulity ...
Because the firm did n't actually need the money .
They simply restructured their tax setup so they would be eligible .
After all , you can never have too much money :
WASHINGTON — A bank that employs the wife of Rep. Eric I. Cantor , R - Va. , benefited from the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout that Cantor helped steer through Congress last fall .
Diana F. Cantor runs a Virginia - based subsidiary of New York Private Bank and Trust .
The New York bank received $ 267.2 million from the U.S. Treasury ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program Jan .
9 . A spokesman for New York Private Bank and Trust told ProPublica , an investigative journalism Web site that first reported the relationship , Diana Cantor was “ never aware that the parent bank was seeking or received [ bailout ] funding . ”
A spokesman for the New York bank declined to comment for this report .
Diana Cantor , the managing director of the subsidiary , Virginia Private Bank and Trust , did not return a phone call seeking comment Monday .
She also serves on Media General ’s board of directors .
[ Editor 's note : Props to Media General for following up on an embarrassing story about their own board member .
After all , she 's an attorney , a CPA and an investment banker .
You might expect her to be better informed about these things ! ]
Religion raises the stakes of human conflict much higher than tribalism , racism , or politics ever can , as it is the only form of in - group / out - group thinking that casts the differences between people in terms of eternal rewards and punishments .
Sam Harris , Letter to a Christian Nation ( Vintage )
When I first came across this quote , I was n't sure what to think .
As someone who thinks that tribalism , racism , and some approaches to politics are pretty bad in terms of their impact on conflict , I was skeptical about the possibility of religion being even worse .
But I think Harris is right when he points out that religion is the only one that makes the differences between people eternal .
Racism , which I think most of us would agree is a bad thing , may be the one most closely associated with dehumanization .
But as bad as that is , it does n't always go as far as religion seems to with making the out - group not just subhuman but evil in the sense of deserving everlasting punishment .
The concept of eternal punishment is probably something we critics of religion do not emphasize enough .
The hell Christians imagine is supposed to be forever .
Once there , one is not eligible for parole ; one remains there forever .
That is not the sort of sentence a loving being would impose .
What 's that ?
You say you wanted more sandbox - style games ?
Activision has you covered with the release of Protoype on the Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 and PC this Summer .

New York Comic
Con attendees will have a chance to go hands - on with the game at the show this weekend and we recently got to see the game in action at CES .
But I played through an early level at an Activision event earlier tonight in advance of the show .
Advertisement
What It Is
Prototype is an open - world action game that takes place in a decimated New York City .
The protagonist , Alex Mercer , has awoken to a pretty large problem .
Not only has his memory been erased , but he also has these crazy shape - shifting powers .
What is one to do ?
Why , go on a rampage of course !
You 'll fight hoards of militants and enemy mutants by flinging cars , people , or by using any one of your many shape - shifting powers .
Radical Entertainment is developing the game , who may be best known for their sandbox -y action games like Scarface and The Incredible Hulk : Ultimate Destruction .
What We Saw
I saw an early preview level from the game for the Xbox 360 that I managed to complete in about 15 minutes .
Overall , there were 4 mission objectives given sequentially , mostly involving killing someone or something before advancing to the next .
I played this demo at an Activision party , meaning I did have an Activision rep on hand to highlight some of the elaborate looking move sets , but I mainly completed it myself without any help .
How Far Along
Is it ?
I was told it 's still in pre-beta .
Its expected release date is June .

What Needs Improvement
While I was n't given the option to fiddle with every feature of the game , from my initial impression I 'd like to see a few minor touch - ups to the camera positioning .
During busy fights you can lose sight of what you 're doing .
The civilian A.I. did n't seem to really react to anything going on in the environment .
They were always just running around in panic mode ( which could be understandable ) .
At times , I felt like I could simply button - mash my way to victory .

Oh , and it would be nice to have multiplayer co-op , but that 's not happening any time soon .
Advertisement
What Needs To Stay The Same
The controls .
Performing high - profile acrobatic moves never seemed easier .
Holding the right - trigger while running allows Alex to automatically leap over debris .
The controls themselves take very little time to get used to .
Final Thoughts
While the game is an original I.P. , I 'm not sure about how much different of an experience this will be from the Incredible Hulk games they made .
The demo I played looked extremely polished , save for a few minor bugs , like cars getting stuck in the street pavement .
The framerate , overall , was solid .
I 'm also interested to see where the story goes throughout the rest of the game .

In the days of MMO gaming and online play , the idea of sitting around a card table and actually playing with people in the room must seem almost quaint to some .
There is still much joy to be had in playing table - top Dungeons and Dragons however , although Wizards of the Coast is now dealing with some modern problems .
Rampant piracy of its products has led the company to sue a number of individuals and to yank all the for - pay PDF files from the Internet .
Wizards of the Coast has filed three lawsuits against eight defendants �( via TechDirt ) from the US , Poland , and the Phillipines .
The complaint ?
That the defendants allegedly bought digital copies of the Player 's Handbook 2 , and then uploaded them to certain file - sharing sites .
As of yesterday , the PDF files were not available for purchase legally .
Ars called Wizards of the Coast PR Manager Tolena Thorburn to talk about the situation .
She denied that the company took down the files themselves .
" We have relationships , contracts with those companies , " she explained to Ars .
" What we did is we terminated our contracts .
When we terminated the contracts , the files come down .
The reason ?
The severe increase of piracy of the products . "
Wizards of the Coast products have long been easily available online ... if you know where to look .
At what point does the problem get bad enough for a move this drastic ?
" There was n't a specific number for us , " Thorburn said .
" In these lawsuits , which are public information , you would see that this specifically revolves around the players handbooks .
They were released and , the same day , there were thousands of copies being downloaded illegally .
It 's very frustrating for us . "
We asked if , at the moment , there was any way to download the PDF files legally .
" There should not be , " she told Ars .
" You can buy the books online , but not the pdfs . "
This has frustrated many fans , and some blogs are pointing out that now the only way to get these books digitally is to pirate them .
Thorburn would n't say whether or not the files will be coming back , or when , but she did say Wizards is " actively exploring other avenues for digital distribution . "
How do you stop these books from finding their way on to BitTorrent trackers ?
It 's a tough question , one that software companies have n't yet found a good answer for .
It 's even harder for companies selling information in physical form ; copying the content is as easy as brewing a pot of coffee and connecting a scanner to your computer .
You can add DRM to the files to protect your intellectual property , but that again simply makes the pirated product more appealing .
Having no legal way to buy the files is a damaging strategy in a time when a dungeon master is almost as likely to have a laptop as he is to have a pad of paper .
" It 's a difficult problem to have , and it's one that plagues our industry , " Thorburn said .
" We did n't do this lightly , and we understand our fans enjoy that format .
Most of the fans who have legally purchased PDFs are also customers who have the physical product .
Until we have another digital solution , I think our fans at least are not being deprived of the product , and I think that 's really important , that they have the product that they know and love . "

Kate Connolly , one of only two British journalists in the court in St Pölten , witnesses the opening of the case against Josef Fritzl
Josef Fritzl , the Austrian electrical engineer on trial for incarcerating his daughter in an underground prison for 24 years and fathering seven children with her , yesterday pleaded guilty to charges of rape , incest , false imprisonment and coercion .
The 73 - year - old denied one charge of murder for the death of a twin boy born to his daughter , for whom Fritzl failed to seek medical help .
He also denied a charge of slavery , which has been on the Austrian statute book since the 1960s , but has never been tried in court .
Fritzl faces a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison , and a maximum of life .
Prosecutor Christiane Burkheiser told the court how Fritzl had raped his daughter an estimated 3,000 times while holding her in appalling conditions .
She said he had lured his daughter into the purpose - built cellar in August 1984 when she was just 18 , on the pretence of asking her to help him fix a door .
He then sedated her by placing a cloth soaked with ether over her nose and mouth and slammed the door closed .
On the second day after her incarceration , he put an iron chain around her stomach , attaching it to a pole " so that she had no chance of escape " .
He raped her the same day for the first time , Burkheiser said .
She said the underground cell had been " his playground " and that he had " used [ Elisabeth ] like a toy " .
" He came , took her and went again , " she said .
Listing the dates Elisabeth had given birth over a 12 - year period , Burkheiser spoke of the pain she had felt at her father 's decision to take three of the children to live with him upstairs .
" Can you imagine what that was like for her , on the one hand the relief that the child would have a better life , on the other , the fact that he was taking away her dearest ? " she asked .
She detailed how his failure to fetch medical help for a twin boy called Michael , born to his daughter in 1996 , had led to his death , and how he later disposed of the body by burning it .
Defending Fritzl , Rudolf Mayer said his client was not a monster , as he had been portrayed by the media .
" Despite the way he 's been described , try to see the accused as a human being , " he told the eight - strong jury and four replacement jurors .
He argued that Fritzl could have let the cellar children die and that his determination to provide for both his " upstairs " and " downstairs " families was proof that he was not a monster .
Having submitted his pleas on the six charges , Fritzl then answered detailed questions from Humer about his childhood , early adulthood and career , including his apprenticeship as an electrical engineer .
Fritzl said he had hardly known his father , who had only played a " periodic and sporadic " role in his life , and that had been abused as a child by his mother .
" I had a very difficult childhood , " he said in a weak and sometimes barely audible voice .
" My mother rejected me .
She was 42 when she had me .
She just did n't want a child and she treated me accordingly . "
He said he had been hit repeatedly , even for bringing school friends home .
" I had friends but mother did n't allow them .
I got a clip round the ear every time .
Then when I was 12 I said to her : ' If you do that again I 'll hit you back , ' and then she stopped . "
Asked if he had any friends in adulthood , Fritzl said : " I had no friends .
You need to nurture friendships and I had no time for that . "
He told the court that he had met his wife , Rosemarie , at the age of 19 , and she had been " the first woman I had sexual relations with " .
She had been " very domesticated , and wanted at least 10 children " .
The press and public were made to leave the courtroom before a video of Elisabeth Fritzl was played on a huge screen .
Investigators recorded an interview with her last July in the presence of psychiatrists , to spare her the ordeal of having to face her father in person .
Court officials said the 11 - hour long recording will be played to the court in " small portions " throughout the week , due to their apparently harrowing content .
Four expert witnesses are also on hand to give evidence .
For the duration of the trial , Elisabeth and her six children are being looked after in the nearby psychiatric clinic they were taken to after their release last year , having been allegedly hounded out of their new home by British paparazzi .
One British tabloid has published pictures of Elisabeth in her new environment , while another has printed the name of the village where the family had set up home in a new house .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- William Jackson was a slave in the home of Confederate president Jefferson Davis during the Civil War .
It turns out he was also a spy for the Union Army , providing key secrets to the North about the Confederacy .
William Jackson , a slave , listened closely to Jefferson Davis ' conversations and leaked them to the North .
Jackson was Davis ' house servant and personal coachman .
He learned high - level details about Confederate battle plans and movements because Davis saw him as a " piece of furniture " -- not a human , according to Ken Dagler , author of " Black Dispatches , " which explores espionage by America 's slaves .
" Because of his role as a menial servant , he simply was ignored , " Dagler said .
" So Jefferson Davis would hold conversations with military and Confederate civilian officials in his presence . "
Dagler has written extensively on the issue for the CIA 's Center for the Study of Intelligence .
Watch the stories of slaves as spies »
In late 1861 , Jackson fled across enemy lines and was immediately debriefed by Union soldiers .
Dagler said Jackson provided information about supply routes and military strategy .
" In Jackson 's case , what he did was ... present some of the current issues that were affecting the Confederacy that you could not read about in the local press that was being passed back and forth across local lines .
He actually had some feel for the issues of supply problems , " Dagler said .
Jackson and other slaves ' heroic efforts have been a forgotten legacy of the war -- lost amid the nation 's racially charged past and the heaps of information about the war 's historic battles .
But historians over the last few decades have been taking an interest in the sacrifice of African - Americans during those war years .
Jackson 's espionage is mentioned in a letter from a general to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton .
Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell refers to " Jeff Davis ' coachman " as the source of information about Confederate deployments .
Watch grandson of slaves : " They call me Little Man " »
Dagler said slaves who served as spies were able to collect incredibly detailed information , in large part because of their tradition of oral history .
Because Southern laws prevented blacks from learning how to read and write , he said , the slave spies listened intently to minute details and memorized them .
" What the Union officers found very quickly with those who crossed the line ... was that if you talked to them , they remembered a great more in the way of details and specifics than the average person ... because again they relied totally on their memory as opposed to any written records , " he said .
Jackson was n't the only spy .
There were hundreds of them .
In some cases , the slaves made it to the North , only to return to the South to risk being hanged .
One Union general wrote that he counted on black spies in Tennessee because " no white man had the pluck to do it . "
No one was better than Robert Smalls , a slave who guided vital supply ships in and out of Charleston Harbor in South Carolina .
He eventually escaped and provided the Union with " a turning of the forces in Charleston Harbor , " according to an annual report of the Navy secretary to President Lincoln .
" A debriefing of him gave ... the Union force there the entire fortification scheme for the interior harbor , " Dagler said .
One of the most iconic spies was Harriet Tubman , who ran the Underground Railroad , bringing slaves to the North .
In 1863 , she was asked by the Union to help with espionage in South Carolina .
She picked former slaves from the region for an espionage ring and led many of the spy expeditions herself .
" The height of her intelligence involvement occurred late in 1863 when she actually led a raid into South Carolina , " Dagler said .
" In addition to the destruction of millions of dollars of property , she brought out over 800 slaves back into freedom in the North . "
As the nation marks Black History Month in February , Dagler said that history should include the sacrifices of the African - Americans who risked their lives for their nation .
Many paid the ultimate sacrifice .
" They were all over the place , and no one [ in the South ] considered them to be of any value .
Consequently , they heard and saw virtually everything done by their masters , who were the decision - makers , " Dagler said .
Whatever happened to William Jackson , the spy in Jefferson Davis 's house ?
Unfortunately , that remains a great unknown .
" He simply disappeared from history , as so many of them have . "

Oprah Winfrey , one of the nation 's most influential women ( and a billionaire to boot ) , is now on Twitter .
The Chicago talk show host and entrepreneur is a bit late to the party , considering a bunch of Congress members have been typing away 140 - character messages on their cellphones for months .
President Obama , the first presidential candidate to whom she pledged her public support , used Twitter as a tool for rallying voters .
Just a couple hours after the segment aired on her show today , Winfrey 's Twitter name , @oprah , already has more than 174,000 followers , ** who will hypothetically receive brief updates about her show , magazine and products in the future .
Perhaps more interestingly , after creating her account Thursday , she amassed more than 35,000 followers by last night -- without any promotion or even a single tweet on the page .
But she still has a ways to go before she catches " That 70's Show " and " Punk'd " star Ashton Kutcher .

I ’d like to call out something important from my QCon slides : the Railsbench GC settings .
quick study
In my experience , a typical production Rails app on Ruby 1.8 can recover 20 % to 40 % of user CPU by applying Stefan Kaes ’s Railsbench GC patch to the Ruby binary , and using the following environment variables :
RUBY_HEAP_MIN_SLOTS=500000 RUBY_HEAP_SLOTS_INCREMENT=250000 RUBY_HEAP_SLOTS_GROWTH_FACTOR=1 RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT=50000000
In return , you get a minor increase in peak memory consumption .
Not too shabby .
gc behavior
Ruby ’s GC is non-generational , which means that the GC looks at every object every time it runs .
Java , OCaml , and other static languages have a generational GC , which means that only recent allocations are frequently checked ( the older an object is , the less likely it is to be freeable ) .
But Ruby pays a high cost each GC run because it looks at all old objects too ; for example , the Rails code itself stored in the AST .
Writing a generational GC is quite difficult , but there is one thing we can do : run the GC less frequently .
This is what Stefan ’s patches allow .
how to tune your app
If you install this patch from Sylvain Joyeux , you can add object allocation deltas to your Rails log , as well as use Stefan ’s GC tracking methods .
This gives you visibility into exactly when the GC runs and how much useful work it does .
Spin up ab and script a representative page .
Also start top in another shell to watch total memory in the Rails process .
Now , do a simulated annealing - like search through the available environment settings .
example
Here is one of our test runs with Ruby ’s default GC settings ( we use a custom logger at Twitter , but you should be able to arrive at similar output ) :
tcpu:0.154 alloc:63926 delta:-66290 gccpu:0.078 tcpu:0.067 alloc:63640 delta:63645 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.146 alloc:63788 delta:-68896 gccpu:0.078 tcpu:0.060 alloc:63779 delta : 63784 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.138 alloc:63787 delta:-75152 gccpu:0.072 tcpu:0.059 alloc:63779 delta : 63784 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.138 alloc:63787 delta:-77591 gccpu:0.072 tcpu:0.062 alloc:63779 delta : 63784 gccpu:0.000
With the conservative Ruby defaults , the GC runs every other request , and takes 0.075 seconds , giving us a per-request GC cost of 0.038 seconds — 40 % of the entire request time .
This is excessive .
But if you explore a bit , you will quickly arrive at something like RUBY_HEAP_MIN_SLOTS=500000 RUBY_HEAP_SLOTS_INCREMENT=250000 RUBY_HEAP_SLOTS_GROWTH_FACTOR=1
RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT=50000000 , which is what we use at Twitter .
These particular settings mean :
Start with enough memory to hold Rails ( Ruby ’s default is practically nothing )
Increase it linearly if you need more ( Ruby ’s default is exponential increase )
Only garbage - collect every 50 million malloc calls ( Ruby ’s default is 6 x smaller )
Here are the GC timings for the same ab run with these settings applied :
tcpu:0.181 alloc:63829 delta:-763708 gccpu:0.118 tcpu:0.067 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.062 alloc:63777 delta : 63782 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.060 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.060 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.060 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.058 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.060 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.063 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.058 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.063 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.059 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.060 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.185 alloc:63828 delta:-761854 gccpu:0.119 tcpu:0.069 alloc:63777 delta : 63782 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.065 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.058 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.062 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.060 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.061 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.062 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.062 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.059 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.060 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.060 alloc:63776 delta : 63781 gccpu:0.000 tcpu:0.062 alloc:63775 delta : 63780 gccpu:0.000
Woah !
Now the GC runs only every 13 requests , at a slightly higher cost , for a per-request cost of 0.009 seconds .
This translates to a general speedup of 34 % .
The frequency of GC calls corresponds quite directly to the change in RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT , but if we increase it much more the memory usage balloons .

Unfortunately , there ’s not much clear information on the Ruby garbage collector .
But here are a few resources :
We are now experimenting with Brent ’s MBARI branch of Ruby 1.8.6 , kindly sponsored by EngineYard .
So far it looks excellent , expecially in combination with Stefan ’s patches .
I will publish some results soon .
Finally , somebody stole my identity .
That somebody , or who I , not by choice mind you , now call the New Me , finally took the bait and stole my identity .
Ever since I invested all of my hope in Y2 K ( that ’s “ Year 2000 ” – for my fellow Acronym Challenged brethren out there ) wiping the financial slates clean from microchip memory , only to be thoroughly disappointed when the anticipated crash did not happen , I ’ve been praying somebody would steal my identity and the financial baggage that comes with it .
During the waning days leading up to the turn of the century , when I was n’t thinking about what life must have been like in debtors ’ prisons , I channeled all of my remaining energy into Operation Ground Zero – my little pet name for the impending Y2 K crash .
Often times these thought strands would merge , and I imagined the resurrection of debtors ’ prisons in the post - Y2 K era .
Ironically , I envisioned debtors ’ prisons in an optimistic light – a trait I picked up through my mother ’s umbilical cord while floating aimlessly in the womb , without any financial worries whatsoever .
Ah yes , the salad days .
Debtors ’ prison :
Where else are you guaranteed a roof over your head and three square meals a day ?
Moreover , debtors will get the opportunity to spend more time with their families , since they ’ll be imprisoned alongside their loved ones instead of alone in an office cubicle , not to mention , debtors ’ prisons will have the best education system , since most teachers are in debt up until they retire .
To help tempt and encourage identity thieves , I ’ve been leaving my financial baggage all over the Internet , unattended , despite all the warnings circulating in the virtual airwaves via telecom :
Warning :
Do not leave your financial baggage unattended , for bags may be stolen or injected with a virus that will virtually destroy your life .
Please report any unattended bags to the Internet police or any behaviors that may be considered suspicious , including but not limited to persons fitting computer hacker profiles that demonstrate antisocial behaviors in public places , shoeless children offering to carry your bags in exchange for money and / or sexual favors , or mechanical dogs sniffing through your matching , leopard - skin luggage set .
Despite making wholesale security cuts and leaving behind a mixed - trail of computer cookies a hack hacker could easily digest , nobody had been tempted by my identity .
They must have read the writing on the firewalls :
Keep Out !
This Poor Cat Ain’t Carryin’ No Cash or Credit
Even so , I thought somebody would at least nibble on my identity before moving on to other , more reputable and potentially profitable marks , say AIG shareholders .
Although I had never bought into the Fear Industry ’s mega - marketing machine , I thought my revealing identity would lure somebody into its financial abyss .
Exacerbated by 9 - 11 attacks and the “ War on Terror , ” the “ War on Identity Theft , ” has stepped up its measures as well , pumping paranoia into the market through fear generators – known as televisions and radios in less paranoid communities .
Not a day goes by that I do n’t hear some advertisement warning me about identity theft :
Voice Over : Did you know that paying with unprotected plastic is like having sex without a rubber ?
Whether it ’s somebody stealing your identity or giving you an incurable STD , you ’re putting your life on the line .
Why risk subject yourself to a long , painful death , when you can protect yourself and enjoy the temporary gratification without having to worry about what or who ’s on the other end ?
No more worries ; now you can buy the best protection in the industry …
The Identity Protection Industry Racket has become the new Mafia in America , offering consumers protection from identity thieves in exchange for nominal fees .
For me the key to fighting identity theft is making sure I do n’t have anything worth stealing ( at least that ’s what I keep telling myself ) , including my dignity .
Subconsciously , at least that ’s what I tell Therapist Bob , I ’ve taken this philosophy to an extreme by digging a financial hole to China , who by the way , already owns my debt by way of the United States .
Hmmmm …maybe we should tempt another country to steal our country ’s identity to help erase our debt and lift us out of the current recession .
Got toxic assets ?
So I began leaving my identity laying around on the Internet , thinking somebody would quickly snatch it up , but no such luck .
I even resorted to using reverse psychology : “ Yoo hoo .
Over here .
Whatever you do , keep your hands off my sweet , little identity , big boy . ”
But to no avail .
However , some sucker , the New Me , finally took the bait and hooked my identity last month , only to discover he had been hobbled by a rapidly falling credit score .
The New Me is not banking too well .
Worse , the New Me had the nerve to file a lawsuit against the Old Me , claiming I had entrapped him into a financial quagmire .
But I ’ve vowed to fight the New Me , to the death if need be , and it ’s no longer about the money , rather it ’s about protecting my dignity – at least what ’s left of it after amortization .
The animal world contains so many amazing facts , misconceptions , and mysteries that we could write a list based on it every day .
So it is probably a little surprising that we only have one list of animal facts on the site .
So today we are doing something about it and presenting this , our second , list of amazing animals facts .
Be sure to share your own favorites in the comments .
Oh – and for those who are interested , here is the original list of 10 .
10 Cyanide Bugs
Amazing Fact : Some millipedes ( Apheloria Virginiensis ) are able to secrete cyanide
Laboratory study of these millipedes ( which are slow moving and feed on plants ) are able to release clouds of hydrogen cyanide gas through small vents in their body .
This is most likely to occur when being handled , or attacked by other creatures such as ants .
It is essential that one wash ones hands after touching one of these millipedes .
This large creature is found in North America and is also known as the Kentucky Flat Millipede .
9 Unlikely Mates
Amazing Fact : Red Ants and Large Blue Butterflies work together
Large Blue caterpillars feed on wild Thyme or Marjoram flowers for the first few days of development .
Afterwards , they seek out the nests of a specific species of red ant , and hibernate inside their tunnels .
The caterpillar will spend a further 3 weeks transforming into the Large Blue butterfly adult .
After its change from caterpillar to butterfly , the insect emerges from its chrysalis and leaves the red ant nest to find a mate .
Usually , red ants will escort the newly emerged butterfly to the surface , taking it to a low plant or shrub nearby .
The red ants will encircle the butterfly and ward off any predators that attempt to attack the butterfly as it dries out .
After the butterfly is ready to fly away , the ants will retreat back into their nest .
To make itself less of an intruder to the red ants , Large Blue caterpillars will adopt the red ant ’s scent and mimic the ant ’s sounds , in addition to providing the ants with honeydew .
Once the caterpillar is inside its chrysalis , it will rub its head against the chrysalis walls to make a scraping sound that the red ants make .
Failure to complete any of these disguises will often lead to the caterpillar being eaten by the red ants .
8 Ferret Sex
Amazing Fact :
If a female ferret goes into heat but ca n’t get any sex , she will die
This is a female specific problem ; female ferrets can go into extended heat – during which time they must breed or they can die of aplastic anemia – a condition in which the bone marrow stops producing enough new blood cells ( caused by estrogen toxicity . )
This is because female ferrets are induced ovulators , so mating is required to bring the female out of heat .
Intact females , if not mated , will remain in heat , and after some time the high levels of estrogen will cause the bone marrow to stop producing red blood cells .
7 Dolphin Sex
Amazing Fact : Dolphins , like humans , have sex for pleasure
Dolphin copulation happens belly to belly and though many species engage in lengthy foreplay , the actual act is usually only brief , but may be repeated several times within a short time - span .
Dolphins are known to have sex for reasons other than reproduction , sometimes also engaging in acts of a homosexual nature .
Various dolphin species have been known to engage in sexual behavior with other dolphin species , this also having resulted in various hybrid dolphin species as mentioned earlier .
Sexual encounters may be violent , with male dolphins sometimes showing aggressive behavior towards both females and other male dolphins .
Occasionally , dolphins will also show sexual behavior towards other animals , including humans .
6 Hummingbird Feet
Amazing Fact : Hummingbirds do n’t walk
There is a popular misconception that hummingbirds do n’t have feet .
It is , of course , wrong .
But while they do have feet , they do n’t use them to walk because they are so poorly developed ; this is due to the fact that they spend most of their time in flight and seldom need to walk .
Hummingbirds also have an incredibly fast metabolism which means they are always just a few hours away from starvation .
5 Pistol Shrimp
Amazing Fact :
The pistol shrimp makes such a loud noise with its claws , that it can kill other fish
The snap of the pistol shrimp ’s claw is so loud that it competes with animals such as the sperm whale for the title of loudest creature of the sea .
When it snaps its claws together , it creates a vapor bubble with pressure sufficient to kill nearby small fish ; these are then eaten .
Incredibly , when the bubble bursts it produces temperatures of up to 5,000 K , close to the temperature of the surface of the sun .
This is not visible to the naked eye because of its low intensity .
4 Nature ’s Chastity Belt
Amazing Fact :
The males of some species ( including bees , baboons , rats , squirrels , scorpions , mice , and spiders ) create a “ mating plug ” after sex which prevents other males from having sex with the same female
The mating plug is a gelatinous compound which is inserted in the female ’s vagina after copulation .
When it hardens , it prevents other males from having sex with the female .
This is useful in the case of bee - hives where there may be thousands of males wanting to have sex with the queen .
When a drone in the beehive has had sex with the queen , his entire genitalia detaches to form the plug – which also means that he dies shortly after .
Future drones who wish to mate with the queen must forcibly remove the plug .
3 Frog Hearing
Amazing Fact :
Some frogs hear with their lungs
Panamanian golden frogs do n’t have outside ears – their lungs pick up sound waves and direct them to their eardrums .
Interestingly , many fish hear in this same manner which supports the link between frogs and their evolutionary ancestors .
Due to internal air - pressure controlled by the frog , it is able to largely ignore its own voice which is incredibly loud .
2 Octopus Eating
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaOWJxEr3U0&hl=en&fs=1
Amazing Fact : Octopuses ( or octopi if you prefer ) eat with their hands like humans .
With the suckers on its arms , an octopus seizes prey and pulls it up to its mouth , where a poisonous salivary secretion is immediately released from the beak .
The secretion paralyzes the prey and partially digests it .
Fortunately for the octopus , if it loses an arm , another one grows to replace it .
Another interesting fact about octopuses is that one of the legs of the male is used for copulation and it is broken from the body in the act of sex .
1 Pig ’s Orgasm
Amazing Fact : A pig ’s orgasm lasts 30 minutes
Before you start pining to be a pig , remember , after the orgasm the pig eventually ends up on our dinner table !
But that aside , it is true that a pig can have an orgasm that lasts up to 30 minutes – at least I have not been able to find any evidence to the contrary after extensive research .

A handy open source utility by Adrian Kosmaczewski allows you to convert Interface Builder files to Objective - C code .
With it , you can extract all the layout information and properties of your visual design and transform that into code .
Nib2 objc does exactly what its name suggests .
With it , you can generate converted code that takes into account the class constructors , method calls , and more .
The utility is kind of like Code the Code 's class - dump but for XIBs and NIBs instead of compiled code .
It produces results that are obviously computer generated and yet usable at the same time .
Here 's a sample of the kind of code it generates :
UILabel * view15 = [ [ UILabel alloc ] initWithFrame : CGRectMake( 20.0 , 6.0 , 272.0 , 21.0 ) ] ; view15 .
frame = CGRectMake ( 20.0 , 6.0 , 272.0 , 21.0 ) ; view15.adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth = YES ; view15.alpha = 1.000 ; view15.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleRightMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleBottomMargin ; view15.baselineAdjustment = UIBaselineAdjustmentAlignCenters ; view15.clearsContextBeforeDrawing = YES ; view15.clipsToBounds = YES ; view15.contentMode = UIViewContentModeScaleToFill ; view15.enabled = YES ; view15.font = [ UIFont fontWithName : @" Helvetica " size : 17.000 ] ; view15.hidden = YES ; view15.lineBreakMode = UILineBreakModeTailTruncation ; view15.minimumFontSize = 10.000 ; view15.multipleTouchEnabled = NO ; view15.numberOfLines = 1 ; view15.opaque = NO ; view15.shadowOffset = CGSizeMake ( 0.0 , - 1.0 ) ; view15.tag = 401 ; view15.text = @" Progress : " ; view15.textAlignment = UITextAlignmentCenter ; view15.textColor = [ UIColor colorWithRed:0.000 green:0.000 blue:0.000 alpha:1.000 ] ; view15.userInteractionEnabled = NO ;
As you can see , the emphasis is on creating correct and exhaustive detail .
If you want the results to look pretty , you 'll have to edit it by hand .
The nib2objc utility exposes nearly all the information stored by and editable in Interface Builder .
The sample above is the output for a simple UILabel instance .
Nib2objc has a few real limitations .
According to the README at the git hub repository , it cannot produce values for UIImage , NSLocale or NSTimeZone instances .
That 's because the results are generated by the ibtool utility ( /usr / bin / ibtool ) , which does not support them .
It also cannot produce default property values .
These limitations aside , it 's a great tool for people who want to leverage IB 's visual layout but want to expose object details inside their Xcode projects .
Nib2objc is hosted at github and issued under a general " Use this for good not evil " style of license .
DEVO have just announced will play their genius 1978 album ‘ Q : Are We Not Men ? A : We Are Devo ? ’ in full at the London Kentish Town Forum on May 6 .
The band who took their name from their concept of “ de- evolution ” — an idea that instead of evolving , mankind has actually regressed , as evidenced by the dysfunction and herd mentality of American society – are still as weird and wonderful as ever .
The Kentish Town show will precede the band ’s scheduled appearance at All Tomorrow ’s Parties : The Fans Strike Back event at Minehead on May 8 , where they will play a set featuring their most popular songs .
When they first appeared on the scene , there was an almost unbearable tension in the speed of their jerky , jumpy rhythms , outstripping Talking Heads , XTC , and other similarly nervy new wavers – or so our Dad ’s tell us .
This will be a real treat for the nostalgic reveller and young indie Kid alike .

President Obama has vowed to close the controversial prison
A former Afghan inmate at the US prison in Guantanamo Bay has joined the Taleban 's high command in Pakistan , UK government officials say .
They say Mullah Abdul Kayum Zakir , who was released last year , is now closely involved in planning attacks on British and other Nato forces in Afghanistan .
They say he is operating with impunity from the Pakistani city of Quetta .
The Pentagon says more than 10 % of 520 inmates released so far have returned to what it calls terrorism .
It says this complicates efforts to release and repatriate those still being held .
US President Barack Obama has long vowed to close the controversial Guantanamo Bay detention centre .
Lord Carlisle 's warning
British government officials say Mullah Abdul Kayum Zakir was handed over by the Americans in the spring of 2008 to the Afghan authorities , who briefly imprisoned him in Kabul .
But from there he was released and promptly made his way over the Pakistani border to rejoin the Taleban and its leadership .
Since then , says a US counter - terrorism official , he has had a hand in doing some very bad things .
Meanwhile , Lord Carlisle , the British government 's independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws , warned on Monday against imposing control orders on former Guantanamo inmates if they came to Britain .
He said it was over - simplistic to assume that control orders would be appropriate or even lawful against people simply because they had been detained elsewhere .
I do n’t know what ’s going on in these pictures , but it looks like Korea is somewhere I ’d love to party , not because I like naked men on crosses , but because I like naked men…. especially when that naked man is me and the cross I am mounting is n’t actually a cross for some political or cultural protest , but a prostitute I am about to crucify for a couple US Dollars … Asia is the future .

An experimental study of pinon pines at Biosphere 2 in Arizona shows that an increase in temperature makes the species more susceptible to die - off during drought .
When temperatures were increased by 4 degrees Celsius ( 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit ) , the piñon pines died 28 percent faster than trees which experienced drought - conditions at current temperatures , according to a new study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
The researchers transplanted mature piñon trees pinus edulis ( also known as the Colorado Pinyon ) to the Biosphere facility .
As the researchers simulated drought - conditions on the trees , one set of trees experienced average temperatures while the other set received temperatures 4.3 degrees Celsius higher .
“ All drought trees in the warmer treatment died before any of the drought trees in the ambient treatment , ” the researchers write .
“ Our results imply that future warmer temperatures will not only increase background rates of tree mortality , but also result in more frequent widespread vegetation die - off events . ”
Relating their findings to historic occurrences of drought across the Southwestern United States , the scientists predict tree die - offs in the region will occur five times more frequently than in the past .
However the authors write , “ this projection is conservative because it is based on the historical drought record and therefore does not include changes in drought frequency , which is predicted to increase concurrently with warming . ”
With the likelihood of more droughts and continued stress from pests , like the bark beetle , the outlook for trees in America ’s southwest , and possibly elsewhere , is troubling at best .
More tree die - offs is likely to increase the region ’s carbon output as well .
When trees die they release their stored carbon back into the atmosphere , at the same time massive declines in trees means less carbon storage .
According to the authors , tree die - offs could also lead to losses in wildlife habitat , changes in the water cycle , increased opportunities for alien species , and a loss of ecosystem services .
The scientists suggest that similar research should be done on other tree species .
In addition , they write , “ the temperature sensitivity we document highlights the need to improve model predictions and could profoundly alter assessments of climate change impacts , which continue to reveal increasingly dangerous risks . ”

Plant communities changing across the globe , says scientist Sasha Wright
( 03/29/2009 )
Having studied plant communities across three continent and within widely varied ecosystems — lowland tropics , deciduous forests , grasslands , and enclosed ecosystems on hill - tops — graduate student Sasha Wright has gained a unique understanding of shifts in plant communities worldwide as they respond to pressures from land use and global climate change .
“ Plant communities are certainly changing , ” Wright told Mongabay.com in a March 2009 interview .
“ These changes are undoubtedly affected by an increased occurrence of extreme weather events , temperature fluctuations , atmospheric CO2 concentrations , human land use , and in some cases urbanization of populations . ”

Mon 16 February 2009 | tags : facebook privacy tos
Update : Facebook has since reverted the change in terms of service .
Cool .
On Feb 18th , a message on the home page said :
Terms of Use Update
A couple of weeks ago , we posted an update to our Terms of Use that we hoped would clarify some parts of it for our users .
Over the past couple of days , we have received a lot of questions and comments about these updated terms and what they mean for people and their information .
Because of the feedback we received , we have decided to return to our previous Terms of Use while we resolve the issues that people have raised .
For more information , visit the Facebook Blog .
Mark Zuckerberg also blogged about the same issue in Update on Terms .
Original post begins here .
Facebook published a new Terms of Service on February 4th 2009 which has a strong implication for how internet / cloud based data privacy is likely to be viewed .
This was very well publicised here - Facebook 's New Terms Of Service : " We Can Do Anything We Want With Your Content .
Forever . " .
There was some consternation on the net especially on twitter about this change in facebook rules .
While I did not use facebook much , I was sufficiently appalled at the change in rules to go and delete pretty much most of my data one line at a time .
It is unclear to me if the old data is still available to facebook for sublicensing from a legal perspective ( I know all the data will be there in their archives ) , but I decided it probably would n't hurt to nevertheless to go delete most of it .
I did n't actually delete the account since Facebook still helps me keep in touch with my friends .
But it is quite safe to assume that any interactions with them with an assumption or requirement of any data privacy will no longer be done on facebook .
Whats wrong with the new terms of service ?
Some people in forums argued that most of the data on internet is likely to be there forever .
So one just needs to be careful and not worry about it .
I do n't quite agree with that line of thinking .
When I blog , tweet , post to usenet or forums , I am upfront aware of the fact that that data is going to be cached by google and other search engines and that once I press the publish button , there 's often no way to revoke it .
However in case of Facebook , there is a general expectation that the data will be shared only within a network of friends , a network that I have control over .
There is an expectation that that data will not get cached by search engines and short of an accidental data breach or some intentional malafide activities that data will not become public .
What is unnerving with the new terms of service is that Facebook changed these rules at will without even sending me an email about the same .
Asymmetry of Privacy Expectations :
It is interesting to note how asymmetric some of the terms are .
For example in the section User Content , the following is to be found .
By using or accessing the Facebook Service , you represent , warrant and agree that you will not Post :
* User Content that violates the law or anyone 's rights , including intellectual property ( " IP " ) rights or other proprietary rights ( such as rights of publicity and privacy ) ; * any Contact Information or private information of any third party ;
Further down in the section Licensing , it states ,
You hereby grant Facebook an irrevocable , perpetual , non-exclusive , transferable , fully paid , worldwide license ( with the right to sublicense ) to ( a ) use , copy , publish , stream , store , retain , publicly perform or display , transmit , scan , reformat , modify , edit , frame , translate , excerpt , adapt , create derivative works and distribute ( through multiple tiers ) , any User Content you ( i ) Post on or in connection with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof subject only to your privacy settings or ( ii ) enable a user to Post , including by offering a Share Link on your website and ( b ) to use your name , likeness and image for any purpose , including commercial or advertising , each of ( a ) and ( b ) on or in connection with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof .
As you can see , you undertake to not violate anyone else 's IP or other proprietary rights , but information about you will not be treated with the same level of respect by Facebook , though its done quite legally by documenting the same in the Terms of Service .
Moreover anything you post or any information on your stream is now sub-licensable by Facebook .
Now why would I exactly want to sign away all rights on status updates , photographs etc. on content which I posted assuming that it was secure and private ?
But the earlier terms were also quite onerous .
So how come you did not complain ?
Apparently under the earlier terms , facebook also had the rights on the content , so whats the big deal ?
Two main issues .
The earlier TOS did not grant Facebook the right to sublicense the content :
The possibility of sublicensing means you have no control or idea on who the eventual user of that data could be .
I still get angry at so many commercial parties at having leaked my email and phone number data .
The likelihood of a similar scenario where facebook sells that data for commercial purposes now cannot be ruled out , purposes on which I will have no control on that data .
The earlier TOS had an escape clause of deleting the account Basically Facebook did not have the right on the data once you deleted the account .
This is important as can be seen by another case on Twitter Privacy Disaster At Twitter : Direct Messages Exposed ( UpDate : GroupTweet Is Likely Culprit ) .
In this case private messages were apparently accidentally made public due to confusing software usability .
The person immediately responded by deleting the account .
This is a useful kill switch to have in case one makes a terrible terrible mistake of putting out something accidentally .
This kill switch is also no longer available .
Bait and Switch :
By not informing users of the change in terms of service especially since these were so important , I think this creates an impression that the user is a victim of bait and switch ( even though the real underlying causes of the change which I am unaware of could be different ) .
Facebook should 've informed the users about the change in rules , offered a button to delete all prior data / photographs / content or at least made clear that the earlier content will continue to be governed by the earlier TOS - something thats a little unclear in this situation .
Implications for Internet Web sites and users :
I think sites should very clearly document how they will control and use the data that they gather .
Many of them do by explicitly document the same .
Moreover any substantial changes to the same should be communicated to the users .
Finally users need to be now aware of potentially changes of Terms of Services on a number of web sites that they interact with .
Data that they assume to be private may no longer stay so and the user may not be any wiser about the same if the Terms of Services are changed without him being explicitly informed .
Updates :
Why did I delete the data ?
Seems some readers are thinking I deleted the data believing that that will get rid of it .
Thats not why I deleted the data .
I am fully aware the data is likely to live perpetually in facebook archives and be accessible to facebook .
I deleted it because that data had been submitted and generated under the old Terms of Service .
Letting it be around to me seemed like an implicit acceptance of the new Terms of Service around old data , which I was uncomfortable with .
So I deleted the data at the first available opportunity on realising that the Terms of Service around that data had changed .
Any new interactions I do with facebook will be under an awareness of and therefore an acceptance of new Terms of Service .
Response from Facebook : Mark zuckerberg attempts to address the issue on facebook blog : On Facebook , People Own and Control Their Information .
I could not find any rationale to why Facebook needs the privilege to sublicense the content .
I also thought the way the blog post was written and the way the Terms of Service are structured are very very different .
In my opinion its the Terms of Service that count .
This topic has been also getting a lot of traction on other blogs .
Am quoting some other interesting opinions on the topic on the internet along with link backs to the posts below
Google has had its own problems with user privacy , but this Facebook move calls into question the wisdom of clouds or , rather , storing one 's data in others '
Web services like Facebook .
We need to come up with new licenses or new mandates for open data in the cloud .
Facebook should n't own our data .
The possible implications of this TOS change go beyond these concerns .
Sure , you can choose not to use Facebook at all , but that does n’t mean a thing .
Someone can still take your photo , slap it on Facebook , and now neither you nor the author of the photo can stop Facebook from using the photo in whichever way they please .
Looking at it globally , millions of people are uploading bits of information on everyone and everything , to a huge online database , and by doing so they ’re automatically giving away the rights to use or modify this information to a private corporation .
And not only that ; they now also waiver the right to ever take it back from it .
Facebook should take a long , deep look into how it treats its users .
Until now , users had options with regards to how the data they generated on Facebook was used .
Now , they have no options whatsoever , rather than quit the service altogether .
It ’s a major difference ; I ’m not going to take it lightly , and neither should you .
( CNN ) -- Pontiac lovers are feeling nostalgic and mournful Monday amid General Motors announcement that it will end production of the car .
Pontiac models , such as the 1969 GTO , helped usher in the era of the muscle cars , enthusiasts say .
Jean Lindsay of western New York fondly recalls the muscle cars in her family 's driveway : Two 1967 GTOs .
" I had two brothers , and they each had one of these cars , " she said .
" The GTO represented the suburban culture of its time , heavily laden with root beer and plain beer . "
" Those were the days of Bob 's Big Boy [ hamburger restaurant ] , when girls wore skates .
Back then we pleasantly wasted gas looking for fun .
It was a social thing . "
Debuting in 1964 , the Pontiac GTO is widely regarded as the original muscle car .
It was a risky model in that it featured a big - block engine in an intermediate - size frame .
The GTO 's success not only buoyed GM but helped jumpstart the high - performance market for Detroit 's Big Three automakers -- and ushered in the era of the vehicle as status symbol .
Watch GM 's CEO explain why the company is cutting Pontiac »
" It was a chick magnet , for God 's sake .
Even from a girl 's standpoint , " Lindsay said .
Pontiac 's other emblematic performance car , the Firebird Trans Am , featured the outline of a firebird on the hood -- the whole hood .
It enjoyed a rise in popularity and brisk sales after being featured in the " Smokey and the Bandit " movie franchise beginning in the late 1970s .
But like even the most sturdy odometer , the numbers , years ago , had begun to work against Detroit .
After years of watching their market share erode to foreign automakers , GM , Ford and Chrysler were beset by a perfect storm of declining sales , slow innovation and a dogged recession .
While all three shed jobs , GM and Chrysler took bailouts to survive ;
Ford chose to rely on its cash reserves to ride out the storm .
In February , GM announced the end of the Saturn and Hummer lines while casting a ray of hope for Pontiac enthusiasts by saying that the brand would survive but be scaled back to a niche product .
GM could file bankruptcy as a June 1 deadline looms .
In the midst of pressure from the Obama administration to present a restructuring plan that shows the company 's long - term viability , the automaker recently released a statement to downplay fears that brands Americans have patronized for generations are on the chopping block .
" General Motors has not announced any changes to its long - term viability plan or to the future status of any of its brands , " the automaker said Friday in a statement on its Web site .
Pontiac fans said on Friday that contemplating the closure of Pontiac feels like a longtime friend pulling out of the driveway for the last time .
" I think it 's crazy [ to end the brand ] , " Max Thompson of Huntsville , Alabama , said .
" I think they ought to streamline versions of Pontiac .
Just take it to a few models .
Make it special , but not get rid of it because it's too iconic . " ireport.com : See Thompson describe his wheels
Thompson , 46 , said his 1973 Firebird Formula had him sold when he saw the stylistic front end .
" The hood of it looked cool , " Thompson said .
" Just the front of it , it was a sexy - looking vehicle .
It had a very sleek look for the time . "
Thompson said he does n't drive his Firebird anymore , preserving it as a memento with 65,000 miles on it .
The Pontiac brand did n't just appeal to baby boomers .
The younger generation seems to have bonded with the brand during their time behind the wheel , too .
Brian Hemgesberg of Flint , Michigan , said one of the reasons why he purchased his 2008 Pontiac G6 last year was because of what 's under the hood .
" I like the engine , I only got the V6 . ... I want to get the G8 , " Hemgesberg said .
When asked if he pushed the engine , Hemgesberg , 22 , let out a telling laugh .
" Yeah , " he said .
Like other Pontiac owners , Hemgesberg does n't want to see the brand die .
" I think it'd be a pretty big mistake .
I wo n't stop buying GM , I 'd just buy Chevy .
I think [ Pontiac ] is just a very good brand of car . "

New method to assemble nanoscale elements could transform data storage industry
An innovative and easily implemented technique in which nanoscale elements precisely assemble themselves over large surfaces could soon open doors to dramatic improvements in the data storage capacity of electronic media , according to scientists at the University of California , Berkeley , and the University of Massachusetts Amherst ( UMass Amherst ) .
( Dong Hyun Lee / UMass Amherst )
" I expect that the new method we developed will transform the microelectronic and storage industries , and open up vistas for entirely new applications , " said co-lead investigator Thomas Russell , director of the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center at UMass Amherst , visiting Miller Professor at UC Berkeley 's Department of Chemistry , and one of the world 's leading experts on the behavior of polymers .
" This work could possibly be translated into the production of more energy - efficient photovoltaic cells , for instance . "
Russell conceived of this new approach with co-lead investigator Ting Xu , a UC Berkeley assistant professor with joint appointments in the Department of Material Sciences and Engineering and the Department of Chemistry .
They describe their work in the Feb. 20 issue of the journal Science .
" The density achievable with the technology we 've developed could potentially enable the contents of 250 DVDs to fit onto a surface the size of a quarter , " said Xu , who is also a faculty scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
Xu explained that the molecules in the thin film of block copolymers - two or more chemically dissimilar polymer chains linked together - will self - assemble into an extremely precise , equidistant pattern when spread out on a surface , much like a regiment of disciplined soldiers lining up in formation .
For more than a decade , researchers have been trying to exploit this characteristic for use in semiconductor manufacturing , but they have been constrained because the order starts to break down as the size of the area increases .
Once the formation breaks down , the individual domains cannot be read or written to , rendering them useless as a form of data storage .
( Soojin Park / UMass Amherst )
To overcome this size constraint , Russell and Xu conceived of the elegantly simple solution of layering the film of block copolymers onto the surface of a commercially available sapphire crystal .
When the crystal is cut at an angle - a common procedure known as a miscut - and heated to 1,300 to 1,500 degrees Centigrade ( 2,372 to 2,732 degrees Fahrenheit ) for 24 hours , its surface reorganizes into a highly ordered pattern of sawtooth ridges that can then be used to guide the self - assembly of the block polymers .
With this technique , the researchers were able to achieve defect - free arrays of nanoscopic elements with feature sizes as small as 3 nanometers , translating into densities of 10 terabits per square inch .
One terabit is equal to 1 trillion bits , or 125 gigabytes .
Because crystals come in a variety of sizes , there are few limitations to how large this block copolymer array can be produced , the researchers said .
They also noted that the angle and depth of the sawtooth ridges can be easily varied by changing the temperature at which the crystal is heated to fine - tune the desired pattern .
" We can generate nearly perfect arrays over macroscopic surfaces where the density is over 15 times higher than anything achieved before , " said Russell .
" With that order of density , one could get a high - definition picture on a screen the size of a JumboTron . "
" It 's one thing to get dozens of soldiers to stand in perfect formation in an area the size of a classroom , each person equidistant from the other , but quite another to get tens of trillions of individuals to do so on the field in a football stadium , " Xu added .
" Using this crystal surface as a guide is like giving the soldiers a marker so they know where to stand . "
Other research teams across the country are engaged in similar efforts to break the size barrier of self - assembled block copolymers , but this new project by the UMass Amherst - UC Berkeley scientists differs in that it does not rely upon advances in lithography to achieve its goals .
In the semiconductor industry , optical lithography is a process in which light passes through a mask with a desired circuit pattern onto a photosensitive material , or photoresist , that undergoes a chemical change .
Several steps of chemical treatment are then used to develop the desired pattern for subsequent use .
To keep up with Moore 's Law and the demand for increasingly smaller features for semiconductors and microprocessors , industry has turned to nanolithography and the use of ever - shorter wavelengths of light at greater cost .
" The challenge with photolithography is that it is rapidly approaching the resolution limits of light , " said Xu .
" In our approach , we shifted away from this ' top down ' method of producing smaller features and instead utilized advantages of a ' bottom up ' approach .
The beauty of the method we developed is that it takes from processes already in use in industry , so it will be very easy to incorporate into the production line with little cost . "
An added benefit , said Xu , is that " our technique is more environmentally friendly than photolithography , which requires the use of harsh chemicals and acids . "
UC Berkeley and UMass Amherst have filed a joint patent on this technology .
The U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation helped support this research .
Fun with Bank Graphs
I enjoyed this graph in the financial times .
It ’s market capitalization of the world ’s 20 largest banks .
Here ’s the best part .
At the bottom of the graph is a a slider , so you can see how the listing changes over a 10 year period .
Fun games you can play :
Look at Citigroup ’s capitalization over time .
Notice anything peculiar about the most recent year ?
Look at HSBC ( the company I am suing ) .
It seems to have ups and downs .
Look at the biggest banks in 1999 .
See how it compares with the biggest banks in 2009 .
Can you draw any conclusions about the world economy from it ?
Look at Fannie Mae ( did you even know it was a bank ? )
Track its rise and fall .
Look at how the color bars grow and decline over time ( the color bars represent the wealth of all humanity ) .
Wow , look at how great a year 2007 was for banks !
Wow , where did Bank of America go ?
Essay question : is the better performance of Asian banks in 2009 a result of 1 ) China ’s modernization or 2 ) China ’s cautious investment
policy or 3 ) incompetence of US banks or d) all of the above .
Update : Darn , it looks like this fun graph is now behind a pay wall .

Unveiling the 8 pound loaf of candy .
It has been a year since my last giant chocolate experiment .
I 've done other , less unreasonable candy making and chocolatiering projects in the interim .
Making simple things has improved basic competency , but the most important lessons are learned attempting things beyond one 's comfortable skills .
This candy bar shall be correspondingly more ambitious and more delicious .
Goals for Candybar2 :
Better ingredients
More variety
Even bigger
Tempered chocolate
The first two will not be difficult .
Candybar1 was made using the cheapest ingredients possible .
It was made as fast as possible , largely put together in two days .
Start earlier , move carefully , plan methodically and quality will naturally follow .
Size should follow suit as well .
More variety means more layers , which will make the loaf rise to triumphant heights .
Of course , simply starting with a wider and longer base is another option .
Tempering is still a bit insane .
More experience , better equipment and boundless confidence should make the difference now .
While it is a lot of work , tempering is entirely worth the effort .
Tempering adds crystalline structure which greatly increases the structural integrity and thermal stability of the chocolate .
Basically , untempered chocolate will melt at room temperature and squish between your fingers .
Tempered chocolate melts at body temperature and crisply snaps under sufficient force .
This year 's layers include :
caramel
cookie
marshmallow
cherries
peanut butter
almonds
nutella
lots of chocolate
Layer Zero .
The base was made using a bread pan for the mold .
I decided to do something a little strange to this layer .
The base takes a lot of abuse .
If it is too soft it will collapse under the weight .
If it is too brittle it will snap at the slightest twist .
A large amount of granulated sugar was mixed in to improve the stability .
Four ounces of sugar were blended into the eight ounces of chocolate .
The result was thermally stable and had a forgiving amount of flex .
Its texture was a little strange , most similar to a nonpareille .
Cookie layer .
Much much lazier with the cookie this year .
Simply crumbled up the vanilla wafers and poured chocolate over the bits .
Frankly , last year 's cookie layer was really weird .
This is both less weird and so much less tedious .
Caramel : not structurally sound .
This year the caramel would be pure , and not blended with nuts .
I also opted not to freeze the layer , thinking I could simply freehand pour it .
The pouring went pretty well .
The molten caramel was generally well behaved .
The problem came when it was time to cap it .
While waiting for the caramel to cool , large portions slid down the sides , as if Salvador Dali was making the candy .
Not sure why it was so much softer this year , but whatever .
I piled the caramel back on , capped it with a layer of chocolate , ...
Nuts to caramel ! ... and while the chocolate was still molten I pressed in as many almonds as would fit .
This is when the chocolate 's temper is put to the test .
The loaf is stored at room temperature , so everything is softer and more willing to flow .
The thin walls of chocolate along the sides need to retain the outwards pressure as more layers are piled on .
Last year , I could have not bothered with chocolate side walls , as the entire bar was kept solid in the refrigerator .
Tasty trouble .
This is not how a candy bar should look .
There should not be gaps in the sides like that .
Why did this happen ?
I forgot the most important rule to a fast and easy candybar : Never freehand layers !
Freehanded layers have a tendency to go convex , so you need to either save them for last or alternate them with cast layers .
The Nutella was cast in the freezer , but it is on top of three hand poured layers .
Whoops .
I will do my best to plug up the gaps with extra chocolate , and try very hard not to serve anyone the heel of the loaf .
Should I add a jelly layer next year ?
10 ounces of peanut butter were frozen into this slab .
The gaps from the nutella layer were completely filled .
Fluff needs a pastry tube and fast hands .
Marshmallow fluff has taught me about many things .
Like thermal expansion .
Moral of the story : marshmallow fluff expands with considerable force .
Another half a pound of chocolate was poured over the marshmallow for reinforcement .
This layer also cracked , as the marshmallow further lifted the chocolate .
Another eight ounces were applied when it finished warming up .
Altogether , it looks pretty good from the outside .
If it were white chocolate , a Moby Dick reference might be in order .
This monster of chocolate weighs in at just over eight pounds .
It is 9 " long , 4.5 " wide , and 5.5 " tall .
Half its weight is chocolate .
Each pound of chocolate required about two hours of folding to achieve a good temper .
Preparing for your doctor 's appointment is key to getting the most from the visit .
Getting together the information you need before a medical appointment can make the entire experience go much more smoothly .
It can yield better information , support a good relationship with your doctor , and may , as a result , improve your care outcomes .
Preparing for Your First Visit to a New Doctor
Here is a list of items for you to take with you to your appointment :
Your insurance , Medicare or Medicaid card , and a picture ID such as a driver 's license .
If you are in the U.S. and do n't have insurance , then be sure to get permission to pay in cash when you make your appointment and ask how much it will be .
If they ask for your social security number , know that you may be able to deny them information about it .
A current record of every drug and herbal substance you take , including alcohol .
It might be easiest to throw all your pill and supplement bottles into a bag to take with you — they will have your dosage written on them , so it 's easy to figure out what you take each day .
Alternatively , you can make a list to take with you , including the name of the drug or supplement , the dosage , and how often you take it .
If you drink alcohol , write down how much you drink .
Be sure to note if you smoke or chew tobacco or marijuana .
A list of any allergies you have , even if you do n't know their cause .
A list of all the doctors you have seen within the past two years , including your primary and all specialists .
Include their specialty , location , and contact information .
If you are part of a system that uses electronic records , they may already have some of this information and can access it .
But not all doctors are connected to all records , so it 's better to have that information handy if needed .
Notes about your family 's medical history that may affect your health and care .
A list of two or three questions you have for your doctor .
If you have more questions than two or three , then prioritize them ahead of time so you can be sure to have time for the most important ones .
If you do n't finish them all , you 'll need to make an extra appointment .
If This Is Not Your First Appointment With This Doctor
Here is a list of items for you to take with you to your appointment :
Insurance and identification information described above .
A record of your symptoms or side effects , their frequency , and what triggers them .
You may not know all that information , but to the extent , you can record it will be helpful to both you and your doctor .
If you are in pain , do your best to rate your pain on that scale of one to 10 .
If you are experiencing side effects , record what you think is causing them ( like which drug do you think is the cause ? ) and what makes you think that is true .
Updates to any of the information above since the last time you saw this doctor .
For example , you may have been prescribed a drug by another doctor and this doctor will need to know about it .
Or your family history may have changed — if your mother was diagnosed with cancer or your father developed dementia since your last visit , that is important information for your own medical history .
A list of questions relevant to this new visit to the doctor .
Remember , limit them to two or three , and if you have more , prioritize them .
Visiting a Specialist or Seeking a Second Opinion
Be sure to have your payer 's permission , in writing , for the visit .
Many doctor 's offices wo n't ask for this , but some will .
If you are seeking a second opinion , take copies of the results of any tests that have already been run , including x-ray films , MRIs , or CT scans which may be supplied to you on a CD or DVD .
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - The World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level on Monday to phase 4 over the deadly swine flu virus , indicating the infection can spread between humans to cause community - level outbreaks .
The decision came after experts held hours of emergency talks on whether to raise the alert level from phase 3 due to the outbreak , which has killed up to 149 people in Mexico and spread to the United States , Canada and Europe .
Justice Stevens denied that .
The precedent of Belton had often been applied too broadly , he said .
Vehicle searches should be allowed only in two situations , he wrote : when the person being arrested is close enough to the car to reach in , possibly to grab a weapon or tamper with evidence ; or when the arresting officer reasonably believes that the car contains evidence pertinent to the very crime that prompted the arrest .
In the case decided Tuesday , Rodney J. Gant , an Arizona man , was arrested on an outstanding warrant for driving with a suspended license .
He was handcuffed in the back of a patrol car while his car was searched .
The police found cocaine and a gun , and Mr. Gant was convicted on drug charges and sentenced to three years .
The Arizona Supreme Court ruled that the search of Mr. Gant ’s car had violated the Fourth Amendment ’s ban on unreasonable searches and suppressed the evidence against him .
The United States Supreme Court affirmed that decision on Tuesday .
Justice Stevens , joined by the unusual alliance of Justices Antonin Scalia , David H. Souter , Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg , said the court had agreed to hear the case because the conventional view of the Belton decision had been widely criticized .
“ The chorus that has called for us to revisit Belton , ” Justice Stevens wrote , “ includes courts , scholars and members of this court who have questioned that decision ’s clarity and fidelity to Fourth Amendment principles . ”
Police officers and lower courts , Justice Stevens wrote , had failed to take adequate account of the two rationales that animated Belton : protecting the safety of arresting officers and safeguarding evidence of crimes .
Those rationales only make sense , he said , “ when the arrestee is unsecured and within reaching distance ” of the car .
Above , Hemp for Victory , a 13 - minute film produced by the US government in the 1940s which urged citizens to grow hemp during the war .
During this earlier era of American crisis , farmers and 4 - H clubs were encouraged to cultivate industrial hemp , the non-intoxicating cousin of what I like to call cannabis gettabis stonerus .
And now , during our current American crisis , this same " non-drug " cannabis strain is the subject of a new bill put forth by Congressmen Ron Paul ( R - TX ) and Barney Frank ( D - MA ) .
They and eight cosponsors , both Republican and Democrat , hope to legalize the plant so American farmers can begin supplying fibers for a wide array of products , with the overreaching goal of opening a new sector in American agriculture .
Anyway , back to the propaganda film .

( CNN ) -- State officials said Monday that they suspect a drug reaction or toxins killed 21 horses as they were prepared to compete in a Sunday polo match in Wellington , Florida .
Blue tarps obstruct the view of horses that died at the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Florida .
State officials and local law enforcement also announced Monday that they are launching investigations into the deaths as scientists work to pinpoint what exactly killed the horses .
Officials believe that the " very rapid onset of sickness and death " points to toxins or a drug reaction and also allows them to rule out other possibilities .
" At this time , there is no evidence that these horses were affected with an infectious or contagious disease , as there are no other horses affected at this time , " according to Florida Agriculture and Consumer Services spokesman Terence McElroy .
Officials are continuing to conduct tests , and Florida agriculture scientists are performing necropsies on the animals .
" We 'll be testing blood and tissue to see what the common denominator was here : Was it something injected ?
Was it bad water ?
And so forth , " McElroy said .
John Walsh , the Lechuza Caracas polo club president , said he was told that there was no contagious virus airborne or disease and that the incident was an " isolated " one .
Watch Walsh talk about the devastating deaths »
" This was a mistake of a combination of something , and whether the mistake was at the barn , whether the mistake was at the feed company , whether the mistake was at the vitamin company , " Scott Swerdlin of the Palm Beach Equine Clinic , who treated some of the horses , told CNN affiliate WPTV .
" We do n't know , but we 're going to find out . "
James Belden , a veterinarian at the Left Bank Equine Clinic who also treated some of the horses , told WPTV that he and others do n't suspect foul play .
" I think this is an accident , " he told WPTV .
" A terrible accident . "
McElroy said that despite the early indications , he does not want to jump to conclusions about what happened .
" Obviously , this is a tragic situation , and we are working hard to determine what happened , " he said .
" But it would be irresponsible to speculate on what may have killed the horses .
We will wait until the facts are in before making any specific comments on the case . "
Do n't Miss WPLG : Tainted shots may be cause
Officials in the state Agriculture and Consumer Services Department will investigate the case with the help of the department 's Division of Animal Industry , the department 's Office of Agricultural Law Enforcement and other law enforcement agencies .
The horses were part of the Venezuela - based Lechuza Caracas team and were being kept at the team 's trailers on the grounds of the International Polo Club Palm Beach .
Fifteen horses that seemed disoriented died before Sunday 's match , said McElroy , and their bodies were sent to the state - run Kissimmee Diagnostic Laboratories near Orlando , Florida .
Luis Escobar , a player on the opposing Team Blackwatch , was on the grounds when the horses began to fall ill .
" I thought it was something temporary , and I saw a veterinarian and thought maybe it was one or two horses , and the vet was going to give something to help them out , and it was going to be done , " he said .
" But it was n't . "
Two horses initially collapsed , and as veterinarians and team officials scrambled to revive them , five others became dizzy , Tim O'Connor , spokesman for the polo club , said Sunday .
Watch as vets search for clues »
Escobar said soon things got worse , and other horses started to get sick .
Peter Rizzo , executive director of the United States Polo Association , was at the match and saw the horses drop .
" It was surreal , " he said , calling the deaths " unprecedented . "
" It is a horrible tragedy , " he said .
Some of the 15 horses died immediately , but some lingered for about 45 minutes , Swerdlin said Sunday , according to a report in the Sun-Sentinel newspaper .
The clinic is the International Polo Club 's consulting veterinarian group , the newspaper said .
Six of the 21 horses were kept overnight in the same trailer in Wellington , said McElroy , and died sometime between Sunday and Monday .
Their bodies have not been taken to the Kissimmee lab .
Escobar said he 's never seen anything like the scenario that unfolded Sunday night .
He says the players and trainers do " everything possible " to keep the horses in optimum condition , saying " they are babied every single day , all day long . "
The U.S. Polo Association , the sport 's governing body , is opening their own investigation .
Celeste Kunz , chief examining veterinarian at the New York Racing Association and a 19 - year veterinarian , said Monday that she suspected a tainted substance was injected into the horses .
" [ It was ] something that was administered for it to work in a short amount of time and have an animal succumb that quickly , " Kunz said .
" My thought is that something was injected , because it would have to affect the central nervous system . "
Escobar , from his experience with the animals , agreed .
" When something like this happens , if there was disease or illness or virus , other horses would already be coming out , " he said .
" Anything that would come whether it 's something like this or a small stomachache , we see it , because we are there with them all the time . "
Anabolic steroids are not likely to have caused the deaths , either , Kunz said .
" It takes at least five days for [ anabolic steroids ] to really work , and the effects are n't real obvious at first , " she said .
" Most of the time , [ anabolic steroids ] are used to build up their muscularity . "
Each team brings between 40 to 60 horses for matches .
The ponies are continuously switched out throughout a match to keep them from overexerting themselves , O'Connor said .
The horses were between 10 and 11 years old and were valued at about $ 100,000 each , club spokesman O'Connor said , according to the Sun-Sentinel .
CNN 's Kimberly Segal and John Zarrella contributed to this report .
All About Florida
Barack Obama said he could support a congressional investigation US President Barack Obama has left open the possibility of prosecuting officials who wrote CIA memos allowing harsh interrogation techniques .
It would be up to the attorney general whether to prosecute , Mr Obama said .
The memos detailed a range of methods the CIA could use on terrorism suspects under the Bush administration .
Mr Obama had said he would not use anti-torture laws to prosecute CIA personnel who relied in good faith on legal opinions issued after 9/11 .
The BBC's James Coomarasamy in Washington says the president 's comments marked a change of tone amid growing pressure from the Democratic Party not to rule out potential prosecutions .
" With respect to those who formulated those legal decisions , I would say that that is going to be more of a decision for the attorney general within the parameters of various laws , " Mr Obama said .
He also said he could support a congressional investigation of the issue if it was conducted in a bipartisan way .
' Very complicated '
White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel had previously said in a television interview that the administration did not want to pursue those who " devised policy " .
As a general view , I do think we should be looking forward , not back

Cheney enters ' torture ' memos row Q&A : Waterboarding
The memos revealed that two al - Qaeda suspects were subjected to waterboarding - a technique which simulates drowning - 266 times .
Other methods mentioned in the memos include week - long sleep deprivation , forced nudity and the use of painful positions .
Former Vice - President Dick Cheney has said the techniques produced results .
He has called for the release of additional documents that he said would show what the techniques yielded .
On Thursday , when the memos were released , Mr Obama said CIA personnel working from Bush administration legal opinions would not be prosecuted .
His comments drew criticism from human rights organisations and UN officials , who say charges are necessary to prevent future abuses and in order to hold people accountable .
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday , Mr Obama said the episode involved a " host of very complicated issues " .
An investigation would be acceptable , he said , " outside of the typical hearing process " and with " independent participants who are above reproach " .
He added : " As a general view , I do think we should be looking forward , not back .
" I do worry about this getting so politicised that we cannot function effectively and it hampers our ability to carry out critical national security operations . "

Attributor is a Silicon Valley start - up that creates digital fingerprints of published content online , then crawls the Web to find where all or part of that content is reused ; Creative Commons is a nonprofit corporation that helps copyright owners set less restrictive rules for the reuse of their material online .
Today they announced the public launch of FairShare , which enables creators to apply Creative Commons license terms to their text - based work , then use Attributor 's free service to track how that work is reused and whether the license terms are complied with .
Attributor CEO Jim Pitkow said his company can tell the percentage of a text that 's reused on each page , whether there 's a link back to your site , whether there are advertisements on the page , the number of visitors that site receives , the number of times in the last 30 days your material has been reused on that site , and the average amount of text that 's been cut and pasted .
( To give you a better idea of what this looks like , keep reading after the jump . )
Ever wonder how your blog 's well - turned phrases ripple across the Web ?
Put another way , would you like to know who 's cutting and pasting your best work onto their sites without giving you an ounce of credit ?
Attributor and Creative Commons have joined forces to help you track the dissemination of your posts and other published texts across the Internet , showing you where to find potential partners -- or to send takedown notices .
" It 's the first service which can quantify your input into the sharing economy , " said Mike Linksvayer , vice president of Creative Commons .
His firm 's licenses typically require that anyone who reuses content give credit to the creator , but there are a range of options beyond that -- for example , one option is to forbid reuses for commercial purposes , and another is to require any new works made from the content to be published under the same Creative Commons terms .
Whatever the publishers ' goals are , Linksvayer said , FairShare gives them an easy way to measure how their works are performing .
What content creators do with the FairShare reports is up to them ; there 's no built - in enforcement mechanism for spitting out takedown notices .
Pitkow said the more promising use is in helping creators identify and reach out to the sites that are helping to distribute their works .
For example , it might reveal commercial possibilities that creators did n't anticipate , along with the partners who can help them realize that potential .
Invariably , it will also identify the chuckleheads who are copying your pieces wholesale and pretending it 's their own work .
By the way , it 's available to anyone who publishes content online , with or without Creative Commons licenses .
Blogger Beth Kanter , who specializes in training nonprofit groups on the use of social networks , is a strong believer in the sharing ethic .
She publishes her work under a Creative Commons license that allows people to reuse and modify it freely , as long as they give her credit .
She 's been testing FairShare as a way to see how the open - content projects she works on get embellished and improved online .
" Once it 's out there , it 's great to look at the remix so you can remix it again .
It informs your own work , " she said .
Not surprisingly , Kanter 's no fan of takedown notices .
Noting how her freely shared work has helped her earn a living as a trainer and consultant -- and , soon , as a scholar in residence at the Packard Foundation -- she said , " I 've monetized without having to police . "
Her interest in FairShare is " more as a tool to connect with more people who are using my work " than to crack down on those who do n't comply with her license terms .
Nevertheless , she acknowledges , " What 's been eye - opening for me is how much is out there but is n't being attributed . "
Here are a few screen grabs from the aforementioned FairShare feed for this blog :

MadSci Network : Microbiology Query :
Hi Mike ,
Thanks for submitting your question to the MadSci network .
You are asking two questions here ; ( 1 ) why have pathogenic antibiotic - resistant bacteria evolved in response to the use of antibiotics so rapidly ( i.e. , in under 100 years ) ; and ( 2 ) why have n't pathogenic heat - resistant bacteria evolved in response to cooking .
With respect to question ( 1 ) , you seem to be assuming that bacterial antibotic resistance arose de novo in bacteria as a result of human antibiotic use .
However , it is not true that antibiotics have only been in use for 80 years .
They have actually been used for hundreds of millions of years , by fungi .
Remember that the original antibiotic , penicillin , was isolated from colonies of Penicillium chrysogenum .
Over the hundreds of millions of years that have passed since these antibiotic compounds were first recruited , some bacterial species have been able to develop means of protecting themselves by reducing the effectiveness of the compound , or completely neutralizing the compound 's activity .
For example , many antibiotics interfere with bacterial protein synthesis , either stopping protein synthesis or reducing the fidelity of the process to the point where the organism can't make sufficient functional product .
If the bacteria can't make proteins , then they can't replicate , carry out metabolisms , or repair damage to themselves , and they eventually die .
Many of the mutations that confer resistance to specific antibiotics are single nucleotide rRNA mutations ( e.g. , Streptomycin resistance , a single base mutation in the 16S rRNA , and Chloramphenicol resistance , a single base mutation in the 23S rRNA ) , which protect the bacterial cell from the method of action of the antibiotic ( often at the expense of a sub- optimal rate of translation , which means slower growth ) .
Other modes of antibiotic resistance involve the pumping of the offending compound out of the cell , so that it never reaches its target .
In these cases ( e.g. , tetracycline , erythromycin ) the pumping is carried out by a special enzyme ( an ATP - dependent efflux pump ) , and it costs the bacterial cell energy ( in the form of ATP ) to do the work of pumping out the offending compound .
There are other methods of achieving antibiotic resistance , but I wo n't go into them here , because I think that these two will suffice .
So , now you 're probably asking , " if antibiotics have been around for billions of years , why are n't all bacteria resistant to them ? " .
Well , as you can see with the methods of drug resistance I 've described , resistance comes at a cost to the cell .
If you resist through the use of a mutated rRNA , then you sacrifice efficiency of your ribosomes for drug resistance .
If you are using a protein to pump drugs out of your cytoplasm , then ( in addition to the ATP that it costs to make the pump work ) , you have to make sufficient amounts of the efflux pump to be effective , and you have to replicate the gene that codes for the protein .
These costs are worth the extra trouble when you are in the presence of the antibiotic , but for hundreds of millions of years , the only time a particular bacterial strain came into contact with a particular antibiotic was when it was trying to grow near a particular fungus , and different fungal species developed different antibiotic drugs .
In cases where there are no antibiotic drugs present , a bacterial strain that is maintaining drug resistant genes will be out - competed by strains that have more efficient ribosomes and that are n't spending extra time and energy replicating the genes for efflux proteins and synthesizing copious efflux pumps .
So , much of the time , there was no use for antibiotic resistance , and natural selection favored those bacteria that could replicate efficiently ( i.e. , without maintaining antibiotic resistance genes ) .
The final wrinkle is that different bacterial strains / species can exchange genes in a process known as congugation .
I 'm not going to go into this in detail , because it is already described in our archives ( 984777600 .
Mb ) .
But , this means that bacterial species can pass resistance genes ( e.g. , rRNA or efflux pump genes ) to each other .
Its like bacterial file - sharing . :)
This is why many antibiotic resistance genes are found on small , circular chromosomes known as plasmids , because plasmids can be transmitted more rapidly than the large main chromosome , and they can be lost when there are no antibiotics present without involving the rest of the crucial genes on the main chromosome .
However in today 's environment , where human activity has spread antibiotic ( and other antibacterial ) drugs throughout the environment , there are antibiotic challenges to bacterial survival everywhere .
This has resulted in a strong selection pressure for bacterial strains that maintain multiple resistance genes .
From the bacterial point of view , there are potentially toxic fungi lurking around every corner .
So , what about question ( 2 ) ; why have n't bacteria been able to resist being cooked ?
Well , when we cook our food , we are very rapidly ( over the course of minutes ) raising it to high temperatures ( > 100 degrees C ) that will denature proteins .
Bacterial resistance to anything relies on the resistant cell 's ability to replicate itself , which occurs on the order of a score of minutes .
When a bacterial cell is cooked , all of it 's proteins are denatured at the same time .
There are organisms ( primarily Archaea and Bacteria ) that live quite well at high temperatures , known as thermophiles , but these organisms do n't do so well at low temperatures ( like 37 degrees C ) .
The proteins in a bacterium that you would find on your food and that would grow in you and make you ill will function best at about your body temperature ( which is why we culture so many of these at nice warm 37 degrees C ) .
In order to function at temperatures >100 degrees C , proteins have to be modified at a large number of sites to make them much more stable at these high temperatures , and it seems likely that these proteins would not be functional at 37 degrees C.
For example , Cambillau and Claverie ( below ) compared the genomes of a variety of thermophilic organisms , and found that these organisms all had some protein characteristics in common ; these organisms all have very large differences between the fraction of polar ( noncharged ) and charged residues in their proteins , with very high proportions of charged residues on the surface of proteins , which allows thermostable proteins to be stabilized at high temperatures via ionic bonds .
In addition , there are numerous examples of proteins found in thermophiles that are stable and active at high temperatures ( 70 - 100 degrees C ) , but which function poorly , or not at all , at 37 degrees C. I 've cited three examples below ; Zoldak et al describe NADH oxidase from Thermus thermophilus , which has optimal activity at 70 degrees C , Malhotra et al describe alpha- amylase from Bacillus thermooleovorans NP54 , which has optimal activity at 100 degrees C , and Mandal et al describe a P - type Ag+ / Cu+-ATPase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus that is active at 75 degrees C and inactive at 37 degrees C .
In addition , denatured proteins tend to aggregate , so that the cytoplasm sort of precipitates out of solution , which is something of a disaster .
Bacteria do have mechanisms ( Heat Shock proteins ) that protect themselves from sudden , brief elevations in temperature by refolding denatured proteins , but these mechanisms are not effective for elevations as drastic as those that occur when we cook food .
So , antibiotic drugs target specific metabolic functions in a cell , and resistance to drugs like these can be achieved through single point mutations , or through the expression of a single protein coding gene .
Cooking targets all of the functions of a cell , and causes them all to " crash " simultaneously .
There 's no single point mutation or single gene product that could protect a cell from being cooked .
I guess one could invent a scenario in which cooking developed gradually , with food first being cooked at 42 degrees C for a few hundred thousand years , and then at 52 degrees C for another hundred thousand or so , and then at 62 , 72 , 82 , and 92 degrees C , until after 1.8 million years food was cooked at 102 degrees C , fostering the evolution of a thermophile , but at that point the organism would n't function at 37 degrees C , because that temperature would be too " cold " for its thermostable proteins .

In 2005 , the average American consumed 64kg of added sugar , a sizeable proportion of which came through drinking soft drinks .
Now , in a 10 - week study , Peter Havel and colleagues , at the University of California at Davis , Davis , have provided evidence that human consumption of fructose - sweetened but not glucose - sweetened beverages can adversely affect both sensitivity to the hormone insulin and how the body handles fats , creating medical conditions that increase susceptibility to heart attack and stroke .
In the study , overweight and obese individuals consumed glucose - or fructose - sweetened beverages that provided 25 % of their energy requirements for 10 weeks .
During this period , individuals in both groups put on about the same amount of weight , but only those consuming fructose - sweetened beverages exhibited an increase in intraabdominal fat .
Further , only these individuals became less sensitive to the hormone insulin ( which controls glucose levels in the blood ) and showed signs of dyslipidemia ( increased levels of fat - soluble molecules known as lipids in the blood ) .
As discussed in an accompanying commentary by Susanna Hofmann and Matthias Tschöp , although these are signs of the metabolic syndrome , which increases an individual 's risk of heart attack , the long - term affects of fructose over - consumption on susceptibility to heart attack remain unknown .
Along with being an anime buff , I ’m also a big movie buff .
I probably see a new film at least once a week , so I am quite familiar with the way Hollywood and the industry works .
Because I have such a huge admiration for the medium , it takes a lot to make me hate a film .
In fact , I ’ve only hated three films within the past year while finding the 50 - some other films at least tolerable .
I hated Twilight because it was a dull film that was only meant to show off a pretty boy with bushy eyebrows .
I hated Mama Mia !
because the film ripped out my testicles , threw them at the screen , and then sang a song about it .
I hated The Legend of Chun - Li movie not because it was a poor video game adaptation , but because it was a bad action flick .
But as difficult as it is to make me really hate a film , it ’s even harder to make me really love a film and make it significantly stand out for me .
So when the end credits began to roll for Dragonball Evolution last weekend and I gave it a genuine applause out of admiration , that really meant something .
Yes , I actually enjoyed this live - action adaptation of the popular manga series .
I was a fan of Dragonball even before I was a fan of anime .
This simple story of strength , power , and domination has reached out to many Americans and has made the franchise the most popular anime ever released over here .
So because I thought that the final moments of the film captured the same awesome feeling that the original comic and anime had , I felt very satisfied that Hollywood brought the property to the big screen .
But looking around , it would appear that I was the only one who enjoyed it .
The Dragonball fans hated the movie before it was even made .
As every photo and trailer came out , the blogoshpere would complain about how bad the movie looked and how much it was going to suck .
And in the weeks leading up to the film ’s release , I was bombarded with blast after blast of hate as anime fans illegally downloaded the film and watched it on their computers .
With all this negative press leading up to the film ’s release , it was no surprise that the film bombed its opening weekend and only took in a dismal $ 4.6 million at the box office .
It even undersold everybody ’s already low projections .
So where did it go wrong ?
How did the most popular anime property in America fail to reach out to its target audience ?
Sci -fi novelist Orson Scott Card offers a very interesting insight into the way Hollywood handles adaptations .
Card ’s 1985 novel Ender ’s Game tells the story of Ender , a 8 - year - old boy going to a futuristic military school to become a commander in a war against an alien race .
When Card was approached by Hollywood to turn the novel into a feature film , every studio producer said they would finance the adaptation given one stipulation : they wanted Ender to be a teenager and they wanted him to have a romantic love interest .
Card was appalled at this idea .
Ender was n’t a teenager , he was only a kid !
Changing that would have completely ruined one of the themes of the story .
And so he refused to allow his work to be adapted until a studio allowed him to faithfully adapt his novel with an 8 - year - old boy instead of a love - struck teen .
And so that is why the Ender ’s Game movie has never seen the light of day .
The Dragonball movie property was optioned in March 2002 and had been sitting on the back burner for many years before ever getting the go ahead to start filming .
What got them that green light ?
Well , I imagine it was the situation that Card was describing .
The movie execs wanted the film ’s protagonist to have a romantic interest , and so you ’d need Goku to be past adolescence and pining for love .
Once the screenwriters gave in to the movie studio ’s demands , they got their financing and could finally begin filming it .
You cannot make a big - budget Hollywood film without that stupid stipulation .
Hollywood feels that the only they they can guarantee box office success is if movie - going couples could make a date out of going to see the flick .
So the universal rule is that you have to have some sort of romantic element to it .
Even the recent adaptation of the Watchmen – one of the most faithful live - action adaptions of all time – added a cheesy romantic undertone between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre in the early scenes of the film .
Like the case with Ender ’s Game , this stipulation completely goes against everything about the original Dragonball story .
Goku was a goofy boy completely unaware of sexuality or romance .
That ’s was actually a big part of his character in the early part of the story .
When Bulma and Master Roshi introduced the idea of sex to the young Goku , he is completely indifferent to it .
He ’s just a kid , after all .
All he cares about is playing , fighting , and eating .
This asexuality becomes a theme for the entire 11 - year run of the comic and anime series .
Characters grow older , get married , and then have kids , but the whole time the concept of love , courtship , and sex never come up .
You assume that Goku and his wife Chi Chi eventually become intimate because they end up having a few kids , but no matter how adult Goku gets , his childish indifference to love and sex still remains .
Perhaps this is one of the biggest appeals of the original series and why it sticks out so much for young American males .
While Hollywood and TV keeps on throwing sex and romance towards us , Dragonball celebrated the male id ’s desire for brute strength and dominance .
The men of Dragonball were manly men .
They did n’t need to fight to show off or impress some dame .
They fought solely to survive and to become the top alpha male of the entire universe .
When Hollywood forces the screenwriters to make one of the first lines of the film be teenage Goku asking his grandfather how to pick up women , you have just alienated every Dragonball fan out there .
You ’ve made Goku a fragile boy who ’s primary desire is not to be the strongest in the world , but to win over the heart of the young exotic hottie Chi Chi .
And so with love on the brain , he begins stumbling through his fight training and screwing up key moments in battle .
In other words , Hollywood made Goku to be as much of a pussy as you , me , and everyone else in the whole world .
That ’s how 20th Century Fox truly blew it .
The sad thing is that you could tell that the screenwriters actually understood the original material and tried to remain as faithful to it as possible .
When I put aside the romance angle to the film , I saw a Dragonball movie adapted the way it should have been .
Bulma ’s spunky attitude .
Master Roshi ’s slight perversion .
Goku ’s relationship with his adopted Grandfather .
Yamcha being a thieving airhead .
Mai and Piccolo ’s cold indifference .
Bulma ’s expanding capsule car and dragonball tracking device .
Goku transforming to a giant ape - thing .
The climatic ending as Goku ’s Kamehameha wave overpowers Piccolo ’s to prove that he is the most powerful being on Earth .
This was the manly action that made the franchise so big in America and all around the world .
This was the manly action that made 20th Century Fox pick up the rights to the film seven years ago .
This was the manly action that should have brought in a lot of nerd money this past weekend .
All the right elements were there and Hollywood ’s big budget made it look amazing on screen .
That is what I saw when I watched the film , and that is why I applauded the screenwriters ’ attempts to make the best Dragonball film possible given these stupid circumstances .
By including a sugar coated romance element to it , Hollywood violated a Dragonball taboo that forced the fans to give up on the whole thing completely .
Dragonball Evolution bombed like it rightfully should .
Studio execs who stuck with an outdated formula for creating a box office success ended up creating one of the biggest blunders in recent Hollywood history .
But if they had just simply eliminated the cheesy romantic undertone , then the movie would have been significantly better in the box office then it did last weekend .
… but then again , it probably does n’t matter .
After all , the Dragonball fans hated the movie before it was even made .

Each bar balances two consecutive Fibonacci numbers of hanging elements .
For example , a five - element bar has two elements ( a disk and a loop ) hanging from one end and three elements ( a disk and two loops ) hanging from the other .
The paper is cut so that the disks and loops have exactly the same weight .
This means that if we assume that the weight of the wires has a negligible effect on the position of the balance points ( and surprisingly , this is empirically the case ) , the balance points will divide each bar into one of the Fibonacci ratios above .
The larger the mobile , the closer the final balancing point gets to dividing the top bar into the golden ratio .
The master mobile maker Alexander Calder used the Fibonacci pattern in a closely related but different way in his 1957 sculpture Black , White , and Ten Red , which is in the collection of the National Gallery of Art in Washington , D.C. Calder 's mobile contains a total of twelve hanging elements , where
12 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5
Coming Soon to Major City Centers : The Green Power Express
February 10th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
One of the biggest problems with wind power is that it ’s often trapped in low - density rural areas .
ITC Holdings wants to bring wind energy to major US city centers with the “ Green Power Express ” , a network of transmission lines that will move 12,000 MW of power from the Midwest to cities like Chicago and Minneapolis .
The $ 10 billion network will add 3,000 miles of transmission lines in North Dakota , South Dakota , Minnesota , Iowa , Wisconsin , Illinois and Indiana .
ITC has n’t provided an exact completion date for the project , but the company is in the midst of filing an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission requesting a revenue requirement formula and incentives for construction of the Green Power Express .
According to the company ’s website , “ Construction will start once all of the related studies have been completed , regulatory approvals have been received and the detailed routing of the project has been completed and approved as appropriate .
Due to the size and scope of this project along with the various state and federal approvals that will be required , ITC is aggressively targeting to have the Green Power Express in service by 2020 . ”
Here ’s hoping other organizations take on similar projects in the near future .
The sooner transmission lines are in place , the sooner we can move towards a truly smart grid .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
PRINCETON , NJ -- A new USA Today / Gallup poll finds that a majority of Americans disapprove of the loans made to General Motors and Chrysler late last year to help them avoid bankruptcy .
On Monday , the government rejected the automakers ' own restructuring plans and imposed new deadlines and conditions for each to receive further government loans .
That includes Chrysler 's working out a partnership with Italian automaker Fiat , and General Motors ' replacing its CEO and getting concessions from its unions and bondholders as part of more aggressive restructuring plans .
The new poll results , from a March 27 - 29 poll , are in line with what Gallup has found in earlier polling about government aid to two of the Big Three U.S. automakers .
In February , when asked about government aid to U.S. automakers in a general sense , just 41 % of Americans favored the concept while 58 % were opposed .
Gallup found even less public support when it asked about the specific GM and Chrysler requests for additional federal loans after they had submitted their restructuring plans to the government last month .
At the time , only 25 % of Americans believed Congress should approve these additional loans to GM and Chrysler , while 72 % thought it should not do so .
In November 2008 , when the automakers ' plight was first gaining widespread national attention , Americans were somewhat more likely to favor government aid , but were still slightly more likely to oppose ( 49 % ) than to favor ( 47 % ) it .
Democrats One of Few Groups That Supports Loans
The new poll finds most key demographic or attitudinal subgroups within the U.S. population disapproving of the government loans made to GM and Chrysler last December to help them avoid bankruptcy .
Democrats are a notable exception , as 57 % approve , more than twice the level of Republicans , whose support is among the lowest .
Independents ' views are closer to those of Republicans .
Even though the Midwest is the traditional home to the U.S. auto industry , residents of that area of the country are no more likely to approve of the GM and Chrysler loans than are those living in other parts of the United States .
Only 40 % of Midwesterners approve , compared with 42 % of those living in the East , 38 % of Southern residents , and 39 % of those residing in the West .
Implications
It is pretty well - established at this point that Americans oppose the idea of government assistance to the U.S. automakers .
Over the next two months , Chrysler 's and General Motors ' fates will become clearer as they work to meet the government 's guidelines for restructuring to receive further assistance .
Without that assistance , there is a high probability that one or both will enter bankruptcy .
Either outcome -- bankruptcy or successful restructuring -- does have the potential to shift Americans ' views on federal aid for U.S. auto manufacturers .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,007 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted March 27 - 29 , 2009 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Amazon 's Kindle 2 is slimmer , faster and has longer battery life than its predecessor .
But the newly launched e-book reader falls short when it comes to how well it displays text , say some users .
" When you read a lot of text on the screen , the contrast on the text drops as the font size gets smaller , which is the exact opposite of what the reader wants , " says Ted Inoue , a Kindle 2 owner from Pennsylvania who has extensively analyzed the issue .
It 's a problem that did n't exist for the first generation of Kindle owners .
Kindle 2 has font smoothing algorithms and its screen offers more levels of gray in order to better render text and pictures .
But the changes have backfired by making text more difficult to read at smaller sizes .
The problem seems especially acute for older users .
Kindle 2 owners are discussing the issue on Amazon 's forums ( about 480 messages have been posted in the thread ) and have called for Amazon to offer a quick fix to the problem .
It 's vexing enough for some to have returned their Kindle 2 devices to Amazon .
Others have downgraded , by exchanging their Kindle 2 units for the earlier model .
Amazon released the first generation of the Kindle e-book reader in 2007 and offered a refreshed version in February this year .
One of the major improvements has been that Kindle 2 has 16 shades of gray " for clear text and even crisper images , " compared to the four shades that the earlier version had .
The changes are proving to be particularly problematic to Kindle 2's users who do n't have 20 / 20 vision .
While the font size threshold varies , most complaints have been around the smallest three font sizes available on the device .
Kindle 2 offers a single default typeface and users cannot change it .
" The new basic font on the Kindle 2 is thinner and not as dark as the K1 , " says Andrys Basten , a Berkeley , California - based web programmer who also has a Kindle - focused blog .
" Its like writing with a fine point pen versus a darker point pen . "
Basten owns both generations of the Kindle .
Kindle 2's improved gray scale renders photographs and illustrations better than the old version , but it is a problem when translating text that was originally designed to be in color .
( See here for a quick explanation on how the gray scale works . )
" With the Kindle 1 , all people would get is black shading for text that was originally in color , " says Basten .
" Now there is increased gradation , which makes text lighter , and some people have trouble seeing it . "
Kindle 2's display is supplied by E Ink , which also produces the " electronic ink " displays used in most other e-book readers .
E
Ink did not respond to a request for a comment .
Then there are the font smoothing algorithms .
Without those algorithms , pixels along the edge of a letter would have typically been rendered as black .
Instead , they are now available in several shades of gray , as shown in the photographs above .
" In conventional backlit displays that works well , " Inoue says .
" But on a reflective screen like Kindle 's , you are just losing contrast rather than enhancing the image . "
The algorithms do produce smoother lines but they do not take into account the human psychology of perception , says Inoue .
" Most people do n't have perfect vision , " he says .
" What I find is that anything that degrades the contrast is going to make it blurrier . "
Amazon says the disgruntled customers ' gripes are not reflective of how most users feel .
" A few customers have said they prefer Kindle 1 with less shades of gray , but for the overwhelming majority it ’s the opposite – they enjoy the smoother text and crisper images on Kindle 2 , " says Andrew Herdener , director of communications for Amazon in a statement , without offering any other details .
Still , Inoue and other Kindle 2 users say there are a few easy fixes that Amazon can make to keep everyone happy .
One is to render text below a certain font size without applying any
anti-aliasing to it , says Inoue .
" This is not a perfect solution , as people with extremely sharp vision will notice the blockiness and may find it objectionable , " he says .
" However , for the majority of the population , the pixelation that occurs will be blurred out by the eye , making the fonts appear bold and smooth . "
Another solution could be to offer a way to make the fonts at lowest three sizes bold .
And if nothing else works , suggest Inoue , add a darker skin to the Kindle to offset its all - white body .
The darker skin helps create an illusion of increased contrast .
Some users have gone a step ahead .
Andrei Pushkin , a Kindle 2 owner has created a fonts hack that replaces the default Kindle 2 fonts with ones that support a wider range of Unicode characters , including , for example , Cyrillic .
That 's a step too far for Basten , who says she would rather wait for an official update .
" I see the relative lightness of the new font but it does n't bother me , " she says .
" I am not complaining much because I really like my Kindle . "
Do you see a difference between your Kindle 1 and Kindle 2 screens ?

Lions ’ approach with No. 1 pick is all wrong
When Matt Millen was finally relieved of his general manager duties last year , Lion fans had a renewed sense of hope .
Even though Martin Mayhew was n’t a big , outside name that was coming in to save a burning franchise , Detroit fans reveled in the fact that he was n’t Millen .
Up to this point , Mayhew ’s first offseason has been relatively quiet .
The Lions have n’t made any big splashes in free agency , but have added quality pieces to their defense in cornerback Phillip Buchanon and tackle Grady Jackson .
The team also made it a priority to re-sign long - time veteran kicker Jason Hanson .
Much of the focus for Mayhew and the Lions revolves around the draft , where they have three selections in the first 33 picks .
With major holes at quarterback , middle linebacker and offensive tackle , the Lions will essentially attempt to address two of those needs with the No. 1 and No. 20 picks .
But is Mayhew already screwing things up ?
The Lions have stated all along that they wanted to get the No. 1 pick under contract before the start of the April 25 draft .
So they began working with the agents of top prospects Aaron Curry , Matthew Stafford and Jason Smith roughly a week ago , and even have a even struck a deal with Curry , who is the top linebacker prospect in the draft .
But even with a contract in place with Curry , the Lions are reportedly waiting to hear from Stafford , who seemingly would be their first choice at No.
1 . If you read between the lines , Detroit wants Stafford but only if he agrees to a contract before the draft .
If he does n’t , then Detroit will go with Curry .
On the surface , this seems like a realistic game plan .
There are three players that the Lions like , so they ’re basing their final decision on money .
What ’s the big deal ?
The big deal is that if the Lions are n’t completely sold on Stafford , why are they even considering taking him ?
He ’s a quarterback – not a long snapper .
Mayhew and the Lions should be tripping over themselves to get to the podium to select him – not waiting to see if he ’ll agree to a reasonable contract .
This is n’t Money Management 101 – this is the freaking NFL .
Look I get it , the rookie salary cap is so screwed up and that ’s part of the reason the Lions have to approach their situation in this manner .
But this is a team coming off an 0 - 16 season so above all else , they ca n’t afford to get this pick wrong .
They need a slam - dunk and if Stafford is n’t it , then they should be concentrating on which player is .
Mayhew should be working day and night with new head coach Jim Schwartz on figuring out what player best fits everything the Lions are trying to accomplish on the field .
As much as the rookie salary cap has to factor into this decision , it still ca n’t be the deciding factor .
This is n’t like going to the grocery store to buy laundry detergent and coming home with whatever is on sale .
The Lions need to get the player right above all else .
This whole notion that they have to take a quarterback because they need one is wrong , too .
Do they need a quarterback ?
Absolutely .
Is Stafford the best quarterback prospect in this draft ?
Yes .
But at the end of the day , his strengths as a player have to fit what the Lions want to accomplish offensively .
And if his strengths do n’t match , then Detroit should go with another player and attempt to address their quarterback need at another time .
For the record , this has nothing to do with Curry .
I ’ve said all along that he should be the Lions pick for these three reasons :
He ’s the best prospect in the draft , he fills a major need and if the Lions are so worried about money , he comes significantly cheaper than Stafford and Smith .
Looking for a slam - dunk ?
Curry might be the closest thing to it in this draft .
Maybe in the end , Mayhew and the Lions wo n’t screw this up .
Maybe they ’ll make this decision based on financial reasons and still wind up taking the right player .
But if I were a Lion fan , I ’d be scared to death that my team is clearly not 100 % convinced that Stafford ( i.e. a quarterback – the most important position on the field ) can ultimately win them games .
ZOMG , lmfao

The two New York Times journalists who broke the original Bush - era NSA wiretapping story in 2005 have published fresh revelations of new abuses of the program , which include alleged access to Americans ' domestic communications and an attempt to wiretap a member of Congress without a warrant .
The article reports that " officials with both the House and Senate intelligence committees said they had concerns that the agency had ignored civil liberties safeguards built into last year ’s wiretapping law . "
Um , what safeguards ?
Last July , when the Democratic - controlled congress completely caved on the issue of NSA wiretapping abuses and weakened the safeguards against abuse with a set of terrible compromises , Ars writer Timothy B . Lee wrote :
The 114 - page bill was pushed through the House so quickly that there was no real time to debate its many complex provisions ...
The new legislation dramatically expands the government 's ability to wiretap without meaningful judicial oversight , by redefining " oversight " so that the feds can drag their feet on getting authorization almost indefinitely .
It also gives the feds unprecedented new latitude in selecting eavesdropping targets , latitude that could be used to collect information on non-terrorist - related activities like P2P copyright infringement and online gambling .
In short , the FISA Amendments
Act of 2008 opens up loopholes so large that the feds could drive a truck loaded down with purloined civil liberties through it .
The FISA compromise of 2008 , passed by a Democratic Congress , essentially gave congressional blessing to the surveillance abuses of the Bush - era NSA , and then went a step further by greatly reducing existing safegaurds over wiretapping .
The way that many ( including yours truly ) interpreted the move was that the Democrats were trying to shore up their national security credentials in advance of the November elections .
Indeed , then - senator Barack Obama voted in favor of the compromise , and Salon 's Glenn Greenwald documents in some detail how the senator 's surrogates tried to spin the vote as pro-civil liberties .
In respect of these two goals — i.e. , to increase the executive 's ability to wiretap with impunity and to help Democrats gain control of Congress and the White House in November — the bill could be considered a smashing success .
Unfortunately , it 's definitionally impossible to gauge the secret program 's effectiveness at its nominal goal , which is preventing terrorism .
Moving back to the revelations in the NYT article , most of them are relatively nonspecific and very carefully phrased by Lichtblau and Risen .
In brief , it looks like a DOJ audit of the program uncovered " significant and systemic " abuses , in which the NSA " unintentionally " collected — but did n't necessarily examine — domestic e-mails and phone calls of Americans .
Some of the alleged confusion over what 's kosher to collect and what is n't arose from the difficulty of separating out the communications that travel through American 's satellites and fiber optic cables into " foreign " and " domestic " traffic .
The only truly specific charge , and it's a doozy , is that the NSA considered wiretapping a member of the US Congress without authorization :
The agency believed that the congressman , whose identity could not be determined , was in contact — as part of a Congressional delegation to the Middle East in 2005 or 2006 — with an extremist who had possible terrorist ties and was already under surveillance , the official said .
The agency then sought to eavesdrop on the congressman ’s conversations , the official said .
The official said the plan was ultimately blocked because of concerns from some intelligence officials about using the NSA , without court oversight , to spy on a member of Congress .
That the NSA would even consider wiretapping a member of Congress without a court order is so disturbing that it makes me want to run out and organize a populist protest over creeping fascism , vanishing liberties , and the shredding of the Constitution .
Here 's an idea : we could plan to dump 1 million phone cords in DC's Lafayette Park .
The DOJ has released a statement confirming that there were " issues " with the program , and that they 're working to rectify them .
And , as is the agency 's custom in every single one of these instances , the NSA has denied doing anything wrong .
AMD announced its first quarter earnings today , and , as expected , the company 's losses continue to widen .
AMD posted a net loss of $ 0.66 per share , or $ 416 million , which is worse than the $ 0.60 per share net loss from the same quarter a year ago .
In its conference call , AMD corroborated Intel 's earlier claim that PC demand appears to be bottoming out , and the company attributes the 7 percent sequential increase in net processor revenues to the post - bottom inventory bump I described in my previous report on Intel 's earnings .
So that 's two datapoints indicating that PC demand has stopped cliff diving and may have actually made a real bottom in the first quarter .
Let 's hope that it 's the bottom , and not just a bottom .
As I mentioned above , AMD 's microprocessor sales were up a bit from the previous quarter , but they 're still down 21 percent year - over - year .
The company wants to paint this 7 percent sequential bump as evidence that AMD can still see growth even in a down market , but I think it 's also evidence that AMD is still the cheaper alternative to Intel .
In other words , the PC market right now is extremely price - sensitive , and AMD 's server processors are the bargain alternative .
Revenues for AMD 's graphics unit are down 18 percent sequentially and 15 percent year - over - year , which indicates that the demand for graphics products is still contracting .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
One corner of the wild and wooly world of derivatives is about to get a little tamer -- and not a moment too soon for those who fret over the rising cost of bailouts .
The banks that handle the bulk of the trading in credit default swaps -- the unregulated contracts whose misuse helped AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) bring about its own demise -- are adopting new trading and settlement rules this week in a shift the industry has labeled the " big bang . "
The changes will set new terms for credit default swaps traded on companies in North America , standardize payment schedules , or coupons , and eliminate clauses that would force CDS users to settle trades when a company does a limited restructuring under certain circumstances .
Other shifts will streamline the process for settling the swaps in the event of default .
The moves should eventually make it easier for regulators to oversee the CDS market , whose rapid growth and limited transparency have long been a source of acute anxiety .
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has called for putting the market , currently an " over - the - counter " affair that consists of private contracts between traders , on the same footing as the markets for stocks and commodities , in which parties trade with a central counterparty or exchange .
The changes , which are due to take effect Wednesday , will push the market closer to that goal .
" Regulators and the industry have been working together for some time to strengthen the infrastructure , " said Karel Engelen , global head of technology solutions at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association trade group .
" This is the next step in the evolution toward a more standardized market . "
Even so , it will be some time before the CDS market is all grown up .
In the meantime , some observers are warning of the dangers of concentrated derivatives exposure in a banking sector already leaning on federal support .
Dealers are taking " an inordinate risk -- and exposing taxpayers to substantial risk as well , " said Gary Kopff , a former McKinsey consultant who is now an expert witness in shareholder litigation involving subprime mortgages , collateral debt obligations and credit default swaps .
U.S. commercial banks ' net current credit exposure -- a measure used by regulators to estimate possible losses on outstanding derivatives contracts -- more than doubled last year , to $ 800 billion , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said last month .
Total credit exposure , which reflects how derivatives exposure could rise over time , hit $ 1.58 trillion - up 50 % from 2007 levels and in line with the 2006 all - time high .
The nation 's largest banks , many of which have received tens of billions of dollars of federal assistance over the past year , have the most exposure to these derivatives .
Four the top five commercial banks with the biggest U.S. derivatives dealings -- JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and Britain 's HSBC ( HBC ) -- lost money in the fourth quarter on their credit - related trading .
Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) was the only one in the top five that made money in the fourth quarter on its credit trading , the OCC said .
Still , one of its units -- New York - based Goldman Sachs Bank -- lost $ 926 million on credit trading last year , according to reports filed with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council .
Goldman notes in its annual report filed earlier this year that the market for credit derivatives -- 98 % of which are credit default swaps , going by OCC data -- is no picnic .
" The market for credit default swaps is relatively new , although very large , and it has proven to be extremely volatile and currently lacks a high degree of structure or transparency , " Goldman said in the report .
' Lots of changes ' but ' little visibility '
This week 's changes set out to change that , however modestly .
Engelen said there could be some hiccups as traders get used to the new regime , with " lots of changes taking place at once . "
But he said he expects little disruption .
Geithner said in congressional testimony last month that a regulatory overhaul must include federal oversight of unregulated over - the - counter derivatives such as credit default swaps .
He called for CDS trading to move to so - called central clearing -- eliminating the fears that one party wo n't make good on its obligations .
Even in a centrally cleared market , however , it will be difficult for investors to track which firms end up holding the counterparty risks embedded in tradable derivatives .
That 's why Geithner wants to give regulators the authority to privately view firms ' books and monitor traders ' risk management .
" The days when a major insurance company could bet the house on credit default swaps with no one watching and no credible backing to protect the company or taxpayers from losses must end , " Geithner said in reference to AIG , the insurer that imploded last September and has since required more than $ 170 billion in taxpayer funds to stay afloat .
Not everyone is alarmed by the banks ' derivatives exposure .
Unlike AIG , banks are widely assumed to habitually hedge their trading books .
It 's also worth noting that the OCC 's current exposure estimates do n't reflect the collateral held by dealers -- a number that tends to run around 30 % - 40 % of net exposure , the agency said .
Still , FBR Capital Markets analyst Steve Stelmach estimated in a report last month that the potential credit derivatives losses at two big dealers , Goldman and Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) , stood at $ 568 million and $ 675 million , respectively .
Stelmach stressed that this level of losses is unlikely , but that " given the minimal disclosure " provided on counterparty exposure , there is " little visibility on any potential problems , and the market would likely receive little forewarning if losses were to develop . "
Perhaps a bigger problem for the banks is that adding structure to the CDS market stands to squeeze their profits , Stelmach added .
That 's because it would make pricing more competitive at a time when many of their businesses are already under pressure .
The money is funding cheaper ways to send data using lasers .
The UK government is spending £ 1 m to develop technologies to boost future broadband speeds .
The money is being spent on research that could boost browsing speeds to between 1 and 10 gigabits per second .
The technologies being researched are all to do with broadband delivered by fibre - optic cables .
Some of the 13 projects being funded aim to make it easier and cheaper to build fibre networks to ensure they can reach as many people as possible .
Home net
The cash is being put up by the Technology Strategy Board ( TSB ) for research that will set firms on the path to creating all the pieces of future " ultra - fast " broadband networks .
It will also help those UK firms join larger European projects that are also committed to boosting broadband speeds .
" There 's a Moore 's Law for bandwidth in the home , " said Mike Biddle , a lead technologist for the TSB .
" It 's doubling roughly every 21 months . "
" If you look out to 2020 you start to need about 1 gigabit per second ( gbps ) and beyond , " he added .
" Although you can already get 1 or 10 gbps you cannot do it at the right cost point , " he said .
" That 's the barrier we are trying to crack . "
One project winning funds will survey possible technologies for ultra fast broadband , and plot a roadmap that dictates the best way for the UK to prepare its infrastructure for that high - speed future .
Others will look into ways to create so - called passive components that make the job of connecting homes to fibre networks straightforward .
Currently , building multi-gigabit networks involves complex , expensive components such as tunable lasers .
One scheme , called HOWL ( Hi-performance Optical - Wireless Links ) aims to create a home wi-fi access point that uses a single chip to connect to broadband networks and convert data to wireless for distribution around a home .
Mr Biddle said the funding was also to help UK companies prepare for a similar Europe - wide competition that would put far more money , 7.5 m euros ( £ 6.58 m ) into research into cheaper fibre networks .

There is a precarious balance in the garden .
Just leave your garden unsupervised for a month or two and you 'll see signs of its flight back to chaos .
Some chaos is a good thing .
Manicured gardens make me nervous and require too much work to maintain .
Who has the time ?
Winter is a good time to identify problems that will occur , round up any materials needed and make a note in your day planner so that you do n't forget to implement your strategy .
My tomato patch used to be a common site for calamity .
Top - heavy tomatoes would topple over , leaving fruit on the ground , squashing some of them and crushing neighboring plants .
There are several ways to prevent this .
HEAVYWEIGHT CAGES : I use folding tomato cages made of heavy steel .
They have long legs that easily sink into garden soil to keep the cages standing upright , especially when wired to one another .
These cages cost more than many other types at local nurseries , but they are made of heavier steel so they 'll last longer and wo n't topple like flimsier ones .
LIGHTWEIGHT CAGES :
If you are using lightweight wire cages for tomatoes , however , there is an easy way to prevent them from toppling .
Figure out your tomato placement and spacing .
A straight row works best for the following solution : Just beyond the spread of each plant at each end of the tomato row , place a pair of 2 - by - 4 posts .
If the row is just a couple of plants , you can drive in the posts with a sledgehammer rather than digging a hole ; sharpening the base of the post makes insertion easier .
Nail a crosspiece near the bottom of each post to help stabilize it .
Guide wire through the top ring of squares of the lightweight cages and attach it to the posts .
Click here for the drawing for three ways to do this .
TIPS
bull ; Keep determinate and indeterminate varieties in separate rows .
Indeterminate tomato varieties can get a good deal larger and heavier because they continue to grow and bear fruit all season .
bull ;
Use cages 48 to 72 inches tall for vigorous indeterminate tomato varieties .
Cages no more than 48 inches are best suited to determinate tomato varieties .
bull ;
Wait until you usually plant tomatoes outside to dig post holes or you 'll compact the still - wet soil .
bull ;
Do not use pressure - treated wood .
bull ;
Saw the base of each post to be driven in by sledgehammer or just dig a hole instead .

They can be tough to find , so I order in bulk .
They are by far the easiest , most durable method for keeping wire tight for espaliers , trellising and other garden jobs .

The Bagger 288 was built for the job of removing overburden prior to coal mining in Tagebau Hambach ( stripmine Hambach ) , Germany .
It can excavate 240,000 tons of coal or 240,000 cubic metres of overburden daily – the equivalent of a football field dug to 30 meters ( 98.4 ft ) deep .
The coal produced in one day fills 2400 coal wagons .
The excavator is approximately 240 m long and 96 m high .
The Bagger 's operation requires 16.56 megawatts of externally supplied electricity .
It can travel 2 to 10 m ( 6.6 to 32.8 ft ) per minute ( 0.1 to 0.6 km / h ) .
The chassis of the main section is 46 meters ( 151 ft ) wide and sits on 3 rows of 4 caterpillar track assemblies , each 3.8 m ( 12.5 ft ) wide .
The large surface area of the tracks means the ground pressure of the Bagger 288 is very small ( 17.1 N / cm2 or 24.8 psi ) ; this allows the excavator to travel over gravel , earth and even grass without leaving a significant track .
It has a minimum turning radius of approximately 100 meters , and can climb a maximum gradient of 1:18 .

Well , it 's about that time .
Darkness is setting in on the East Coast and that means Earth Hour is on its way .
This is where you are supposed to turn your lights off for an hour in order to send a message to government leaders that more needs to be done to combat climate change .
And people from all over the world did that today -- from Sydney Harbor in Australia , to the Great Pyramids in Egypt , to a research station in Antarctica .
Many cities across the US are participating .
New York , Chicago , Los Angeles , and San Francisco all have events planed .
In Boston , the Prudential Center and the Hancock building will power down .

By the way , Rush Limbaugh is celebrating Earth Hour just like everybody else .
Although he 's planning on doing it a bit differently .
Earlier this week , he announced on his radio show that he 's making it much more festive .
" I have the ability from my couch , wherever I happen to be , I can turn on very light in the place , on all five houses .
I can turn on the air conditioner and I can regulate the air conditioner .
So I lit my place up like a Christmas tree last night .
" At 8:30 on Saturday night , I 'm going to do the same thing .
I mean , I might even put a Christmas tree up !
I might even put Christmas lights on the outside lights , on the outside landscaping .
I mean , I 'm going to go just the opposite way , because I , El Rushbo -- as you know -- resist the tug of popular sentiment . "

After three days of gun battles , the Sri Lankan military said it has captured the last stronghold of the Tamil Tiger rebels and killed five rebel leaders .
" Soldiers of 53 and 58 divisions and TF - VIII captured entire Puthukkudiyiruppu area , the last base station of the LTTE terrorists this morning , " the military said in a statement posted on its Web site Sunday .
A " couple of hundred " rebels could be " hiding " in a 20 - square - kilometer area designated as the " safety zone , " military spokesman Udaya Nanayakkara told CNN .
There will be no military offensive in that area , he said , as it has a civilian population of about 50,000 people .
Five rebel leaders were killed , the statement said , and a sixth was critically injured .
More than 250 dead bodies of rebels were recovered , bringing the total number of bodies recovered during the last three days up to 420 , the military said .
Weapons were also recovered , according to the statement .
At least 110 rebels have surrendered to the military , army sources told CNN .
There was no immediate reaction from the Tamil Tiger rebels .
The organization has fought since 1983 for an independent homeland for the country 's ethnic Tamil minority .
The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead .

The Moon and Venus both in their crescent phase .
Right now you may have noticed that Venus is sinking down bit by bit every day in the evening sky as it once again draws closer to the Sun , but space.com tells us that this time due to the slight difference in the orbital plane of our two planets it 'll actually be able to be seen ( ever so slightly ) both in the evening of the 25th and the next morning if you live in the northern hemisphere :
Seen from mid-northern latitudes at this time of year , the ecliptic – the imaginary line across the sky representing the path of the sun – is steeply inclined to the horizon in the early evening .
Therefore , Venus appears to descend the western sky rapidly during these last couple of weeks of March .
On March 25 at 14 hours Universal Time the sun and Venus are in conjunction in right ascension with the planet 9.1 - degrees due north of the center of the sun 's disk .
On this date viewers in North America will see Venus about equally well in both the evening and morning sky , almost 9 - degrees to the upper right of the setting sun ( your clenched fist measures roughly 10 - degrees at arm 's length ) and about as far to the left of the rising sun .
From latitude 40 - degrees north ( the latitude of Philadelphia , Denver or Madrid ) , Venus will be 5 - degrees above the horizon at both sunrise and sunset !
Up to and including the evening of March 25 , Venus is easier to see in the evening sky , and thereafter easier in the morning .
Using Stellarium for that date you can see what this is going to look like ( this is using the sea as a background ) .
First Venus at sunset March 25 :
and then the next morning , just before the Sun comes up :
As for the original subject of the post , the reason why night owls ( like myself ) should be happy is because two things will happen beginning in April :
1 ) The days will continue to get longer , meaning the Sun will be rising earlier and earlier until the Solstice , and
2 ) Venus will begin to rise higher and higher in the morning sky .
Eventually by about June or so Venus will have risen so high in the morning sky that it 'll start to be visible in the east some time after 2 am , which is when a lot of us night owls are still awake , so if you 're like me you wo n't need to get up bright and early just to see Venus - just wait until after 2 am and then make a quick trip outside to see it in the east .
Everybody wins !
Venus and Jupiter ( and Mars ) just after 3 am on July 1st this year , from about 37 degrees north .
California ’s high school exit exam is keeping disproportionate numbers of girls and non-whites from graduating , even when they are just as capable as white boys , according to a study released Tuesday .
It also found that the exam , which became a graduation requirement in 2007 , has “ had no positive effect on student achievement . ”
The study by researchers at Stanford University and UC Davis concluded that girls and non-whites were probably failing the exit exam more often than expected because of what is known as “ stereotype threat , ” a theory in social psychology that holds , essentially , that negative stereotypes can be self - fulfilling .
In this case , researcher Sean Reardon said , girls and students of color may be tripped up by the expectation that they cannot do as well as white boys .
Reardon said there was no other apparent reason why girls and non-whites fail the exam more often than white boys , who are their equals in other , lower - stress academic assessments .
Reardon , an associate professor of education at Stanford , urged the state Department of Education to consider either scrapping the exit exam -- one of the reforms for which state Supt. of Public Instruction Jack O’Connell has fought the hardest -- or looking at ways of intervening to help students perform optimally .
Reardon said the exam is keeping as many as 22,500 students a year from graduating who would otherwise fulfill all their requirements .
“ No one can be happy with these results , ” Reardon said .
“ The exit exam is n’t working as it was intended . ”

O’Connell issued a statement containing measured praise of the report but defending the exam , saying it “ plays an important role in our work to ensure that a high school diploma has meaning . ”
Other officials in the Education Department reacted skeptically to the study , sharply rejecting its assertion that the test has no positive effect on learning .
“ I ’m not ready to agree with that at all , ” said Deb Sigman , deputy superintendent for assessment and accountability .
The researchers , she said , “ do n’t look at grades , they do n’t look at classroom observation or interviews with children . ”
But Russell Rumberger , a professor of education at UC Santa Barbara who directs the California Dropout Research Project , called the study “ very sophisticated ” and said policymakers need to take heed of its conclusions and perhaps consider an alternative test .
State Assembly Speaker Karen Bass ( D - Los Angeles ) issued a statement saying that the research “ reinforces the concerns that many of us have had about the exit exam from its inception . ”
She said the results “ must make us all pause and take stock of whether the exam could be fixed or is fatally flawed . ”

The exit exam , which students can take multiple times beginning in their sophomore year , includes math and English tests , with the math aligned to eighth - grade standards and English to 10th - grade standards .
It has been criticized both for being too easy and for unfairly denying a diploma to students who otherwise might graduate .
The study , funded by the private , nonprofit James Irvine Foundation , is based on analysis of data from four large California school districts , those in Fresno , Long Beach , San Diego and San Francisco .
Reardon said the results were very similar for all four districts , suggesting that the conclusions had broad application for all California schools .
Not surprisingly , the researchers found that the exam was toughest on students in the bottom quarter of their class , based on state standardized test scores .
That was also where the study found the strongest inequality of results .
“ Graduation rates declined by 15 to 19 percentage points for low - achieving black , Hispanic and Asian students when the exit exam was implemented , and declined only one percentage point . . . for similar white students , ” the study said .
Low - achieving girls had a 19 percentage - point drop in their graduation rate , compared with a decrease of 12 percentage points for boys .

Reardon said he initially was skeptical of the “ stereotype threat ” effect , but that it has been well - established by social psychologists and appears to apply to the test disparities .

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
A narrow ice bridge connecting Charcot Island and Latady Island — the last remnant of the northern part of Antarctica ’s Wilkins Ice Shelf — broke apart in early April 2009 .
These photo - like images , from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) , show the break - up of the ice bridge .
In the lower image , taken by the MODIS instrument on NASA ’s Terra satellite on March 31 , 2009 , the ice bridge was still intact .
The ice appears to be smooth , an unbroken surface .
Less than a week later , late on April 6 , the MODIS instrument on NASA ’s Aqua satellite captured the top image .
The smooth bridge is gone , replaced by chunks of ice .
The breakup was initially observed in radar imagery by the European Space Agency .
The pieces of the former ice bridge join multiple other chunks of ice formed as the northern portion of the ice shelf broke apart throughout the previous decade .
The broken pieces of the shelf have remained frozen in place since 1998 , but now that the ice bridge no longer provides a barrier , the remnants of the ice shelf may flow out into the Southern Ocean .
A careful comparison of the two images reveals that some of the ice nearest the bridge shifted between March 31 and April 6 .
Cracks that formed in the ice shelf below and right of the bridge in late 2008 expanded after the ice bridge broke and the remnant ice nearest the shelf shifted away , says Ted Scambos of the National Snow and Ice Data Center .
These changes are emphasized by differences in light between the two images .
The Sun was low in the sky on April 6 .
The clouds cast long shadows on the ice beneath .
By contrast , the Sun was relatively high , and the light more direct on March 31 .
Fewer shadows outline the topography on March 31 .
The low Sun angle highlights cracks in the ice in the April 6 image .
The cracks were first seen in radar images collected by the European Space Agency , and were evident on November 26 , 2008 .
Many factors contributed to the collapse of the northern portion of the ice shelf , including brine on the ice , physical stresses on the shelf , and warming temperatures , says Scambos .
Throughout 2008 , parts of the ice shelf ( formerly to the left of the bridge ) broke away .
The ice bridge had been the last intact portion of the northern edge of the ice shelf .
The southern portion of the Wilkins Ice Shelf ( part of which appears in the lower right corner of the images ) is still intact , but may be more vulnerable now that the northern edge has disintegrated .
What is the significance of the disintegration of the northern portion of the Wilkins Ice Shelf ?
The collapse of the ice shelf will not contribute to sea level rise , since the ice had already been floating on the water .
When other ice shelves such as the Larsen , have collapsed , they allowed glaciers to pump more ice into the ocean at a faster rate , which did contribute to sea level rise .
The Wilkins Ice Shelf , however , does not buttress any major glacier , says Scambos .
The Wilkins Ice Shelf is the tenth major ice shelf to collapse in recent times , another sign that warming temperatures are impacting Earth ’s fragile cryosphere .

A medical - marijuana advocate who grew 32,000 plants on his land in Lake County was sentenced to 10 years in prison Monday by a federal judge who criticized the law she was applying .
" I think that amount of time is excessive , but it 's not up to me , " U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel said in sentencing Charles " Eddy " Lepp in a San Francisco courtroom crowded with his supporters .
Patel gave Lepp until July 6 to report to prison and said she would reconsider the sentence if Congress changed the law , which requires a 10 - year term for growing at least 1,000 marijuana plants .
Lepp , 56 , was arrested in 2004 , after federal agents said they had found more than 32,000 marijuana plants in gardens near his home in Upper Lake , most of them in plain view of Highway 20 .
He said the plants were all for patients who had a right to use marijuana with their doctors ' approval under California law .
Courts have ruled , however , that the state law does not bar federal prosecutions .
Lepp also said that he was a Rastafarian minister , for whom the plants were a sacrament , and that he was growing the plants for 2,500 members of his church who were sharecroppers .
Patel barred the religious defense last year , saying Lepp could not credibly claim that his faith compelled him to distribute thousands of plants to unidentified parishioners .
A jury convicted Lepp in September of conspiracy and cultivation with the intent to distribute marijuana .
His lawyer , Michael Hinckley , argued for a lesser sentence , but Patel said the 10 - year term was mandatory because the evidence showed Lepp led the operation and supervised others .
Hinckley also argued in court papers that the sentence was " grossly disproportional " to the crimes and that Lepp , who is in frail health , would not survive 10 years in prison .
Hinckley said Monday he would appeal the sentence .
What is the real route to better Google rankings ?
Many new Internet marketers obsess over Google pagerank believing it to be the route to rising in the search results , where in fact pagerank is just one of many factors involved in your search engine ranking and , most misleading , what you see in the Google Toolbar is very inaccurate anyway .
People look at Wikipedia and think they rank so highly and so often because of pagerank , or perhaps because they have a gajillion links , but there is another powerful element we can overlook if we are not careful .
Once relevance , links and keywords are taken into account , the true engines of search engine success are now believed to be “ Trust ” and “ Authority ” .
But what do those phrases mean in this context , and how do you get more of the good stuff ?
Read on !
Authority Leads to Google Authority
You know I am all about promoting authority in your blogging .
Authority in general means that people trust you to supply expert insight .
The good news is that authorities trusted by human beings are also trusted by Google .
“ If a site is an authority in your industry , you can bet that it will be for Google as well .
So if you ’re a web designer , a link from Smashing Magazine or A List Apart helps , as a lot of other web design sites will be linking to those sites , thus causing those sites to be ‘ hubs ’ in the web design space . ”
— Joost De Valk , Yoast
Authority in a search context takes into account all the elements of a site then determines a grading on the spectrum from completely authoritative through to no authority at all .
The more authoritative and trusted your site , the better you will rank .
In fact , being an authority in Google ’s eyes is a game - changer .
The rules are quite different for authorities and authorities can get away with much more gray and risky behavior than other sites .
There are many factors that directly influence your Google authority including the domain ( a .gov is going to be more trusted than a much easier to gain .info ) , quantity and quality of links , plus traffic elements .
Dear Google … Who Do You Trust ?
Perhaps the most important element is this factor of who is linking to you .
It is believed that Google has a whitelist of trusted websites .
While it is unlikely you will get onto this hallowed category yourself , inbound links from the websites that are already on the white list will give you a certain boost in the search engine rankings .
“ Trust is the reason some websites can rank highly for competitive search terms purely by publishing a page targeted to that search term .
Sites like Wikipedia and the BBC do n’t need to worry about building links to pages because Google has so much trust in the domain that they rank in the top few results , seemingly without having to work for it . ”
— Patrick Altoft , BlogStorm
The problem is all of this is very unscientific , based on observation and guesswork , and the only people that really know what is going on work for Google , and unsurprisingly they are not talking .
I should also point out that , while we often use “ Authority ” and “ Trust ” almost interchangeably , Google almost certainly sees the two factors as separate .
We have way more influence over our authority than we do our “ TrustRank “ , in fact as far as trust is concerned the best we can do is improve our “ degrees of separation ” from those we suspect are on the search engine ’s white list .
That all said we can still take some educated guesses as to which elements of your site and content will drive up the authority factor and in turn help you gain those all - important search results .
Plus the more authority we accrue , the more likely we are to get linked to by the trusted few .
Let ’s take a look at some of those now , starting with the negatives , then leading to the positives :
Negative Trust Influences
What can you do to your own site , or could a competitor do to you , that will nuke your trust and therefore rankings ?
“ I always think that links have a positive or negative value .
Let ’s say the BBC gives you a +10,000 and a spammy blogspot link gives you a - 100 , you still have a positive 9,900 score .
The problems occur when the BBC get hit with a link selling penalty , if your backlinks have fallen into negative equity things go south quickly .
Get caught selling links and your link value could shift from a positive value to a negative value , so I re-visit my clients links monthly and check out what ’s happening to the sites that link to them ”

Buy and Sell Links – First is if you are obvious in your link buying , do n’t expect to last long in the search engines .
Mr Cutts is very keen on tracking down and destroying sold links .
There are even some sites that are so “ dirty ” in Google ’s eyes that a purchase in the right place and right time can nuke you over night .
Do n’t believe me ?
Ask the right people at the right conferences to show you the evidence .
That ’s all I am saying 🙂

If your links are not paid but still associate you with the seedier parts of the interwebs , do n’t be surprised if you are seen as guilty by association .

Unnatural Growth Patterns – Google will look carefully at your link growth for any signs of unnatural acquisition .
This is n’t to say that if you get on the front page of Digg and garner 20 k visitors and as a result , 100 fresh links that you will be penalized .
What is likely though is they will take a closer look if your brand new domain arrives out of the gate with one page of content and 10,000 links overnight .

Thin or Spammy Content – Duplicate , scraped or feed content , or spammy gibberish is likely to get marked down .
As you would expect , Google is aiming to promote the highest quality .
They will use human checks , algorithms and watch the behaviour of their customers to see if what they are delivering meets expectations .
So the first element to emphasize is make your site evolve as naturally as possible !
“ You can manufacture authority with a very intelligent link building campaign but more often than not it ’s the natural growth of the site and links with other sites in the same industry that gives Google reason to trust the site . ”
— Patrick Altoft , BlogStorm
We have looked at negatives , but what could be positive trust signals ?
Traffic
Let ’s get the most controversial potential factor out of the way right now .
Traffic might be a quality signal .
It seems a fairly obvious one as a human being , but what about to Googlebot ?
“ My #1 SEO lesson is simple : get the technical details right , and then start making sure you get as much traffic from other sources than Google as you can , and your Google search traffic will rise along with it . ”
— Joost De Valk , Yoast
We know that Google track click - throughs from some search results pages , but could Google also be using Analytics , FeedBurner and toolbar data to get a sense of traffic also ?
Quantity – Are many people visiting the site ?
– Are many people visiting the site ?
Growth –
Is your traffic growing organically ?
– Is your traffic growing organically ?
Consistency – Does your traffic go from zero to thousands then back again with no discernible reason ?
Google of course knows what is going on with their own search engine , so if they place undeserved trust in a site for a certain search result they will get good feedback from user behavior .
Another hint might be Brand Search –
If lots of people are looking for your brand then that is likely a good sign .
It makes sense that if people are searching for BMW then the official BMW site should appear .
“ People who only think about search marketing often forget the branding aspects of blogging , it ’s really important to get a decent design and logo , people will remember you and thus search for you more , and link to you more . ”
— Joost De Valk , Yoast
Links
I feel on much safer ground suggesting links as a trust influencer .
Directories ( like Yahoo ! and Dmoz ) – Some directories are trusted , others are not .
Key is if they are editorially controlled or free - for - all .
It ’s the one type of paid link that Google likes .

Theme –
Is the subject of the domain on topic or irrelevant ?
Strength –
Is the linking site strong or untrusted ?
Diversity –
Is there a large variety and diversity of domains , or a few home grown reciprocals ?
Age – Are the linking domains as old as the internet or brand new registrations ?
Location –
You want a variety of links but sidebar or footer links are unlikely to be as trusted as relevant in - content and in - context links .
Anchor Text – Google will want variety in anchor text , and for the anchor text to be on topic .
Balance relevance against looking unnatural again .
“ I ’d rather have four moderately successful pieces than one single very successful one .

Saudi Arabia is ruled with an austere and patriarchal form of Sunni Islam Saudi Arabia says it plans to start regulating the marriage of young girls , amid controversy over a union between a 60 - year - old man and a girl of eight .
A court in Unaiza upheld the marriage on condition the groom does not have sex with her until she reaches puberty .
Justice Minister Muhammad Issa said his ministry wanted to put an end to the " arbitrary " way in which parents and guardians can marry off underage girls .
But he did not suggest the practice would be abolished .
Human - rights groups oppose such marriages , which they say are often motivated by poverty .
Saudi Arabia implements an austere form of Sunni Islam that bans free association between the sexes and gives fathers the right to wed their children to whomever they deem fit .
' Selling daughters '
The Unaiza case was brought by the eight - year - old girl 's mother who wanted the marriage to be annulled .
The judge said he had tried to persuade the husband to accept a divorce , but the man refused .
The girl is still with her family and there is no suggestion that she will live with her husband until much older .
The judge said that once she reached puberty , she could ask for a divorce .
Local press reports say the case seems to be an example of how some Saudi families sell their daughters for money .
Correspondents say the girl 's father appeared to have sought the dowry from the groom to pay off debts .
Saudi commentators also point out that the marriage took place in the central province of Qaseem - the heartland of Saudi Islamic fundamentalism .
Earlier this year , the country 's highest religious authority , the Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz al - Shaikh , said it was not against Islamic law to marry off girls who are 15 and younger .

A three - month - old boy rushed to hospital after a multi-vehicle collision yesterday afternoon remains in critical condition while his three - year - old sister has been upgraded to serious but stable condition .
Both children were taken to the Hospital for Sick Children with critical , life - threatening injuries Saturday after three vehicles collided at Yonge St. and Lake Shore Blvd.
around 3:30 p.m. , shutting down the busy intersection for several hours .
The father was behind the wheel of the Dodge Caravan when it allegedly ran a red light around 3:30 p.m. , police said .
A Chevrolet Uplander smacked into the side of the van and ricocheted off a BMW that was stopped at the intersection .
The baby boy apparently flew out of his mother 's arms and into a window , suffering head injuries and a broken leg , police said .
His three - year - old sister also hit her head , resulting in a severe cut .
The victims ' two - and four - year - old sisters were treated for minor bumps and bruises , as were their parents and three adults in the other vehicles .
The two children who suffered the most severe injuries , the baby boy and his three - year - old sister , were " unrestrained " in their minivan when the accident occurred , according to police .
Police said investigators are trying to determine the cause of the crash .
No charges have been laid .
The crash happened just three days after police kicked off an Ontario - wide campaign to crack down on motorists who do n't wear seatbelts , with a special emphasis on encouraging people to ensure their kids are safe .
Police across Ontario are in the middle of a safety blitz , writing more tickets for people who break the province 's seatbelt laws and holding safety clinics to inform people of the law .
" It 's a really simple philosophy : seatbelts save lives and reduce injuries , " said Sgt. Tim Burrows , of Toronto Police 's Traffic Services Division , who says officers have been finding that most people know the law .
" It 's too bad that ( Saturday 's collision ) had to happen to drive that home . "
Childrens ' car seats seem to be one of the biggest problems , Burrows said .
At previous safety clinics , police have noted that a disturbing 80 per cent of people they 've talked to do n't know how to properly install one .
" The biggest thing we notice is that they 're just not tight enough , " Burrows said , adding that he uses his knee to pull the straps taut when he buckles up his own children .
More than 95 per cent of Ontarians wear seat belts , police say , but they want to push that number higher .
Police estimate that for every percentage point of the driving public who wear seatbelts , some five lives can be saved .
The Ministry of Transportation says that car crashes are the number one cause of death for Canadian children , and that car seats can reduce the risk of serious injury or death by up to 71 per cent .

With files from Thandiwe Vela
Six years ago he walked into my dorm room on the verge of tears .
“ I ca n’t take it anymore ! ” he groaned .
“ I ’m just running in place !
I aim .
I sprint .
I leap .
I fall .
I get nowhere .
Nowhere ! ”
His desperate eyes stared into mine , hoping … searching for an answer .
His Story
He has dreamed of pursuing a career in software engineering since he was a kid .
“ Businesses worldwide will rely on my code someday , ” he used to tell his computer programming teacher in high school .
Now , as a junior enrolled in computer science at a reputable university , he finally has a clear shot at making his dream a reality .
He wakes up every morning filled with excitement and positive intentions .
Studying is actually the first thing that crosses his mind .
“ I ’ve got to get that chapter read , ” he tells himself .
But first he needs to grab some Starbucks and a muffin .
“ Okay , now I ’m ready . ”
He sits down at his desk and cracks open the book Agile Software Development .
The phone rings .
It ’s Jen , a good friend he met in his sophomore English class .
“ Lunch today ?
Yeah , I could do that .
How ’s noon sound ?
Perfect .
See you then . ”
Before he sits back down to read , he remembers that he skipped his workout yesterday .
“ A quick workout will only take forty - five minutes and it will energize my mind for a few hours of diligent studying , ” he thinks to himself .
He puts his sneakers on , grabs his iPod and heads over to the campus gym .
When he returns from the gym , he takes a shower and is once again ready to read .
“ Chapter 1 : Welcome to the power of agile software development .
This book is divided into … ”
“ Ah , crap !
I forgot to email my mother those photos I promised her .
Heck , it will only take a second . ”
He quickly fires - up his laptop and logs into Gmail .
Before he has time to send the email , he gets an IM from an old high school buddy , Danny , whom he has n’t spoken to in six months .
After a forty minute chat session , he sends the email to his mother and returns to the book .
He glances up at the wall clock and realizes he has to leave in thirty minutes to meet Jen for lunch .
“ Gosh , it ’s pointless to get into the groove of a focused study session for just thirty measly minutes , ” he says aloud .
He convinces himself that it ’s in his best interest to save the reading for after lunch .
So he logs into Facebook , replies to a few messages from his friends and then heads off to meet Jen .
Once he returns from lunch an hour and a half later , he feels exhausted .
The post - meal grogginess is kicking in hard .
“ All I need is another round of Starbucks and I ’ll be ready . ”
He hustles out to grab it .
As he sits down at his desk with a fresh cup of coffee he repeats the word “ focus ” over and over as a mantra in his mind .
He cracks the book back open .
“ Chapter 1 : Welcome to the power of agile software development .
This book is divided into … ”
But then his neighbor knocks on his door .
“ Turn on the Local 6 news channel !
The college apartment complex down the street is on fire ! ” his neighbor chants .
He thinks about it for a second , puts the book down and clicks on the television .
“ This should only take a second … ”
And another day comes closer to an end .
Her Story
She gets up early every morning , grabs her soccer ball , and heads outside before she even washes her face , or eats , or pees .
She juggles the ball between her feet nonstop until she achieves a continuous count of fifty .
An old high school coach once told her that Mia Hamm ( the greatest female soccer player ever ) used to do this .
When she ’s done , she gears - up for the day , grabs a glass of milk and a protein bar , and heads off to soccer practice .
Sometimes she catches up with me after practice , just before our 9 A.M. Economics class .
I love it when she does , because her positive attitude is contagious .
Her eyes always radiate with contentment and verve .
In the few minutes before class we usually philosophize about our lives , our ambitions , and our relationships .
For instance , today she said , “ It ’s all about balance .
We ’ve got to somehow mesh our long - term goals with our momentary pleasures . ”
She always explains herself clearly until she ’s confident that I understand her point of view .
Once class starts , she ’s silent , entirely focused on the professor ’s lecture .
Her notes are more diligent than most .
And although she rarely raises her hand , when she does , her question or comment usually brings a respectful smile to the professor ’s face .
Outside of class , I seldom see her during the day .
She locks herself away in her dorm room , or in the library , or on the soccer field .
She reads , writes , learns , and practices .
She conditions her mind and her body with perpetual vigor .
Once or twice a week , when she actually takes a break , she ’ll call me at lunchtime .
She usually goes off on a short tangent about something she ’s recently learned or experienced that excites her .
And she always finishes by saying , “ I ’ll fill you in on the details later . ”
Because she knows I ’m interested in hearing them .
Because she mindfully extracts interesting details from data sources … details that most of us miss .
After a little nourishment , she gets back to work .
Pages turn .
Notes are taken .
Keys on her laptop click repeatedly .
And she carries forth until her vision blurs .
When it does , she gets up , juggles her soccer ball to a count of twenty , and refocuses herself on her work .
Again she forges ahead for another couple of hours until her brain has trouble focusing and her belly aches with hunger .
Then she swings by my dorm room .
It ’s pretty late now , and both of us are done with whatever we ’ve been working on .
So we head out for a bite to eat .
She fills me in on her day and speaks enthusiastically about the things that move her .
Sometimes it ’s something new she learned .
Sometimes it ’s an entrepreneurial idea .
Sometimes it ’s soccer .
Or someone she met on campus .
Or a song she heard on the radio that inspires her .
When we finish eating , she walks back to her dorm room .
She thinks , or reads poetry , or listens to music , or works on the novel she ’s been leisurely writing for the last few months .
When her eyes finally get heavy , she snuggles into her bed and falls blissfully asleep in an instant .
Satisfied with today .
Eager for tomorrow .
The Advice
When he walked into my dorm room that day , I told him about her , and how she lives her life .
And although we do n’t talk as much as we used to , I received an email from him last night .
It was a cheerful email about the software company he started last year .
As it turns out , he just landed his first six - figure contract .
In the P.S. section of the email , he wrote : “ Do you remember that story you told me in college about the girl who played soccer ?
Thank you .
That advice saved my life . ”

The governor of Utah has two problems with a State Senate proposal to scan the IDs of everyone who visits a bar in the state and make that database available to law enforcement officials .
[ efoods ]
For starters , it is an “ Orwellian ” breach of privacy , he said .
And second , it makes his state look kooky .
“ I think that would enhance the oddness of our laws , ” Gov. Jon Huntsman told The Associated Press .
“ I think that for most people that is a rather frightening , almost Orwellian , proposition . ”
Utah already has the strictest alcohol laws in the country , requiring tipplers to become members of any bar they patronize by paying a small fee and filling out a brief application .
Bars in Utah are open to the public , but they ’re still classified as private clubs and only members and sponsored guests may enter .

XNA Tutorials
Welcome to the XNA Tutorials , the largest and easiest to use collection of XNA 4.0 tutorials on the Internet !
There are plenty of other sites out there , but as far as I know they are either much smaller than this , or way out of date , which is a big deal , since so much changed in version 4.0 .
You may also find my MonoGame tutorials of interest .
MonoGame is an open source port of XNA that runs on a very wide variety of programs , and may ultimately have a longer lifespan than XNA .
About These XNA Tutorials
XNA is an extremely powerful and easy to use set of tools for game making , created by Microsoft .
If you are interested in making your own game , XNA is the way to do it , and my tutorials on this website should help you get going .
I have divided these tutorials up into multiple categories .
Each category has a simple flow to it , which will take you from the very beginning and teach you everything you need to know about the topic to get started with your game .
Below is a diagram of the ordering of the tutorials .
Once you are done with a set of tutorials , you should be well prepared to start on anything after it .
1 - C# Crash Course
If you have never done anything with programming , start with this crash course on the basics of programming with C# .
If you already know the basics of programming , feel free to skip this set of tutorials .
Note that this set is still a work in progress .
C# Crash Course
2 - Getting Started
Before you get started , there are a few things you will need to know and do in these four tutorials .
These tutorials explain a little bit about what XNA is , how to install the necessary ( free ) software to use XNA , and how to do some of the basic things in an XNA game .
Once you have been through these few tutorials , you will be able to go on to just about anything that you want , though I recommend going to the 2D tutorials next , and then the 3D tutorials , and pick up the rest of the tutorials as you need them .
Getting Started
3 - 2D Tutorials
These tutorials cover the basics of doing 2D stuff , like drawing text and images , as well as 2D animation , and some fancy effects in 2D .
After you have completed these tutorials , you should be able to make some pretty interesting 2D games with XNA .
2D Tutorials
4 - 3D Tutorials
These tutorials should get you going with a 3D game .
They cover things like drawing models , animation in 3D , and some simple effects , like lighting , and fog .
These tutorials should really get you going on any 3D game .
3D Tutorials
5 - Input Tutorials
No game is complete without getting input from a user .
When you get to the point in your game development where you are ready to get input from the user , take a look at these tutorials .
They cover all sorts of input , including keyboard input , mouse input , and input from an Xbox controller .
Input Tutorials
6 - Audio Tutorials
Adding sound effects and background music to a game really makes the game come alive .
These tutorials will teach you the basics ( and some more advanced stuff ) about playing all types of audio in your game .
When you are ready to add audio to your game , come check out these tutorials .
Audio Tutorials
7 - Publishing Your Game Tutorials
When your game is complete , you will probably want to be able to give it to your friends , or even sell it .
These tutorials will help you get started with the basics of publishing and distributing your game to others .
Publishing Your Game Tutorials
8 - Utility Tutorials
During the time that I have been working on these tutorials and teaching this stuff to students , I have come across a large variety of small random things that people occasionally like to do with their game .
These tutorials are all small , and cover some random aspect of creating XNA games that you may find useful .
At any point in your game development , you might want to check out these tutorials , which cover a broad variety of topics from creating games that run in full screen , to displaying the cursor , to changing the window size .
Utility Tutorials
9 - Content Pipeline Tutorials XNA comes with a feature called the content pipeline , which manages all of your content , like 3D models , audio files , textures , images , and so on .
The content pipeline is extensible , and you can add on anything you want to it , which is pretty nice .
These tutorials cover more detailed information about how the content pipeline works , and how to create extensions for it .
When you want to know more about the content pipeline , or how to extend it , come back to these tutorials .
Content Pipeline Tutorials
10 - Game Math Tutorials
Sometimes games require some fancy math to complete the game .
These tutorials cover some of the more common math related problems that arise while making games .
Game Math Tutorials
11 - Game Physics Tutorials Games can also require an understanding of physics in order to function well .
These tutorials cover some of the more common physics related concepts that may come up while you are making your game , including collision detection .
Game Physics Tutorials
12 - 2D/3D Combination Tutorials
Once you have an understanding of 2D graphics and 3D graphics , you will likely want to combine them together .
These tutorials will show you how to solve some of the problems that arise when you are doing this .
2D/3D Combination Tutorials
13 - Primitives Tutorials
Occasionally , when you are doing stuff with a 3D game , you want to be able to do more than just draw models that have been loaded in .
XNA is built on top of DirectX , and so you have the ability to draw primitives , like lines and triangles ( or lots of triangles to create interesting surfaces ) .
Once you have an understanding of the basic 3D tutorials , try out these tutorials , which will go through the process of drawing with buffer objects , to draw all sorts of primitives .
Primitives Tutorials
14 - Effects & HLSL Tutorials Today 's graphics cards allow you to program them .
The old way , the fixed function pipeline , allows you to only do specific effects while rendering .
But now that you can program the graphics card , the possibilities are limitless .
These tutorials teach you how to program the graphics card using a programming language called HLSL by using effects .
Once you have a good understanding of the basic 3D tutorials , check these tutorials out .
Effects & HLSL Tutorials
15 - Advanced XNA Tutorials
Once you have completed the stuff in the 2D and 3D tutorial categories , you might want to look at this set of tutorials , which discuss some of the more advanced topics in XNA that are n't covered in one of the other categories .
Advanced XNA Tutorials
RB's Game Development Kit
I have also created a list of free software that you can download and use in your game development : RB's Game Development Kit
Need Extra Help ?
I am constantly adding more tutorials to this site , as well as modifying older tutorials to better help you learn and understand XNA .
If there is anything that you think would help you ( missing tutorials , clarification , etc. ) , let me know , or post something in the Forum .
My goal is to help you be able to make the game of your dreams !
Also , if you get stuck on terminology , I have created a glossary of terms that are commonly used in XNA , programming , and game development that might be able to help .
The Future of These Tutorials
Like I 've said , I 'm constantly working on these tutorials .
I have plans for what else to add , but I welcome your suggestions .
Please see the page on my future plans for these tutorials .
In the Keyboard and Mouse section of System Preferences there is a Keyboard shortcuts tab that allows you to assign a keyboard shortcut to any menu item .
This is great , but unfortunately it does n’t work everywhere .
The main loss I notice is being unable to assign keyboard shortcuts to scripts in the scripts menu , which would actually solve the entire problem because you could just create scripts to replicate the functionality of any menu item that does n't want to have a keyboard shortcut .
Luckily you can use Quicksilver to assign keyboard shortcuts to AppleScripts .
( or anything else ) .
Listed below are 10 AppleScripts to perform lots of tasks that are much more convenient to do quickly with a keyboard shortcut .
Quicksilver is probably one of the most versatile applications for Mac OS X so I wo n't try and explain everything it does .
For our purposes , we only need to use the " Triggers " part , which is accessible from the Quicksilver preferences .
If you want to know more about Quicksilver check out the official " What is Quicksilver " , or read through Dan Dickinson 's " QuickSilver - A Better OS X In Just 10 Minutes " .
For each of the AppleScripts below , this is the process you need to go through to assign a keyboard shortcut .
Open up AppleScript Editor ( located in Applications / Utilities ) and paste in the script .
You can test it works by clicking Run .
Save the script in the Scripts folder , located in the Library in your user folder .
Open up the Triggers panel in Quicksilver ( Command - ' when quicksilver is visible ) .
If you do n't already have Quicksilver , you can download it for free from here .
Click the plus (+ ) at the bottom , and choose HotKey from the menu to create a new trigger .
Start typing the name of the script and it should appear in the box .
Alternatively you can just drag it into the box from the Scripts folder .
Click Save .
Assign a keyboard shortcut by double - clicking on the trigger column , and typing the shortcut .
These are just the scripts that I could think of off the top of my head .
If you have any others that work well with a keyboard shortcut please share them in the comments .
1. Turn AirPort on and off
The two separate scripts that you need to use are below .
It 's pretty obvious which is which .
As explained above , paste each one into a script editor and save as " Airport Off " and " AirPort On " in the Scripts folder .
do shell script " networksetup - setairportpower off "
do shell script " networksetup - setairportpower on "
2. Run Time Machine backup now
do shell script " / System/ Library / CoreServices / backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/backupd-helper & “
3. Eject All Disks
To eject all disk images , flash drives , external hard drives , CDs and DVDs ( i.e. everything ) :
tell application " Finder " to eject ( every disk whose ejectable is true )
To ignore CDs and DVDs :
tell application " Finder " to eject ( disks where free space is not 0 )
To ignore large drives ( like a Time Machine backup ) .
This is good to get rid of all the mounted disk images :
tell application " Finder " to eject ( every disk whose ejectable is true and local volume is true and physical size & lt ; 1.0E+9 )
4 . Set colour labels in the Finder
You will need to create one script for each colour , and assign a different keyboard shortcut to each ( or just the colours you use regularly ) .
Command - Option - 1 , Command - Option - 2 etc. might work well .
The script works with multiple files selected too .
tell application " Finder " activate set selected to selection set colour to 2 repeat with n_file in every item in selected set label index of n_file to colour end repeat end tell
Replace the number in the fourth line with one of the following : 0 = No colour 1 = Orange 2 = Red 3 = Yellow 4 = Blue 5 = Purple 6 = Green 7 = Grey
5. Enable / Disable Growl Notifications
This page over at Mac OS X Hints has a great script for toggling Growl notifications on and off .
Really useful for turning them off just before a presentation .
6. Go to Login Window
Quickly switch over to the login window without actually logging out .
Works similarly to a " lock screen " shortcut .
do shell script " '/ System / Library / CoreServices / Menu Extras / User.menu/Contents/Resources /CGSession ' - suspend "
7. Sync with MobileMe
do shell script " / System / Library / PrivateFrameworks /DotMacSyncManager.framework/Versions/A/Resources/dotmacsyncclient sync "
8. Paste as plain text
This script just strips the formatting out of text in the clipboard .
So you use Command - C to copy a load of formatted text , then Control - C ( or whatever ) to strip formatting , then Command - V to finally paste it .
do shell script " pbpaste | pbcopy "
9. Create a short URL
This script creates a short URL of the current page in Safari and copies it to the clipboard .
Then all you need to do is paste into where you want it .
tell application " Safari " set bigURL to the URL in document 1 end tell set tinyURL to ( do shell script " curl --url \ " http://metamark.net/api/rest/simple?long_url= " & bigURL & " \ " " ) set the clipboard to tinyURL
10 .
The built in scripts
Most of the scripts that come with Mac OS X are pretty useless , but some are quite fun .
They are all located in Macintosh HD / Library / Scripts .
Here are the ones to look out for :
The more closely knit an animal society is , and the more interdependent its members , the higher the rate of taxation .
Among bell miner birds of Australia , for example , pairs of breeding adults are assisted at the nest by several youthful helpers , usually male .
The helpers provision the couple ’s fledglings with a steady supply of lerp , sugary casings secreted by plant - sucking insects .
And though some scientists had wondered whether lerp was n’t basically a junk food , offered up to the young bell miners as much for show as for substance , researchers report in the March issue of Animal Behaviour that lerp is , in fact , as important to the fledglings ’ growth as is the meatier arthropod prey supplied by their parents .
By all evidence , the helper birds are honestly “ paying to stay , ” trading a valuable currency for the right to remain within the aggressively guarded precincts of a bell miner breeding colony , with the hope of better times and personal propagation opportunities ahead .
Or at least of averting personal injury .
Among another Australian species of cooperatively breeding birds , the superb fairy - wren , dominant males notice when their helpers are less than superb about paying their taxes .
Should a helper fail to feed and groom the dominant ’s nestlings , or to give an alarm call on seeing intruders enter the territory , the dominant male will angrily chase , harass and peck at the helper , for up to 26 hours at a time .
In the case of the highly social cichlid fish , fear of punishment inspires delinquent helper fish to ostentatiously redouble their contributions to the communal nest , their digging in the sand , their cleaning and fanning of the eggs  rather like politicians who suddenly pony up three years of back taxes for themselves , the nanny and the gardener .
“ If they do n’t pay their bill , there will be punishment , ” said Michael Taborsky of the University of Bern , “ so they try to pre-emptively appease the dominant individuals in the group . ”
If hope and fear do n’t guarantee compliance , there ’s always embarrassment .
Vampire bats are famous for their willingness to regurgitate a blood meal to feed fellow bats that are down on their luck .
In fact , hiding one ’s wealth is a problem .
A fully fed vampire bat is as bloated as a fraternity water balloon , and the bats appear to rub bellies to see who is in a position to share .
“ It ’s hard to cheat when your stomach is obviously distended , ” Dr. Santos said .
It ’s also hard to cheat when you live in a small band of big - brained , sharp - eyed individuals , as humans did for vast stretches of our past , which may help explain why we are so easily taxed .
“ There ’s not a human society in the world that does n’t redistribute food to nonrelatives , ” said Samuel Bowles , director of the behavioral sciences program at the Santa Fe Institute .
“ Whether it ’s through the state , or the chief , or a rural collective , or some other mechanism , food sharing of large nutritional packages is quite extensive and has been going on for at least 100,000 years of human history . ”
In hunting and foraging cultures , the proportional tax rate is so high , said Dr. Bowles , that “ even the Swedes would be impressed . ”
Take the case of the Ache tribe of Paraguay .
Hunters bring their bounty back to a common pot .
“ The majority of calories are redistributed , ” he said .
“ It ends up being something like a 60 percent income tax . ”

Entwurf Wahlprogramm
Hierbei handelte es sich um einen Entwurf für ein EU - Wahlprogramm .
Dieses wurde nie beschlossen , aber zu Dokumentationszwecken sollen hier die Entwurfs - Inhalte festgehalten werden .
Präambel - Frieden und Freiheit in Europa
Im Zuge der Digitalen Revolution aller Lebensbereiche sind trotz aller Lippenbekenntnisse die Würde und die Freiheit des Menschen in bisher ungeahnter Art und Weise gefährdet .
Dies geschieht zudem in einem Tempo , das sowohl die gesellschaftliche Meinungsbildung als auch die staatliche Gesetzgebung ebenso überfordert wie den Einzelnen selbst .
Gleichzeitig schwinden die Möglichkeiten , diesen Prozess mit demokratisch gewonnenen Regeln auf der Ebene eines einzelnen Staates zu gestalten dahin .
Die Globalisierung des Wissens und der Kultur der Menschheit durch Digitalisierung und Vernetzung stellt deren bisherige rechtliche , wirtschaftliche und soziale Rahmenbedingungen ausnahmslos auf den Prüfstand .
Nicht zuletzt die falschen Antworten auf diese Herausforderung leisten einer entstehenden totalen und totalitären , globalen Überwachungsgesellschaft Vorschub .
Die Angst vor internationalem Terrorismus lässt Sicherheit vor Freiheit als wichtigstes
Gut erscheinen – und viele in der Verteidigung der Freiheit fälschlicherweise verstummen .
Informationelle Selbstbestimmung , freier Zugang zu Wissen und Kultur und die Wahrung der Privatsphäre sind die Grundpfeiler der zukünftigen Informationsgesellschaft .
Nur auf ihrer Basis kann eine demokratische , sozial gerechte , freiheitlich selbstbestimmte , globale Ordnung entstehen .
Die Piratenpartei Deutschland versteht sich als Teil einer europäischen und weltweiten Bewegung , die den freien und selbstbestimmten Bürger in den Mittelpunkt politischen Handelns stellt .
Sie steht für ein friedliches Miteinander der Völker in Europa und der Welt .
Wir treten deswegen am Sonntag , den 7 .
Juni 2009 zur Europawahl an , um auf parlamentarischer Ebene für ein demokratisches , bürgernahes Europa zu streiten und um die Menschen - und Bürgerrechte und die kulturelle Vielfalt im Informationszeitalter zu verteidigen .
In unserem Wahlprogramm zeigen wir pragmatische Lösungen und alternative Zukunftsvorstellungen auf .
Demokratisches Europa
EU - Aufbau - Gewaltenteilung und dezentrale Entscheidungen statt maßloser Bürokratie
Die EU muss nach streng demokratischen Grundsätzen aufgebaut sein .
Die Wahlen zu Volksvertretungen müssen allgemein , unmittelbar , gleich , geheim und frei durchgeführt werden .
Das Gleichgewicht der Kräfte muss nach dem bewährten Prinzip der Gewaltenteilung in Exekutive , Legislative und Judikative hergestellt werden und dem Bürger Möglichkeiten der Einflussnahme einräumen .
Entscheidungen , die auf unteren Ebenen gefällt werden können , sollen regional entschieden werden .
Das Prinzip der Subsidiarität muss gestärkt werden .
Die gesetzgeberische Kompetenz der EU muss überprüft und auf sinnvolle Bereiche reduziert werden .
Dazu ist eine Kontrollinstanz notwendig , deren Befugnisse über einfache Empfehlungen hinaus gehen .
Die obersten Richter der europäischen Gerichte sollen auf Lebenszeit durch das Europaparlament gewählt werden .
Da die Verwaltung den rechtsstaatlichen Ansprüchen genügen muss , wird eine oberste Instanz benötigt , die von jeder natürlichen oder juristischen Person angerufen werden kann .
Die Ernennung auf Lebenszeit ist wichtig , damit die Richter von Beeinflussung Dritter unabhängig sind und sich voll Ihrem Amt widmen können .
Die Piratenpartei fordert Bürgereingaben und Volksabstimmungen auf EU - Ebene : Dem Bürger muss Gehör verschafft werden , um die Kluft zwischen Bürger und Verwaltung zu schmälern .
Wir wollen Bürgereingaben ermöglichen , deren Bearbeitung transparent verfolgt werden kann .
EU - Verfassung - EU als freiwillige Kooperation souveräner Staaten
Die Piratenpartei unterstützt den Einigungsprozess zwischen den europäischen Staaten und sieht die europäische Zusammenarbeit als wichtige Grundlage einer soliden wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung und nachhaltigen Friedenspolitik .
Die Institutionen der europäischen Gemeinschaft sollten als Plattform zur Verständigung und Zusammenarbeit zwischen den Staaten dienen und nicht als Macht - und Herrschaftsinstrument über souveräne Regierungen missbraucht werden .
Freiwilligkeit und Einstimmigkeit bei der fortschreitenden Integration sind dabei unverzichtbare Grundsätze , um die Souveränität der Staaten zu erhalten und das Selbstbestimmungsrecht der Völker zu achten .
Die Piratenpartei lehnt daher den Lissabon - Vertrag als aktuellen Entwurf einer Verfassung für die EU ab .
Nur eine Verfassung , die von jedem Volk in einer Abstimmung ausdrücklich angenommen wird , kann eine so grundlegende rechtliche Veränderung rechtfertigen .
Eine Volksabstimmung in nur einem Land legitimiert den Vertrag nicht .
Ein Verfassungsentwurf muss auf wenige Kernbereiche beschränkt sein .
Er muss im Volltext lesbar und klar und allgemein verständlich formuliert sein .
Außerdem muss er in allen Amtssprachen der Mitgliedsstaaten vorliegen .
Da dies für den mehrere hundert Seiten füllenden Lissabon - Vertrag nicht erfüllt ist , lehnt ihn die Piratenpartei auch deswegen ab .
Transparenz des Staatswesens - Lobbyismus aufdecken und Bezüge offenlegen
Dieser Abschnitt beschäftigt sich mit einem Kernthema der Piratenpartei und ist daher von besonderer Bedeutung .
Die politische Arbeit wird in den Nationalstaaten und insbesondere auch auf EU - Ebene stark von Lobbyinteressen gesteuert .
Unternehmensvertreter nehmen unbemerkt Einfluss auf Politiker und arbeiten sogar an Gesetzen mit .
Abhängigkeiten zwischen Unternehmen und Politikern müssen aufgedeckt werden .
EU - Abgeordnete sollen ihre Nebentätigkeiten und die gegebenenfalls daraus resultierenden Einkünfte veröffentlichen .
EU - Abgeordnete der Piratenpartei werden mit gutem Beispiel vorangehen und dies mit dem Einzug ins Parlament offenlegen .
Dem Bürger muss klar ersichtlich sein , welche Interessen hinter Gesetzesinitiativen stecken und wer , wie und wann auf den Gesetzgebungsprozess Einfluss genommen hat .
Da ein Großteil der politischen Entscheidungen durch die Mitglieder der Europäischen Kommission herbeigeführt werden , soll die Offenlegung von Nebentätigkeiten auch für die vorgeschlagenen und gewählten Kommissare Teil ihrer Transparenzverpflichtung werden .
Zu einer transparenten EU gehören neben den Regelungen zu Lobby - und Nebentätigkeiten von Parlamentariern und Kommissaren auch die gelebte Verpflichtung , Entscheidungsfindungsprozesse für den Bürger wahrnehmbar und nachvollziehbar öffentlich zu machen , wie auch Verordnungen , Diskussionspapiere und Vertragswerke so zu gestalten , dass diese so kurz wie nötig , so sprechend wie möglich und für den Bürger verständlich gehalten sind .
Gleichzeitig müssen die Interessen der Bürger besser vertreten werden .
Zudem sollen Nichtregierungsorganisationen gefördert werden , die für die Rechte und Interessen der Bürger eintreten .
Wir lehnen geheime Ausschüsse ab und wollen verhindern , dass erneut Abstimmungen in fachfremden Ausschüssen stattfinden .
Einen Fischereiausschuss , der über Belange der Inneren Sicherheit abstimmt , wird es mit uns nicht geben .
Außerdem dürfen Abstimmungspakete keine Abstimmungen über Fremdthemen enthalten .
So waren zum Beispiel beim Telecom - Paket , bei dem es eigentlich um Verbraucherschutz ging , Abstimmungen zum Thema Urheberrecht versteckt .
Die PIRATEN treten ein , für eine nachvollziehbare und transparente Politik und Verwaltung auf EU - Ebene .
Europaweit einheitlich fordern die europäischen Piratenparteien :
Die EU und Ihre Mitgliedsstaaten sollten sich an die höchsten demokratischen Standards halten .
Deshalb sollten solche Prinzipien wie transparente Staatsführung , schnelle und gerechte Gerichtsverfahren und die Redefreiheit stets beachtet werden .
In diesen Tagen und in dieser Zeit ist es wesentlich , den gesetzlichen Schutz der Bürger vor willkürlichen Staatszugriffen weiterhin durchzusetzen .
Die EU spielt eine wichtige Rolle dabei , Licht in das Dunkel der Verletzung von Bürgerrechten zu bringen .
Eine demokratische Gesellschaft braucht einen transparenten Staat und keine gläsernen Bürger .
Die Bürger müssen die Möglichkeit haben , sich frei und unbeobachtet zu versammeln , und ihre Meinung ohne Furcht vor staatlicher Überwachung ausdrücken zu können .
Um dies in die Informationsgesellschaft zu übertragen , muss das Recht auf anonyme Kommunikation ausgebaut werden .
Deswegen muss das Korrespondenzgeheimnis auf digitale Kommunikation ausgeweitet werden .
Digitales Europa - Chancen der Informationsgesellschaft ergreifen
Dieser Abschnitt beschäftigt sich mit einem Kernthema der Piratenpartei und ist daher von besonderer Bedeutung .
Der Schutz der Privatsphäre und der Datenschutz gewährleisten Würde und Freiheit des Menschen , die freie Meinungsäußerung , demokratische Teilhabe und in der Folge unsere freiheitlich - demokratische Gesellschaftsform , die in der Vergangenheit auch unter Einsatz zahlloser Menschenleben erkämpft und verteidigt wurde .
Jeder einzelne Schritt auf dem Weg zum Überwachungsstaat mag noch so überzeugend begründet sein - doch als Europäer wissen wir aus Erfahrung , wohin dieser Weg führt .
Diesen Entwicklungen stellen wir uns entschieden entgegen und sagen dem Überwachungsstaat den Kampf an .
Das Recht auf Wahrung der Privatsphäre ist ein unabdingbares Fundament einer demokratischen Gesellschaft .
Die Meinungsfreiheit und das Recht auf persönliche Entfaltung sind ohne diese Voraussetzung nicht zu verwirklichen .
Systeme und Methoden , die der Staat gegen seine Bürger einsetzen kann , müssen der ständigen Bewertung und genauen Prüfung durch gewählte Mandatsträger unterliegen .
Wenn die Regierung Bürger beobachtet , ohne dass sie eines Verbrechens verdächtig sind , ist dies eine fundamental inakzeptable Verletzung des Bürgerrechts auf Privatsphäre .
Jedem Bürger muss das Recht auf Anonymität garantiert werden , das unserer Verfassung innewohnt .
Die Weitergabe personenbezogener Daten vom Staat an die Privatwirtschaft hat in jedem Falle zu unterbleiben .
Das Briefgeheimnis soll erweitert werden zu einem generellen Kommunikationsgeheimnis .
Zugriff auf die Kommunikationsmittel oder die Überwachung eines Bürgers darf Ermittlungsbehörden nur im Falle eines begründeten und konkreten Tatverdachtes erlaubt werden , dass dieser Bürger ein Verbrechen plant oder begangen hat .
In jedem Fall ist ein richterlicher Beschluss erforderlich .
In allen anderen Fällen muß der Staat annehmen , seine Bürger seien unschuldig .
Diesem Kommunikationsgeheimnis muss ein starker gesetzlicher Schutz gegeben werden , da Regierungen wiederholt gezeigt haben , dass sie bei sensiblen Informationen nicht vertrauenswürdig sind .
Speziell eine verdachtsunabhängige Vorratsdatenspeicherung von Kommunikationsdaten widerspricht nicht nur der Unschuldsvermutung , sondern auch allen Prinzipien einer freiheitlich demokratischen Gesellschaft .
Der vorherrschende Kontrollwahn stellt eine weitaus ernsthaftere Bedrohung unserer Gesellschaft dar als der internationale Terrorismus und erzeugt ein Klima des Misstrauens und der Angst .
Flächendeckende Videoüberwachung öffentlicher Räume , fragwürdige Rasterfahndungen und zentrale Datenbanken mit unbewiesenen Verdächtigungen sind Mittel , deren Einsatz wir grundsätzlich ablehnen .
Das Recht des Einzelnen , die Nutzung seiner persönlichen Daten zu kontrollieren , muss gestärkt werden .
Dazu müssen insbesondere die Datenschutzbeauftragten völlig unabhängig agieren können .
Neue Methoden wie das Scoring machen es erforderlich , nicht nur die persönlichen Daten kontrollieren zu können , sondern auch die Nutzung aller Daten , die zu einem Urteil über eine Person herangezogen werden können .
Jeder Bürger muss gegenüber den Betreibern zentraler Datenbanken einen durchsetzbaren und wirklich unentgeltlichen Anspruch auf Selbstauskunft , Korrektur , Sperrung oder Löschung der Daten haben .
Ausgenommen davon sind Fälle , in denen ein öffentliches Interesse zur Erfüllung der staatlichen Aufgaben vorliegt .
Erhebung und Nutzung biometrischer Daten und Gentests erfordern aufgrund des hohen Missbrauchspotentials eine besonders kritische Bewertung und Kontrolle von unabhängiger Stelle .
Der Aufbau zentraler Datenbanken mit solchen Daten muss unterbleiben .
Generell müssen die Bestimmungen zum Schutze personenbezogener Daten die Besonderheiten digitaler Daten , wie etwa mögliche Langlebigkeit und schwer kontrollierbare Verbreitung , stärker berücksichtigen .
Gerade weil die Piratenpartei für eine stärkere Befreiung von Information , Kultur und Wissen eintritt , fordern wir Datensparsamkeit , Datenvermeidung und unabhängige Kontrolle von personenbezogenen Daten .
Wenn diese nämlich für wirtschaftliche oder Verwaltungszwecke genutzt werden , können sie die Freiheit und die informationelle Selbstbestimmung des Bürgers unnötig einschränken und den Eindruck der Überwachung hervorrufen .
Urheberrecht
Dieser Abschnitt beschäftigt sich mit einem Kernthema der Piratenpartei und ist daher von besonderer Bedeutung .
Das Urheberecht entfernt sich immer weiter vom Urheber und entwickelt sich hin zum Verwerterrecht .
Musik - und Filmindustrie profitieren , während Nutzer kriminalisiert und Künstler entrechtet werden .
Wir PIRATEN fordern für Privatleute ohne kommerzielle Interessen das Recht , Werke frei verwenden und kopieren zu dürfen .
Der Einsatz von Maßnahmen , wie die DRM - Technologie oder ähnliche Kopierschutzmechanismen , die diese und andere rechtmäßige Nutzungen einseitig verhindern , soll untersagt werden .
Abgeleitete Werke sind neue künstlerische Schöpfungen und müssen dem Kreativen grundsätzlich erlaubt statt verboten sein .
Wir stellen uns gegen eine weitere Ausweitung der Schutzfristen und fordern , dass diese soweit begrenzt werden , dass sie Ihren ursprünglichen Zweck erfüllen , nämlich zusätzliche Anreize für kulturelle Schaffensprozesse zu bieten .
Eine Begrenzung auf einen Zeitraum deutlich unterhalb der Lebenszeit des Urhebers halten wir für geboten .
Angesichts der Tatsache , dass bei der überwiegenden Mehrzahl von Werken der wesentliche Vermarktungsgewinn in den auf die Veröffentlichung folgenden Jahren anfällt , könnte dieser Zeitraum etwa zwischen 5 und 15 Jahren liegen .
Damit fordern wir für Deutschland und Europa einen Ausstieg aus dem TRIPS - Abkommen in dieser Hinsicht .
Die für eine internationale Neuausrichtung des Urheberrechts zu verhandelnden Themen müssen der öffentlichen Debatte gestellt werden und dürfen nicht einseitig durch die Lobbyinteressen der Rechteverwerter geprägt sein .
Wir PIRATEN setzen uns für die Veröffentlichung von Lehrmaterialien unter freien Lizenzen und die bevorzugte Nutzung von freien Lehrmaterialien in der Bildung ein .
Dies beinhaltet die Erstellung von Lehrmaterialien durch Lehrkräfte oder beauftragte Personen unter freien Lizenzen .
Europaweit einheitlich fordern die europäischen Piratenparteien :
Das Copyright steht längst nicht mehr in Verbindung mit der heutigen kulturellen Landschaft .
Es hat sich zu einem Hindernis für die Kreativität , insbesondere für die Quellen der Kreativität entwickelt .
Wir müssen zumindest folgendes am Copyright ändern :
- Copyright ist kommerziell
Copyright regelt nur kommerzielle Aktivitäten ( Die lokale Gesetzgebung definiert " kommerzielle Aktivität " normalerweise ausreichend genau ) .
Nichtkommerzielle Aktivität wird nie durch das Copyright geregelt .
- Ein auf das wesentliche reduzierter Monopolbegriff
Copyright ist ein geschäftlich begrenztes Monopol , welches sich innerhalb einer Generation auflösen sollte .
- Keine Medien - oder Hardwareabgaben
Keine Pauschalabgaben , die für Kopiermöglichkeiten kompensieren , sollten erlaubt sein - aber wir erlauben Regierungsstipendien für Künstler und ähnliches ; diese stellen keine Kompensation dar .
Auf diese Weise wird der Prozess offensichtlich unilateral , und die Copyrightlobby bekommt keinen impliziten Anspruch darauf , zu akzeptieren oder abzulehnen .
- Parlamente schreiben die Copyright - Gesetze , nicht die Lobby
Techn .
Maßnahmen , die verhindern , dass Kunden Kultur im Rahmen des Gesetzes zu nutzen , wie die sog .
DRM - Technologie , sind ungesetzlich .
- Abgeleitete Werke immer erlauben
Anstatt abgeleitete Werke , außer unter unklaren Ausnahmen der normalen Nutzung , zu verbieten , werden unter unserem Copyright abgeleitete Werke immer gestattet sein ( d.h. nicht vom ursprünglichen Copyright betroffen sein ) , mit Ausnahme derer , die durch das Gesetz genau bezeichnet werden ( wie zum Beispiel die " Übersetzung eines Buches " ) .
Patentwesen - Keine Patente auf Leben , Gene , Software und Geschäftsideen
Dieser Abschnitt beschäftigt sich mit einem Kernthema der Piratenpartei und ist daher von besonderer Bedeutung .
Das heutige Patentsystem erfüllt in vielerlei Hinsicht nicht mehr seinen ursprünglichen Zweck , Innovationen zu fördern .
Im Gegenteil :
Es erweist sich immer öfter als Innovationshemmnis und behindert den technischen und ökonomischen Fortschritt in vielen Bereichen .
Wirtschaftlicher Erfolg ist in der Informationsgesellschaft zunehmend nicht mehr von technischen Erfindungen , sondern von Wissen und Information und deren Erschließung abhängig .
Das Bestreben , diese Faktoren nun ebenso mittels des Patentsystems zu regulieren , steht unserer Forderung nach Freiheit des Wissens und Kultur der Menschheit diametral entgegen .
Wir PIRATEN lehnen Patente auf Software und Geschäftsideen ab , weil sie die Entwicklung der Wissensgesellschaft behindern , weil sie gemeine Güter ohne Gegenleistung und ohne Not privatisieren und weil sie kein Erfindungspotential im ursprünglichen Sinne enthalten .
Die gute Entwicklung klein - und mittelständischer IT - Unternehmen in ganz Europa hat beispielsweise gezeigt , dass auf dem Softwaresektor Patente völlig unnötig sind .
Aus den gleichen Gründen dürfen Patente auf das Leben , inklusive der Patente auf Saatgut und Gene , nicht erteilt werden .
Der Privatisierung der Biodiversität oder der Grundlage menschlichen , tierischen und pflanzlichen Lebens ist mit aller Entschiedenheit entgegenzutreten .
Europaweit einheitlich fordern die europäischen Piratenparteien :
Das Patentsystem heute hat die Verbindung zu den ursprünglichen Intentionen verloren und sich zu etwas entwickelt , das Innovationen und ökonomischen Fortschritt in vielen Bereichen schadet .
Pharmazeutische Patente erheben viele ethische Bedenken , nicht zuletzt in Verbindung mit Menschen aus Entwicklungsländern .
Sie sind auch eine treibende Kraft für die steigenden Kosten im öffentlich finanzierten Gesundheitssystem [ in den Mitgliedstaaten ] .
Wir verlangen die Initiierung einer europäischen Studie über den ökonomischen Einfluß pharmazeutischer Patente[ , ] verglichen mit andern Systemen zur Finanzierung med .
Forschung und Alternativen zum gegenwärtigen System .
Patente auf das Leben ( inkl .
Patente auf Saatgut und Genen ) und auf Software sollen nicht erlaubt sein .
Fortschrittliches Europa
Open Access - Öffentliches Wissen teilen
Dieser Abschnitt beschäftigt sich mit einem Kernthema der Piratenpartei und ist daher von besonderer Bedeutung .
Wissenschaft und Forschung sind zentrale Bausteine einer erfolgreichen Europäischen Union .
Heute lassen sich wissenschaftliche Großprojekte oft nur noch im Verbund von mehreren Staaten finanzieren .
Mit öffentlichen Geldern geförderte Arbeit muss aber auch der Öffentlichkeit zugute kommen .
Noch immer sind viele wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse nur gegen Bezahlung erhältlich , und das , obwohl dank moderner Technik die Reproduktion der Werke praktisch kostenlos erfolgen kann .
Dieses Problem ist auch vielen Wissenschaftlern bewusst , die daher zunehmend dazu übergehen Arbeiten als Open - Access - Publikationen zu veröffentlichen und damit einen dauerhaften kostenfreien Zugang zu den Ergebnissen ihrer Forschung sicherzustellen .
Diesen
Trend möchten die PIRATEN unterstützen , da wir glauben , dass ein leichterer Zugang zu Wissen zu erfolgreicherer Forschung und mehr Innovation führen wird .
Open Access heißt daher für uns auf EU - Ebene , dass mit öffentlichen Geldern geförderte wissenschaftliche Arbeit und daraus resultierende Publikationen für jeden Menschen kostenfrei zugänglich sein müssen .
Gleichzeitig muss eine Infrastruktur geschaffen werden , die digitale Archivierung und den dauerhaften einfachen Zugang zu Publikationen ermöglicht .
Diese Aufgabe wird heute vorrangig von den etablierten Verlagen übernommen .
Für Open - Access - Publikationen entwickeln sich entsprechende Mechanismen erst , oft in loser Kooperation von Bibliotheken und Universitäten .
Derartige Initiativen wollen die PIRATEN auch mit EU - Mitteln unterstützen .
Innere Sicherheit - Bürgerrechte gegen Einschränkungen verteidigen
Die Bekämpfung der Kriminalität ist eine wichtige staatliche Aufgabe .
Sie ist nach unserer Überzeugung nur durch eine intelligente , rationale und evidenzbasierte Sicherheitspolitik auf der Grundlage wissenschaftlicher Erkenntnisse zu gewährleisten .
Um sinnvolle Sicherheitsmaßnahmen zu fördern und schädliche Maßnahmen beenden zu können , wollen wir alle bestehenden europäischen Befugnisse und Programme der Sicherheitsbehörden systematisch und nach wissenschaftlichen Kriterien überprüfen auf Wirksamkeit , Kosten , schädliche Nebenwirkungen , auf Alternativen und auf ihre Vereinbarkeit mit den Menschen - und Bürgerrechten .
Wir wollen , dass die Europäische Kommission und der Rat künftig jeden Vorschlag für neue Sicherheitsmaßnahmen noch im Entwurfsstadium von der Europäischen Grundrechteagentur auf diese Kriterien hin begutachten lassen .
Nur durch einen solchen " Gesetzes - TÜV " kann weiteren verfassungswidrigen Angriffen auf unsere Grundrechte frühzeitig entgegen gewirkt werden .
Der Grundrechteagentur müssen dafür alle nötigen finanziellen und personellen Ressourcen zur Verfügung gestellt werden .
Um den fortschreitenden Abbau der Bürgerrechte seit 2001 zu stoppen , fordern wir ein Moratorium für weitere Grundrechtseingriffe im Namen der inneren Sicherheit ein , solange nicht die systematische Überprüfung der bestehenden Befugnisse abgeschlossen ist .
Zur Gewährleistung der Freiheitsrechte und zur Sicherung der Effektivität von Gefahrenabwehr und Strafverfolgung treten wir dafür ein , dass eine staatliche Informationssammlung , Kontrolle und Überwachung künftig nur noch gezielt bei Personen erfolgt , die einer Straftat konkret verdächtigt sind .
Zum Schutz unserer offenen Gesellschaft und im Interesse einer effizienten Sicherheitspolitik wollen wir auf anlasslose , massenhafte , automatisierte Datenerhebungen , Datenabgleichungen und Datenspeicherungen verzichten .
In einem freiheitlichen Europa ist eine derart breite Erfassung beliebiger Personen ohne Anlass und Verdacht inakzeptabel .
Die europäische Sicherheitsforschung aus Steuergeldern wollen wir demokratisieren und an den Bedürfnissen und Rechten der Bürgerinnen und Bürger ausrichten .
In beratenden Gremien wie dem Europäischen Forum für Sicherheitsforschung und Innovation ( ESRIF ) sollen künftig neben Verwaltungs - und Industrievertretern in gleicher Zahl auch Volksvertreter sämtlicher Fraktionen , Kriminologen , Opferverbände und Nichtregierungsorganisationen zum Schutz der Freiheitsrechte und Privatsphäre vertreten sein .
Eine Entscheidung über die Ausschreibung eines Projekts soll erst getroffen werden , wenn eine öffentliche Untersuchung der Europäischen Grundrechtsagentur über die Auswirkungen des jeweiligen Forschungsziels auf unsere Grundrechte ( impact assessment ) vorliegt .
Die Entwicklung von Technologien zur verstärkten Überwachung , Erfassung und Kontrolle von Bürgerinnen und Bürgern lehnen wir ab .
Stattdessen muss die Sicherheitsforschung auf sämtliche Optionen zur Kriminal - und Unglücksverhütung erstreckt werden und eine unabhängige Untersuchung von Wirksamkeit , Kosten , schädlichen Nebenwirkungen und Alternativen zu den einzelnen Vorschlägen zum Gegenstand haben .
Weil auch die gefühlte Sicherheit eine wichtige Voraussetzung für unser Wohlbefinden ist , wollen wir zudem erforschen lassen , wie das öffentliche Sicherheitsbewusstsein gestärkt und wie verzerrten Einschätzungen und Darstellungen der Sicherheitslage entgegen gewirkt werden kann .
Einzelne konkrete Forderungen dazu sind :
Durchsetzung des Folterverbots
Bessere , wirksame Kontrolle von Geheimdiensten und Polizei national und europaweit
Zustimmungspflicht des europäischen Parlaments für Themen der inneren Sicherheit
keine Absenkung der Erfordernisse für den Informationsaustausch zwischen Polizeien der Mitgliedsstaaten , solange kein europaweiter einheitlicher Datenschutz auf hohem Niveau existiert
Einführung einer Informations -/ Auskunftspflicht gegenüber den Betroffenen beim Datenaustausch zwischen Polizeien der EU - Länder
Rücknahme der europäischen Richtlinie zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung
keine Vorratsspeicherung von Flug- , Schiff - und sonstigen Passagierdaten ( PNR : Passenger Name Records )
keine Weitergabe von solchen Passagierdaten an Dritte
kein automatisiertes KFZ - Kennzeichen - Scanning
Einrichtung einer unabhängigen europäischen Datenschutzbehörde mit Sanktions - Recht
keine ' präventive ' Strafverfolgung ( keine Aufhebung der Unschuldsvermutung )
keine Internierungslager ( Gefängnis ohne Aburteilung ) in Europa
auch keine geheimen Internierungslager
auch keine Internierungslager außereuropäischer Staaten auf europäischem Boden
Untersuchungsausschuß zu geheimen EU - Armeen ( Gladio )
Abbau von Echelon - Abhörzentralen auf EU - Boden
Ablehnung von Schengen - SIS -II , teilweise Revision von Schengen - SIS - I – diese europaweiten Datenbanksysteme werden ohne den erforderlichen gesetzlichen Hintergrund aufgebaut unter völliger Mißachtung von Datenschutzbelangen
Stärkung des allgemeinen Informantenschutzes
europaweites Zeugnisverweigerungsrecht
Abschaffung der Beugehaft für Zeugen
Einführung einer ' Poisonous - Tree ' - Doktrin , die ein Beweisverwertungsverbot für auf illegalem Wege beschaffte Informationen darstellt .
- Hiermit soll insbesondere dem massenhaften illegalen Abhören ( etc. ) entgegengewirkt werden .
Einführung einer Miranda - Klausel ( Rechtsaufklärung bei Verhaftung )
Schutz von Ermittlungsdaten vor automatischem Austausch zwischen Polizeien verschiedener Staaten
Eindeutige , gut sichtbare Identifikationsnummern von Polizisten bei Einsätzen zur Identifikation
Verzicht auf Videoüberwachung von öffentlichen Plätzen etc. , Videoüberwachung generell verstärkt ersetzen durch unbewaffnete Polizeistreifen
Ausweitung des Persönlichkeits - Kernbereichs auf elektronische - Medien ( z. B. Mail bei Webmailern , Laptop )
Überprüfung und ggf .
Aufhebung der unter dem Namen ' Anti- Terror - Maßnahme ' eingeführten Regelungen , die seit dem 11.9.2001 installiert wurden
Infrastruktur - Straßen- , Bahn - und Stromnetze offen , neutral und gemeinnützig betreiben
Die Piratenpartei ist der Ansicht , dass jegliche Wettbewerbsverzerrung durch die Beeinflussung von Infrastruktur aufgrund privatwirtschaftlicher Interessen auf Kosten der Gesellschaft vermieden werden muss .
Die Infrastrukturen sind nicht nur die Basis für die Marktwirtschaft , sondern für das generelle Miteinander der Menschen .
Durch dieses zentrale Element des Zusammenlebens entscheidet sich , wer aktiv an der Wirtschaft und dem kulturellem Leben teilhaben kann .
Aus diesem Grund muss für alles , was Infrastrukturen betrifft , Gemeinnützigkeit und Transparenz als Auflage vorgeschrieben sein .
Dies gilt insbesondere für die Betreiber .
Die jeweiligen EU - Staaten sind für Verfügbarkeit und Zuverlässigkeit verantwortlich , um hohe Versorgungssicherheit , Effizienz und Nachhaltigkeit zu garantieren .
Die Zugänge zur jeglicher Infrastruktur müssen sowohl für Produzenten und Anbieter als auch für Nutzer und Konsumenten unlimitiert und barrierefrei sein .
Durch gleiche Zugangsmöglichkeiten wird der freie Wettbewerb zwischen den verschiedenen privaten Anbietern gefördert .
Es ist durch geeignete , öffentlich kontrollierbare und transparente Kontrollinstanzen seitens der einzelnen EU - Staaten dafür
Sorge zu tragen , dass die für Infrastruktur geltenden Regeln eingehalten werden .
In Fällen , in denen diese Kontrollinstanzen versagen und Abhilfe auch nicht durch Auflagen , Verordnungen und Gesetze mit einem verhältnismäßigen und endlichen Aufwand erreicht werden kann , ist diese Infrastruktur zu verstaatlichen .
Straßen- , Schienen - und Stromnetze sowie Wasserwege gelten als natürliche Infrastrukturmonopole .
Der Zugang zu diesen Teilen der Infrastruktur ist für unsere Gesellschaft überlebenswichtig , gleichzeitig sind sie durch ihre Singularität extrem anfällig für Wettbewerbsverzerrung .
Nur wenn der Staat , als einzig öffentlich kontrollierbare Instanz , der Betreiber solcher Netze ist , kann sichergestellt werden , dass die von uns geforderten Ansprüche erfüllt werden .
Militär - Armeen zur Verteidigung der Staaten
Die Aufgabe des Militärs ist die Landesverteidigung .
Auslandseinsätze können nur akzeptiert werden , wenn sie durch ein UN - Mandat gedeckt sind .
Die Erweiterungen des Aufgabenspektrums auf Auslandseinsätze , zum Teil auch ohne UN - Mandat , hat dazu geführt , dass die Bundeswehr auch in Angriffskriegen eingesetzt wurde .
Die Piratenpartei sieht darin auch eine der Ursachen für Terrorismus weltweit .
Jeder EU - Nationalstaat innerhalb der europäischen Gemeinschaft ist für die äußere Sicherheit der Gemeinschaft verantwortlich .
Größe , Beschaffenheit und Ausrüstung der Streitmacht die der Nationalstaat bereithält , liegt in dessen Ermessen .
Es ist deshalb nicht erforderlich , eine Streitmacht unter EU - Befehl aufzustellen , oder Teile der nationalen Streitkräfte unter EU - Befehlsgewalt zu stellen .
Die Soldaten stehen in der Verpflichtung gegenüber ihrem Land , entsprechend hat auch das jeweilige Land die Verantwortung über Ihren Einsatz .
Eine Übergabe dieser Verantwortung an die EU lehnt die Piratenpartei ab .
Bestrebungen , das Militär in Polizeifunktionen einzusetzen , müssen verhindert werden .
Das gilt insbesondere auch für den Einsatz von Militär in anderen EU - Mitgliedsländern im EU - Inneren , wie es der Vertrag von Lissabon ermöglichen würde .
Der Einsatz von Massenvernichtungswaffen ist zu ächten .
Darunter fällt auch der Einsatz von " panzerbrechender " Munition aus abgereichertem Uran , die die Bevölkerung in den Kampfgebieten auf lange Zeit radioaktiv belasten .
Die Abrüstung von Atomwaffen muss international wieder aufgenommen und konsequent eingefordert werden .
Umweltschutz
Nachhaltige , dezentrale Energieversorgung
Die Piratenpartei setzt sich für eine Energiewende zu einer nachhaltigen , dezentralen Energieversorgung ein .
Eine nachhaltige Energieversorgung ist weder mit fossilen Brennstoffen noch mit Kernenergie aus Kernspaltung möglich .
Dementsprechend setzt sich die Piratenpartei für eine Versorgung mit vorwiegend regenerativen Energien ein .
Um den Übergang zu regenerativen Energien zu beschleunigen will die Piratenpartei Forschung im Bereich regenerativer Energien sowie den Bau von entsprechenden Anlagen mit EU - Mitteln fördern .
Dabei sollen dezentrale Ansätze bevorzugt behandelt werden , da wir Monopolstrukturen , wie sie zur Zeit bei Energieerzeugern üblich sind , abbauen möchten .
Außerdem bietet eine dezentrale Versorgung noch weitere Vorteile , wie Ausfallsicherheit und höhere Effizienz durch Nutzung der Abwärme zum Heizen .
Eine lückenlose Versorgung durch regenerative Energien ist sehr viel einfacher und wirtschaftlicher sicherzustellen , wenn Europa zusammenarbeitet .
Durch die verschiedenen klimatischen und geologischen Gegebenheiten sind in verschiedenen europäischen Staaten verschiedene regenerative Energieformen nutzbar .
Die verschiedenen Energieformen sind verschiedenen Schwankungen im Tages - und Jahresverlauf unterworfen .
Durch ein gemeinsames europäisches Hochspannungs - Gleichstromnetz könnten diese Schwankungen mit höchster Effizienz ausgeglichen werden und somit die Energieversorgung effizienter gestaltet werden .
Derartige Projekte unterstützt die Piratenpartei daher explizit .
Auch bei der Nutzung regenerativer Energien werden Resourcen verbraucht , wenn auch in einem sehr viel geringeren Maße , als bei konventionellen Kraftwerken .
Doch auch dieser Resourcenverbrauch verringert die Nachhaltigkeit , Forschung , die dazu führt , diesen zu verringern , soll deshalb ebenfalls gefördert werden .
Je weniger Energie verbraucht wird , desto weniger Resourcen müssen auch zur Energiegewinnung aufgebracht werden .
Einsparmöglichkeiten gibt es viele .
Je mehr davon umgesetzt werden , ohne die Lebensqualität zu verringern , desto besser .
Die Piratenpartei setzt sich dafür ein , dass die EU derartige Maßnahmen fördert , sowie Forschungen in diese Richtung unterstützt .
Beispiele sind unter anderem : Wärmedämmung von Gebäuden , intelligente Steuerung des Energieeinsatzes , Stärkung des öffentlichen Nah - und Fernverkehrs , Stärkung des Schienenverkehrs , aber auch die Förderung von Hybrid - und Elektrofahrzeugen .
Kernforschung ja , Kernspaltung nein
Die Piratenpartei setzt sich für einen Ausstieg aus der Atomkraft ein .
Dafür gibt es viele Gründe , die wichtigsten sind die ungeklärte Frage der Endlagerung , das geringe Rohstoffvorkommen sowie die Möglichkeit die Technik für militärische Zwecke zu missbrauchen .
Natürlich muss die Forschung im Bereich der Endlagerung fortgesetzt werden , da bereits entstandene Abfälle sicher gelagert werden müssen .
Diese Forschung sollte aufgrund des großen öffentlichen Interesses auch öffentlich gefördert werden .
Außerdem müssen die Kosten der Atomkraft realistischer bewertet werden , es darf nicht sein , dass die Gesellschaft Kosten für Transporte und Sicherheit abfängt und somit Atomstrom subventioniert .
Gleichzeitig bietet die Kerntechnik , insbesondere die Kernfusion , aber interessante Chancen und Perspektiven um zukunftsfähige Energielösungen zu entwickeln .
Deshalb soll die Forschung im Bereich Kernenergie fortgeführt werden .
Gentechnik - Für verantwortungsvolle Forschung , gegen Genpatente
Die grüne Gentechnik kann in Zukunft neue Möglichkeiten in der Landwirtschaft eröffnen .
Sie birgt jedoch , wie jede Technologie , auch Gefahren für Mensch und Umwelt .
Um Chancen nutzen zu können und Risiken verantwortungsvoll abschätzen zu können ist die wissenschaftliche Forschung unerlässlich .
Unter diesem Gesichtspunkt , und unter der Betrachtung der Forschungsfreiheit , setzt sich die Piratenpartei für eine sichere und verantwortungsbewusste Erforschung der grünen Gentechnologie .
Gleichzeitig ist die Piratenpartei gegen Patente auf Lebewesen und Gene .
Dies betrifft auch Gene auf Saatgut und die daraus resultierenden monopolartigen Strukturen auf dem Wirtschaftssektor der Biotechnologie .
Dies bedeutet insbesondere , dass Patente auf Lebewesen nicht mehr erteilt werden dürfen und bereits erteilte Patente dieser
Art für nichtig erklärt werden .
Damit der selbstbestimmte Bürger frei entscheiden kann , ob er gentechnisch veränderte Lebensmittel zu sich nehmen möchte , müssen Lebensmittel , die entsprechende Bestandteile enthalten , eindeutig und unmissverständlich gekennzeichnet werden .
Dies betrifft auch Lebensmittel , die nur indirekt auf gentechnische Erzeugnisse zurückgehen , wie z.B. Fleisch von Tieren mit gentechnisch verändertem Futter .
Verkehr - Verkehrsmittel richtig einsetzen
Der Verkehr als ein wichtiger Energie - Verbraucher kann wesentliche Beiträge zum Umweltschutz leisten , indem er effizienter gestaltet wird .
Einen Beitrag dazu leistet die Besteuerung von Flugtreibstoffen .
Dadurch entfällt ein künstlicher Wettbewerbsvorteil des Flugverkehrs , so dass der tatsächliche Ressourcenverbrauch vergleichbar zu den konkurrierenden Verkehrsmitteln im Preis abgebildet wird .
Ein wichtiger Beitrag zum Umweltschutz soll auch durch eine bessere Nutzung des öffentlichen Nah - und Fernverkehrs gebracht werden : Die Piratenpartei will den öffentlichen Personennah - und - fernvehrkehr fördern , damit er gegenüber dem Individualverkehr auch für jeden einzelnen attraktiver wird .
Gefördert werden soll dazu der Wettbewerb verschiedener Bahngesellschaften auf dem Schienennetz - das Schienennetz selbst muss in öffentlicher Hand verbleiben .
Im Öffentlichen Nahverkehr fordert die Piratenpartei Modelle , die die kostenlose Nutzung der Verkehrsmittel ermöglichen .
Dies dient nicht nur dem Umweltschutz sondern auch der sozialen Gerechtigkeit , da Mobilität ein wichtiges Grundbedürfnis des Menschen ist .
Außerdem dient es der Anhebung der Attraktivität und Erreichbarkeit der Innenstädte , die in den letzten Jahren einen immer höheren Leerstand der Geschäfte des Einzelhandels erlebt haben .
Weiterhin kann der Einsatz von Informationssystemen im Verkehr noch erheblich dessen Effizienz steigern .
Hier sollten Mitfahrgelegenheiten und Car-Sharing Konzepte für eine bessere Auslastung der einzelnen Fahrzeuge genutzt werden .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama told Americans on Sunday a substantial number of the 140,000 U.S. troops in Iraq would be home within a year , saying Iraqis were now ready to take more responsibility for their own security .
Obama , who inherited two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , pledged during his presidential campaign to withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq within 16 months , at a rate of one or two brigades a month .
In an interview with NBC television , Obama praised the provincial elections held in Iraq at the weekend , the most peaceful polls since U.S. - led forces invaded in 2003 to topple Saddam Hussein .
Asked in the NBC interview whether a substantial number of troops would be home in time for next year ’s Super Bowl , the National Football League ’s championship game being played on Sunday , Obama replied : “ Yes .
We are going to roll out in a very formal fashion what our intentions are in Iraq as well as Afghanistan . ”
The Obama administration has launched a comprehensive review of America ’s strategy in Afghanistan , where NATO - led forces are struggling to cope with spiraling violence and a resurgent Taliban militancy .
The administration is considering almost doubling the U.S. force in Afghanistan from 36,000 to more than 60,000 within 18 months .
Obama , who held talks with the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon last week , has said he wants a responsible and phased withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq .
The United States signed a military deal with Iraq last year that set a 2011 deadline for U.S. forces to quit the country .
“ In conversations I have had with the joint chiefs , with commanders on the ground , I think we have a sense , now that the Iraqis just had a very significant election with no significant violence , we are in a position to put more responsibility on the Iraqis , ” Obama said in the interview .
He also said one of the more sobering moments of his young presidency was having to sign letters to send to families of slain soldiers .
Some 644 U.S. soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan and 4,236 in Iraq .
The letter was supposed to guarantee Wallace safe passage A letter carried by William Wallace when he was captured by English forces in 1305 should be returned to Scotland , a Nationalist MSP has claimed .
The document , known as the Safe Conduct , was written by the King of France and was supposed to guarantee Wallace safe passage to visit the Pope .
It is currently held at the National Archives in Surrey .
South of Scotland MSP Christine Grahame said it should be in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh .
The Safe Conduct was in Wallace 's possession when he was captured in Robroyston in 1305 - eight years after he had led a Scottish army to victory against English forces at the Battle of Stirling Bridge .
It was written by King Philip IV of France and has been held in England since Wallace was hanged , drawn and quartered on 23 August 1305 after being found guilty of treason .
It is currently kept at the National Archives in Surrey .
In the year of homecoming it would be fitting to see this document finally returned to Scotland
Christine Grahame MSP
Ms Grahame has lodged a parliamentary motion calling for the return of the letter , and also lodged a parliamentary question asking if Scottish ministers will make a formal request to have it returned .
" This is a very significant historical document related to Scotland 's most iconic and lasting national hero , " she said .
" In the year of homecoming it would be fitting to see this document finally returned to Scotland .
" There are very few artefacts around today that we know for certain Wallace handled and held in his possession . "
Ms Grahame said it would be " entirely inappropriate that it should languish , forgotten in some closed drawer in Surrey and urge the UK National Archive to pass it to the National Museum of Scotland where it can be properly displayed . "
She claimed the document will be " an inspirational boost " for Scots to return for the Homecoming celebrations .
Tory deputy leader Murdo Fraser last year called for the only surviving document issued by Wallace to be returned to Scotland .
The Lubeck Letter was sent by Wallace and Andrew Murray in 1297 to notify the merchants of the German city of Hamburg that Scottish ports were open again for trade .
The letter is held in Lubeck .

Photo Gallery 90 Years of Bauhaus
The Bauhaus is still a legend 90 years after its foundation .
The school that created the image of the modern age all began when a young architect , Walter Gropius , set out to not only shape products for the future but to create a more just society .
It 's been nearly nine years since Lars Ulrich became one of the most vocal opponents of Napster and the generation of file - sharers it spawned .
Not one to speak about something he has no experience of , Ulrich has just admitted downloading his own album , Death Magnetic , and it was " bizarre " .
In April 2000 , Lars Ulrich launched his vocal campaign against file - sharing service Napster .
After discovering that Metallica ’s entire back catalogue could be found on the service he could hardly contain his anger and by July 2000 he was testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Of course , Napster was dead and buried a long time ago but thanks in part to Ulrich , the destruction of the service led to the creation of many others , most of which carry the entire back catalogue of Metallica to this day – along with that of every other band in the world with a respectable following .
So , when Metallica ’s latest album ‘ Death Magnetic ’ hit the file - sharing networks last year , it seemed like business as usual when the band ’s label , Universal , canceled an interview with a Swedish newspaper after their reviewer admitted he got his copy from The Pirate Bay .
However , the once vehemently anti-p2p Ulrich came out with a softened stance .
“ If this thing leaks all over the world today or tomorrow , happy days , ” he said .
“ It ’s 2008 and it ’s part of how it is these days . ”
Now , just a few months later , Ulrich has admitted that following years of aggression against file - sharing , he has actually just tried it out for himself .
In an intervew with Eddie Trunk of VH1 ’s “ That Metal Show ” , Ulrich admits that last year he ‘ pirated ’ his own album after it leaked onto the Internet .
“ I sat there myself and downloaded ‘ Death Magnetic ’ from the Internet just to try it , ” he said .
“ I was like , ‘ Wow , this is how it works . ’
I figured if there is anybody that has a right to download ‘ Death Magnetic ’ for free , it ’s me . ”
Ulrich went on to say that he and half a dozen friends were enjoying a bottle of wine at his house and used a file - sharing client ( the name of which eluded him ) to download the album .
“ We found it – this was like two or three days after it leaked .
I was like , ‘ You know what ?
I ’ve gotta try this . ’
So we sat there and thirty minutes later I had ‘ Death Magnetic ’ in my computer .
It was kind of bizarre . ”
Welcome to the 21st century , Lars – although the same ‘ bizarre ’ stuff went on in the last century too .
A case of North American Human Influenza A ( H1N1 ) – swine flu – in a University of Notre Dame student was confirmed Tuesday ( April 28 ) by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .
The student has fully recovered and is in good health after suffering flu symptoms and becoming ill last week .
The student sought treatment April 22 at the University ’s student health center in Saint Liam Hall .
As a part of the center ’s standard protocol , a culture sample was taken from the student and sent to the Indiana State Department of Health in Indianapolis for analysis .
The University was informed on April 24 that the sample was atypical for Influenza A , which could indicate that it was swine flu .
The culture was then sent to the CDC in Atlanta for confirmation .
The University and the health department were in constant communication until confirmation was determined today .
After receiving confirmation of the positive test result , staff and medical personnel in University Health Services followed CDC protocol by contacting and interviewing the affected student .
Health services staff members are collaborating with local and state public health officials to identify the student ’s close contacts .
University Health Services physicians cannot identify at this time where the transmission to the student occurred .
According to the CDC , this new flu strain has symptoms in humans similar to those of seasonal flu , including fever , sore throat , cough , chills , headache and body aches .
About 65 cases have been reported in the United States and all have been mild or the patients have recovered , the CDC reported .
Health experts say young , healthy adults , such as the student population at Notre Dame , are at low risk for severe complications .
University Health Services officials said they are not aware of any active swine flu cases on campus .
Students who experience flu symptoms such as sudden onset of fever above 100 degrees , cough or sore throat should come to University Health Services for evaluation .
Faculty and staff should consult their personal physicians .
Notre Dame ’s University Health Services is a formal participant in the CDC surveillance program for identifying strains of influenza , and works in collaboration with local and federal health organizations in this regard on a routine basis .
University classes and final exams will continue as scheduled .
Information on swine flu is available on the University Health Services Web site at http://uhs.nd.edu/ and from the CDC at http://www.cdc.gov/swineflu.
Health officials recommend following these precautions to limit the spread of flu :
Wash hands frequently with soap and water , especially after you cough or sneeze .
Alcohol - based cleaners are also effective .
Contain coughs and sneezes with tissues , or use a shoulder or crook of the elbow .
Throw the tissue in the trash after use , and wash hands .
Avoid touching eyes , nose or mouth .
Germs spread that way .
Try to avoid close contact with sick people .
Use sanitizing or disinfecting agents often on frequently touched surfaces .
Avoid close contact with others and their secretions .
This means the usual handshakes , hugs and kisses , and sharing drinking glasses , food and utensils should be avoided .
Microsoft said it expected another tricky quarter .
Microsoft has said sales in the first three months of 2009 fell 6 % from the previous year - its first quarterly drop in 23 years as a public company .
The world 's largest software maker said profit dropped by 32 % to $ 2.98 bn ( £ 2 bn ) .
Sales slipped to $ 13.65 bn .
Microsoft makes most of its profit selling the Windows operating system and business software such as Office .
However demand has been hit by falling sales of personal computers as consumers and businesses trim spending .
Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer told the BBC World Service that its results had been " impacted " by the downturn in the world economy .
He also admitted the company would have had less total sales " than we would have had before the downturn " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" We expect the weakness to continue through at least the next quarter , " said the firm 's chief financial officer , Chris Liddell .
Microsoft - which became a public company in 1986 - has been looking at ways of cutting costs .
In January , it said it would cut up to 5,000 jobs over the next 18 months , including 1,400 immediately .
' Controlling costs '
Microsoft 's fall in profit was more severe than analysts had been expecting .
" There 's stuff to be happy with - they 're controlling costs and getting that under control , " said Kim Caughey , a senior analyst with Fort Pitt Capital .
The bad thing is demand and consumer preference seems to have affected their top line
Kim Caughey , Fort Pitt Capital
" The bad thing is demand and consumer preference seems to have affected their top line . "
Shares in Microsoft rose by 4 % in after - hours trading - possibly reassured by comments from the firm that it was on track to release the next version of its operating system , Windows 7 , during its 2010 financial year .

" What is the best super soaker ever " is the kind of ambiguous question that you will never get everybody to agree on .
As has been said , the most powerful one is the CPS 2000 mk .1 .
However , it 's not great in the field because of its low shot time and number of pumps .
The CPS 2500 is better in that respect due to its choice of nozzles .
The CPS 3000/3200 , on the other hand , having a backpack is very good on water capacity , so they are good if mobility is n't a massive issue .
If you want intimidation , the Monster XL has to be your choice .
For an all - round powerful gun , go for the CPS 1500 / 1700 .
Size - to - power ratio is very good .
And if you want an air pressure rifle ... go for the XP 150 , though the XP 310 / Max - D 6000 is n't bad either .
As I say though , people 's opinions will always differ .
Libertarians say Republicans have hijacked tea party movement David Edwards and John Byrne
Published : Wednesday April 15 , 2009

As conservatives coalesce in nationwide protests against rising taxes , government spending and what they call the " bailout mentality " of President Barack Obama 's Administration , the ship appears to have sprung a leak .
Speaking on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow show Tuesday evening , Rep. Ron Paul 's ( R - TX ) media coordinator Steve Gordon decried what he characterized as an attempt by mainstream conservative Republicans to hijack a long - cherished libertarian cause .
Paul was a longshot candidate for the Republican presidential nomination last year .
Gordon brought Maddow a gift of Southern tea bags -- using them as a metaphor for what he said was a Southern version of conservatism , sweetened by taxes and deficit spending .
Gordon singled out former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich , a Georgia native , and Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee .
" Newt Gingrich is a good example , " Gordon said .
" He could be one of these two tea bags because he likes his tea bags sweetened with TARP [ Troubled Asset Relief Program ] funding .
This other one could be Mike Huckabee , ' Tax Hike Mike ' because he likes his tea bag sweetened with tax increases .
So you see we 've got a bunch of republican , senior Republican officials in the deep south who can't tell if their tea bags are swinging from the left or the right . "
Last year , supporters of Paul 's presidential campaign tried to fly a blimp to Boston , where they planned to dump tea in the Boston harbor .
The media coordinator for the Texas Republican says that Republicans have " co-opted " their message .
" Newt Gingrich of all people should not be involved in any movement to decrease deficit spending , " Gordon quipped .
Gordon spoke about a specific Alabama protest event where the conservative 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) Freedom Works tried to set up a rally in Birmingham where " nobody showed up , " but said that his own rally was more successful .
" It 's important the people at the grassroots level stick to our guns and say no when they try to co-opt our message , " Gordon said .
Gordon told The Washington Independent Tuesday , " Bringing in someone like Gingrich takes away from the message .
Newt Gingrich enabled George W. Bush , he enabled the big spending , he lobbied conservative Republicans to compromise their principles and support Medicare Part D. "

Facebook is about to make more user data available to outside websites .
It 's an attempt to promote third - party applications , but will inevitably bring attention back to the firm 's privacy policies .
The Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) says speculates that the Facebook plans will be announced later today .
The changes would mean companies could access and use data uploaded by users such as photographs , comments , blog - style note posts and videos .
( Source : wsj.com )
Developers to Spawn External Sites from User Content
Developers could then use the data to create an external website .
For example , a photo sharing website would be able to allow a user to have access to their Facebook photos and those from another service such as Flickr , in a single portfolio .
At the moment , Facebook user data is only available for developers making applications which appear on the Facebook site itself .
It appears Facebook is making the changes to keep up with rival services such as Twitter which already allow outside sites and tools to use its data , such as Microsoft 's site which lists the latest posts from major business executives .
As part of the changes , Facebook will alter the technical barriers on the way developers can access the information .
At the moment they must use a special system controlled by Facebook , but in the future they will likely be able to use an open system which is more easily compatible .
Implications and Privacy Rights
The WSJ report says users would have to give their permission to allow companies to access their information , and that their existing privacy settings will cover the new services .
Thanks to recent public relations problems , including a rash of worm viruses on user accounts and an unsuccessful change to terms of service policy that would have given Facebook permanent rights to use uploaded photos and posts even after users cancel their accounts , it will be vital for Facebook to clearly communicate how user privacy will be protected when third parties get the increased access .

Why People Hate the Paperclip : Labels , Appearance , Behavior , and Social Responses to User Interface Agents Luke Swartz
Honors Thesis for Symbolic Systems Program , Stanford University
Professor Clifford Nass , Advisor
Abstract :
User interface agents are increasingly used in software products ; perhaps the best - known user interface agent is the Microsoft Office Assistant ( " Clippy the Paperclip " ) .
This thesis explores why many people have a negative response to the Office Assistant , using a combination of theoretical , qualitative , and quantitative studies .
Among the findings were that labels -- whether internal cognitive labels or explicit system - provided labels -- of user interface agents can influence users ' perceptions of those agents .
Similarly , specific agent appearance ( for example , whether the agent is depicted as a character or not ) and behavior ( for example , if it obeys standards of social etiquette , or if it tells jokes ) can affect users ' responses , especially in interaction with labels .

( AP Photo / Denis Poroy ) PR rep / spokesperson for the Miss California pageant , Roger Neal , denies that contest officials told Carrie Prejean , the current Ms. Cali , to publicly apologize for the statement she made in which she opposed same - sex marriage during the Miss USA pageant .
Neal says that her claims are lies and that contest officials only urged her to use the national exposure to " heal some wounds " and reaffirm that she did not mean to offend anyone .
He says , " She chose to stand up in church ( the Rock Church in San Diego ) and in front of the media and say something that was a lie , " Neal said .
" No one ever said , ' You must apologize to the gay community , ' and no one ever said , ' Do n't talk about your faith or your religion . '
Those two things never came out of anybody 's mouth . "
Los Angeles talent agent and gay activist , Keith Lewis , who runs the Miss California pageant , has expressed concern about Prejean 's ability to carry out her duties during the remainder of her reign .
He says , " Given the fact that Carrie Prejean 's first act upon returning to California was to headline five services at a church that promotes homosexuality as both unnatural and abnormal , we stand by our concern for her individual image and look forward to a time in the near future when she can put down her personal agenda . "
Below is a video of Miss California 's appearance this morning on the Today Show .
Journalists follow Japanese Defence Minister Yasukazu Hamada upon his arrival to meet Prime Minister Taro Aso at Aso 's official residence in Tokyo Sunday just after a rocket was launched from North Korea .
Enlarge By Issei Kato , Reuters Japan Ground Self - Defense
Force soldiers react following North Korea 's launch of a long - range rocket on Sunday that passed over Japan , the government in Tokyo said , defying calls from world leaders to scrap a plan that has caused international alarm .
N. Korea defiantly launches rocket over Pacific SEOUL ( AP )  North Korea defiantly carried out a provocative rocket launch Sunday that the U.S. , Japan and other nations suspect was a cover for a test of its long - range missile technology .
Liftoff took place at 11:30 a.m. Sunday from the coastal Musudan - ri launch pad in northeastern North Korea , the South Korean and U.S. governments said .
The multistage rocket hurtled toward the Pacific , reaching Japanese airspace within seven minutes , but no debris appeared to hit its territory , officials in Tokyo said .
The U.N. Security Council approved an emergency session for Sunday afternoon in New York , following a request from Japan that came minutes after the launch .
The South Koreans called it " reckless , " the Americans " provocative , " and Japan said it strongly protested the launch .
The launch was a bold act of defiance against President Barack Obama , Japanese leader Taro Aso , Hu Jintao of China and others who pressed Pyongyang in the days leading up to liftoff to call off a launch they said would threaten peace and stability in Northeast Asia .
South Korea 's presidential Blue House said the launch poses a " serious threat " to stability on the Korean peninsula and that it would respond to the provocation " sternly and resolutely . "
President Lee Myung - bak ordered the military to remain on alert , the Blue House said .
" We cannot contain our disappointment and regret over North Korea 's reckless act , " presidential spokesman Lee Dong - kwan told reporters Sunday .
He said the launch of the long - range rocket " poses a serious threat to security on the Korean peninsula and the world . "
North Korea claims its aim is to send an experimental communications satellite into orbit in a peaceful bid to develop its space program .
The U.S. , South Korea , Japan and others suspect the launch is a guise for testing the regime 's long - range missile technology — one step toward eventually mounting a nuclear weapon on a missile capable of reaching Alaska and beyond .
They contend the launch violates a 2006 resolution barring the regime from ballistic missile activity .
Obama said Friday the launch would be a " provocative " move with consequences .
State Department spokesman Fred Lash said late Saturday in Washington that the U.S. will " take appropriate steps to let North Korea know that it cannot threaten the safety and security of other countries with impunity . "
He called the launch a clear violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1718 , adopted five days after North Korea carried out a nuclear weapons test in 2006 .
Japan's U.N. mission has asked for a meeting of the 15 - nation council Sunday , spokesman Yutaka Arima said .
Mexico 's mission to the United Nations set the meeting for 3 p.m. ET , spokesman Marco Morales said .
Mexico holds the 15 - nation council 's presidency this month .
U.N. diplomats already have begun discussing ways to affirm existing sanctions on North Korea against its nuclear program and long - range missile tests .
In Japan , chief Cabinet spokesman Takeo Kawamura said it was not immediately clear if the rocket was mounted with a satellite as North Korea has claimed .
North Korea calls its " space launch vehicle " Unha - 2 , but the rocket is better known to the outside world as the Taepodong - 2 , a long - range missile that can be mounted with a satellite or nuclear armament .
" Even if a satellite was launched , we see this as a ballistic missile test and we think this matter should be taken to the United Nations Security Council , " Kawamura said .
" We are highly concerned by this matter . "
" We strongly protest this launch , " he said .
The first stage of the rocket dropped about 175 miles off the western coast of Akita into the waters between Japan and the Korean peninsula .
The second stage was to land in the Pacific at a spot about 790 miles off Japan 's northeastern coast , a Defense Ministry spokeswoman said in Tokyo .
Japan said it would convene a security panel meeting later in the day to discuss what further measures can be taken .
Kawamura said Japan would work closely with Washington and with the U.N.
" Our primary concern is to confirm safety and gather information , " Aso told a news conference at his Tokyo office Sunday .
North Korea shocked Japan in 1998 when it launched a missile over Japan 's main island .
Japan has since spent billions of dollars on developing a missile shield with the United States and has launched a series of spy satellites primarily to watch developments in North Korea .
Japan had threatened to shoot down any debris from the rocket if the launch went wrong , and positioned batteries of interceptor missiles on its coast and radar - equipped ships off its northern seas to monitor the launch .
No attempt at interception was made since no debris fell onto its territory , a ministry spokeswoman said , speaking on condition of anonymity , citing department rules .

Master Cpl. Scott Francis Vernelli , Cpl. Tyler Crooks , Trooper Jack Bouthillier and Trooper Corey Joseph Hayes were killed Friday in two roadside bomb blasts in Kandahar province .
Eight Canadian soldiers were also wounded .
( ( Department of National Defence ) )
Four Canadian soldiers were killed and eight others wounded in two separate roadside bomb blasts outside Kandahar city on Friday , military officials said .
Master Cpl. Scott Vernelli and Cpl. Tyler Crooks — both of November Company , 3rd Battalion , Royal Canadian Regiment — died when an improvised explosive device exploded near their patrol in the Zhari district , about 40 kilometres west of Kandahar .
The incident happened about 6:45 a.m. local time , Brig. - Gen. Jonathan Vance said during a news conference in Kandahar .
One Afghan interpreter was killed and another injured in the attack .
Trooper Jack Bouthillier and Trooper Corey Joseph Hayes , both of the Royal Canadian Dragoons , were killed when their vehicle struck a roadside bomb around 8:45 a.m. local time in the Shah Wali Kot district .
That region is about 20 km northwest of the city and has seen an increase in Taliban activity .
All the soldiers who died were based in Canadian Forces Base Petawawa .
All of the injured soldiers are in stable condition in Kandahar and were able to call their families , said Vance , the commander of Canadian troops in Afghanistan .
Largest joint U.S - Canadian offensive since Korean war
The CBC's Alan Waterman , reporting from Kandahar , said the military have not released information about the identity or condition of the injured yet .
Commenting after Vance spoke , Waterman said at least one of the eight had been flown to Germany .
Waterman said the soldiers were nearing the tail end of a four - day offensive that was the largest joint U.S. - Canadian offensive since the Korean war .
The offensive , which began Tuesday , saw Canadian and U.S. soldiers split into two battle groups .
They went into a large swath of land in Kandahar 's Zhari district to engage Taliban forces , who usually try to organize munitions and prepare plans for the fighting season in the summer , Waterman said .
The operation was aimed at disrupting the Taliban as they organized and to " push back the fighting season as much as possible . "
" So , an extremely large operation but of course in the midst of this we 've lost four of our own here , [ and ] eight more injured in this four - day operation . "
' Success in war is costly '
" Please do not think of these incidents as a failure on the part of any person or the mission itself , " Vance said .
Master Cpl. Scott Vernelli ( right ) and another soldier set up a defensive position during an assault on a Taliban command centre in Zhari District , Afghanistan , on Friday .
( ( Murray Brewster / Canadian Press ) )
" These wonderful Canadian men were , at the moment of their deaths , engaged directly in the continuing work to keep the insurgency sufficiently at bay to ensure safety for the population and to preserve our ability to meet the objectives of the Afghans , the international community , and the government of Canada , " he said .
" And those objectives are intended to meet the needs of a desperate Afghan population .
Success in war is costly . "
Vance described Vernelli , 28 and married with a six - month - old daughter , as " an enthusiastic and dedicated father . "
" He was a terrific athlete , very funny and , ironically enough , always able to joke at the worst of times , " Vance said of the Sault Ste. Marie , Ont. , native .
Crooks killed on 24th birthday
Crooks , a native of Port Colborne , Ont. , was a keen and motivated soldier who " loved dirt - biking and was a Texas Hold 'em card shark , " Vance said .
He died on his 24th birthday .
" He 's remembered by his friends as the kind of guy who would do anything for you without even being asked . "
Vance said Bouthillier , a 20 - year - old from Hearst , Ont. , was a joker who always had everyone laughing .
" His enthusiasm and his unswerving duty for work inspired other soldiers . "
Hayes , 22 , who grew up in Ripples , N.B. , " was a proud and dedicated soldier who always put his friends and family before himself , " Vance said .
" His friends remember him not only as a friend and a comrade - in - arms , but a brother who Inspired them to stand up in the face of danger and do what was right . "
PM offers condolences
Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered his condolences in a statement to the families of the soldiers who lost their lives .
" Canadians and the Government of Canada stand proudly in support of our Canadian Forces members as they strive to bring safety and stability back to Afghanistan .
Master Corporal Vernelli , Trooper Bouthillier , Corporal Crooks and Trooper Hayes ' sacrifice will not be forgotten , " Harper said in his statement .
" I join with all Canadians in wishing a prompt and full recovery to the other eight soldiers injured in these incidents . "
The latest deaths bring the number of Canadian military fatalities in Afghanistan to 116 since Canada 's combat mission there began in 2002 .
One diplomat and two aid workers have also been killed .
There are 2,830 Canadian troops serving at Kandahar Airfield and Camp Nathan Smith , the home of the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Kandahar city .
My buddy at work asked me if I could find some location information for a list of IPs .
I knew of the GeoIP / GeoLite project (s ) , so I said yes and then proceeded to put together the following quick hack in bash .
Here ’s what it does :
Pull a list of IP addresses from your apache logs ( you can get the list from anywhere , of course ) .
Strip the duplicates ( using uniq )
Use host to get the DNS entry for the IP Use the default geoiplookup to get the country for the IP .
Use geoiplookup with the city file passed to it to get the city ( and other info ) for the IP .
Output the whole thing into a .csv file that will import instantly into Excel .
#!/usr/bin/env bash cat / var/ log / apache2 / | awk '{print $ 1} ' > ips.txt uniq ips.txt > uniques.txt IPS=' cat uniques.txt ' echo " " > ./ipinfo.csv for i in $ IPS do echo " $i , 'host $ i | awk '{print $ 5 } '' , ' geoiplookup $ i | cut -d " , " - f2 | sed -e 's / ^ [ t]//'' , ' geoiplookup -f /usr / share/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat $ i | cut -d " , " - f3 | sed -e 's / ^ [ t]//'' , ' geoiplookup -f /usr / share/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat $ i | cut -d " , " - f4 | sed -e 's / ^ [ t]*//'' " >> ipinfo.csv done
[ The backticks have been changed to single quotes so it would render correctly .

Setup
So there are a few quick things you need before this will work :
geoip , which gives you the geopiplookup command .
The GeoLiteCity .dat file manually , which you need to put somewhere .
I put it next to the default one that comes with geoip , which is in /usr / share / GeoIP / .
ensure the paths in your environment match the paths in the script .
, which gives you the command .
Of course , if I were really cool I ’d use a real programming language and one of the APIs , but this is quick , dirty and effective .
I ’m thinking about building a rails - based web service for doing it .

A baby mammoth which was perfectly preserved in ice for 40,000 years died by drowning in mud , Russian scientists have revealed .
The mystery surrounding the remains found in the ice in the Russian arctic had proved tricky to solve .
Researchers had been trying to work out how the mammoth met its end since the find two years ago , and in the latest issue of ‘ National Geographic ’ , scientists explained how they solved the puzzle .
After carrying out an autopsy on the animal in St. Petersburg laboratories , they found a thick layer of sand and clay in the mouth and trunk – the four - month - old mammoth must have drowned to death in mud .
The species ( mammuthus primigenius ) lived in the north east of Siberia .
They became extinct 14,000 years ago – wiped out by either disease or the impact of a meteorite .
But the frozen body of the baby mammoth provides a unique glimpse into the past .
Baby ‘ Ljuba ’ , as researches have named the remains , is about 40,000 years old and has been incredibly well preserved - even the eyelashes are still recognisable .

The expanding torture scandal has left the American public horror - struck at how casually the Bush administration and its employees countenanced torture techniques like sleep deprivation , waterboarding and stress positions .
However , another form of torture was not just used on detainees , but is being used on at least 25,000 Americans right now .
That 's the number of people currently held in long - term solitary confinement in the United States , living for years in 80 - square - foot concrete cubes lit by round - the - clock fluorescent light , with little or no human contact .
The U.S. is alone among developed countries in using long - term solitary confinement on a regular basis .
Academic scientific analysis of solitary confinement is still in its early stages , but the results are obvious , and echo the experiences of Americans who 've been held in solitary confinement by terrorists or as prisoners of war .
Human beings evolved to be social creatures .
Solitary confinement drives us mad .
Wired.com spoke with psychologist Craig Haney of the University of California , Santa Cruz , an expert on long - term solitary confinement .
Asked if it 's torture , Haney replied , " For some people , it is . "
Wired.com : Everybody 's talking now about waterboarding and sleep deprivation and stress positions , but I have n't seen solitary confinement mentioned much .
Why is that ?
Craig Haney :
My interpretation is that the other techniques are generally regarded as more severe .
But solitary confinement is in the background of all this .
It 's assumed to be part of the environment in which torture is occurring .
And it is itself a painful , potentially harmful condition of confinement .
Wired.com :
What have you seen in your own work ?
Haney :
First let me note that solitary confinement has historically been a part of torture protocols .
It was well - documented in South Africa .
It 's been used to torture prisoners of war .
There are a couple reasons why solitary confinement is typically used .
One is that it 's a very painful experience .
People experience isolation panic .
They have a difficult time psychologically coping with the experience of being completely alone .
In addition , solitary confinement imposes conditions of social and perceptual stimulus deprivation .
Often it 's the deprivation of activity , the deprivation of cognitive stimulation , that some people find to be painful and frightening .
Some of them lose their grasp of their identity .
Who we are , and how we function in the world around us , is very much nested in our relation to other people .
Over a long period of time , solitary confinement undermines one 's sense of self .
It undermines your ability to register and regulate emotion .
The appropriateness of what you 're thinking and feeling is difficult to index , because we 're so dependent on contact with others for that feedback .
And for some people , it becomes a struggle to maintain sanity .
That leads to the other reason why solitary is so often a part of torture protocols .
When people 's sense of themselves is placed in jeopardy , they are more malleable and easily manipulated .
In a certain sense , solitary confinement is thought to enhance the effectiveness of other torture techniques .
Wired.com :
Is it fair to say that the science of sensory deprivation is " soft , " but the results are hard ?
Haney : Yes .
Human beings are socially connected organisms .
It 's only when people are deprived of that connection that how much we depend on feedback from other people and contact becomes apparent .
And all but the most resilient people begin to experience various forms of deterioration in the face of it .
I 'm not suggesting that everyone does n't recover , but not all of them do .
Wired.com : Confusion and loss of self - identity sounds uncomfortable , but is it profoundly damaging ?
Haney :
It 's certainly profoundly damaging if people lose hold of their own sanity .
For some people , their sense of themselves changes so profoundly and so fundamentally that they are unable to regain it .
The other thing that happens more frequently , under even less long - term solitary confinement , is that people lose the ability to interact with others .
They have to learn how to live in a world in which they 're in complete isolation .
Their ability to be comfortable during social interaction and maintain relationships is permanently impaired .
And for some people , the actual experience of isolation is so painful that it generates an anxiety or panic reaction .
People lose their ability to control themselves .
They become uncontrollably and sometimes permanently depressed in the face of this kind of treatment .
Others become angry and unable to control those impulses .
You also find people who suffer cognitive impairments .
Their ability to process information is undermined .
And it 's not clear if these skills can be brought back .
Wired.com :
How many people in long - term solitary confinement are permanently damaged ?
Haney :
It 's difficult to estimate precisely , because the long - term solitary conditions themselves vary , and not all people are created equal in terms of psychological resiliency .
There tends to be a kind of sloppiness when we talk about this .
Some people will point to a particular study where it does n't look like the effects were especially harmful , and conclude that there 's no harm to be concerned about .
But there are many other studies showing a higher risk .
I 've heard word informally that a large percentage of prisoners in Guantanamo have experienced psychiatric problems .
Was it all because they were isolated ?
No .
They were subjected to a variety of other things as well .
Wired.com : Based on your own experience with U.S. citizens in long - term solitary confinement , would you be able to hazard a guess as to how many have sustained long - term damage ?
Haney : I do n't know .
We do n't have good data on follow - ups of people who come out of this environment .
This is not something that 's easy to study , and not something that prison systems are eager to have people look at .
But I can tell you that large numbers of them are in pain and are suffering while they 're in solitary confinement .
And there is certainly anecdotal evidence that some people have left solitary confinement deeply disturbed .
I know such cases .
I 've seen them .
These are instances of people going into solitary confinement with no pre-existing psychological problems , who are given a clean bill of health when they go in .
When they come out they have psychiatric problems that are permanent or long - lasting .
Wired.com : Does America need to change how it thinks of long - term solitary confinement ?
Haney : Yes .
In the last 30 or 40 years in the United States , we 've slipped into more long - term use of solitary confinement .
In some cases it 's a more complete form than was used before .
We have an overwhelmingly crowded prison system in which the mandate to rehabilitate and provide activities for prisoners was suspended at the same time as the prison system became overcrowded .
Not surprisingly , prison systems faced with this influx of prisoners , and lacking the rewards they once had to manage and control prisoner behavior , turned to the use of punishment .
And one big punishment is the threat of long - term solitary confinement .
They 've used it without a lot of forethought to its consequences .
That policy needs to be rethought .
The debate over long - term solitary confinement is always over how much harm it does , not over what positive effects it can have on people subjected to it .
That 's because the latter answer is obvious : none .
It 's an extraordinarily expensive , extraordinarily wrong - headed way of trying to manage prisoner populations .
Wired.com :
Do you consider it legalized torture ?
Haney : I do n't think correctional administrators always put people in solitary confinement just to make them feel pain .
But to the extent that 's done , to the extent they know that people in these environments will feel that pain , then that creeps very close to the definition of what 's understood internationally as torture .
I think our sloppiness , our carelessness about how this policy has been implemented , raises very severe ethical concerns about the humane treatment of prisoners by both U.S. standards and international standards .

" We will not be able to expand . "
The project lies close to Bethlehem , south of Jerusalem , where the Greek Orthodox Sahouri family live in a modern three - bedroom home , with two flat - screen televisions and a small bar displaying a collection of whiskies and other liquors .
While their Jewish neighbours celebrate Passover this week , they are fasting for Lent ahead of Orthodox Easter , and their house is overflowing with the delicious aroma of lentil soup .
Stepping out on the balcony of his master bedroom , Sahouri points to the Israeli security road , with electronic warning fences , that runs 30 metres ( 100 feet ) from his apartment block .
Only Israeli army vehicles can use the road , to patrol the area .
The noise of tractors and bulldozers is a constant nuisance , said Sahouri .
Once completed , the road will encircle the whole area , forcing residents to enter and leave via a gate controlled by Israelis .
Beit Sahour 's fate was decided by an Israeli military order issued on April 29 , 2003 , by Moshe Kaplinsky , then - chief of the army 's Central Command that includes Judea and Samaria -- the biblical names Israelis use for the Israeli - occupied West Bank .
" I hereby announce the seizure of land for military purposes , " said the order , accompanied by maps showing how the housing project would soon be cut off , along with a few other Palestinian homes and some farmland .
Across the valley from Beit Sahour lies the sprawling Jewish settlement of Har Homa , south of Jerusalem .
Construction began at Har Homa and Beit Sahour around the same time in the late 1990s .
While Har Homa now houses thousands of Jewish families , the Beit Sahour site is still unfinished .
In 2002 the Israeli authorities issued orders for the demolition of the housing project .
The orders have been frozen but still hang over the heads of the residents .
When they were first issued , construction came to a standstill for eight months as fear spread among the community .
The project 's committee called together everyone with a stake in the housing and in defiance they all agreed to continue building despite the risks .
CHURCH LAND
Intended to create affordable housing for young families on land leased from the Greek Orthodox church , the project consists of 15 buildings , each with eight privately owned apartments .
A community church is still on the drawing board .
Sixty - four families now reside in 10 completed buildings .
Witha few exceptions they are Greek Orthodox from Beit Sahour .
To buy a flat , they must earn a limited income , be in need of housing and not own land elsewhere .
Sahouri lived in his parent 's house before moving to the housing project seven years ago .
" This is the only place .
There are no lands to expand , " said Sahouri .
" Beit Sahour is part of our identity .
We ca n't go anywhere else . "
Tourism in the area has plunged severely since 2002 when an Israeli incursion into Bethlehem led to a lengthy standoff with Palestinian militants trapped in the Church of the Nativity .
This led residents of Bethlehem and the neighbouring Christian villages of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour to emigrate in large numbers , said Claudette Habash , a member of the Palestinian presidential committee for Christian affairs .
Israel 's confiscation of land to build a settlement has hit the Beit Sahour community hard .
" The expropriation of properties has been flagrant , " Habash said .
" People lost hope that there is a possibility for peace . "
Housing projects like this one encourage the Palestinian Christian community to stay in their homeland , Habash said .
" In our culture , if you have a roof over your head then you are safe , " she said .
" The people of Beit Sahour , if they have $ 1,000 in their pocket , they will start building . "
The Israeli measures faced by the Greek Orthodox housing project are a constant reminder of the instability Palestinians live in and an incentive for the Christian community to flee .
" We are seven brothers , but only three of us are left here , " said Sahouri .
" The rest have emigrated . "
The Israeli military declined official comment .
But a military source said security was the motive for its actions .
" The route of the security fence is determined on the basis of security considerations in order to prevent terrorist infiltrations into Israel , " he told Reuters .
Israel says its security fence has radically reduced the ability of Palestinian militants to launch suicide attacks .
But Palestinians say it is a land grab .
" It 's not their property and they take it against your will , " said Yassar Qumsieh , a 30 - year - old Website administrator , who moved with his wife to their Beit Sahour flat in 2006 .
" I do n't know how to describe this feeling .
To call it injustice seems stupid because it's not a big enough word . "
Palestinians see the Jewish construction in Har Homa , which they call by its Arabic name Jabal Abu Ghneim , as the last rampart in a wall of settlements encircling Arab East Jerusalem , cutting it off from the rest of the occupied West Bank .
Washington has been critical of Israel 's construction plans in Har Homa .
Israel rejected criticism on the grounds that it annexed the land and placed it inside the Jerusalem city boundaries that it drew after occupying the West Bank in the Middle East war of 1967 .
Israeli settlement is expected to be a controversial issue in talks next week when U.S. Middle East peace envoy George Mitchell visits the region .
The security road not only prevents Palestinians from reaching the Jewish settlement , but also severely curtails the ability of the Palestinian housing project to expand .
Nevertheless , said Sahouri , " we are encouraging people to come here ...
We must live here , it 's our existence . "
" Here you are born in Beit Sahour , live in Beit Sahour , die in Beit Sahour , " he said .
" We do n't have the mentality to sell the house , or sell the land . "
Qumsieh is also philosophical about the future .
" I 'm not concerned , for the simple reason that we 're not the only ones , " he said .
" When you think how many have problems like these , you feel like you 're just one of the many Palestinians in similar circumstances . "

Q : There ’s a lot of talk today about solar and wind power , but what about biomass ?
How big a role might this renewable energy source play in our future ?
Could n’t everyday people burn their own lawn and leaf clippings to generate power ?
– Deborah Welch , Niagara Falls , N.Y .
A : The oldest and most prevalent source of renewable energy known to man , biomass is already a mainstay of energy production in the United States and elsewhere .
Since such a wide variety of biomass resources is available – from trees and grasses to forestry , agricultural , and urban wastes – biomass promises to play a continuing role in providing power and heat for millions of people around the world .
According to the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists ( UCS ) , biomass is not only a renewable energy source but also a carbon neutral one , because the energy it contains comes from the sun .
When plant matter is burned , it releases the sun ’s energy originally captured through photosynthesis .
“ In this way , biomass functions as a sort of natural battery for storing solar energy , ” reports UCS .
As long as biomass is produced sustainably – with only as much grown as is used – the “ battery ” lasts indefinitely .
While biomass is most commonly used , especially in developing countries , as a source of heat so families can stay warm and cook meals , it can also be utilized as a source of electricity .
Steam captured from huge biomass processing facilities is used to turn turbines to generate electricity .
Of course , biomass is also a feedstock for several increasingly popular carbon - neutral fuels , including ethanol and biodiesel .
According to the federal Energy Information Administration , biomass has been America ’s leading nonhydroelectric renewable energy source for several years running through 2007 , accounting for between 0.5 and 0.9 percent of the nation ’s total electricity supply .
In 2008 – although the numbers are n’t all in yet – wind power probably took over first place due to the extensive development of wind farms across the country .
According to the USA Biomass Power Pro­ducers Alliance , generating power from biomass helps Americans avoid some 11 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions that burning the equivalent amount of fossil fuels would create each year .
It also helps avoid annual emissions of some 2 million tons of methane – which , as a greenhouse gas , is 20 - plus times more powerful than carbon dioxide is .
The largest biomass power plant in the country is South Bay , Florida ’s New Hope Power Partnership .
The 140 - megawatt facility generates electricity by burning sugar cane fiber ( bagasse ) and recycled urban wood , powering some 60,000 homes as well as the company ’s own extensive milling and refining operations .
Besides preserving landfill space by recycling sugar cane and wood waste , the facility ’s electricity output obviates the need for about a million barrels of oil per year .
Some homeowners are making their own heat via biomass - fed backyard boiler systems , which burn yard waste and other debris , or sometimes prefabricated pellets , channeling the heat indoors to keep occupants warm .
Such systems may save homeowners money , but they also generate a lot of local pollution .
So , really , the way to get the most out of biomass is to encourage local utilities to use it – perhaps even from yard waste put out on the curb every week for pickup – and sell it back to us as electricity .

I think that Fox is a different sort of news source , but that does not mean people should not exercise their right to watch it .
Yes , some people may just not understand that there is a world outside of Glenn Beck .
Kind of the same way some people do n't know there is a world of music outside of MTV .
Unfortunately ,
Fox news preaches to be the " conservative " source , when in fact even though I am a liberal , I think that there could be a conservative source that is more reliable and honest than Fox seems to be .
Also , we need to remember , people watch what is available and what they grow up with .
For right - leaning Americans ,
Fox seems to be a better alternative than perhaps MSNBC or CNN , even though they may not agree with it .
And eventually they get accustomed to now things run on Fox and it becomes a reality .
And also , the typical flag - waving , apple - pie- eating , rifle - owning middle - American - seems - to watch and listen to Fox news .
That 's just how it goes , and it's not a small minority of people either .
That takes me back to my points of 1 ) some people do n't understand that there is a world outside of Fox news and 2 ) it attracts people who are not quite liberal enough for MSNBC or CNN , the leaners .
I consider CNN to be less liberal than MSNBC , but still too liberal apparently for many conservatives .
I also think that Fox does something unfair .
They point fingers , call names , and they have pretty people as their newscasters .
In a way , it 's like entertainment .
I watch Glenn Beck .
I do .
I really do .
It 's like an entertainment , primetime show .
That 's how it reaches me and that 's what it looks like , with the camera placement , the clever pauses , the script .
It 's not a news show , to me .
It 's a " these are my ideas and your ideas and we will repeat them a hundred times and protect these specific rights for these reasons no matter the consequences but we do n't respect the rights of gays or people who want abortions , etc , and we go to Church and this is who we are as an American political group . "
I do n't often watch Fox if I 'm looking to see what happened with a news story .
If I want to know what happened , I do n't want to hear political commentary , I do n't want people voicing their opinions , not until I actually know what happened .
But maybe conservatives who are short on time want to hear their own opinions being repeated back at them even during live coverage .
Maybe the conservatives are craving reassurance .
But I think it would be a big gift to our country to acquire an honest conservative news source .
And then , the people who watch Fox , will be the same people who watch Maury and who criticize the liberals and who have one set unchanging notion of what they think America should be .
I do n't think they 're progressive and I think that over time , based on the beliefs of my generation I think , they will be phased out except in some very small towns in the middle of the nation .
I 'm not saying that they should , I 'm just saying that they 're not trying very hard .
To some , Fox is a reputable news source .
And it 's sad and it's an insult to our intelligence as a country , I believe .
There is no reputable news source , and the best thing we can do is take an average of what we hear and do independent research on issues from sources NOT like mainstream media .
Will it be a lucky seven for Nicklas Lidstrom in Las Vegas ?
Lidstrom , the Detroit Red Wings ' star defenseman and winner of six of the last seven Norris Trophies as the NHL's top defenseman , is in the running for a seventh on June 18 when the NHL Awards are handed out in Vegas at the Pearl Concert Theater inside the Palms Hotel ( VERSUS , CBC ) .
Tickets to the NHL Awards in Las Vegas and the exclusive NHL After - Party are available at ticketmaster.com / nhlawards
The other finalists as selected by the Professional Hockey Writers ' Association are Boston Bruins ' captain Zdeno Chara and Washington Capitals dynamo Mike Green The Norris , named for the owner of the Detroit Red Wings from 1933 until his death in 1952 , has gone to Lidstrom in six of the past seven years , creating a dynasty for defensive excellence .
In those years , the other nominees had to be content with the honor of being a finalist .
This time around , Lidstrom is again a nominee , but the outcome is not so certain .
Not because Lidstrom had an off year , but because of the strong candidacies of Chara and Green .
"
It 's always an honor being nominated and I know the other two players have had really solid seasons as well , but I 've never taken it for granted and it's a real honor , " Lidstrom said .
The strongest argument for Lidstrom might be contained in the award 's terms , " all - around ability , " because Lidstrom 's skill set falls between the outstanding offensive capability of Green and the smothering defensive work of Chara .
Green 's excellent defense and Chara 's impressive offensive contributions often get overlooked , but perhaps not this year .
Here 's a look at the finalists .--
Chara 's supporters have a strong argument that the captain is the acknowledged leader and best player on his team .
He logs the most ice time per game , 26:04 , more than Green and Lidstrom , sixth in the league and tops on his team .
He has a strong plus - 23 rating , a gaudy number that is second to Dennis Wideman among the Bruins ' defensemen , but trails Green and Lidstrom .
Chara had 19 goals , tops among Bruins ' defensemen and fourth - best among NHL defenders , and 31 assists , again second to Wideman among Boston defensemen , and 26th among NHL defensemen .
Chara 's 50 points was tied for 12th among NHL defenseman and tied for tops with Wideman on the Bruins defense and sixth on the team .
Chara 's 11 power - play goals led all Bruins and he had three game - winning goals .
His 216 shots was second on his team behind Phil Kessel 's 232 .
Chara scored on 8.8 percent of his shots .
It 's on the defensive side where Chara excels over Green and Lidstrom .
His 169 hits ranked 17th among NHL defensemen and his 123 blocked shots ranked 51st .
He also had 28 takeaways .
Chara often dominates the game with his size , strength and skills and he 's been good for a long time .
He was the runner - up for the Norris in 2004 .
At 6 - foot - 9 , he is the tallest player and fifth - heaviest at 255 pounds .
The son of an Olympic wrestler , Chara is also most likely the strongest player in the League .
Like Lidstrom , Chara is extremely well positioned due to his experience and anticipation .
It 's rare to see him have to hustle to get into position , unless he 's returning from an offensive foray .
Because of his size and stick skills , he 's used on power play either at the point or as a forward in front of the net .
Chara played an important defensive role earlier in his career on a talent - laden Ottawa Senators defense .
There , he supported team leadership .
After signing with Boston and being named captain , Chara seized control of the dressing room and dominates it with his size , personality and work ethic .
Their success is a reflection of his leadership .
The Bruins led the Northeast Division and Eastern Conference throughout the season .--
The fastest and most agile skater of the three -- we hesitate to say the best skater because of Lidstrom 's great skating -- Green had an outstanding year offensively while leading his team to the Southeast Division crown and a second - place finish in the Eastern Conference .
He led NHL defensemen with 31 goals and 73 points , tied for 28th among NHL skaters .
His 42 assists ranked seventh among NHL defensemen and 38th in the NHL .
" Being nominated for the Norris Trophy is definitely a great honor , " Green said .
" I give credit to my teammates because it 's been a lot of fun this year playing with players like ( Alex ) Ovechkin , ( Nicklas ) Backstrom and ( Alexander ) Semin .
My teammates have definitely helped and it's an honor to be in the same category as the other players nominated .
" In his fourth NHL season , the 29th overall pick of the 2004 Entry Draft has made great progression getting in sync with his team .
Green had negative plus - minus numbers in his first two seasons , progressed to plus - 6 last season and was plus - 24 this season , tied for fifth among NHL defensemen and 17th in the NHL .
Green was tremendous on the Washington power play , scoring 18 of his 31 goals in man-advantage situations .
That ranked second to Alexander Ovechkin on the Capitals , tops among NHL defensemen and fourth among all players .
He also had four game - winning goals , tied for third among NHL defensemen with Lidstrom and seven others .
On the defensive side , Green had 86 hits , 110 blocked shots and 49 takeaways .
He was well ahead of Lidstrom and Chara in that last category .
Because of Green 's great skating skills , offensive instincts and good judgment , coach Bruce Boudreau has given him the green light to join the rush .
It 's not unusual to find Green carrying the puck or being a passing option on odd - man rushes .
He uses his speed to get back to his position in transition .
There have n't been too many defenders in NHL history better at that than Green .--
Lidstrom is the book on how to play defense and like Chara , and unlike Green , the acknowledged leader of his team .
Although it 's seldom mentioned , his durability , for a defenseman , has been phenomenal .
He broke into the NHL in 1991 and played every game through his first three seasons .
He has missed only 32 games in 17 seasons , has five seasons in which he played every game , four seasons when he missed one game and three seasons when he missed only two games .
That 's unheard of in a position where players are expected to block shots and muscle forwards in front of their net .
Seasoned pros marvel at how he always seems to have the play in front of him and how the routes around him are non-productive .
Forget about passing to the man he 's covering .
He rarely shows his speed for flashy reasons but it 's there whenever he needs it .
He 's fast straight - ahead and quick in his movements .
He gets to pucks first and he 's slick at avoiding getting hit .
His hand - eye coordination is unparalleled .
Time and again , he thwarts the basic offensive maneuver of chipping the puck in along the wall by batting the shot back out of his defensive zone .
He plays close enough to the oncoming attacker to place his stick right where the shot should be launched from .
Watch NHL forwards hesitate after taking their stick back for a shot .
The shot is doomed before it 's launched .
At the blue line , he thwarts clearing attempts and keeps the puck in the offensive zone as well as anyone ever , with the sole exception , perhaps , of former teammate Larry Murphy " Every team has high - end players that they count on a lot and when your high - end players are professional and hard working and bring it every day , it makes it that much easier for you , " Wings coach Mike Babcock said of Lidstrom .
" And I think a big part of playoff hockey is trust ; the trust you have within the room , the trust you have between the coach and players and Nick is one of the best in the world at this as we all know .
He 's been great .
" For those reasons , Lidstrom topped Green and Chara with his plus - 31 rating , second on the Red Wings , third among NHL defensemen and seventh - best in the league .
He had 43 hits , 67 blocked shots and 26 takeaways .
All three candidates are great at launching offensive attacks from their own zone , whether they carry the puck or make the initial pass .
Lidstrom is the quarterback of the Red Wings ' feared power play .
His 10 power - play goals ranked fourth on his team , fourth among NHL defensemen and 17th among all players .
