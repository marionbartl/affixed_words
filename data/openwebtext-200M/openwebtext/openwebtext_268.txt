You ’ve probably heard about , and perhaps read , a book phenomenon called The Secret .
I have n’t read the book , but I ’ve seen lots of negative reviews about its new age mumbo jumbo .
As I understand it , the central concept is something the book calls the Law of Attraction .
Essentially , you focus on positive things and the universe will attract those things to you .
One skeptical reviewer picked the most outrageous sounding example in the book to point out how ridiculous it is .
Apparently the book claims , without science to support it , that if you want to be thin , you should avoid overweight people , even to the extent of avoiding looking at them .
Clearly , that ’s mumbo jumbo .
Today I read in the news that researchers have discovered weight to be “ socially contagious . ”
Your chances of becoming obese are 57 % higher if you have ONE friend who is obese .

It ’s probably premature to declare this a fact .
The media is n’t good at getting this sort of thing right .
But I ’d be surprised if it ’s wrong .
After all , humans conform to their friends ’ habits in every other realm , from clothing , to music , to choice of words .
It ca n’t be too surprising to learn that they start eating the same .
Friends influence friends .
That ’s obvious .
But can you also become overweight just by looking at overweight people ?
My guess is that you can .
Humans are natural copiers .
Your choice of clothing , for example , is influenced just as much by what you see on strangers as on friends .
And your notion of what is acceptable and normal is probably more determined by strangers than by your one or two close friends .
How about success ?
Can the universe provide success just by focusing on it and avoiding thinking about failure ?
I ’ve seen no research on that topic , but would n’t you be surprised if success is n’t socially contagious too ?
Stanford University creates an enormous number of entrepreneurs and other successful people .
I ’ve often hypothesized that half of Stanford ’s success is because the students are brilliant , well taught , and screened for high potential , and half is because the environment breeds success contagion .
I imagine it would be difficult to graduate from Stanford and settle for an ordinary life .
The impulse to copy the other go - getters would be mighty strong .
I ’ve often written about my own experiences with affirmations , the practice of writing your goals 15 times a day .
It seems to work much of the time , at least in my experience , but presumably not because of any magic .
At least one probable explanation for its perceived effectiveness is that focusing on goals changes the person who is doing the focusing .
In a book called The Luck Factor , the author and researcher , Richard Wiseman ( Google it ) , discovered that people who expect luck will notice opportunities in their environment more readily than those who do n’t .
And he learned that you can train people to expect luck , and cause an improvement in their ability to spot opportunities , that look like luck , when they pop up .
I can imagine affirmations tuning a person in the same way , until it seems that extra luck is being provided by the universe , but all that ’s happening is that it ’s more easily recognized .
Affirmations probably also increases a person ’s natural level of optimism , especially if you believe it works .
I can imagine optimism working to harden people against the inevitable setbacks and obstacles along the way to success .
To the extent that affirmations might increase a person ’s stick - to - itiveness , his perception might be that the universe is removing barriers .
To be fair , there ’s also some selective memory at play .
I ’m sure people who use affirmations , or The Secret , tend to remember the successes and forget the failures .
I recall about six ridiculously unlikely successes of my own with affirmations , and one quasi - failure that I still think will pan out .
( There ’s the optimism thing . )
Realistically , I might be forgetting some failures .
And I have no way of knowing whether I would have had the successes without affirmation .
As I said , I have n’t read The Secret .
I do n’t endorse it .
But if you think the concept has no value because it ’s not backed by science , do n’t be surprised if that changes .
Bad Bill had been roughing up Obama so much that Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina suggested that he might want to “ chill . ”
On a conference call with reporters yesterday , the former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle , a national co-chairman of the Obama campaign , tut - tutted that the “ incredible distortions ” of the political beast were “ not keeping with the image of a former president . ”

Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
Jonathan Alter reported in Newsweek that Senator Edward Kennedy and Rahm Emanuel , the Illinois congressman and former Clinton aide , have heatedly told Bill “ that he needs to change his tone and stop attacking Senator Barack Obama . ”
In the Myrtle Beach debate Monday night , Obama was fed up with being double - teamed by the Clintons .
He finally used attack lines that his strategists had urged him to use against Hillary for months .
“ It was as though all the e-mails were backed up , ” said one .
When Hillary tried once more to take Obama ’s remarks about Ronald Reagan out of context , making it seem as though Obama had praised Reagan ’s policies , he turned sarcastic about getting two distortionists for the price of one .
“ I ca n’t tell who I ’m running against sometimes , ” he snapped at Hillary , obviously entrapped and psyched - out by the Clinton duo .
On a conference call with reporters yesterday morning , Obama did not back off from his more aggressive , if defensive , stance .
The Clintons , he said “ spent the last month attacking me in ways that are not accurate .
At some point , it ’s important for me to answer . ”
Recalling that Hillary had called mixing it up the “ fun ” part of politics , he said : “ I do n’t think it ’s the fun part to fudge the truth . ”
Bill has merged with his wife totally now , talking about “ we ” and “ us . ” “ I never did anything major without discussing it with her , ” he told a crowd here .
“ We ’ve been having this conversation since we first met in 1971 , and I do n’t think we ’ll stop now . ”
He suggested as First Lad that “ I can help to sell the domestic program . ”
Wrinkles in Dem party rules could put strong third - place finisher in driver 's seat at convention time .
Close contest could make Edwards kingmaker
John Edwards has said he ’s in the Democratic primary to win it .
He ’s also said he ’s planning on staying in “ through the convention . ”
And while those two statements may sound more or less the same , they ’re not .
Because while Edwards would like to be on the stage accepting his party ’s nomination , there may be another role for him at the convention : Kingmaker .

The prospect of a vigorous , three - way contest across some 22 states on Feb. 5 , suggested by polling and by the swerving momentum of the two early votes , is raising the distinct possibility that the primary process could return to its roots as a nuts - and - bolts battle for delegates to the August Democratic National Convention in Denver .
The leading Democratic campaigns have all begun to focus on delegates — the prize awarded in primaries and caucuses .
Barack Obama 's aides stress that the Illinois senator may well accumulate almost as many delegates as Hillary Clinton on Super Tuesday without winning as many states .
And Clinton told reporters in Elko , Nevada Friday that she expects the contest to continue after Feb .
5 .
“ This is ultimately about delegates and how many delegates every one of us have , ” she said .
Technical features of the Democratic Party ’s primary process could hand significant power to a strong third - place finisher , placing him in a position to determine the nomination .
“ If Edwards can continue to do what he ’s done – which is to win more than 15 percent of the vote – and to distribute his vote generally all over the state – then he will have a big impact on Super Tuesday , ” said Tad Devine , a veteran Democratic consultant who ran Michael Dukakis ’s delegate - tracking operation in 1988 .
“ I do n’t think his impact is going to be that he ’s going to win it .
But he’d be in an awfully influential position – more than any other individual . ”
“ Sen. Edwards ' delegates could potentially come into play and he could look for a major role , ” said Chris Lehane , a Democratic strategist who supports Clinton .
" There may be a race within the race within the race for the hearts and minds of these delegates . ”
Though Edwards has criticized both of the front - runners , he 's also made clear that he sees Obama as his ally in change — making it likely that he'd be making a king , not a queen .
Here 's the math : A Democrat needs 50 percent plus one of a total 4,049 delegates to secure the nomination .
Eighty percent of that total can be won in primaries and caucuses , meaning that to lock up the nomination in the early voting , a candidate would need to collect 62 percent of the delegates awarded through primaires .
The rest are “ superdelegates , ” party officials who can promise their support , and among whom Clinton holds a lead .
Meanwhile , the 22 states voting and caucusing on Feb.
5 operate under systems that award one - third of their delegates to the winners of the state , and two - thirds to the winner of each congressional district within the state .
The states use proportional representation , meaning that in a close contest , one candidate might get four delegates , the other three .
For instance : Iowa ’s caucuses – for narrative purposes a stunning Obama victory – awarded Obama 16 delegates , Clinton 15 , and Edwards 14 .
Clinton ’s " game - changing " New Hampshire win got her and Obama nine delegates each , and Edwards four .
Crucially , the contests operate under a rule that can empower a certain kind of strong third - place finisher :
One who breaks through the 15 percent threshold for getting any delegates at all .
A weaker third - place candidate would be eliminated outright .
But the threshold also serves to exaggerate the impact of a candidate who squeaks past it .
The net is a leveling effect : A candidate who just breaks 15 percent will be awarded more than 15 percent of the delegates .
Edwards drew 17 percent of the support from Democrats in a national CNN poll released Friday .
With strong finishes in states where he ’s currently polling strong , observers say , Edwards could plausibly win more than 300 delegates .
Of course , this is still probably not the likeliest scenario .
Edwards wo n’t get votes on Feb.
5 if voters do n’t see him as a viable candidate for president , and a weak finish in his native South Carolina on Jan. 26 could end the perception that he ’s viable -- and his candidacy .
" Are ordinary voters going to want to vote for him so he can have a little basket of delegates to vote for another candidate ? " asked an aide to one of his rivals .
And his delegates wo n’t automatically follow his lead , and might instead shift to a media - anointed front - runner .
“ Nobody ’s bound to him .
You guys , the media , are the ones who will decide , ” said one veteran of past delegate processes who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he supports one of Edwards ’ rivals .
“ If the delegates go there and are truly dedicated to him and are his people , then he could be kingmaker . ”
Edwards aides would n't speculate on what he would want for the support of his delegates , but he 'd certainly be able to guarantee himself a prominent role in a Democratic admninistration .
Edwards , of course , is publicly conceding no ground .
“ The nomination is n't going to be determined by the win-loss record in a few early states ; it 's going to go to the candidate that can compete widely and accumulate delegates over the long haul , ” said an aide to Edwards , Jonathan Prince .
“ Ultimately , we expect the race to narrow to one of the two celebrity candidates and us , and when that happens , we are confident that the remaining contests will break in our direction as voters are finally offered the choice the national media has ignored all year : the most progressive , most electable candidate in the race . ”
Still , the prospect of serious wrangling in Denver remains a distinct possibility , and the leading campaigns say they ’ve begun to focus on the prospect of running the kind of delegate operations that were common in the 1980s , when campaigns would employ a dozen or more staffers , each assigned to minding a set of delegates .
“ The most likely scenario now after the fifth of February is that Obama and Clinton will basically split the delegates , ” said Devine .
“ The only real question is will there be a third candidate who can win between 10 and 20 percent of the delegates , and become a serious force . ”

Q : Why does salt dissolve in water ?
Iain Stewart
Er , I guess the sodium ions get taken up ... oh , gosh , I suppose the sodium and chlorine dissociate .
The chlorine joins with the water and the sodium ions float free .
Something like that .
Will Self
It does n't completely dissolve , of course .
It must be because it absorbs water to the point at which it disintegrates .
Is that right ?
I could n't describe it scientifically .
Daisy Goodwin
It forms another compound .
The only reason I know any of this is because I 've been testing my daughter on her GCSEs .
Marina Warner
The molecules join with the water molecules .
The sodium molecules join up with the hydrogen and oxygen molecules .
Susan Greenfield Because sodium and chloride disassociate and H20 is hydrogen and oxygen .
Kirsty Wark Because it 's less dense .
Robert Winston
It 's to do with ions is n't it ?
Let me just work it out .
It 's to do with the way sodium and chloride ions , um .
Do you know , I 'm not sure I can really explain it .
I can't remember now from my physics years ago .
John O'Farrell
No idea .
Answer : Sodium chloride is an ionic substance that contains alternating sodium and chlorine ions .
When salt is added to water , the partial charges on the water molecule are attracted to the Na+ and Cl- ions .
The water molecules work their way into the crystal structure and between the individual ions , surrounding them and slowly dissolving the salt .
Q : Roughly how old is the earth ?
John O'Farrell
I 'll have a guess .
About 100 million years ?
Will Self I 'm completely winging this .
A couple of billion years ?
No ?
Give me right on that .
Mark me up .
Iain Stewart
This I am sure of : 4.5 billion - no , actually 4.6 billion years .
Daisy Goodwin Pass .
This is embarrassing .
Marina Warner
That I do n't know .
( I did actually just hear Melvyn Bragg 's programme this week about very ancient worlds . )
I 'm not very good at figures .
Robert Winston
Well , the universe is 13 billion or 14 billion and the earth is between 4 and 5 billion years old .
Kirsty Wark More than 5 billion years .
Susan Greenfield
Oh blimey .
Well , I know that human beings have been going for about a million and a half years , so ... I 'm just grasping here .
Something like 60 billion years or something like that , but that 's a grasp .
I 'm not a physical scientist and it shows .
I 'm probably not scientifically literate .
Answer : 4.5 billion years .
Q : What happens when you turn on a light ?
Will Self
In my house , very little , because I never get round to changing the bulbs .
You complete a circuit ?
Iain Stewart
This is taking me right back to school physics .
It 's the kind of question I always pray a nine - year - old wo n't ask me .
I think the switch closes a loop for the circuit .
Kirsty Wark
It gets brighter .
There 's a current ... that connects between two prongs .
Marina Warner
The energy is conducted along the wire to the filament .
John O'Farrell
I 'm running out of steam here .
I really do n't know .
Susan Greenfield
There 's a flow of electrons called a current , and it's that flow which is the energy and generates heat and light .
Robert Winston
Well you fall in love , do n't you ?
Is n't that what it is ?
No , Okay , when you turn on the switch you make a circuit .
Daisy Goodwin
You connect a circuit .
Answer :
The switch controls the flow of electricity through a circuit - a complete , unbroken loop through which electric charges can move .
When the light switch is on , these electric charges can move in an endless loop .
This loop begins at a power station where the charges pick up electric energy .
They then flow through wires to the light switch , then to the light bulb where they deliver their electric energy , and finally back to the power company to obtain more energy .
Q : Is a clone the same as a twin ?
Will Self No .
Iain Stewart
Yes , er , I think ... oh God , it 's probably not .
But I think it has to be , does n't it ?
John O'Farrell No . How could it be the same ?
That 's not how cloning works , is it ?
Susan Greenfield Yes .
An identical twin .
Daisy Goodwin
As an identical twin ?
That 's quite interesting .
No .
Well , I 'm not sure about that .
I 'd say no .
But maybe yes .
I 'm baffled .
Kirsty Wark No .
But there 's two different kinds of twin .
You have to give me a point for that !
Robert Winston
Well , not necessarily .
It 's not genetically the same actually , no .
You see , it depends on the kind of twin .
Do you mean an identical twin ?
Identical twins are different in all sorts of ways .
It 's different epigenetics and there 's different mitochondrial DNA , so it 's a different organism .
Actually , what we 're beginning to understand is that the epigenetic aspects of cloning are fundamentally very important .
And twins are rather more dissimilar than people imagine , too .
For example , they have different fingerprints from each other , so there are quite interesting and subtle diff erences .
Marina Warner
Yes it is .
Well , identical twins are clones , not non-identical twins .
Answer : Yes , up to a point ( see Robert Winston 's answer ) .
Q : Why is the sky blue ?
Susan Greenfield
That was discovered here at the Royal Institution [ of Great Britain ] by Tyndall .
Sorry , I can't articulate that entirely because I 'm half asleep .
John O'Farrell
My daughter explained this to me the other day .
She is in Year Seven .
It 's to do with blue being the dominant colour in the colour spectrum .
Will Self
It 's because of the diffusion of light from the sun through oxygen , through the air .
Iain Stewart Because of ' Rayleigh scatter ' , the diffusion of blue light molecules .
Daisy Goodwin
I have no idea .
I have looked it up because I 've been asked the question by my children and I 've explained it to them and now I 've forgotten .
It 's the colour of the atmosphere or something .
It 's the gases or whatever .
Marina Warner
It 's a refraction of the light .
Robert Winston
Oh bugger , I can't remember now .
Um. Oh Jesus .
It is n't really blue actually .
It does n't actually have a colour at all .
It just simply appears blue .
Kirsty Wark Because it 's a reflection of the oceans on the planet .
No idea apart from that .
I think the sky is blue because ... the rain clouds obscure the blue , and the blue is a reflection ... because of the sunshine .
Fuck !
I do n't know !
Why is the sky blue ?
Answer :
A daytime sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light .
Q : What is the Second Law of Thermodynamics ?
Will Self
It 's either the conservation or the dissipation of energy , is n't it ?
It 's everything tending towards entropy , is n't it ?
Iain Stewart
It 's about the conservation of motion , I think , but I 'm not sure .
Different field from mine , you know .
John O'Farrell
Let me think .
Is it to do with heat conductors ?
Metal is an effective heat conductor and wood is not .
I remember that from metalwork classes .
Marina Warner
Is it that mass can not be ... that no energy can be lost ?
The first law is conversion .
Is the second law that there is no loss ... that energy must go somewhere ?
Susan Greenfield
That everything degenerates to entropy .
Robert Winston
I 've always refused to answer that question on a matter of principle , simply because of C P Snow , and you can report that .
But it is in one of my children 's books .
Daisy Goodwin
Do n't know .
I 'm scientifically illiterate .
Kirsty Wark
No idea .
Answer :
It is the Law of Increased Entropy .
It states that in any system the quality of energy deteriorates gradually over time .
' Entropy ' is defined as a measure of unusable energy within a closed or isolated system ( the universe for example ) .
As usable energy decreases and unusable energy increases , ' entropy ' increases .
As usable energy is irretrievably lost , disorganisation , randomness and chaos increase .

CAMP ARIFJAN , Kuwait ( CNN ) -- Attacks against U.S. troops in Iraq with bombs believed linked to Iran -- known as explosively formed penetrators ( EFPs ) -- have risen sharply in January after several months of decline , according to the top U.S. commander in Iraq .
Explosively formed penetrators are more sophisticated and deadlier than typical improvised explosive devices .
Iraqi and U.S. officials indicated just a month ago that Iran was using its influence to improve security in Iraq by restraining cross - border weapons flow and militia activity .
The U.S. military had said in recent months that the number of EFP attacks had gone down .
Gen . David Petraeus disclosed the reversal to reporters after a meeting with President Bush who was visiting troops in Kuwait .
" In this year , EFPs have gone up , actually , over the last 10 days by a factor of two or three , and frankly we 're trying to determine why that might be , " Petraeus said .
Petraeus did not say how many American troops have been killed or wounded by EFPs in recent days .
Do n't Miss Bush arrives in Kuwait on Mideast peace mission
The U.S. military announced nine troop deaths from bombings in the first 11 days of January , but the death announcements did not specify if EFPs were involved .
EFPs are more sophisticated and deadlier than the typical improvised explosive devices ( IED ) used by insurgents as roadside bombs to attack convoys and foot patrols until last year .
EFPs use components manufactured in Iran and militants are trained in Iran to use them , the U.S. military has said .
President Bush , in remarks to reporters in Kuwait , said : " Iran must stop supporting the militia special groups that attack Iraqi and coalition forces , and kidnap and kill Iraqi officials . "
The Bush administration and the military have long maintained that Iranian agents , particularly the Quds Force of Iran 's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps -- have been arming and training Iraqi insurgents .

SOME 7,500 people need an organ transplant in Britain , with many dying for lack of a donor .
This month the government unveiled proposals to tackle the country 's low donor rate .
One idea is to switch to an opt - out system , whereby consent after death is presumed unless potential donors explicitly register their disapproval .
Spain does this and has a donor rate that is nearly three times higher than that of Britain .
But an opt - out system does not guarantee success .
Sweden ( which also has opt-outs ) sees just 15.1 donors per million people , a rate little better than Britain's .

All the comments to my previous post have provided me with hints to increase further the efficiency of a script I am working on .
Here I present the advices I have followed , and the speed gain they provided me .
I will speak of “ speedup ” , instead of timing , because this second set of tests has been made in a different computer .
The “ base ” speed will be the last value of my previous test set ( 1.5 sec in that computer , 1.66 in this one ) .
A speedup of “ 2 ” will thus mean half an execution time ( 0.83 s in this computer ) .
Version 6 : Andrew Dalke suggested the substitution of :
line = re.sub ('>' , '<' , line )
with :
line = line.replace ( '> ' , '<')
Avoiding the re module seems to speed up things , if we are searching for fixed strings , so the additional features of the re module are not needed .
This is true , and I got a speedup of 1.37 .
Version 7 : Andrew Dalke also suggested substituting :
search_cre = re.compile( r' total_credit' ) . search if search_cre ( line ) :
with :
if ' total_credit ' in line :
This is more readable , more concise , and apparently faster .
Doing it increases the speedup to 1.50 .
Version 8 : Andrew Dalke also proposed flattening some variables , and specifically avoiding dictionary search inside loops .
I went further than his advice , even , and substituted :
stat [ ' win ' ] = [ 0,0 ] loop stat [ ' win ' ] [ 0 ] = something stat [ ' win ' ] [ 1 ] = somethingelse
with :
win_stat_0 = 0 win_stat_1 = 0 loop win_stat_0 = something win_stat_1 = somethingelse
This pushed the speedup futher up , to 1.54 .
Version 9 : Justin proposed reducing the number of times some patterns were matched , and extract some info more directly .
I attained that by substituting :
loop : if ' total_credit ' in line : line = line .
replace ('>' , '<') aline = line.split ('<') credit = float ( aline [ 2 ] )
with :
pattern = r'total_credit >( [ ^ <]+ ) <' ; search_cre = re.compile ( pattern ) . search loop : if ' total_credit ' in line : cre = search_cre ( line ) credit = float ( cre.group ( 1 ) )
This trick saved enough to increase the speedup to 1.62 .
Version 10 : The next tweak was an idea of mine .
I was diggesting a huge log file with zcat and grep , to produce a smaller intermediate file , which Python would process .
The structure of this intermediate file is of alternating lines with “ total_credit ” then “ os_name ” then “ total_credit ” , and so on .
When processing this file with Python , I was searching the line for “ total_credit ” to differentiate between these two lines , like this :
for line in f : if ' total_credit ' in line : do something else : do somethingelse
But the alternating structure of my input would allow me to do :
odd =
True for line in f : if odd : do something odd =
False else : do somethingelse odd =
True
Presumably , checking falsity of a boolean is faster than matching a pattern , although in this case the gain was not huge : the speedup went up to 1.63 .
Version 11 : Another clever suggestion by Andrew Dalke was to avoid using the intermediate file , and use os . popen to connect to and read from the zcat / grep command directly .
Thus , I substituted :
os.system ( 'zcat host.gz | grep - F -e total_credit -e os_name > ' + tmp ) f = open ( tmp ) for line in f : do something
with :
f = os.popen ( 'zcat host.gz | grep - F -e total_credit -e os_name ' ) for line in f : do something
This saves disk I/O time , and the performance is increased accordingly .
The speedup goes up to 1.98 .
All the values I have given are for a sample log ( from MalariaControl.net ) with 7 MB of gzipped info ( 49 MB uncompressed ) .
I also tested my scripts with a 267 MB gzipped ( 1.8 GB uncompressed ) log ( from SETI@home ) , and a plot of speedups vs. versions follows :
Execution speedup vs. version
( click to enlarge )
Notice how the last modification ( avoiding the temporary file ) is of much more importance for the bigger file than for the smaller one .
Recall also that the odd / even modification ( version 10 ) is of very little importance for the small file , but quite efficient for the big file ( compare it with Version 9 ) .
The plot does n’t tell ( it compares versions with the same input , not one input with the other ) , but my eleventh version of the script runs the 267 MB log faster than the 7 MB one with Version 1 !
For the 7 MB input , the overall speedup from Version 1 to Version 11 is above 50 .
Country music singer Lee Kernaghan OAM has been named Australian of the Year 2008 at a ceremony in front of Parliament House in Canberra .
Micro-finance entrepreneur David Bussau AM was named as Senior Australian of the Year and MotoGP champion Casey Stoner was announced as Young Australian of the Year .
Johnathon Welch of Choir of Hard Knocks fame was announced as Australia 's Local Hero 2008 .
Kernaghan 's musical achievements - which include 24 golden guitars at the Australian Country Music Awards - are well - known , but tonight 's award reflects his efforts to help rural families through his ' Pass the Hat around ' tours .
The tours have raised up to a $ 1 million for communities in need .
David Bussau is a social entrepreneur and one of the pioneers of the micro-enterprise movement , where developing world poverty is alleviated using small loans to the poor .
In 1979 he co-founded Opportunity International , which has 1.25 million loans to people in 23 countries .
The recipients were presented with their awards by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , who acknowledged the achievements and contributions of all the award finalists .
" This year 's award recipients are great examples of passion and commitment .
They are all proud Australians who have earned our respect and our admiration , " Mr Rudd said .
He paid particular tribute to Kernaghan for his dedication to helping others .
" He has rolled up his sleeves to make a real difference for those in need in rural Australia , " he said .
" Lee is truly an Australian to make us all proud ; you would have to travel a long way to find a better , more genuine bloke than Lee . "
Kernaghan , 43 , described the award as the proudest moment of his life .
" In all my dreams I could never have imagined that I 'd receive an award like this - it 's been a huge surprise and without doubt it 's the greatest honour I have ever been given in my entire life , " he said .
" I do n't think it 's totally sunk in yet , but it 's a humbling experience because I know there is [ a list ] at least a mile long of more worthy recipients for the award than myself . "
Kernaghan said he aimed to use his time as Australian of the Year to bring focus to the plight of families on the land who are struggling against drought and to also encourage people to support home - grown industries .
" Australia is just coming through the worst drought on record and there are families out there still experiencing extreme hardship , " he said .
" What I 'd like to do is look at ways that , individually and as a nation , we can assist those people - that we can support them and help them get back on their feet again . "
More than 3,000 nominations were recieved from the public for the 2008 awards .

Any other stunning , never - saw - that - coming headlines I need to include here ?
Once again the BS BCS , the NCAA ’s laughable insult to the very concepts of competition and moral decency , has failed , and this time they ’ve simply outdone themselves .
They finally managed to get LSU , a more than worthy contender , into the “ championship ” game , but the flagrant back - room conspiracy required to do so was ridiculous .
Let ’s examine some of the nuances of this year ’s college football travesty .
If not for an obscene choke job in Morgantown Saturday night the best team from the best conference – LSU and the SEC , respectively – would not have been allowed to compete for the national title .
That the BCS somehow got that part right only proves that sometimes things work out despite the system , not because of it .
The best team in the second best conference – Southen Cal , probably the best team in the nation at this moment – will not be allowed to compete for the national title .
The best team in the third best conference – Big 12 champ Oklahoma – thanks for showing up .
Buh - bye .
Here ’s another important artifact of the NCAA ’s work of genius .
You can go undefeated and not be allowed to even compete for a shot at the title .
Just for fun , let ’s remind everybody that in their next - to - last games of the season , the two teams playing for the “ national championship ” each lost on their home fields to unranked opponents .
Last week Missouri knocked off Kansas to win the Big 12 North .
So who is the second Big 12 rep to a BCS bowl game ?
Kansas , going to Miami for the Orange .
There ’s more .
Georgia , which finished second in the SEC East , is going to a BCS Bowl – the Sugar – instead of the team they finished behind , Tennessee .
It gets even better .
There was a scenario whereby LSU would n’t get to the title game , but Georgia – which did n’t even make it to the SEC title game – would .
Arguably , this is what should have happened – last night # 1 Missouri and # 2 West Virginia lost , so # 3 Ohio State and # 4 Georgia move up , right ?
This is how the polls work 99 times out of 100 .
Uhh , no , because here ’s where that last - minute engineering thing kicked in .
Voters clearly realized that the system was hutzed to the gills ( it ’s unclear whether they realize that they ’re a big part of why that ’s the case ) and that it would be , well , wrong to rank Georgia ahead of LSU .
( Pretend , if you can , that the system did n’t leapfrog Kansas over Missouri for the Orange Bowl and that Georgia will be appearing in the Sugar instead of their division ’s champion , Tennessee , by the way , as you contemplate the mysteries of these events . )
Never mind that they had Georgia ranked ahead of LSU last week and that UGa did n’t lose – which is the main criterion for deciding movement in the polls .
Today ’s transparent flip - flop by the voters is an acknowledgment of their own stupidity .
They appreciate you not noticing .
But wait , you say – UGa did n’t lose , but LSU did play and win a very big game against SEC East champ Tennessee .
So that ought to count for something , right ?
Well , that would be a compelling argument in the absence of one inconvenient bit of fact .
Georgia did n’t play and got passed over .
But Ohio State did n’t play for the last two weeks and they moved up .
If ever you needed proof that the polls and all those associated with them are a pack of monkey - greased asspipes , that ought to do it .
One team backs in by not playing , while another team ( and I ’d love to see Georgia on the field against OSU – I ’d take the Dawgs and lay two touchdowns right now ) gets punished for it .
By the way , LSU also leapfrogged Virginia Tech , which was ranked a spot ahead of the Tigers in last week ’s poll and which yesterday won its conference championship game .
Now wait a sec , you say – LSU and the Hokies played head to head this season and LSU stomped their balls off , so LSU ought to be ahead of them .
Right .
So why was VT ranked ahead of them last week , then ?
In sum , here ’s what you need to know about the Bowl “ Championship ” Series :
The voters are tools .
The coaches are corrupt .
( The current system allows about half of the coaches in D1 – excuse me , the Bowl Championship Division – to tell the boosters that “ hey , we went to a bowl game !
And half of those get to say “ we won a bowl game !
God bless accountability . )
The athletic directors are corrupt .
The university presidents are corrupt .
The championship will never be decided on the field as long as you ’re alive because it would cost a group of men with bad haircuts and even worse sportcoats a lot of money .
Anybody who refers to the winner of this year ’s big game in the Superdome as the “ national champion ” should be flogged , flayed , de-narded , slathered in pork gravy and chased naked through a pit of half - starved Jack Russell Terriers .
In case you have n’t been counting , I ’ve now written around 900 words without once using “ playoff . ”
So pass the Tostitos , fuck ’em all , and enjoy your meaningless exhibition season .
I ’ll see everybody in March .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - European shares extended losses on Wednesday as oil stocks weighed and British lender Alliance & Leicester ALLL.L kept nerves on edge after taking a writedown and warning of higher funding costs ahead .
At 5:38 a.m. EST , the FTSEurofirst 300 index .
FTEU3 was down 0.9 percent to 1,324.97 points .
Shares in Alliance & Leicester tumbled more than 13 percent after its 2007 profit plunged by around a third and it suffered a $ 360.4 million writedown on its exposure to risky assets .
Vodafone VOD.L was the biggest weighted loser after its joint venture in the United States , Verizon Wireless , said it had started offering flat - rate plans for unlimited calls , raising investors concerns that a price war could break out .
The stock was down 3 percent .
Meanwhile oil stocks also struggled as crude prices eased slightly from the previous session 's record high above $ 100 a barrel .

In recent news , there is a legal battle ( as usual ) with big distributors and others , fighting to eliminate direct sales in Florida .
The newest proposal is saying that direct sales will be limited only to those wineries who produce less than 250,000 gallons of wine per year .
Now how exactly does that figure work for a State that records about 25,000 gallons of wines shipped direct ( all direct statistics ) for all of last year , though this does n’t include those shipped by in - state wineries .
The reports also show that wholesalers / distributors handled about 25,000 gallons of domestic and about 5,000 gallons of imported wine per month .
So direct sales have taken less than 10 % of the business … so far .
Distributors are losing all of that profit , and where is it going … back into the pockets of the wineries who worked so hard to produce the fabulous wines being purchased ?
So how is this new law hurting the majority of the wineries that are shipping into Florida .
After all , if you are a winery producing over 250,000 gallons a year ( 100,000 cases ) , odds are you have a distributor who is taking care of you , and its probably more convenient for the consumer to go buy it at a grocery store anyway .
Does somebody really want to wait on a bottle of Kendall Jackson ?
The concept of direct sales is mostly beneficial to those smaller production wineries that are n’t a staple brand for the distributor .
Regardless of who may benefit more , the fact remains that Florida , one of the nations leading wine consumers , is about to take a step backwards , and if you live in Florida , you should be concerned .
Go to FreetheGrapes.org and personalize a letter to protest the legislation .
It takes just a second , and if you do n’t do it , do n’t complain when your missing out on all the fun of these wines that can only be found direct .

SWEDEN'S government collected the highest share of national income of all rich countries , with neighbouring Denmark a close second , according to figures from 2006 .
In general , government claims a bigger slice of national income than a generation ago , says the OECD .
The tax burden in Europe in 2005 was above the OECD average of 36.2 % of GDP , which itself had leapt up from 29.5 % in 1975 .
Ireland , where the government claimed 31.7 % of GDP , is a comparative tax haven , due partly to a light touch on companies .
America paid less than 30 % of its income in taxes .
Mexico is the least - taxed country , taking 20.6 % of GDP in 2006 .

It 's the holidays , which means shoppers get themselves worked into a frenzy looking for " hot " products that will prove to their children that they love them despite the 11 previous months of shoddy parenting .
Looking to take advantage of some people less internet - savvy than yourself this season ?
Take a gander at the top products that are getting way above their retail value on eBay right now , plus some free tips on getting the highest bid possible with the fewest scruples possible :
Nintendo Wii
Retail Price : $ 250
eBay Prices : $ 300 - $ 450
Yes , yet again the Wii is the hottest gift this year .
If you have one and do n't mind parting with it for a month or so , you could always pack it up in the original box , off it on eBay for a $ 150 profit , then buy one in January when it 'll be easier to come by .

Rock Band
Retail Price : $ 170
eBay Prices : $ 170 - $ 250
The profits are n't as high for Rock Band as they are for the Wii , but if you creatively make your listing look like it 's more than it is ( " Rock Band Special Edition PLUS Guitar PLUS Drums PLUS Microphone PLUS USB Hub !!!! " ) you could eek out a nice profit .
Guitar Hero 3
Retail Price : $ 100
eBay Prices : $ 100 - $ 150
Like Rock Band , you 'll need to make a pretty nice auction page to get a whole lot higher than retail here , but it could be worth making a go of it if you want to take a lot of pictures .

Amazon Kindle
Retail Price : $ 399
e Bay prices : $ 450 - $ 700
The Amazon Kindle sold out almost immediately , and if you were smart you purchased one and did n't open it .
If so , you 've got a little pile of gold , with confused eBay purchasers willing to spend and arm and a leg on the eBook reader .
Even opened Kindles are selling for above retail , so if you 're unimpressed with yours now is the time to get rid of it .
Unlocked iPhone
Retail price : $ 399
e Bay prices : $ 450 - $ 750
If you have the technical know - how to unlock an iPhone for use on carriers other than AT&T ( and really , it is n't rocket science ) , you can make a tidy profit selling an unlocked phone on eBay .
There are few things that would be easier to do than going to your local Apple store , snagging a couple of iPhones , unlocking them , and tossing them up for auction .
Just tell yourself you 're providing a valuable service .
If you 're not afraid of getting coal in your stocking for being a bastard , bump up the prices by jacking up the shipping rates , and hope the buyers do n't notice that you 're charging $ 150 to ship a Wii .
Mention in small print that you 're including a Guitar Hero 2 controller in place of the Guitar Hero 3 controller , or that it 's just the game and not the bundle .
Sell a Wii box and hope no one notices .
There are plenty of ways to be as horribly sleazy as humanly possible on eBay , so get creative !
A guy just sold a copy of Rock Band for a whopping $ 9,000 by telling a sob story about finding his son smoking weed .
Try making an auction selling the same game saying you need money to buy weed for your kid and want to see if you can get more money than that guy .
Even if you do n't , it 'll get more publicity than a standard auction .

Really , at the end of the day , it 's about the spirit of the holidays : ruining other people 's Christmas so yours is better .
Do n't ever let that escape you .
It 's the real spirit of the season .
Jeffrey Jones , a researcher and the Security Strategy Director at Microsoft ’s Trustworthy Computing group , recently posted a report ( PDF format ) that was featured in the CSO online magazine .
The report compared the security track records of both Internet Explorer and Firefox , including both older ( IE 6 and Firefox 1.0 ) and newer ( IE 7 , Firefox 1.5 and 2.0 ) versions .
Jones came to the conclusion that , contrary to popular belief , Internet Explorer has experienced fewer security vulnerabilities than Firefox over the same periods of time .
Now , I can already hear some of you anxiously mashing the " Reply " button in order to point out that Jones ' position as an employee of Microsoft has biased his results and thus they can not be taken at face value .
And Mozilla chief evangelist Mike Shaver has some serious problems with Jones ' methodology ; more on that below .
Jones has anticipated negative reactions and has encouraged readers to challenge his assumptions , analysis , and conclusions by pointing out flaws in his methodology .
Jones collected and cross-checked his data from a number of sources in order to ensure its accuracy .
Disclosed vulnerabilities for Internet Explorer were compiled from Microsoft security bulletins and for Mozilla 's own bulletins for Firefox .
Both sources were checked with the National Vulnerability Database ( NVD ) and sites such as Securityfocus.com , the BugTraq mailing list , Secunia.com , and Securitytracker.com .
Vulnerabilities for IE and Firefox .
Data source : Jeff Jones .
The report looks at vulnerabilities over the last three years , breaking them down into High , Medium , and Low severity categories .
Since November 2004 , Microsoft has fixed 87 total vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer 6 and 7 , while Mozilla has issued 199 fixes to Firefox 1 , 1.5 , and 2.0 .
In addition to looking at the total number of vulnerabilities , Jones broke the issue down into four categories of users : IE users who upgraded to new versions right away , IE users who held off from upgrading as long as they could , and Firefox users of both types .
Interestingly , delaying upgrades made very little difference to the total number of vulnerabilities on either browser .
As shown on the chart , Internet Explorer had significantly fewer vulnerabilities during this time period .
Jones also looked at the trends of vulnerabilities found in new software during its first year of availability : are Microsoft and Mozilla getting better or worse at creating secure software with fewer holes in it ?
He found that IE 6 had 26 vulnerabilities found in its first year , while IE 7 did slightly better with 17 ( IE 7 on Vista , thanks to its improved security capabilities , had only 14 ) .
Firefox had a slightly different trend , with version 1.0 experiencing 66 vulnerabilities , version 1.5 upping the trend with 77 , and version 2.0 beating both with 56 .
Still , these numbers are all higher than IE .
Of course , measuring fixed vulnerabilities is not the whole picture : what about unfixed holes ?
Jones researched this and found 24 disclosed but unfixed holes in Firefox 2 , versus 21 in Internet Explorer 7 .
Jones did not look at earlier versions of either browser , nor did he attempt to estimate the number of undisclosed and unfixed vulnerabilities , which are by their very nature almost impossible to count .
He did also not attempt to count the number of sites that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities , which would also be a difficult task .
While some may still think that malware only targets
IE , the truth is that most malware today does a simple browser version check and loads the appropriate exploit code for IE or Firefox .
Gone are the days of ActiveX - only malware .
A rebuttal from Mozilla
In a blog post today , Mozilla chief evangelist Mike Shaver savaged the Microsoft study .
Shaver points out that Microsoft bundles its fixes together , which means that several IE defects may be repaired , but only one vulnerability accounted for .
" We count every defect distinctly , " argues Shaver .
" We count the ones that Mozilla developers find in - house .
We count the things we do to mitigate defects in other pieces of software , including Windows itself and other third - party plugins .
We count memory behavior that we think might be exploitable , even if no exploit has ever been demonstrated and the issue in question was found in - house .
We open our bugs up after we 've shipped fixes , so that people do n’t have to take our word for our severity ratings . "
Shaver also criticizes Microsoft 's disclosure standards and what he sees as a lack of transparency .
He suggests that Microsoft spend more time fixing bugs instead of " hoping that defects are n't found by someone who they can't keep quiet . "
Mozilla , he argues , is much more transparent and aggressive when it comes to security .
The result ?
" 130 million Firefox users are safer for it every day . "
Some people may criticize Jones ' approach for cherry - picking the time frames to work in Microsoft 's favor : the three - year window neatly coincides with the release of IE 6 for Windows XP SP2 .
This service pack was the culmination of a massive two - year refocusing on security by Microsoft that mandated security training for every developer in the company .
Jones is right to be proud of his company 's accomplishments on the security front , but one suspects that if this same test were run again with an earlier start date , the results would have been rather different .

LIKE a striptease artist in front of an eager audience , Craig Venter has been dropping veils over the past few years without ever quite revealing what people are hoping to see : the world 's first artificial organism .
He has been discussing making one since 1995 , when he worked out the first complete genetic sequence of a natural living organism .
And , after a lot of hard graft and blind alleys , he and his team have almost got there .
As they report in this week 's Science , they have replicated the genome of Mycoplasma genitalium , the species that was the subject of that original sequencing effort .
It is not actual life , but it is surely the tease before the last veil finally falls away .
Though Dr Venter ( pictured above at the helm of his yacht , Sorcerer II ) is the public face of the effort , and the 17 - strong team that did the work are all employed by the J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville , Maryland , the synthetic genome project is equally the brainchild of his collaborator , Hamilton Smith .
Indeed , it is in Dr Smith 's name that the paper announcing the synthesis is published — along , of course , with the 16 others including Dr Venter himself .
It is a formidable effort .
But what is , perhaps , most noteworthy is that the starting point for the project was not the raw nucleotides ( the chemical letters of which DNA is composed ) , but a set of pre-assembled “ cassettes ” of DNA that the team had ordered from commercial suppliers .
The point where any Tom , Dick or Harriet with a reasonably well equipped genetics laboratory could do likewise is not , therefore , that far off .
All you create
M. genitalium 's genome is a single , circular chromosome that is 580,076 letters long , and contains 485 protein - coding genes .
The team divided it on paper into 101 units ( the cassettes ) , each containing four or five genes .
They also took the precaution of editing one gene in particular , so that it would not work .
The gene in question is crucial to M. genitalium 's ability to stick to mammalian cells , and thus become infective ( it lives naturally in the urinary tract and is thought to cause urethritis ) .
Disrupting it thus forestalled the risk of creating anything nasty .
The team placed orders for the cassettes with three firms that turn such things out routinely .
They then used a variety of techniques , some old and some specially invented , to link the cassettes together into larger and larger units until they had two half chromosomes which , with the aid of some yeast cells , they turned into a whole one .
All that remains to create what most researchers in the field would be willing to recognise as an artificial organism is to insert such a chromosome into a bacterial cell that has had its own chromosome removed .
At the moment , no one is clever enough to make all of the cellular machinery that translates genes into the stuff of life .
Hence the need for this shortcut .
But if the newly reconstituted cell were able to grow and reproduce , the nature of its progeny would be dictated by the implanted chromosome .
That , not the nature of the host “ shell ” , would define the species of the progeny .
Dr Venter 's purpose in synthesising artificial genomes is twofold .
Scientifically , he wants to understand how life works .
One way to do this is to discover what he refers to as the minimal genome .
This is a Platonic ideal of life , which would contain only the genes absolutely necessary for survival and reproduction , and might shed light on the nature of Luca , the last universal common ancestor of life on Earth .
In practice , that ideal is difficult to realise , since many genes cover for each other .
He knows that 100 of M. genitalium 's genes can be eliminated individually without killing it , but eliminate all of these and it dies .
Assembling mix - and - match genomes with lots of different combinations of cassettes that each contain but a handful of genes should shed light on the question .
But Dr Venter is also a practical man , who wants to turn genomics into technology .
Indeed , one of his other enterprises is a firm called Synthetic Genomics and he is one of the leading lights of the emerging field of synthetic biology .
This seeks , among other things , to create a parts list of biological components such as DNA cassettes that could be ordered from catalogues in the way that electronic components can be .
Synthetic Genomics itself is a bit cagey about exactly which molecular products it is working on , but one of Dr Venter 's interests is in using modified bacteria to make fuels .
Natural bugs can turn out both hydrogen and methane .
There is talk of modifying them to produce high - value liquid fuels , for jets , say .
He is not alone in this idea .
Several Californian firms are also seeking to make advanced biofuels using modified bacteria .
But if Dr Venter can take the final step of kicking the new , wholly synthetic genome into reproductive life , he will not only have made a great technological leap forward , he will also have erased one of the last mythic distinctions in science — that between living and non-living matter .
Watching that veil drop will have been worth the wait .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A British man has met and married a 22 - year - old woman after , by his own account , dreaming of her phone number and then sending her a text message .
David Brown , 24 , says he woke up one morning after a night out with friends with a telephone number constantly running through his head .
He decided to contact it , sending a message saying “ Did I meet you last night ? . ”
Random recipient Michelle Kitson was confused and wary at first but decided to reply and the two began exchanging messages .
Eventually they met and fell in love .
“ It was really weird but I was absolutely hooked , ” Kitson told the Daily Mail newspaper .
“ My mum and dad kept saying ‘ But he could be an axe murderer ’ , but I knew there was something special about it . ”
After a long courtship , the oddly matched couple -- he ’s six foot seven inches tall and she ’s five foot four -- have just returned from their honeymoon in the Indian resort of Goa .
A love - struck Brown said : “ I ’ve no idea how I ended up with her number in my head -- it ’s only a few digits different from mine . ”
A pair of wild western lowland gorillas in Africa have surprised researchers by engaging in face - to - face mating , the Wildlife Conservation Society announced today .
Though the behavior had been observed before in mountain gorillas , it had never before been seen in the lowland gorilla subspecies — and had never before been photographed in the wild .
Perhaps just as surprising , the female in the photographs — Leah , named after Star Wars 's Princess Leia — is also the first gorilla seen using a tool in the wild .
Conservation biologist Thomas Breuer took the mating photographs in 2005 , but the images are only now being released to the public .
Breuer , of Germany 's Max Planck Institute and the New York - based Wildlife Conservation Society , never expected to observe such a sight .
" Seeing the similarity between humans and gorillas in this respect is fascinating , " he said .
Previously Seen in Zoos
Breuer is conducting a long - term study of gorilla social organization and sexual selection at Mbeli Bai in Nouabalé - Ndoki National Park in Congo .
Most primates mate facing the same direction .
" Bonobos [ mate face - to - face ] routinely — zoo gorillas and zoo chimps too , " said Craig Stanford , an expert in great ape behaviors with the Jane Goodall Research Center at the University of Southern California ( USC ) .
But the behavior — first noted in a spring 2007 edition of the Dewar Wildlife Trust 's Gorilla Gazette , a newsletter for gorilla scientists — had never before been documented among wild western gorillas .
Harem Society
Breuer 's photos might appear to show a couple sharing a special bond as Leah 's daughter Nancy , about four years old at the time , looks on .
But gorillas mate in a harem society .
Leah is just one of four females currently in the harem of her partner .
Her mating partner in the photos , George , is named for a famous president — Washington , not Bush .
And despite her lowly status , Leah appears to be a rather special gorilla .
In 2005 she made news as the first gorilla ever seen to use tools in the wild when she was observed using a walking stick to cross a swampy forest clearing .
Such tool use was considered surprising for wild gorillas , which some believe are less intelligent than other species of tool - wielding great apes .
" That is why this story is so cool , " Max Planck 's Breuer said .
" The fact that it 's the same female makes it extremely interesting . "
Progressive Gorilla ?
USC 's Stanford is n't sure that the unusual copulation sheds much light on gorilla behavior .
" Unless it 's seen widely , it does n't really mean much , " he said .
So is Leah a particularly progressive gorilla ?
Perhaps .
But Max Planck 's Breuer also suggests that her behavior might be rare or simply rarely seen .
" What we know about these gorillas is just a tiny bit , " he said .
" So I 'm kind of hesitant to say she 's particularly special .
I think we 're [ beginning ] to understand the flexibility of their society and natural behavior .
In time we may see more . "
Diane Doran - Sheehy is anthropology chair at Stony Brook University in New York and a grantee of the National Geograpkhic Society 's Committee for Research and Exploration .
( The Society owns National Geographic News . )
She has observed more than 500 gorilla matings in the wild — and none were face - to - face .
" It is an interesting observation and raises questions about why they sometimes engage in it , " she said .
There may be practical considerations given the apes ' marshy habitat , for example .
" Perhaps a female does n't want to be face down in the swamp , " Doran - Sheehy said .
Critical Time
Western lowland gorillas are listed as critically endangered by the World Conservation Union .
Their populations have declined as much as 60 percent in recent years because of illegal hunting , habitat loss , and fatal Ebola fever .
Leah and George 's encounter made their plight even more poignant for Breuer .
" It leads me to think about how similar gorillas can be to humans , [ and yet ] we humans are destroying them , " he said .
Imaginary numbers always confused me .
Like understanding e , most explanations fell into one of two categories :
It ’s a mathematical abstraction , and the equations work out .
Deal with it .
It ’s used in advanced physics , trust us .
Just wait until college .
Gee , what a great way to encourage math in kids !
Today we ’ll assault this topic with our favorite tools :
And our secret weapon : learning by analogy .
We ’ll approach imaginary numbers by observing its ancestor , the negatives .
Here ’s your guidebook :
It does n’t make sense yet , but hang in there .
By the end we ’ll hunt down i and put it in a headlock , instead of the reverse .
Video Walkthrough :
Really Understanding Negative Numbers
Negative numbers are n’t easy .
Imagine you ’re a European mathematician in the 1700s .
You have 3 and 4 , and know you can write 4 – 3 = 1 . Simple .
But what about 3 - 4 ?
What , exactly , does that mean ?
How can you take 4 cows from 3 ?
How could you have less than nothing ?
Negatives were considered absurd , something that “ darkened the very whole doctrines of the equations ” ( Francis Maseres , 1759 ) .
Yet today , it ’d be absurd to think negatives are n’t logical or useful .
Try asking your teacher whether negatives corrupt the very foundations of math .
What happened ?
We invented a theoretical number that had useful properties .
Negatives are n’t something we can touch or hold , but they describe certain relationships well ( like debt ) .
It was a useful fiction .
Rather than saying “ I owe you 30 ” and reading words to see if I ’m up or down , I can write “ - 30 ” and know it means I ’m in the hole .
If I earn money and pay my debts ( - 30 + 100 = 70 ) , I can record the transaction easily .
I have +70 afterwards , which means I ’m in the clear .
The positive and negative signs automatically keep track of the direction — you do n’t need a sentence to describe the impact of each transaction .
Math became easier , more elegant .
It did n’t matter if negatives were “ tangible ” — they had useful properties , and we used them until they became everyday items .
Today you ’d call someone obscene names if they did n’t “ get ” negatives .
But let ’s not be smug about the struggle : negative numbers were a huge mental shift .
Even Euler , the genius who discovered e and much more , did n’t understand negatives as we do today .
They were considered “ meaningless ” results ( he later made up for this in style ) .
It ’s a testament to our mental potential that today ’s children are expected to understand ideas that once confounded ancient mathematicians .
Enter Imaginary Numbers
Imaginary numbers have a similar story .
We can solve equations like this all day long :
The answers are 3 and - 3 .
But suppose some wiseguy puts in a teensy , tiny minus sign :
Uh oh .
This question makes most people cringe the first time they see it .
You want the square root of a number less than zero ?
That ’s absurd !
( Historically , there were real questions to answer , but I like to imagine a wiseguy . )
It seems crazy , just like negatives , zero , and irrationals ( non-repeating numbers ) must have seemed crazy at first .
There ’s no “ real ” meaning to this question , right ?
Wrong .
So - called “ imaginary numbers ” are as normal as every other number ( or just as fake ) : they ’re a tool to describe the world .
In the same spirit of assuming - 1 , .3 , and 0 “ exist ” , let ’s assume some number i exists where :
That is , you multiply i by itself to get - 1 .
What happens now ?
Well , first we get a headache .
But playing the “ Let ’s pretend i exists ” game actually makes math easier and more elegant .
New relationships emerge that we can describe with ease .
You may not believe in i , just like those fuddy old mathematicians did n’t believe in - 1 .
New , brain - twisting concepts are hard and they do n’t make sense immediately , even for Euler .
But as the negatives showed us , strange concepts can still be useful .
I dislike the term “ imaginary number ” — it was considered an insult , a slur , designed to hurt i‘s feelings .
The number i is just as normal as other numbers , but the name “ imaginary ” stuck so we ’ll use it .
Visual Understanding of Negative and Complex Numbers
As we saw last time , the equation $ x ^2 = 9 $ really means :
or
What transformation x , when applied twice , turns 1 to 9 ?
The two answers are “ x = 3 ” and “ x = - 3 ” :
That is , you can “ scale by ” 3 or “ scale by 3 and flip ” ( flipping or taking the opposite is one interpretation of multiplying by a negative ) .
Now let ’s think about $ x ^ 2 = - 1 $ , which is really
What transformation x , when applied twice , turns 1 into - 1 ?
Hrm .
We can’t multiply by a positive twice , because the result stays positive
We can’t multiply by a negative twice , because the result will flip back to positive on the second multiplication
But what about … a rotation !
It sounds crazy , but if we imagine x being a “ rotation of 90 degrees ” , then applying x twice will be a 180 degree rotation , or a flip from 1 to -1 !
Yowza !
And if we think about it more , we could rotate twice in the other direction ( clockwise ) to turn 1 into - 1 .
This is “ negative ” rotation or a multiplication by -i :
If we multiply by - i twice , the first multiplication would turn 1 into - i , and the second turns - i into - 1 .
So there ’s really two square roots of - 1 : i and - i .
This is pretty cool .
We have some sort of answer , but what does it mean ?
i is a “ new imaginary dimension ” to measure a number
i ( or - i ) is what numbers “ become ” when rotated
Multiplying i is a rotation by 90 degrees counter - clockwise
Multiplying by - i is a rotation of 90 degrees clockwise
Two rotations in either direction is - 1 : it brings us back into the “ regular ” dimensions of positive and negative numbers .
Numbers are 2 - dimensional .
Yes , it ’s mind bending , just like decimals or long division would be mind - bending to an ancient Roman .
( What do you mean there ’s a number between 1 and 2 ? ) .
It ’s a strange , new way to think about math .
We asked “ How do we turn 1 into - 1 in two steps ? ” and found an answer : rotate it 90 degrees .
It ’s a strange , new way to think about math .
But it ’s useful .
( By the way , this geometric interpretation of complex numbers did n’t arrive until decades after i was discovered ) .
Also , keep in mind that having counter - clockwise be positive is a human convention — it easily could have been the other way .
Finding Patterns
Let ’s dive into the details a bit .
When multiplying negative numbers ( like - 1 ) , you get a pattern :
1 , -1 , 1 , -1 , 1 , -1 , 1 , -1
Since - 1 does n’t change the size of a number , just the sign , you flip back and forth .
For some number “ x ” , you ’d get :
x , -x , x , -x , x , -x …
This idea is useful .
The number “ x ” can represent a good or bad hair week .
Suppose weeks alternate between good and bad ; this is a good week ; what will it be like in 47 weeks ?
So -x means a bad hair week .
Notice how negative numbers “ keep track of the sign ” : we can throw $ ( - 1 ) ^ { 47} $ into a calculator without having to count ( ” Week 1 is good , week 2 is bad … week 3 is good … “ ) .
Things that flip back and forth can be modeled well with negative numbers .
Ok .
Now what happens if we keep multiplying by $ i$ ?
Very funny .
Let ’s reduce this a bit :
$ 1 = 1 $ ( No questions here )
$ i = i$ ( Ca n’t do much )
$ i^2 = - 1 $ ( That ’s what i is all about )
$ i^3 = ( i \cdot i ) \cdot i = - 1 \cdot i = - i$ ( Ah , 3 rotations counter - clockwise = 1 rotation clockwise .
Neat . )
$ i^4 = ( i \cdot i ) \cdot ( i \cdot i ) = - 1 \ cdot - 1 = 1 $ ( 4 rotations bring us “ full circle ” )
$ i^5 = i^4 \cdot i = 1 \cdot i = i$ ( Here we go again … )
Represented visually :
We cycle every 4th rotation .
This makes sense , right ?
Any kid can tell you that 4 left turns is the same as no turns at all .
Now rather than focusing on imaginary numbers ( $ i$ , $ i ^ 2 $ ) , look at the general pattern :
X , Y , -X , -Y , X , Y , -X , -Y …
Like negative numbers modeling flipping , imaginary numbers can model anything that rotates between two dimensions “ X ” and “ Y ” .
Or anything with a cyclic , circular relationship — have anything in mind ?
‘ Cos it ’d be a sin if you did n’t .
There ’ll de Moivre be more in future articles .

Understanding Complex Numbers
There ’s another detail to cover : can a number be both “ real ” and “ imaginary ” ?
You bet .
Who says we have to rotate the entire 90 degrees ?
If we keep 1 foot in the “ real ” dimension and another in the imaginary one , it looks like this :
We ’re at a 45 degree angle , with equal parts in the real and imaginary ( 1 + i ) .
It ’s like a hotdog with both mustard and ketchup — who says you need to choose ?
In fact , we can pick any combination of real and imaginary numbers and make a triangle .
The angle becomes the “ angle of rotation ” .
A complex number is the fancy name for numbers with both real and imaginary parts .
They ’re written a + bi , where
a is the real part
b is the imaginary part
Not too bad .
But there ’s one last question : how “ big ” is a complex number ?
We ca n’t measure the real part or imaginary parts in isolation , because that would miss the big picture .
Let ’s step back .
The size of a negative number is not whether you can count it — it ’s the distance from zero .
In the case of negatives this is :
Which is another way to find the absolute value .
But for complex numbers , how do we measure two components at 90 degree angles ?
It ’s a bird … it ’s a plane … it ’s Pythagoras !
Geez , his theorem shows up everywhere , even in numbers invented 2000 years after his time .
Yes , we are making a triangle of sorts , and the hypotenuse is the distance from zero :
Neat .
While measuring the size is n’t as easy as “ dropping the negative sign ” , complex numbers do have their uses .
Let ’s take a look .
A Real Example : Rotations
We ’re not going to wait until college physics to use imaginary numbers .
Let ’s try them out today .
There ’s much more to say about complex multiplication , but keep this in mind :
Multiplying by a complex number rotates by its angle
Let ’s take a look .
Suppose I ’m on a boat , with a heading of 3 units East for every 4 units North .
I want to change my heading 45 degrees counter - clockwise .
What ’s the new heading ?
Some hotshot will say “ That ’s simple !
Just take the sine , cosine , gobbledegook by the tangent … fluxsom the foobar … and … “ .
Crack .
Sorry , did I break your calculator ?
Care to answer that question again ?
Let ’s try a simpler approach : we ’re on a heading of 3 + 4i ( whatever that angle is ; we do n’t really care ) , and want to rotate by 45 degrees .
Well , 45 degrees is 1 + i ( perfect diagonal ) , so we can multiply by that amount !
Here ’s the idea :
Original heading : 3 units East , 4 units North = 3 + 4i
Rotate counter - clockwise by 45 degrees = multiply by 1 + i
If we multiply them together we get :
So our new orientation is 1 unit West ( - 1 East ) , and 7 units North , which you could draw out and follow .
But yowza !
We found that out in 10 seconds , without touching sine or cosine .
There were no vectors , matrices , or keeping track what quadrant we are in .
It was just arithmetic with a touch of algebra to cross-multiply .
Imaginary numbers have the rotation rules baked in : it just works .
Even better , the result is useful .
We have a heading ( - 1 , 7 ) instead of an angle ( atan ( 7 / - 1 ) = 98.13 , keeping in mind we ’re in quadrant 2 ) .
How , exactly , were you planning on drawing and following that angle ?
With the protractor you keep around ?
No , you ’d convert it into cosine and sine ( -.14 and .99 ) , find a reasonable ratio between them ( about 1 to 7 ) , and sketch out the triangle .
Complex numbers beat you to it , instantly , accurately , and without a calculator .
If you ’re like me , you ’ll find this use mind - blowing .
And if you do n’t , well , I ’m afraid math does n’t toot your horn .
Sorry .
Trigonometry is great , but complex numbers can make ugly calculations simple ( like calculating cosine ( a+b ) ) .
This is just a preview ; later articles will give you the full meal .
Aside : Some people think “ Hey , it ’s not useful to have North / East headings instead of a degree angle to follow ! ”
Really ?
Ok , look at your right hand .
What ’s the angle from the bottom of your pinky to the top of your index finger ?
Good luck figuring that out on your own .
With a heading , you can at least say “ Oh , it ’s X inches across and Y inches up ” and have some chance of working with that bearing .
Complex Numbers Aren’t
That was a whirlwind tour of my basic insights .
Take a look at the first chart — it should make sense now .
There ’s so much more to these beautiful , zany numbers , but my brain is tired .
My goals were simple :
Convince you that complex numbers were considered “ crazy ” but can be useful ( just like negative numbers were )
Show how complex numbers can make certain problems easier , like rotations
If I seem hot and bothered about this topic , there ’s a reason .
Imaginary numbers have been a bee in my bonnet for years — the lack of an intuitive insight frustrated me .
Now that I ’ve finally had insights , I ’m bursting to share them .
But it frustrates me that you ’re reading this on the blog of a wild - eyed lunatic , and not in a classroom .
We suffocate our questions and “ chug through ” — because we do n’t search for and share clean , intuitive insights .
Egad .
But better to light a candle than curse the darkness : here ’s my thoughts , and one of you will shine a spotlight .
Thinking we ’ve “ figured out ” a topic like numbers is what keeps us in Roman Numeral land .
There ’s much more complex numbers : check out the details of complex arithmetic .
Happy math .
Epilogue :
But they ’re still strange !
I know , they ’re still strange to me too .
I try to put myself in the mind of the first person to discover zero .
Zero is such a weird idea , having “ something ” represent “ nothing ” , and it eluded the Romans .
Complex numbers are similar — it ’s a new way of thinking .
But both zero and complex numbers make math much easier .
If we never adopted strange , new number systems , we ’d still be counting on our fingers .
I repeat this analogy because it ’s so easy to start thinking that complex numbers are n’t “ normal ” .
Let ’s keep our mind open : in the future they ’ll chuckle that complex numbers were once distrusted , even until the 2000’s .

Letterman : Gonzales stepping down but ' ca n't recall ' why
David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday August 28 , 2007
Print This Email This
The Alberto Gonzales resignation provided the inevitable subject of David Letterman 's top ten list -- and a good bit of quip fodder for his opening monologue -- on Monday evening 's installment of CBS 's Late Show .
" Beautiful , beautiful day here in New York City , " said Letterman at the top of the progam .
" So nice that Alberto Gonzales was happy to be out of work . "
" By the way , " the host zinged a moment later , " during that last joke another cabinet member resigned . "
Still zeroed - in on the attorney general , Letterman deadpanned " Alberto Gonzales is stepping down -- but he can't recall why , " adding " but actually , he will be replaced by Drew Carey , " as band - leader Paul Shaffer struck up the Price is Right game show theme .
Later , in the show 's signature feature , Letterman rattled off the top ten reasons Alberto Gonzales resigned , including " Felt he was n't incompetent enough for the Bush administration , " and " Did n't want to be around for transition to the Kucinich administration . "
The following video is from CBS 's Late Show , broadcast on August 27 .
/ pop /un-lurks .
Hi there , I ’ve been lurking almost a year now , trying to get up the bottle to post my one and only story worth telling and I think I ’ve found just the QOTW to do it .
I will apologise in advance for any excessive length and also for any slurring which may occur - this is due to Dutch courage in the form of Scottish Water .
It is on topic , but you ’ll have to stick with it .
Well , where to begin ?
( not so easy this is it ? ) How about 1978 ?
I was 17 and while not a geek - I ’ve never been a geek - I was a nerd .
Kind of .
I was into Punk but was n’t really a punk , I was tall and a bit spotty and I liked maths .
My best friend Nick however , was cool .
He was a ladies man and bass guitarist with a post - punk band .
We ’d known each other since junior school and had become best friends in about the 3rd year .
I was more political than him , thanks to my elder brother .
I went on marches a lot and in the holidays I got together with like minded friends from school and we ’d volunteer down at the Anti-Nazi League HQ , stuffing envelopes etc .
We were keen and our hearts were in the right place .
I also got to mix with girls , though I was yet to have a girlfriend , and one of the girls was Manisha .
She was a year younger than me - still in the 5th form , but would soon be a lower - 6th former .
She was born in South Africa and was a ‘ Cape coloured ’ , i.e. her parents ’ families came originally from India .
The whole family was heavily involved in the struggle against apartheid : her grandfather and uncle were lawyers and belonged to the same practise as Nelson Mandela ( before his imprisonment , that is ) ; her auntie had been imprisoned for a time in Robben Island .
When Manisha and her brother Anand were 6 and 4 , the family had fled to the UK where they claimed political asylum .
Ten years on the family were still not UK citizens but ‘ stateless ’ i.e. they had no passports .
As well as being highly political aware , Manisha was a peach and I fancied her silently but fervently from afar .
We got on very well and soon we were both part of a tight group of mates .
This was great until the tragedy stuck ; she and Nick fell in love .
It was full - blown teenage love and I made the best of things , i.e. suffered silently and became a much bruised gooseberry .
I got a Saturday job in a department store restaurant kitchen and when Manisha was looking for a job too , I put in a good word for her and she got a job as a waitress .
This gave me more opportunity to eat my heart out , but it also gave us time to get to know each other better .
As the ‘ middle - man ’ , I could give sound relationship advice , listen to her moans and gripes etc .
I found it easy to talk to her and we became very good friends .
Then the two of them broke up .
I had both of them crying on my shoulders - I ’ve always been a good listener , but this tried my patience somewhat .
Anyway , it meant that we saw less of each other except at work .
I did n’t want to be disloyal to Nick .
I ’ll skip forward here to 1980 .
I ’d got decent grades for Maths , Further Maths , Economics and Government & Politics A Levels and was now an accounting student at Southampton University .
I managed to lose the ‘ V - plates ’ at long last [ thanks Trish ! ] and was a studious student as those things go .
My musical taste was a bit left - of - centre , more punk and reggae than heavy metal and I was pathetically glad to be ‘ interesting ’ as far as accountancy students go - and believe me , that ’s not far .
Half way through the year I got a letter from Manisha !
She was thinking of going to Southampton too and wanted to visit .
Fine !
She came down , but with some boyfriend in tow .
I spent a day showing them round before they went back to London .
The next time I saw her was a scene straight out of ‘ It ’s a Wonderful Life ’ - the one where George Bailey meets
Mary at the college party - except this time it was the freshers ’ ball .
She ’d finished with the boyfriend by then and at 18 she looked sensational .
I mean jaw - droppingly gorgeous .
No , that does n’t even come close .
Well , you ’ve all been in love at 19 have n’t you ?
Is there anything better in the whole world ?
We spent that night in my room in the house I was sharing with two other guys from our school and a friend of ours .
That year , she hardly spent a single night in her room in halls .
I ’ll leave the details to your over - fertile imaginations , this is n’t the place .
She loved teasing me though , in more ways than one , and used to call me ‘ Beenie Man ’ - the reggae lovin ’ bean counter .
Things went smoothly , I graduated with a first after a final year in which we ’d shared our own flat - just like an old married couple .
Our musical tastes coincided exactly , and one of the happiest days I can remember was when Clint Eastwood and General Saint played at the Uni .
We were both right down at the front , lightly stoned , grooving away as if … sod it , ca n’t think of a good analogy , but you get the picture .
In contrast , although I can’t remember where I was when I heard John Lennon was dead , I can picture exactly the scene as we sat up in bed listening to Radio 1 when it was announced that Bob Marley had died .
We put ‘ Redemption Song ’ on so loud I could n’t hear her crying .
We loved that album , and I ’d tease her sometimes when she took an age to get ready or something : “ Bob ’s right you know - ‘ no woman , no cry ’ .
Get a bloody move on !
” “ I like a man who cries , ” she ’d say , “ OK , you can stay .
” The next year I moved back to London and rented a flat in Walthamstow .
Manisha came up to stay weekends and holidays and had a room in halls for week days .
I ’d got a job with one of the ‘ Big Five ’ accounting firms and was also taking an MBA .
They sponsored it and gave me time off too , I was earning good money and was happy .
As soon as Manisha graduated ( History and Politics ) we got married .
Just a small registry office thing .
Her parents were devout communists , and I ’m a non-practising reform Jew .
Now she could finally get a passport as she was a UK citizen .
We used it first time for our honeymoon in the Maldives .
Although house prices were rising fast in London by then - this was 1983 - we were both working and we found a real do - er up - er round the corner within our limit .
Skip again a couple of years and 1986 , Manisha became pregnant .
I ’d got my MBA and a promotion and we decided she should take a couple of years off work to be a Mum .
She was working for the GLC and it was about to be abolished anyway , so we thought it must be fate .
Now , if you or your partner has been pregnant you will know about the changes the female body goes through .
One of them is the enlargement of the breasts - this is necessary to produce milk of course - but Manisha had a large birthmark on her left breast .
It was made up of lots of tiny moles really close together , making a dark , raised area , looking something like a relief map of Crete but about four or five inches across .
As her breasts grew , so did this birthmark , and it started to itch too .
It had never caused any sort of bother before , but this was a bit disturbing , so off to the GP we went .
She took a look , asked some questions and said that it was probably nothing to worry about but she ’d make a note to take another look after the baby was born .
This is where the mix tape comes in for the first time .
From other posts , this seems to be fairly common - I think that ’s down to Dr Miriam Stoppard and her babycare / pregnancy books .
I think it was in her checklist of things to put in the ‘ birthing bag ’ .
Anyway , on this little beauty was a load of reggae of course : Marley , Culture , Burning Spear , Misty in Roots , plus a load of punk tracks like Buzzcocks - ‘ Ever fallen in love with someone ’ ; Ian Dury - ‘ Reasons to be Cheerful ’ ; Xtc ‘ Making plans for nigel ’ ; Ruts ‘ Babylon ’s burning ’ ; The Higsons ‘ Conspiracy ’ ; Madness ‘ My girl ’s mad at me ’ ; Elvis Costello ‘( Ido n’t want to go to ) Chelsea ’ etc etc .
I wo n’t bore you with the full listing .
August 1987 she was born - our little Jasmine - and you know when I mentioned 19 year olds in love earlier - well that was as nothing compared to the feeling you get holding your own tiny little child in your arms , well not quite , but different .
I ca n’t explain it to you if you ’ve not got any kids , and if you have , then I do n’t need to .
All was well at bean - counting towers .
I took a couple of weeks off work and we adjusted to the little one , she seemed to like us …… in September , the doctor sent a letter reminding us about checking out the birthmark .
This time , she suggested a specialist look at it , and the best place would be the Royal Marsden .
OK , well , hmmm , I suppose that ’s the best place , you know best etc .
The doctor arranged it and in early February 1988 she went in for a biopsy .
Now I did n’t know what this meant and was scared to ask really , but Manisha said they ’d look at the birthmark and see whether it was benign or malign .
No point worrying til then .
I had n’t realised they would cut the whole thing out !
She went in with an over - night bag , including tape and walkman , by taxi - she did n’t want us dropping her off as Jazzy would be asleep .
I kissed her goodbye and arranged to visit the next day which would be February 13th - I promised to bring some flowers and the baby .
When we arrived at the ward the next afternoon in visiting time laden down with a dozen red roses and a bundled up baby I was shocked .
All the other women on the ward looked to be in a really bad way .
Quite a few were bald from chemotherapy , lots looking not just old but ancient , wasted , drained , all life sapped away .
And there was Manisha , propped up in bed , a huge bandage on her chest under her nightgown .
Jaz spotted her and reached her tiny arms out towards her , but a nurse swooped down on us , saying , something like : let me take her for a minute while you two have a talk - before snatching her away , cooing in her 6 - month old adorable face passing her around the nurses and patients as if we were n’t there .
It ’s true that , like a fairy drawing colour with a wand in a black and white cartoon , her presence created smiles , spreading down the ward in her wake .
With one eye on the nurse , I went to talk with Manisha , who was a bit upset not to have Jasmine in her arms , but otherwise seemed OK .
They did n’t have the results of the test yet and she ’d have to stay another night , but all being well would be home in a couple of days .
I found a vase for the roses , reclaimed the baby , chatted about this and that and when visiting ended at 5.30 , off we went .
The phone was ringing as I opened the front door - not an easy manoeuvre with a bundle of baby on your hip and a bag of nappies etc. in the other hand .
It was still ringing though and I reached it in time to answer .
“ Mr Bean - counter ? ” “ Yes , ” “ It ’s the Royal Marsden here , ” “ Oh yes , ” Jasmine was wanting to be put down so I said , “ just a sec , ” while I put her down .
“ Mr Bean - counter , ” “ Yes , ” “ It ’s about your wife , ” “ Yes , ” “ There ’s been a complication , ” possibly the four most horrible words in the English language .
“ Yes , ” my brain had frozen and my body was shutting down , “ what is it ?
” “ It was just after you left .
She suffered a pulmonary embolism - a blood clot lodged in her pulmonary artery and cut off the blood supply to her lungs .
The thing is , she had her Walkman on and her eyes closed and by the time the nurse noticed and called the doctor I ’m afraid it was too late .
She died just after 6.00 pm .
I ’m so very sorry Mr Bean - counter .
” Even today , there are tears running down my face and dripping into the whiskey glass shaking in my hand .
The shock at that time was total - luckily , it numbed some of the pain , and time passed in a fog .
I could n’t describe the next few weeks even if I wanted to .
My Mum came to stay and looked after Jasmine while I was sorting out things and crying myself to sleep .
I took a month off work to think what to do , anyway , I could barely count to ten .
I found a nursery that would take Jasmine while I was at work , but after two weeks I handed in my resignation .
The people at work were great but I just did n’t want to be there , I could n’t bear to leave Jasmine at the nursery in the mornings .
I decided to move to Southampton and set up as a self - employed accountant .
That way I could work from home .
At least I did n’t have to worry about money for a while .
The life insurance paid off the mortgage , I put the house on the market .
In the short time we ’d been there the value had shot up , I sold up and bought a big place in Southampton which would serve as home and office .
I played that tape I ’d made for her over and over again .
The first track was ‘ No woman , no cry ’ .
By the way , Bob was wrong , so very , very wrong .
I just tried holding on to the lines that said “ Everything ’s going to be alright ” , but it was a damned close run thing at times .
By the time Jasmine was a year old , she must have heard the tape over a hundred times , and “ Do n’t worry , Jaz , everything ’s going to be alright ” was a kind of mantra of mine .
You have to pull yourself together when you ’re looking after a baby , and if there was one thing keeping me going it was Jasmine .
There was so much of Manisha ’s face in hers …
God , I wish that was the end of my story .
Briefly , over the next few years , I built up a business doing books for small and medium sized businesses in the area .
I could do it virtually in my sleep which was good , and it kept me busy , which was also good .
I made some friends , got recommended .
One of my old housemates still lived in Southampton and taught at the University and Manisha ’s family ( especially Anand and his wife ) as well as my family visited a lot , so I had plenty of human contact .
Quite a few of my clients were self - employed builders and tradesmen , one was Steve who was a plumber .
When his daughter Michelle wanted to open a hairdressing salon , he asked me to look after the finances for her .
Steve and his mates did the place up for her for the cost of the materials and she ’d done an apprenticeship , had HND and whatnot , she was in her mid-20s , pretty , unattached ; I was in my early thirties by this time and had n’t wanted or sought out female company since Manisha died six or so years previously .
You may doubt this was so , but firstly , my heart was burnt to ashes , secondly , I ’d turned off this part of my life and thirdly , I was a single Dad with a little kid - not so easy to do anything about it , even if I wanted to .
But , little by little , I got friendly with Michelle .
She was …undemanding company but she actually made me laugh and I could tell she liked me .
She got me to bring Jasmine to her shop and did her hair for her which thrilled her , as I was her usual hairdresser at that time .
I still did n’t make any move though and it was her idea in the end - she invited both of us for dinner at her place …
… Six months on and she ’d come and stay at our place at weekends .
She left womanly bits and pieces in the bathroom , took over a couple of drawers in my bedroom .
I went along with things , maybe I should n’t have .
It was a couple of weeks before Valentine ’s Day .
You can imagine how I felt about that date .
She wanted to go out to a restaurant but I told her not to come the following week as we wanted to be alone and we’d be up in London , visiting Kew Gardens , where Manisha ’s ashes were scattered in the bluebell wood .
I suppose she felt it was time for me to ‘ get over it ’ and get on with life .
I disagreed , we went to bed in foul moods and woke up the same way .
At breakfast , Jasmine was acting up ; I was making a pot of coffee , so I did n’t see what happened but Michelle started shouting at Jasmine .
As I turned round , Jasmine threw a spoonful of cereal at Michelle and Michelle pulled her out of her seat and smacked her on the bum … … before I knew what was happening , I ’d pulled Michelle ’s arm round with my left hand and smacked her across the face with the flat of my right hand , then I was shouting in her face “ IF YOU SO MUCH AS EVER TOUCH ONE HAIR OF THAT CHILD ’S HEAD AGAIN , SO HELP ME , I’LL KILL YOU ” I bent down and gathered up the screaming Jasmine in my arms , ran out of the kitchen and up to her room , murmuring “ Do n’t worry Jaz , everything ’s going to be alright . ”
When she ’d calmed down a bit I said “ OK Jaz , we ’re going out for the day , get yourself dressed , I ’ll be back up in a minute ” Back in the kitchen , Michelle was looking furious but had n’t moved .
“ OK , ” I said , “ I ’m really sorry I hit you , but this is n’t working .
It was never going to work .
I ’m taking Jasmine out , clear all your stuff out before we get back .
” “ You ’re fucking dead you .
I ’m gonna tell my Dad you slimeball and you ’re gonna wish you ’d never been born .
” “ Too fucking late for that you cow , been there , done it .
Just be gone or you ’ll be the sorry one .
” I took Jasmine to the seaside .
We had a favourite place where there was a café and some shops on the front and a good long beach .
At times of stress I still sometimes fall back on cigarettes , at that time I did .
I very rarely smoke in front of Jaz but I did then .
We went into the café , got a table by the window , I got me a large black coffee and a hot chocolate and a cake for Jaz and I smoked , staring out of the window at the cold blustery February morning .
“ Daddy , what was Mummy really like ? ”
Jasmine asked as I lit a second cigarette .
I could n’t get a word out at first , but the tears started again .
She came round the table and gave me a huge hug , “ Do n’t worry Daddy , everything ’s going to be alright , ” she said .
“ That ’s right Jaz , ” I said , “ everything ’s going to be alright .
Let ’s take a walk on the beach , and I ’ll tell you all about Mummy . ”
We spent a couple of hours walking along the beach , throwing stones in the water , picking up shells , and I told her stories about when the two of us were young students , or when we were working together as 6th formers and when we were newlyweds before she was born .
When we got back to the house the front door was wide open .
Shit .
I went inside first and made Jasmine wait just outside the front door .
I stopped in the doorway to the living room .
Inside , all of the photos of me and Manisha had been smashed and crumpled or torn and all over the room was tape .
She ’d taken the special tape and pulled it all out of the cassette , stretching it and tying it around things , yards and yards of thin brown tape , totally beyond repair .
I stumbled out and into the rest of the rooms ; the bedroom was a mess and all over the house the photos had been broken .
Luckily that was all .
I had re-prints made of all the photos from the negatives and I made the tape again .
I knew the order of songs off by heart and still had most of them on disc , though some now had scratches and jumps where they had n’t the first time I ’d taped them .
I ’ve met a few women since , but I ’ve not brought them home .
I ’ve not met anyone I ’d trust that far .
Jaz knows that I ’m always there for her .
A couple of years ago she went off to university and it was as if I ’d lost an arm ; I ’m still trying to get used to it .
The house is so damned quiet all the time .
She knows if she ’s feeling low , I ’ll drive the 450 mile round trip to bring her home at a minute ’s notice .
Each February at the nearest weekend , we go to the same beach , come rain or shine and I tell her stories about her Mum .
The next day we drive up to London , with the tape on the player and we wander round the woods at Kew and I tell her more stories .
As she ’s got older , I find I can tell her different stories , I think she knows her Mum pretty well now .
Thanks for listening - I do n’t feel any better yet , but I can see that I will do soon .
Sorry it was so long . ( , Tue 12 Feb 2008 , 10:17 , 60 replies
Reality catches up with Giuliani
Various polling outfits have been asking voters about their 2008 presidential preferences since , believe it or not , 2005 .
And in every national poll for more than two years , former mayor Rudy Giuliani has led the Republican field , often by quite a bit .
It led the political world to give Giuliani an awkward title : frontrunner .
It was awkward , of course , in large part because it did n’t make any sense .
Giuliani had extremely high name recognition , which buoyed his national standing , but in the early primary / caucus states , his support has been somewhere between bad and awful since the summer .
Giuliani ’s campaign has clung to the notion that he could suffer huge defeats in all of the early contests and still win the nomination thanks to the support reflected in the national polls .
Except , as it turns out , that support was very wide , extremely thin , and now completely gone .
Two weeks before the Iowa caucus , the race for president , while tightening among Democrats , is wide open on the Republican side , highlighting the unusual fluidity of the first campaign for the White House in over a half - century that does n’t include an incumbent president or vice president .
A new Wall Street Journal / NBC
News poll shows that Rudy Giuliani has lost his national lead in the Republican field after a flurry of negative publicity about his personal and business activities , setting the stage for what could be the party ’s most competitive nomination fight in decades .
Last March , the same poll found that 58 % of Republicans had a favorable view of Giuliani .
That number now stands at 37 % .
In other words , GOP voters are n’t just shifting their allegiances as the race gets more competitive , they ’re also looking at Giuliani more , and are increasingly unimpressed .
Josh asks ,
“ Is there any rationale for still calling him the frontrunner ? ” I think not .
One other noteworthy trend in Republican polls is the growing distinction between faith - based voters and everyone else .
A new ABC / WaPo poll in Iowa shows a two - man race between Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney , which is consistent with everything we ’ve seen in recent weeks , but highlights the key factor driving the Iowa contest : religion .
Religion is driving the Republican presidential race in Iowa , with Mike Huckabee taking the lead on the strength of overwhelming support from evangelical voters — and Mitt Romney falling behind over concerns about his Mormon faith .
Huckabee , who jumped into contention in Iowa a month ago , has soared further among his key groups — weekly churchgoers , abortion opponents , conservatives and , above all , evangelical Protestants , who account for nearly four in 10 likely caucus - goers .
They now favor Huckabee over Romney by a 3 - 1 margin , 57 percent to 19 percent .
Romney , for his part , holds a slight lead among the nearly eight in 10 Iowa Republicans who say his religion does n’t matter in their vote .
That ’s probably a predictable result , but it ’s still striking .
It ’s been obvious for a while that Huckabee ’s ability to rally evangelicals is the key to his support , but it ’s unusual to see this kind of stark contrast — those driven by matters of faith are backing the former Baptist preacher , everyone else is gravitating towards the more policy - focused governor / businessman .
Welcome to the GOP ’s Intra -Party Culture War of 2007 .
Aides said Mr. Bush agreed to speak so freely with Mr. Draper only after years of lobbying , in which Mr. Draper said he finally convinced Mr. Bush and his aides that he was writing about him as “ a consequential president ” for history , not for the latest news cycle .
And aides said they saw the book as the first effort to write about Mr. Bush in the context of nearly his entire presidency .
The lobbying culminated at a meeting at the White House last August in which Mr. Bush grilled Mr. Draper on why he should cooperate with him of all the authors likely to come knocking .
Mr. Draper replied that his book could provide “ the raw material ” for others after him , a point Mr. Bush apparently came to embrace .
Mr. Draper , a Texan like Mr. Bush and a former writer for Texas Monthly , spent hours interviewing Mr. Bush and his close circle of aides in 1998 , when he wrote an early , defining article on Mr. Bush ’s budding presidential candidacy for GQ magazine .
Mr. Draper ’s family also has a history with Mr. Bush ’s .
Mr. Bush ’s father in 1982 was an honorary pallbearer at the funeral of Mr. Draper ’s grandfather , Leon Jaworski , a special prosecutor in the Watergate scandal .
As Mr. Draper described it , Mr. Bush began the interview process over lunch last Dec. 12 , in a week when he suddenly had free time because his highly anticipated announcement of a new Iraq strategy had been postponed .
Sitting in an anteroom of the Oval Office , he eschewed the more formal White House menu for comfort food — a low - fat hotdog and ice cream — and bitingly told an aide who peeked in on the session that his time with Mr. Draper was “ worthless anyway . ”
But as Mr. Draper described it , and as the transcripts show , Mr. Bush warmed up considerably over the intervening interviews , chewing on an unlit cigar , jubilantly swatting at flies between making solemn points , propping his feet up on a table or stopping him at points to say emphatically , “ I want you to get this ” or “ I want this damn book to be right . ”
A twenty - one year - old reader writes :
There 's one salient reason why people of my age are supporting Obama and that 's because we feel that Obama will finally show us what it means to be proud of our president .
I read more than I should about politics and US history and am always confused as to how Americans can love their president so .
Intellectually I understand why Americans love (d ) Lincoln and the Roosevelts but I never felt why they did .
Andrew , people my age are too young to remember Bill Clinton .
All we have is George W. Bush .
The office of the President to us is a mockery .
We do n't link President Bush to concepts such as leader , we link it to ignorance and idiocy .
Most people my age have never felt proud of our President .
We grew up on the Daily Show , we only know how to make fun of him and mock him .
I attended an Obama rally a few days ago and was amazed at how filled up with emotion I was .
Halfway through his speech , other 21 year olds just like that filled the Hall were screaming their heads off , waving banners , and grinning .
Everyone was giddy , hell even I was giddy .
I was smiling and chanting along to " Yes We Can . "
I did n't know what that feeling was because I had never felt it .
But then I realized it .
It was pride .
I was proud of Obama .
I know you 've felt proud of Reagan and others have felt proud of Bill Clinton .
I can't wait to actually know what it feels like to be proud of my President and not embarrassed by him .
That 's why at least my generation is turning out in droves to make Obama president .
We 've finally got a taste of what it feels like to be proud of our President and we 're not giving that feeling up .
GENEVA --
Let the blogging begin .
The IOC has given athletes the right to blog at the Beijing Games this summer , a first for the Olympics , as long as they follow the many rules it set to protect copyright agreements , confidential information and security .
Blogging is a " legitimate form of personal expression , " the International Olympic Committee said .
The IOC said blogs by athletes " should take the form of a diary or journal " and should not contain any interviews with other competitors at the games .
They also should not write about other athletes .
" It is required that , when accredited persons at the games post any Olympic content , it be confined solely to their own personal Olympic - related experience , " the IOC said .
The debate over blogging has been a difficult one for the IOC , which has been concerned that the online journals might infringe on copyright agreements or release confidential information during the Aug.
8 - 24 Beijing Olympics .
Bloggers are prevented from posting audio clips or videos of " any Olympic events , including sporting action , opening , closing and medal ceremonies or other activities which occur within any zone which requires an Olympic identity and accreditation card [ or ticket ] for entry . "
Still pictures are allowed as long as they do not show Olympic events .
Athletes must obtain the consent of their competitors if they wish to photograph them .
Also , athletes cannot use their blogs for commercial gain .
" No advertising and / or sponsoring may be visible on screen at the same time as Olympic content , " the IOC said .
The IOC said accredited participants in the Olympics also " should not disclose any information ... which may compromise the security , staging and organization of the games . "
The same rule applies for the security of athletes ' teams .
Domain names for blogs should not include any word similar to " Olympic " or " Olympics . "
Bloggers are , however , urged to link their blogs to official Olympic Web sites .
僕も学生なのだけ ど(一応)、仕事をしているチームにプログラマをスカウトするために何人もの学生プログラマと会ってきた。能力はいろいろ。Linuxのソースをガンガン読んでいる人もいれば、授業のプログラミング課題がちょっと得意、くらいの人もいた。言い方は悪いけどピンキリ。
で、その差が何から来るのか疑問に思っていた。「プログラミングに対する情熱や興味の差」とか、「アルバイトでの開発の経験」などの差はもちろんあるのだが、どうもそれだけでは説明し得ない壁があるように感じたので、ここ数日それを考えていた。
で、理由を思い立った。
学生に限らず、プログラミング能力は個人差が激しい。これは最終的には「純粋な頭脳労働だから」という点に帰着すると思う。他の多くの世界と違って、プログラミングは「時間と頭脳があれば原理的に何でもできる」わけだ。他の分野においても「頭脳戦の割合が高ければ高いほど偏差も大きくなる」というのは一般論といっても差し支えないと思う。
さて、さらに学生プログラマの場合に言えるのは、「その事実に気づいていない人の割合が高い」ということ。
頭脳戦であるプログラミングを「囲碁」に例えるなら、それを「麻雀」だと勘違いしている。
囲碁は決定性のゲームである（ランダムな要素が何も無い、プレイヤーが打った手によってゲームの全てが決まる）が、麻雀は配牌はランダム要素がある。要するに、
「 そんなにがんばっても仕方が無いよ 」
とか、
「 まぁ役とか覚えてコツをつかめばそれなりに強くなるけど、そんなもんでしょ」
という風に考えている学生が多い。本当は、自分の打った手が全てを決める「囲碁」であるのに。だから、「囲碁」であると気づいている人間は、情報を集めて勉強して、ひたすらコードを書いて、どんどん「強く」なっていく。
能力とか経験とかいう以前に、ゲームのルールを認識する時点で、「勝敗」は半分以上決まっている。
What do you do when your plan to dumb down the general public has worked better than you anticipated ?
Well , someone on Madison Avenue is inevitably gonna realize , “ Hey !
Why is our subliminal advertising no longer working ? ”
Time to adapt .
The Dumbing Down of America is way ahead of schedule .
Apparently , the general public is so far - gone now , that clever subliminals , so long a staple of neural programming and consumer - based demand - generation , are literally , going right over the heads of their intended audiences .
I guess the “ geniuses ” at Tavistock failed to realize that when you dumb - down the conscious mind , the subconscious mind will eventually be stupefied as well .
So , it is time to go super - liminal , or in layman ’s terms , “ like , obvious . ” { *1}
From what I understand , feminist organizations are now complaining that the above ad , which recently debuted in Times Square , is “ overtly sexual . ”
Note to radical feminists : you think ?
So , for years and years , you were quite content to shop at Target , who ’s logo , is an ancient symbol signifying the anus [ i.e. , the part of her pressing precisely against the bull ’s “ eye ” ] .
However , the moment they clue you in on what that symbol may represent , you shout “ chauvinism ” and threaten to boycott ?
Sudden concern is no justification for years of symbol illiteracy .
To paraphrase Michael Tsarion : awareness does not begin when you realize “ someone ’s been selling you a lie , ” but when you admit to yourself that “ you ’ve been buying a lie . ”
Can we get now back to the task at hand please ?
And , that task would be : the agenda of turning all of your little girls into complete sluts .
Oh , thank you noble sirs at Viacom !
I remember back in the day , if you had any hopes of seeing women you just met run around naked , you had better get them drunk first .
It ’s so nice to see your company dedicating its MTV “ programming ” towards the charitable goal of saving us gents a few dollars on alcohol .
Much obliged .
By chance , might some of you other mega- companies out there wanna pitch in and hurry the process along ?
The boys are getting horny .
Oh , thank you Wal - Mart !
Maybe I ’m kind of obtuse , but , if I read this correctly , it ’s basically saying , “ Who needs money , when you ’ve got a pussy between your legs ? ”
Wow , now that is Super - liminal .
It ’s kind of like a corporate symbiosis between Visa International and the National Association of Pimps and Pornographers .
Cross -marketing ?
Help me out Madison Avenue .
Symbiosis ?
What do you guys call it ?
Regardless , I ’m sure the world ’s largest retail chain was more than happy to contribute .
Good to know that Wal - Mart , while resolute in their focus to destroy the American middle - class , is also willing to lend a hand with a few other agendas .
{ * 2} Conscious of the fact that molding an already developed mind can prove extremely difficult , Wal - Mart chose to distribute these panties in their Juniors section [ i.e , girls aged from 8 to 12 ] .
Alas , I will finish this by addressing those males who somehow ended up on this blog via Google search , solely because I threw words like “ vagina ” and “ naked ” in here .
[ and , I seriously hope , your query did n’t also include : “+ little girls ” ]
Do n’t you worry !
These companies are listening .
And , what they hear you saying is , “ I do n’t care about this shit !
I just want more blow - jobs ! ”
Your friends at Walt Disney are way ahead of you .
Today ’s graduating seniors come pre-programmed .
The good people at Disney figured out that phallic objects were passé 12 years ago .
{ * 3} Multiple studies had proven that children were being mentally stunted from over - exposure to television in their early years .
Thus , Disney , in keeping with the times , moved from penis - like objects , to penises .
Now , were I to believe in a place called “ Hell , ” I would finish this by saying we we ’re going to it in a hand - basket , or something like that .
Being more pragmatic , I will instead ask , What makes you think we ’re not already there ?

Every single person wants their life to be the way they want it to be .
If you can get past concepts such as selflessness , altruism , charity , etc. , you will realize that every single person on planet Earth wants it their way .
Yes , there are selfless , altruistic , and charitable people , and more power to ’em if that is their thing .
However , that does n’t change the fact that they are selfless , altruistic , or charitable because that is the way they want to be .
All throughout history , every saint , sinner , hero , or demon did what they did because they wanted whatever it is that they wanted .
Point blank , straight up , no -holds barred ; that ’s the truth of our existence .
So , how do you go about building a successful empire full of whatever it is that you want your empire to be full of ?
By making sure that every single act is one that creates that empire .
The simple fact of the matter is that almost every single day almost every single person does at least one thing that takes them in exactly the opposite direction of what they are trying to attain .
Our lives are so full of “ hurry up and get something done ” that we often rush right by opportunities to attain our desires .
In fact , we tend to rush in the opposite direction of our goals half the time !
If your empire is one where you are lean , sexy , and attractive , do you really think that scarfing down a pizza or a 1 / 4 pound of chocolate cake is an act that will help to build that empire ?
If your empire is one where you are wealthy and successful beyond your wildest dreams , yet you spend your entire paycheck and never save or invest a dime , is doing that every week going to help turn you into a financial juggernaut ?
If your empire is one where you are happily involved in a long - term relationship with a healthy and loving family , do you think that hanging out at single ’s bars and watching Jerry Springer is feeding your mind with the right type of information to build a happy and loving foundation ?
Yes , this all sounds like common sense , but unfortunately common sense is something that is often not as common as its name implies .
Yes , we all know that a healthy body means proper diet and exercise .
Yes , we all know that financial success means creating more wealth than we spend .
Yes , we all know that happy relationships begin with a happy state of mind .
Then why is it that there are so many people who are not happy with their bodies , are not happy with their finances , or are not happy with their relationships ?
The reason : Because people say they want one kind of empire , but their thoughts , feelings , and actions take them in the opposite direction of the success that they claim to desire .
Here is the Fast and Easy way to Build your Empire :
From now on , every single time you get ready to say or do every single thing , ask yourself this one simple question :
Is what I am about to say or do something that will help me to create the empire that I want to live in ?
If the answer is no , then just do n’t do it !
Pretty simple , right ?
Almost like common sense .
Police arrested a principal at his Manhattan high school yesterday after he wrestled with security guards in an attempt to stop them from embarrassing a student by marching her out of the building in handcuffs , cops said .
Mark Federman , 37 , stood in the front doorway of East Side Community HS on East 12th Street at about 8 a.m.
Police said he blocked the officers from hauling away a 17 - year - old girl who was charged with punching one of the guards in the eye .
A fierce argument ensued .
Federman , a well - liked , 13 - year veteran of the school , demanded the guards take the girl out via a secluded back door , cops said .
He feared the teen would be humiliated by being paraded in shackles before the student body , which was beginning to assemble outside for the start of class , sources said .
But the guards insisted that the girl , Isamar Gonzales of East 10th Street , be taken out the front .
The argument soon became physical .
The pugnacious pedagogue and one of the guards started struggling , and fell to the ground .
After the dust settled , Federman was charged with resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration .
The guard was treated at a hospital for an arm injury .
Federman declined to comment after he was given a desk appearance ticket at the Ninth Precinct and released yesterday morning .
He has not been suspended and was back at his post running the school immediately after his release .
Federman , a former teacher and basketball coach , is in his seventh year as the head of the school .
Students and teachers gave him a 93 percent approval rating on the most recent principal performance survey .
Department of Education spokeswoman Dina Paul Parks said officials are not going to press disciplinary action against him .
“ There is some understanding that he was doing what he thought was best , ” she said .
“ Though judgment calls can sometimes be difficult . ”
Despite the donnybrook , Gonzales was eventually frog - marched out of the front of the building before the stunned stares of her fellow students .
Federman was also taken in cuffs out the front of the building .
The teen was charged with second - degree assault , a felony .
The female security officer was hospitalized with an injury to her eye .
After Gonzales was booked at the Ninth Precinct , she was taken to Bellevue Hospital on a stretcher , complaining of head pain .
Gonzales ’ family said that the trouble started because she went to school early and the guards told her to get out .
They claimed that the guards got too rough and escalated the incident .
“ Whoever touched my daughter , they need to come down and pay for it , ” said her mom , Luz .
Isamar Gonzales has no criminal record , but her family admitted that she has a history of getting into fights .
Anthony Morales , who is the father of Isamar ’s boyfriend , said he was in the school at the time and witnessed the struggle .
He said that the guards grabbed her by the hair before she threw the punch .
He also claimed that a representative of the school called her family yesterday and tried to settle the matter quietly .
“ They would consider dropping charges if the family wo n’t press charges , ” he said .

London Councils , the body that represents the capital 's authorities , has moved to initiate legislation to ban free disposable plastic bags in the city .
The initiative came in response to a poll of 1,700 people that showed 90 % wanted either an outright ban or a levy of 10 to 15 p per bag .
London newsagent Haresh said some lateral thinking would be required about what to give customers .
" Maybe I 'll give them the cardboard boxes stock arrives in , " he said .
" That would be green - and cheaper . "
Plastic bags cost him 1 p each , but paper bags are 2 p and the initiative could add to the costs of his business .
However , shopkeepers such as Haresh probably have plenty of time to make plans .
The 33 council leaders from around London who met today cannot banish plastic bags themselves , and the proposed legislation , contained within the ; London local authorities bill , will only begin to be debated in parliament on November 27 .
After the meeting , the London Councils chairman , Merrick Cockell , said : " The campaign to rid the capital of the environmental blight of throwaway shopping bags begins here .
" As a society , we need to do far more to reduce the amount of landfill , and London as a city is determined to take an ambitious lead on this issue .
I urge all Londoners to voice their support to their MP and back the bill once it gets to parliament . "
Today 's move came a week after Brighton & Hove council offered support for a voluntary ban .
It is the largest authority to have done so , while around 80 smaller towns are also considering a voluntary ban .
The London Councils call for a ban instead of a levy could reflect a lack of central government enthusiasm for the kind of plastic bag tax introduced in Ireland with questionable success .
The Department for the Environment 's website says : " There is no clear evidence that such a tax would be beneficial on either broad environmental or litter grounds .
" This is because people would be encouraged to use bags made from other materials or alternative means of packaging , which may be equally or more damaging to the environment . "
Cities such as San Francisco and Dacca in Bangladesh have , however , succeeded in reducing the use of plastic bags through taxation .
The British Retail Consortium ( BRC ) said the London bag tax idea was " born of ignorance " because the voluntary agreement with retailers to reduce the environmental impact of plastic bags by 25 % by the end of 2008 was proving sufficient .
Yesterday , Sainsbury 's revealed it had seen the use of its free carrier bags drop by 10 % – equal to 85 m disposal bags and 750 tonnes of landfill - in the past six months compared with last year .
It said the use of reusable bags had risen by 50 % .
The BRC director , Keith Hawkins , said plastic bags would always be needed for " unplanned shopping trips " and for retailers to pack expensive items such as clothes or electricals to " beat the rising tide of shoplifters " .
While the influx of free and low - cost video has hurt the sale of pornographic videos , the chief executive of the Penthouse Media Group remains so bullish on the sex - related entertainment industry that he is investing $ 500 million in a group of social networking sites .
Marc H. Bell , chief executive of Penthouse Media , said the company had acquired Various Inc. and its subsidiaries as part of a plan to expand its reach .
Various operates more than 25 networking sites and says it has a member base of more than 260 million consumers , about 1.2 million of them paying subscribers .
The combined revenue of both companies is projected to be $ 340 million in 2007 .
Various ’s most popular
Web site is adultfriendfinder , which describes itself as a personals community for swingers and sex .
But Various owns a variety of other social networks like Italianfriendfinder.com , gradfinder.com and bigchurch.com , which offers to help users “ meet people who share the same spiritual beliefs as you . ”
“ For now , we are holding on to everything , ” Mr. Bell said .
He said the goal was to provide consumers , particularly 18 - to - 34 - year - old men , with a wide variety of sex- related offerings in magazines , in videos and online .
Mexico to build only energy - smart homes in three years : minister
by Staff Writers
Mexico City ( AFP ) Feb 8 , 2008
Mexico will soon allow only energy - smart homes to be built in the country , and plans to have 30,000 such units up and running by 2011 , Environment Secretary Juan Rafael Elvira said Friday .
" In two or three years all traditional home construction will come to an end , and all new homes will be built with new materials and energy - sustainable standards , " Elvira told a foreign press conference .
He said the government project will begin with a federally - funded pilot program to build 30,000 energy - smart homes in the next three years that will help establish the criteria for energy efficiency construction .
The initiative is part of a global project to build by 2012 one million energy - smart homes that will save the planet one million tons of carbon dioxide emissions , he added .
He said the new housing will be equipped with energy - smart devices such as solar water heating , low - energy fluorescent lights , high - efficiency appliances and low - flow plumbing fixtures .
The 30,000 - home pilot program will be aimed at people " who make daily wages of 200 pesos ( 18 dollars ) , while the federal government will provide support of 22,000 pesos ( some 1,900 dollars ) to the interested parties , " Elvira said .
He said the cost of each energy - smart home will range from 120,000 - 240,000 pesos ( up to around 21,000 dollars ) .
The secretary said a separate energy - smart - home building program is planned for the southern state of Chiapas to help relocate thousands of people made homeless by the massive floods of October and November .
Every child born on this earth starts by being interested in the natural world .
You have only got to turn over a stone and see a worm or earwig underneath and the child is fascinated .
I grew up in Leicestershire , and the north - eastern part is full of rocks full of fossils .
Every time you put a rock under a hammer there was a chance you 'd see something new , and yours were the first human eyes ever to see that .
The notion that there 's a sea creature in the rocks beneath the ground on which you walk which was alive 100 m years ago I find romantic and amazing .
One of the first series we did was birds , because everybody 's interested in birds .
That worked , so we did another one .
Now we have come to the last , which is amphibians and reptiles .
It was n't until five years ago that I thought : ' It 's possible we could do a series about every major group that lives on land . '
And so it 's turned out .
My children are 55 and 51 .
Of course there were episodes in their lives I missed which I 'm sorry about , but you can't have your cake and eat it .
When you make an animal series , you conceal yourself to get the behaviour as if you were not there .
After Big Brother , eavesdropping on people has become more acceptable ; but if you tell them then they 'll behave in a different way , and their behaviour loses a lot of its validity .
Life is not all high emotion .
Some of the most interesting things are when it's not highly emotional : little details of relationships and body language .
Every society that 's ever existed has felt it necessary to have creation myths .
Why should I believe one ?
People write to me and say : ' You show us birds and orchids and wonderful , beautiful things - do n't you feel you should give credit to He who created those things ? '
My reply says : what about a parasitic worm that 's boring through the eye of a four - year - old child on the bank of an African river ?
It confuses me that I should believe in a god who cares individually for each and every one of us and could allow that to happen .
The cameraman has all those qualities people have generously ascribed to me : patience , endurance ...
I have very little of those .
If you 're sitting next to an 18 - stone gorilla , you do n't shout - you 're respectful .
I 'm caricatured as speaking in this breathy way , but most of the words I 've spoken on TV are n't like that .
I should n't object : to have a characteristic people know as yours is a compliment .
If it was n't for eco-tourism , I 'm quite sure there would be no mountain gorillas left .
People in and around the forest have a better standard of living than if they were just growing maize .
At some stage we 're going to have to control the size of the population .
Human beings are demanding more and more of the natural world for their own particular purposes , and the world is finite .
If we do n't fix it , then the natural world will fix it for us in a devastating way .
It 's already doing it with famines .
Human beings will cut their numbers without the need for draconian measures - the evidence , happily , is that if you provide female education and the technical facilities , that 's the way people choose .
My next project is about Charles Darwin .
He says in a letter to Emma , his wife , something like : ' I sat down on a bench and saw a bird singing in the trees and saw a wide mass of life going on around me , and I thought I did n't care what the process was that brought this into place because it 's so wonderful . '
If I lost that feeling , I 'd go and do something else .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Defying a White House veto threat , the U.S. House of Representatives voted on Thursday to outlaw harsh interrogation methods , such as simulated drowning , that the CIA has used against suspected terrorists .
Demonstrator Maboud Ebrahimzadeh is held down during a simulation of waterboarding outside the Justice Department in Washington November 5 , 2007 .

On a largely party line vote of 222-199 , the Democratic - led House approved a measure to require intelligence agents to comply with the Army Field Manual , which bans torture in compliance with the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war .
The measure , part of a sweeping intelligence bill , passed amid a congressional probe into the recent disclosure that the CIA destroyed videotapes of al Qaeda suspects undergoing waterboarding , a simulated drowning .
Many countries , U.S. lawmakers and human rights groups have accused the United States of torturing terror suspects since the September 11 attacks .
President George W. Bush says the United States does not torture , but the administration will not disclose what interrogation methods it has approved for the CIA .
In threatening to veto the House - passed measure , which now awaits Senate action , the White House argued it would prevent the United States from conducting “ lawful interrogations of senior al Qaeda terrorists . ”
House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer countered that the current administration had blurred the line “ between legitimate , sanctioned interrogation tactics and torture . ”
“ There is no doubt our international reputation has suffered and been stained as a result , ” Hoyer told colleagues .
Backers of harsh interrogation say it is needed to pry vital information out of enemy combatants .
But critics say torture is inhumane and such information is often unreliable .
The CIA has told lawmakers they stopped waterboarding a few years ago , aides say .
The overall intelligence authorization bill that contains the interrogation provision faces another fight in the closely - divided , Democratic - led Senate .
The Army Field Manual provides 19 approved interrogation methods .
They include isolating prisoners , allowing American interrogators to pose as representing another country and the “ good - cop , bad - cop ” interviewing technique .
It prohibits eight methods , including waterboarding .
Paul Waugh has been a volunteer coastguard for 13 years
Paul Waugh climbed down to Faye Harrison , 13 , who was hanging on by her fingertips and about to fall 200 ft ( 60 m ) at Salburn - on - Sea , Teesside .
He did not wear safety equipment as it would have taken time to go back to his vehicle which was some distance away .
Mr Waugh was later told that he had broken rules .
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) said it was not looking for dead heroes .
When you see a little frightened face looking up at you , all you want to do is help
Paul Waugh
The Skinningrove Coastguard Cliff Rescue Team was called out , along with the emergency services in January 2007 , after three girls became trapped by rising tides .
Faye attempted to climb up the cliffs , but when a ledge gave way she was left hanging on to tufts of grass for 45 minutes .
Mr Waugh was one of three team members who arrived at the scene on foot , as their vehicle was trapped behind locked gates a field away .
They left safety equipment in the vehicle because they wanted to reach the scene as quickly as possible .
The 44 - year - old from Skelton Green climbed down and held on to her for 30 minutes until she could be winched to safety .
' Guardian angel '
He said : " I understand I broke a rule , but I felt it was a matter of having to because she only had minutes to live .
She said that herself , she was planning her own funeral .
" When you see a little frightened face looking up at you , all you want to do is help .
" There 's no way I 'm going to stand back and watch a 13 - year - old girl fall off a cliff . "
Faye later nominated him for a life saver award as her " guardian angel " .
However , Mr Waugh , who has been with the MCA for 13 years , was later told that the organisation had carried out an internal investigation into the team 's handling of the incident .
He said : " I 'm leaving now due to the hassle I 've had over the last nine months .
In fact , I 've been depressed over it .
" Yes , fair enough , I broke a rule , but when I started my training a long time ago , I was told , one time , you 'll work outside the box .
And in this case I had to help her , she was ready to fall .
He added : " I 'm very , very sad .
It 's a shame I 'm having to go . "
' Minimise risk '
The MCA said in a statement that it had not received an official notification from him , but was very grateful for his past activities and wished him well in the future .
The statement said : " Our responsibility is to maintain the health and welfare of those who we sometimes ask to go out in difficult and challenging conditions to effect rescues .
" As such we ask our volunteers to risk assess the situations they and the injured or distressed person find themselves in , and to ensure that whatever action they take does not put anyone in further danger .
" We are proud of our safety record and we will seek to maintain the safety of our volunteers , and minimise risk in what can be inherently difficult situations . "
The religious nutbars are at it again .
What ’s getting them unglued this time is this poster for San Francisco ’s Folsom Street Fair :
A predictable response comes from the Christian News Wire reporting on ( quote ) the Sick Perverts in San Francisco .
( Are n’t all perverts sick ?
Oh never mind . )
Here they go :
This year , " Perverts Without Morals " chose to deliberately mock Jesus Christ , Christians and The Last Supper , by depicting half naked homosexuals , leather men and women as the 12 Apostles , and display sex toys in place of the bread and wine .
A bloody fist can be seen in front of the central figure portraying Jesus Christ , possibly representing the vile sex act of " fisting " - where one 's fist is fully inserted into another individual 's anal cavity .
They seem to know a lot about this kind of thing .
More than you ’d expect decent Christians to be aware of at any rate .
Wonder how ?
Wonder no more :
Stephen Bennett , president of SBM and a former homosexual said , " This is the most vile , vulgar and disgusting public display of filth I have ever seen in my life .
A “ former homosexual ” ?
Funny , I was n’t aware you could change .
I guess all those “ pray me straight ” sessions must work after all .
Who knew ?
Anyway , “ former homosexuals ” are apparently a bit like former smokers – more anti gay ( or anti-smoking ) than those who never partook in the first place .
Repressing your natural tendencies must make you pretty frustrated and angry .
Mix that in with religion and we have :
There is no doubt a double standard when Christians and Christianity are mocked by homosexuals and degenerates in such a blatant , vile and sick way .
Where is the media outrage over this event ?
We Christians will no longer tolerate this abuse nor be silent .
Bennett ended , " I call upon the homosexual Human Rights Campaign , GLAAD , GLSEN , and the Gay and Lesbian Task Force to publicly condemn this blatant mockery of Christians and Christianity by some within their community , and condemn this sick public display of immoral behavior .
I call upon the Miller Brewing Company to pull their endorsement of this event .
I call for the organizers of this filth to immediately apologize to Christians worldwide and remove this Last Supper mockery .
I also call upon every law abiding official and citizen in America who has any morals to do what they can to shut down this Folsom Street ' Filth ' Fair once and for all . "
And there , once again , we see the religious in their true colors .
Calling for immediate censorship of anything they do n’t like , and ( of course , you knew this was coming ) , an apology .
Because we all have to apologize when someone makes fun of their invisible sky fairy and they get upset .
And Rick Warren thinks atheists are angry .
I think someone needs a hug .
But not in a gay way .
The CIA destroyed video evidence of the coercive interrogation of al - Qaida operatives held under its secret rendition programme in order to shield agents from prosecution , it was revealed yesterday .
The decision to destroy two videotapes documenting the use of waterboarding against Abu Zubaydah and another high - value al - Qaida detainee was made in November 2005 - as American media were just beginning to focus on the existence of the secret CIA prison network .
" The tapes posed a serious security risk , " the CIA 's director , Michael Hayden , told agency employees in a statement yesterday .
" Were they ever to leak , they would permit identification of your CIA colleagues who had served in the programme , exposing them and their families to retaliation from al - Qaida and its sympathisers . "
Hayden 's message to CIA employees went out a day after he learned that the New York Times planned to publish an article today about destruction of the videotapes .
The revelation is bound to reignite debate in Congress about the use of torture in the war on terror .
But far more seriously for the Bush administration , it raises the prospect that the CIA withheld information from and obstructed the work of the commission investigating the September 11 attacks as well as lawyers for Zacarias Moussaoui , the so - called 11th hijacker .
Officials from the September 11 commission told the New York Times yesterday they had formally requested from the CIA evidence of interrogations , and had been informed that all materials had been handed over .
The Washington Post , which also carried a story on its website yesterday about the destroyed videotapes , reported that the order to destroy the tapes came from Jose Rodriguez Jr , then the director of the CIA 's clandestine operations .
The leaders of the house and Senate intelligence committees - which were then under Republican control - were aware of the existence of the footage and the CIA 's decision to destroy the material , Hayden said in his memo .
However , Democratic committee members who had long demanded that such interrogations be videotaped , were not made aware of the existence of the tapes , the Times reported .
Hayden said the interrogations were filmed in 2002 after George Bush authorised the use of harsh interrogation , including the controversial practice of controlled drowning , known as waterboarding , against al - Qaida suspects .
" The agency was determined that it proceed in accord with established legal and policy guidelines , " Hayden wrote .
" So , on its own , CIA began to videotape interrogations . "
However , the CIA soon discontinued the practice , and it is believed that only two detainees were filmed while undergoing interrogation .
It has long been believed that Abu Zubaydah , a Saudi believed to be a close associated of Osama bin Laden , was subjected to harsh treatment following his capture in Pakistan in March 2002 .
The footage would have clarified what practices such as waterboarding and sleep deprivation - both of which a gravely wounded Abu Zubaydah was subjected to - involve .
The First iPhone virus has been found ( a trojan ) , and it turns out it was made by an 11 - year old who was playing around with XML files .
This was something that people have been waiting to happen and it did .
What most people fear is not this , but the upcoming other viruses that will be made by more skillful people who will have intentions to harm your iPhone .
The iPhones that were vulnerable to this was the " unlocked " iPhones which allow third - party applications to be installed , this shows that deciding to modify your iPhone is a double edged sword that could open up more possibilities as well as more vulnerabilities .
quoted from : macworld , which confirmed the virus along with F - secure
"------------------
The first Trojan for the iPhone has been discovered .
The first reports came from iPhone enthusiast site Modmyifone.com and were later confirmed by security research company F - Secure .
The virus does not currently pose a huge risk , the Trojan specifically targets users that have modified their iPhone so they can install third - party applications .
The application masks itself as an update to Erica 's Utilities and is labeled as " 113 prep . "
According to Modmyifone.com all the app does is say " shoes . "
However , when uninstalled , the application removes files from the / bin directory on the iPhone , breaking valid apps like Sendfile and Erica 's Utilities .
The site hosting the application was taken offline soon after it was discovered , reports F - Secure .
" Hopefully this serves as a warning for those who have opened their iPhones using a security hole in the system and then installing unverified software without a second thought to what they are doing , " said F - Secure on its site .
F - Secure reported that it was an 11 - year - old kid playing with XML files who created the Trojan .
" Next time it might be someone else with more skills and with specific target , " they said .
---------------------"
Okay .
I 'm going to state the obvious here .
After all , somebody needs to say it .
In fact , everybody who sees it needs to say it .
Are you ready ?
Then here goes .
The men and women calling themselves Democrats and sitting in Congress are the biggest bunch of liars this country has ever seen .
Given today 's political situation , what with Bush and Cheney running the White House , that 's a pretty big claim to make .
Unfortunately for those who believed those men and women might actually stop the war in Iraq and begin getting the US military out of there , this is the only conclusion one can make .
I mean , take a look .
There are more troops in Iraq now than there were when the Democrats won ( yeh , won ) both houses of Congress a little over a year ago .
If my calculations are correct , more than $ 100 billion have been spent to keep those troops there , keep them in supplies both lethal and otherwise , and to top it off , more troops have died since those elected “ representatives ” took their places than in any other year of this loathsome war and occupation .
Add to this list of calamities the untold numbers of Iraqis killed , wounded and uprooted from their homes .
No matter how you look at it , there is no way this can be called ending the war .
In fact , not only could it be called enabling this debacle to continue , the more truthful description would be to call what the Democrats have done is conspire to commit murder .
Their partners in the conspiracy — the White House , the Pentagon and their GOP supporters — have been true to their word .
They promised that they would stay in Iraq until their goals were reached , no matter how many lives it took .
Even without an elected majority in Congress , this element of the conspiracy has received every bit of money , every single GI and marine , and almost every bit of positive media spin they have asked for .
This could not have occurred without the collusion of the Democrats .
As I write this , another alleged attempt by Congressional Democrats to begin bringing home a sizable minority of troops from Iraq seems to be going the way of every other previous attempt .
That is , to the dustbin of history .
The reasons given this time by the Democrats are as pathetic as those provided previously .
You know the litany : they do n't have the votes , the GOP is threatening a filibuster if the troop withdrawal limits are attached to the bill , they do n't want to harm the troops in the field , and so on .
Now I do n't know about you , but is n't leaving the troops in the war zone more dangerous than bringing them home ?
Furthermore , if the Republicans can filibuster a spending bill to prevent the inclusion of elements in the bill that they do n't like , ca n't the majority Democrats also filibuster that same bill to make sure those same elements are included ?
I mean , we 're not talking about halting funding for the war and occupation and bringing the troops home starting tomorrow here , even though that is what we should be talking about .
No , we 're talking about a bill that essentially suggests to Mr. Bush that he take $ 50 billion more for the war and start thinking about bringing some of the troops home as soon as possible with the idea that a good number of them are no longer in Iraq by December 2008 .
That 's not a hell of a lot to ask for .
Yet , the Democrats are backing off from this lily - livered legislation and planning on giving the White House another $ 50 billion with no strings attached , not even the silly string of the aforementioned withdrawal suggestion .
To top it off , the Democrats are telling the press that it's the Republican 's fault that they refuse to stand their ground .
“ We 've tried maybe a dozen times " to bring troops home , said Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
" And when we do try and we do n't succeed , we still provide funding for the troops . "
In other words , they still provide monies for the war .
If the Boston Red Sox had this attitude , they would never have made it to the World Series in 2004 and 2007 .
But then again , baseball teams do n't conspire with their competition to get to the championship , they play them harder than they are being played because they truly want to win .
If the Democrats truly wanted to end the war , they would stand up to the challenges of the war supporters across the aisle and in the White House .
Instead , they hedge their bets , blame their opponents for their failures , and vote for more war .
All of which makes it harder for those of us who truly oppose the war and occupation to vote for any of them .
Journalists are today handing in their rumpled Gannex macintoshes , removing the press cards from their battered trilbies and sloping off to the nearest pub for eleven or twelve " quick ones " ( plus chasers ) in memory of News , which has succumbed to a tidal wave of gossip , sports stories and infotainment after a long illness .
It was way back in about 100,000 BC that Ug the Hack became the first person to realise that it might just be a good idea to actually tell his fellow cave dwellers about the stampeding mammoths heading their way , rather than just watching the ensuing carnage .
Not only did his decision to beat out his message on the nearest available drum save his fellow Homo sapiens from a fate worse than death , it also resulted in the birth of News ... as well as leading to Ug being sacked by his boss , Ug the Editor , who pointed out that a bunch of cave men and women being trampled to death by mastodons would have made a much better cave - painting for the Paleolithic Gazette .
Undeterred by Ug 's fate , foolhardy messengers continued to bring the News to all and sundry .
Given that the News for the next several millennia consisted chiefly of stories about drought , pestilence , invading armies , stampeding beasts and crop failure , it is perhaps unsurprising that News was not universally popular and its bearers soon found themselves occupying a position in the people 's affections slightly below venereal disease and just to the left of estate agents .
Indeed , when Pheidippides dropped dead after running the 26 miles from Marathon to Athens to announce the defeat of the Persians he was regarded by most Greeks as having done the world a favour .
By the 15th Century , after having brought details of everything from the collapse of the Roman Empire , through the disastrous Crusades all the way to the arrival of the Black Death , News was so unpopular that its bearers hardly dared show their faces in public .
Indeed , so many messengers were being shot for bringing bad News that by 1402 the Guild of Heralds could only muster three members , all of whom were mad .
Just as things looked their darkest for News , however , a new dawn broke with the arrival of Johann Gutenberg and his miraculous printing press .
Now it was possible for the News to be cheaply and easily transferred to paper - allowing messengers to deliver it and then run away very quickly before anyone could read it .
Soon News was transformed from a pariah into the latest fashion , with everyone eager to grab hold of the latest items hot off the press .
The popularity of News became so great that it soon found itself granted whole newspapers all to itself , filled cover to cover with all the latest information from near and far ( or , at least , as far as a carrier pigeon could travel without being shot and converted into carrier pie ) .
By the 18th Century News was being printed out and stuck up on every stationary surface ( a phenomenon which would lead to the unfortunate incident in which several acres of freesheets were pasted to the side of George IV one morning after he fell asleep outside the Brighton pavilion ) and thousands of people were engaged in its acquisition and distribution .
As mass communication improved , News came to more and more people , and more and more people came to News .
By the early twenty - first century , News appeared almost inescapable - available via television , radio , internet and mobile phones , twenty - four hours a day , seven days a week .
Yet all was not as it seemed .
While the outlets for News were ever greater in number , News itself began to seem pale and worn out .
Pundits began to speculate - usually at length , across all 24 - hour news channels and on the basis of absolutely no real information - that News was suffering from an eating disorder .
Indeed many believed that , overstressed by the need to say something at all times , News had taken to binging on low - quality gossip about troubled minor celebrities , scandals involving overpaid soccer stars and underclothed women and entertainment " stories " merely repeating the exact event witnessed on the previous night 's reality TV , plus unfounded scare stories based on inaccurately reported statistics and tendentious , lying and ill - researched rants along the lines of " Christianity banned to appease Muslims " , " Measles jabs give kids AIDS " and " Diana assassinated by house prices " .
The classic five Ws of journalism " Who ? " , " What ? " , " Where ? " , " When ? " and " Why ? " found themselves transformed into " What ? " , " When ? " , " With how many footballers ? " , " Will you take your kit off for the photo ? " and " Which wankers will read this rubbish ? " and even genuinely news - based News became a shadow of its former self , with political reporting reduced to tales of tribal infighting and interpersonal conflict rather than policy , science news reduced to a few whizz - bang graphics or John Humphrys harrumphing about how gravity was all different in his day , and arts news reduced to half - hour specials on the premiere of the latest Adam Sandler movie .
As a result of this , it came as a surprise to no - one when News 's body was discovered in the early hours of this morning , the cause of death apparently a heart attack induced by the strain of trying to come up with a story involving Amy Winehouse having a drug - fuelled affair with Victoria Beckham and the winner of the X - Factor whilst trying to cover up the death of Madeleine McCann with the aid of " canoe man " John Darwin .
News will be buried at St Trevor 's Church of the Big Ben Bongs .
The Reverend Fiona Bruce will arch one eyebrow à la Dan Dare before reading an overbrief summary of News 's life , shortened in order to fit in the story about the skateboarding duck .
The congregation will sing Hymn No 123 , Mailman Bring Me No More News .
More than 75 percent of alcohol consumers have experienced a hangover at least once .
Stockbyte
­ It 's no secret that intoxication has a number of immediate negative consequences .
Among other things , it impairs judgment , it impairs the ability to do most things and it can bring on a depressed mood .
But even after a drinker has sobered up , alcohol can still be causing the body trouble .
More than 75 percent of alcohol consumers have experienced a hangover at least once ; 15 percent have one at least every month ; and 25 percent of college students feel symptoms weekly .
In this article , we 'll explain what causes hangover symptoms and examine the science of the popular prevention methods and morning - after remedies .

Editor 's note : CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour recently toured North Korea 's nuclear plant .
CNN was one of only two U.S. news organizations at the facility .
YONGBYON , North Korea ( CNN ) --
The North Koreans have n't seen this many Americans since the Korean War , but they are pulling out all the stops .
Technicians work inside North Korea 's nuclear plant at Yongbyon .

CNN was one of only two American news organizations ever allowed to visit the main nuclear facility at Yongbyon .
For a nation President Bush labeled as part of the " axis of evil , " it was not an impressive sight : a dilapidated concrete hulk , built with few resources back in the early ' 80s .
But it did produce plutonium , enough to make a few bombs and to test - fire a nuclear weapon 18 months ago .
Today is a very different story though .
North Korea shut down Yongbyon last summer under an agreement with the United States and four other nations in the nuclear disarmament negotiations .
We were shown the extraordinary sight of heavy metal pipes , chopped down and laid on the ground :
They had been part of a coolant loop that sent steam to the turbine generators to produce electricity .
Watch what 's going on inside North Korea 's nuclear facility »
We saw the distinctive bell - shaped cooling tower , just a shell , the inner guts of the system cut out .
We saw the vital nuclear fuel rods being removed and neutralized under 20 feet of water .
See photos of the plant »
And we even were shown the reprocessing plant where plutonium was extracted from the rods , plutonium that was used for nuclear weapons , the chief engineer admitted .
Parts of the plant are now dismantled , wrapped in plastic and put into storage .
And there are technicians from the U.S. Department of Energy on - site helping with all of this .
It seems a far cry from the hostility conjured by the axis of evil .
Watch analyst Mike Chinoy explain how North Korea has been accommodating »
For all of this , North Korea expected a million tons of heavy fuel oil , a lifting of sanctions and removal from the U.S. list of terrorist sponsors .
This has not happened yet , so North Korea has slowed down the disabling process at Yongbyon .
The United States says Pyongyang has n't yet fully accounted for its past nuclear activities .
However , both sides seem determined to overcome this stumbling block and reach out in other ways , too .
As we were being shown around Yongbyon , the New York Philharmonic Orchestra was landing in Pyongyang , the first time a major U.S. cultural group has visited North Korea since the war in the early ' 50s .
Both sides seem to be looking for a less hostile relationship , and as the U.S. nuclear negotiator says , " They do n't like our words ; maybe they 'll like our music . "
Tuesday night a select group of North Koreans will hear the famed musicians play , and those with TVs will see the concert broadcast live .
Members of the orchestra also will give master classes to North Korean musicians , a small step on a long route to normality .

The loneliest thing on earth is to watch television : things happen on the screen , and ideas change or are reinforced in our minds , and we are left with the impression that something actually happened .
It did n’t – outside of our minds .
Thus televisions are bubble worlds , both insulating ourselves in the castle - prison of our own opinions and perceptions , and like drugs an encouragement to passivity .
If the greatest events in our life happen solely within our own minds and do not necessarily involve external reality except the social factors of what other people think , there is no need to act so to secure changes in external reality .
What happens out there just happens , and what happens in here we can control and makes us feel good , so focus entirely on the individual and its perceptions .
Television as a psychological conditioner is thus a wrecking ball .
We have trained huge populations to watch the damn thing every night , and make the conclusion implied but not outright stated by the news or any number of “ entertainment ” programs that nevertheless tackle “ social issues ” so they can be perceived as serious / artistic .
That way , if a poll ( What is your opinion ?
All opinions are important ) or vote comes up , that huge population can weigh in with whatever opinion proves most popular , which necessarily has little in common with reality .
Put up a choice between an easy decision that makes us feel better ( free cake , entertainment , or some emotional positive feeling ) and a hard one ( self - sacrifice , long - term thinking , culture or learning , eating our spinach ) and the population will inevitably choose the easier decision at makes them feel better right now , and if they ’ve been coached in advance by the talking blue screen , well , then it ’s a shoe -in .
So am I saying that … an evil conspiracy controls both television and government ?
No — we are both individuals , and our own rulers , and together we ’re deluding each other .
Much as in business we sell each other products , or tell socially - acceptable lies to make other people do what we want , or even urge our girlfriends toward oral sex with selective quotes from famous actresses , we are swindling each other .
We are each both producer and parasite , and the only conspiracy is our collective ignorance and willingness to manipulate others for our own convenience .
Is television the devil ?
Like all things , technology enhances previously existing forces and multiplies their effect , so television is like “ peer pressure ” turned up 1,000 % and is vastly effective .
It turns us into passive toads who like queens utter a “ yes ” or “ no ” and imagine it means a difference , which for the short term it appears to .
Think about it this way : businesses sell us products , but are always finding some more popular than others .
In an effort to find out what will be popular , they poll us endlessly and conduct consumer opinion surveys , but these fail as often as they are successful ; when consumers are asked to compare two extant products , they do alright .
When asked what they actually want , they come up with with fanciful notions and unrealistic suggestions .
Business responds to the population ’s will , but the population is forced to choose from what business offers … government caters to the population , but only the choices offered by government are available … media tries to follow public opinion , while showing the public what it believes to be that public opinion , regurgitated through the filter of “ art ” ( entertainment , distraction ) or profit .
Which came first , the chicken or the egg ?
I dunno , but in a democracy , the chicken will not vote to produce an egg .
We can see television ’s effects dramatically on the internet .
At first , the internet was seen as an information resource ( especially when its most profitable industry was pornography ) but rapidly it became a participative one as chat , forums , and video flooded it .
Where people once sought informational resources , now they seek entertainment ; where they once could , like software developers on an email list , discuss ideas and come to a conclusion , now they re-affirm their own conclusions by shouting opinions at those who have contrary beliefs .
It has become a dead - end game where nothing changes and no one does anything , except of course the content producers , who have something to sell .
It is for this reason that many of us have progressively receded from the internet , as we realize that all the people boldly stating their “ opinions ” have no intention of acting on those opinions ; they ’re watching TV , and want the characters on screen to yell and jump in response , and then go back to the status quo .
This is why the internet has increasingly come to represent a separate culture entirely divorced from reality , with its ORLY owls and LOLs , in which people all have radicalized opinions they scream at lungtop , drowning out all digital conversation .
Since television is not only a big industry but a popular method of spending time , and to criticize it implies that those who watch it are wasting their lives on meaningless garbage , it is exceptionally hard to criticize ; unlike a strong political opinion , criticism of television and movies and Hollywood - style “ art ” ( music , paintings , dance , theatre ) is not rebuffed with violent words by a bitter snub .
It is simply not acknowledged .
Few want to point that what we seem to consider as “ culture ” is not only of low quality , but popular merely because it is deceptive and encourages us to consider passivity equivalent to action .
It is one of those paradoxical fixtures of our landscape where we know that fast food or television or popular elections are destructive , yet “ tolerate ” them because they are popular .
By thus inviting them in among us , we watch everything become consumed by them ; literature becomes television - like , paintings reflect MTV videos more than the masters , our theatre is increasingly dramatic yet without substance , and our music — well , generations raised on Britney Spears should not perplex their parents with bad behavior ( it should be expected ) .
Television ’s passive mentality encourages us toward “ art ” that increasingly celebrates the drama of the individual and its preferences and pleasures , with no concern for reality passing us by .
We are drowning in the existential because we have confined our scope of criticism to the individual , much as if we were a nation of people on couches pressing buttons to express our opinions .

Investigators want Pelosi to hand over Foley computer Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday January 9 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Florida investigators are still trying to determine whether disgraced GOP Rep .
Mark Foley violated state law with his lewd , sexually explicit e-mails and instant messages to underage Congressional pages .
The Florida Department of Law Enforcement has been stymied in its pursuit because officers have been unable to examine Foley 's computer , from which ABC News revealed he communicated with teenage male pages , once chatting about sex with a teen boy while the House was in the middle of a vote .
" If we are not granted access to said equipment , I respectfully request a written response specifying the reason for the denial and direction to the court process or other procedure required to gain the requested access , " FDLE Commissioner Gerald Bailey wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a Dec. 11 letter , according to the Palm Beach Post .
Pelosi 's office told ABC it is still crafting a response .
House lawyers previously refused to allow investigators access to the computers , arguing doing so would violate the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution .
Only Foley can waive the privilege that allows lawmakers to keep their legislative papers private .
The Post reports : Last July , House Deputy General Counsel Kerry Kircher wrote to Bailey and said House administrators reviewed Foley e-mails and found no inappropriate images or messages .
The e-mails being examined , however , do not include all of Foley 's communications through his House account .
Some may have been deleted from the main congressional computer server , which was searched , but would likely still be accessible from an examination of the actual computers , which were not searched .
Foley has refused access , citing congressional privilege .
Unless Pelosi agrees to hand over the computers , it is unlikely Foley will face charges .
Because the explicit e-mails were not reported until late 2006 , investigators did not begin building a case against Foley until that November , by which time the statute of limitations on charges stemming from messages sent to a 17 - year - old in 2003 had nearly expired .
Some of you may recall Kansas Senator Pat Roberts ' appearance on Meet The Press in February 2006 , where he pulled out a bottle of " memory pills " as he debated Democratic Senator Tom Daschle .
Roberts , then the Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , ran cover for the Bush administration by stalling multiple reports on the faulty intelligence used to justify the invasion of Iraq .
Roberts has been all but invisible for quite some time and now he has a challenger for his Senate seat .
Kansans elected Democrat Nancy Boyda to Congress last year and things look even worse for Republicans for 2008 .
Given Robert 's permanent ties to the failures in Iraq and his loyalty to President Bush , this seat could easily be in play .
Via Daily Kos :
The Kansas Democratic Party now has a candidate to take on Pat Roberts .
Kansas businessman , Greg Orman is stepping up to the plate .
From Mr. Orman 's press release just this afternoon :
" As I look at what ’s going on in Washington , and the course we ’re on as a nation , I am convinced we can and should be doing better , " Orman said of his decision to run .
" Like so many Kansans , I ’m disappointed and deeply troubled by the inaction , infighting , and ineffectiveness on display in Washington today .
And I ’m prepared to offer the people of Kansas a United States Senator with the right priorities who can help get America moving in a positive direction again . "
When it comes to Pat Roberts , Kansans have much to be disappointed with .
As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committe , Pat Roberts has been a disaster and an embarrassment for this nation .
His committee has done nothing but cover - up the dirty deeds of the Bush administration , obstructing investigations into everything from eavesdropping to the lies leading to the Iraq War .
Think Progress has an excellent and detailed breakdown of his record on the committee .

People with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) who smoke marijuana are more likely to have emotional and memory problems , according to research published February 13 , 2008 , in the online edition of Neurology , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology .
“ This is the first study to show that smoking marijuana can have a harmful effect on the cognitive skills of people with MS , ” said study author Anthony Feinstein , MPhil , PhD , of the University of Toronto .
“ This is important information because a significant minority of people with MS smoke marijuana as a treatment for the disease , even though there are no scientific studies demonstrating that it is an effective treatment for emotional difficulties . ”
Feinstein noted that MS itself can cause cognitive problems .
“ In addition , cognitive problems can greatly affect the quality of life for both patients and their caregivers , ” he said .
For the study , researchers interviewed 140 Canadian people with MS .
Of those , 10 people had smoked marijuana within the last month and were defined as current marijuana users .
The marijuana users were then each matched by age , sex , the length of time they had MS , and other factors to four people with MS who did not smoke marijuana .
The researchers then evaluated the participants for emotional problems such as depression , anxiety and other psychiatric disorders .
They also tested the participants ’ thinking skills , speed at processing information , and memory .
The study found marijuana smokers performed 50 percent slower on tests of information processing speed compared to MS patients who did not smoke marijuana .
There was also a significant association between smoking marijuana and emotional problems such as depression and anxiety .
People with MS have higher rates of depression and suicide compared to the general population .
“ Since marijuana can induce psychosis and anxiety in healthy people , we felt it was especially important to look at its effects on people with MS , ” Feinstein said .

Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) surgery , which is used to treat Parkinson 's disease and other movement disorders , is now being studied for its potential to treat a variety of conditions .
A new study found that hypothalamic DBS performed in the treatment of a patient with morbid obesity unexpectedly evoked a sense of déjà vu and detailed personal memories .
Led by Andres Lozano , Professor of Neurosurgery and Canada Research Chair in Neuroscience and his team at the Toronto Western Hospital in Toronto , Ontario , researchers conducted an experimental study to treat a 50 - year - old man with a lifelong history of obesity in whom a variety of treatment approaches had failed .
While they were identifying potential appetite suppressant sites in the hypothalamus by stimulating electrode contacts that had been implanted there , the patient suddenly experienced a feeling of " déjà vu . "
He reported the perception of being in a park with friends from when he was around 20 years old and as the intensity of the stimulation was increased , the details became more vivid .
These sensations were reproduced when the stimulation was performed in a double - blinded manner .
The contacts that most readily induced the memories were located in the hypothalamus and estimated to be close to the fornix , an arched bundle of fibers that carries signals within the limbic system , which is involved in memory and emotions .
Stimulation was shown to drive the activity the temporal lobe and the hippocampus , important components of the brain 's memory circuit .
At the first office visit two months after the patient was released from the hospital , the researchers were able to induce and videotape the memory effects seen in the operating room by turning on the electrical stimulation .
They also tested the patient 's memory during and without stimulation and found that after three weeks of continuous hypothalamic stimulation he showed significant improvements in two learning tests .
In addition , the patient was much more likely to remember unrelated paired objects when stimulation was on than when it was off .
They conclude that " just as DBS can influence motor and limbic circuits , it may be possible to apply electrical stimulation to modulate memory function and , in so doing , gain a better understanding of the neural substrates of memory . "
DBS of the hypothalamus has also been used to treat cluster headaches and aggressiveness in humans , and stimulating this area influences feeding behavior in animals .

The ACLU was a prominent supporter of Richard Nixon 's impeachment .
In 2006 an ACLU panel argued for impeachment .
In recent years , the national ACLU has lobbied against numerous offenses that appear quintessentially impeachable , but refused , despite intense lobbying by its members and others , to back impeachment .
The national ACLU recently announced a new motto that many impeachment advocates view as a wish for the impossible ( a reference to the current presidential administration ) : " One More Year , No More Damage . "
Richard W. Spisak Jr. of the ACLU of Florida reported that the state chapter met in Fort Myers at 1:30 p.m. on Saturday and passed a motion in support of impeachment hearings for George Bush and Richard Cheney .
The motion calls on the National ACLU to urge hearings in the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives .
Florida Congressman Robert Wexler , a member of that committee , has recently been leading a push for hearings to begin .
Florida citizens have been pushing for impeachment for a long time .
Motion Language Follows :
" The Board of Directors of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida urges the National ACLU Board of Directors to call for the convening of hearings by the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives to determine whether to recommend Articles of Impeachment against President George Bush , and Vice President Richard Cheney to the House . "
According to Spisak , " The debate was energetic with opposing perspectives on tactics related to national staff and issues related to potential complications .
Ultimately those who felt this an important step , a pricipled step won the day . "
Diane Lawrence , a leading Florida impeachment activist with http://www.floridaimpeach.org said that her group had lobbied Howard Simon , Executive Director of the ACLU of Florida , and that he recently hinted at his support for impeachment when speaking at an event in Florida with House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , a long - time friend from Simon 's days in Michigan .
At the event , hosted by the ACLU , Simon said that he disagreed with Conyers on one important point .
Perhaps we now know what that point was .

Ah ... the Doughy Pantload strikes again .
Speaking in front of the Heritage Foundation ( because , honestly , who else could sit through this tripe ? ) to pimp his latest book , Liberal Fascism , Jonah Goldberg tries again to prove Moynihan wrong , not only by coming up with his own facts , but his own definitions as well .
The primary definition that Goldberg ignores for his own version is " Fascism . "
In Doughy Pantload World , " fascism " means " something bad " .
This is something I 've suspected for many years about conservatives :
They do n't actually know the definitions of the epithets they like to throw out to dismiss and demean the left .
They just think it means " something bad . "
For example :
To sort of start the story , the reason why we see fascism as a thing of the right is because fascism was originally a form of right - wing socialism .
Mussolini was born a socialist , he died a socialist , he never abandoned his love of socialism , he was one of the most important socialist intellectuals in Europe and was one of the most important socialist activists in Italy , and the only reason he got dubbed a fascist and therefore a right - winger is because he supported World War I .
Um , actually , not so much .
Mussolini was dubbed a fascist because he founded the Fascist Party , you big , fact - ignoring dope .
Jonah 's hatred of Hillary Clinton knows no rational bounds ( the original sub - title was " The Totalitarian Temptation From Mussolini to Hillary Clinton " -- Mussolini as an American politician -- who knew ? ) and he steals liberally from Naomi Klein to dive head first into the Godwin abyss with fantastical allusions to 1984 and some Big Brother bleak bureaucratic scenario of DMVs with Jumbotrons with nanny - state advisories on breastfeeding , based on Hillary Clinton 's It Takes A Village .
The dizzying logic of it all just shows you why if Jonah Goldberg is one of the great thinkers on the right ( and certainly , he 's has prominent enough platforms from which to spew this tripe to argue that point ) , the right is bankrupt of intellectual honesty and comprehension .
( Update : BG thanks her fellow liberal bloggers for this . )
For Mr. Remes , the answer was simple .
“ Plainly , the government wants only foxes guarding the henhouse , ” he asserted in his motion .
Considering the government ’s behavior so far , Mr. Remes argued , the Justice Department is not entitled to a presumption that it will do the right thing .
The destruction in 2005 of the videotapes , disclosed earlier this month , has caused a furor in the capital .
Critics of the administration have seized on the episode as further evidence that it may have a lot to hide in its treatment of detainees .
In addition to a joint inquiry by the Justice Department and the Central Intelligence Agency ’s own inspector general ’s office , at least one investigation has been begun in Congress .
Lawyers for the detainees say the destruction of the tapes may have violated an order issued by Judge Kennedy himself earlier in 2005 , and may be a sign that other evidence was destroyed .
Government lawyers argued , in part , that the detainees ’ lawyers have not even shown convincingly that their clients were covered by Judge Kennedy ’s order of June 10 , 2005 , since the order applied only to prisoners who were indisputably at Guantánamo Bay on June 10 , and there is a question about the whereabouts of at least some of the detainees on that date .
The government also asserted that Mr. Remes has failed to show that Judge Kennedy ’s order , calling for the preservation of documents concerning the “ torture , treatment and abuse ” of Guantánamo Bay prisoners , addresses any incident in which his clients were involved .

WASHINGTON , Nov. 28 — In July 1969 , as the world was spellbound by the Apollo 11 mission to the moon , President Richard M. Nixon and his close advisers were quietly fretting about a nuclear arms race in the Middle East .
Their main worry was not a potential enemy of the United States , but one of America ’s closest friends .
“ The Israelis , who are one of the few peoples whose survival is genuinely threatened , are probably more likely than almost any other country to actually use their nuclear weapons , ” Henry A. Kissinger , the national security adviser , warned Mr. Nixon in a memorandum dated July 19 , 1969 — part of a newly released trove of documents .
Israel ’s nuclear arms program , which Israel has never officially conceded exists , was believed to have begun at least several years before , but it was causing special problems for the young Nixon administration .
For one thing , the president was preparing for a visit by its prime minister , Golda Meir , who was also in her first year in office and whose toughness was already legendary .
Should Washington insist that Israel rein in its development of nuclear weapons ?
What would the United States do if Israel refused ?
Perhaps the solution lay in deliberate ambiguity , or simply pretending that America did not know what Israel was up to .
These were some of the options that Mr. Kissinger laid out for Mr. Nixon on that day before men first walked on the moon .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Millions of U.S. homeowners who bought homes with sinking value are set to abandon the properties and cut their losses on bad investments , a leading housing market economist said on Tuesday .
Dr. Nouriel Roubini , a professor at the New York University , answers questions during the Reuters Housing Summit , in New York , February 19 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Chip East
“ We may face something unprecedented ... that is a situation where millions of homeowners are going to walk out of their homes in the next couple of years , ” said Nouriel Roubini , professor of economics and international business at New York University ’s Stern School of Business and head of Roubini Global Economics .
Somewhere between 10 million and 15 million homeowners might soon find that their homes are worth less than the amount of their loans , Roubini said at the Reuters Housing Summit in New York .
Such borrowers would be caught in a trap of “ negative equity , ” in which they are paying off loans that no longer represent the true value of their properties .
“ When the value of your home is below the value of your mortgage , you have a huge incentive essentially to walk away , ” he said .
Home prices across the nation are set to sink in value by 10 percent this year on top of the losses already recorded , he predicted .
If prices indeed continued to drop , Roubini said , mortgage servicers and lenders would face pressure to write down a home loan to the lower value and take big losses on many loans .
The other option would be for servicers and lenders to push delinquent borrowers into foreclosure -- but that would be costly for the mortgage industry , which would then be stuck with homes -- very illiquid assets in today ’s market .
Losses could reach $ 1 trillion to $ 2 trillion when all the credit costs are totaled up , Roubini said .
What began with defaults on subprime mortgages has already spread to home loans that were considered less risky , and Roubini sees more problems arising in auto loans , credit cards , student loans , commercial real estate , leveraged buyouts and corporate loans .
In the wake of the housing mess , credit conditions have tightened on a host of loans to consumers and companies , threatening to choke off U.S. economic growth .
The tougher terms were a key reason behind the U.S. Federal Reserve ’s decision to chop interest rates twice in less than 10 days in January .
Roubini welcomed the rate cuts , but said the central bank waited too long to prevent a recession .
“ We ’re going to experience a severe recession , much more severe than we had in 1990 - 91 and 2001 , ” he said , adding that while the housing slump will likely be the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s , this recession should not be as severe as the Depression .
Roubini said the recent $ 168 billion two - year fiscal stimulus package should have only a modest economic benefit because a gaping federal deficit limits the government ’s ability to throw money at the problem .
“ We are constrained because last time around we had plenty of bullets to spend .
This time around , there ’s going to be a major fiscal stimulus , but compared to the one we had ( in 2001 ) it ’s going to be one - third the size as a share of GDP ( gross domestic product ) , ” he said .
“ This time around , we ’re not going to be able to stimulate the economy as much .

We do n't particularly enjoy posting about auto accidents , as totaled cars and injured humans is never a good conversation starter .
Every once in a while , though , we get an opportunity to post about a crash that did n't happen thanks to the quick thinking and selfless nature of a good samaritan .
Such a near miss happened yesterday in San Francisco when a driver on the Golden Gate became unconscious and her Jeep Grand Cherokee came to a stop in the second lane from the center divide .
John Beatty almost rammed his Ford F - 350 into the back of the Jeep , but stopped just in time .
The 50 - year - old man from Mill Valley , CA then noticed the Jeep began to creep forward and to the left .
Realizing it was headed towards the divide and into oncoming traffic , Beatty positioned his truck in front of the SUV so that it would hit him instead of crossing over .
He then guided the Jeep across two lanes of road , which had fortunately been cleared of traffic when other drivers began to realize what Beatty was doing .
Unfortunately , there is a sad ending to this story , as the unconscious driver of the Jeep eventually died at the hospital .
If it had n't been for Beatty , however , you would 've heard about a fatal multi-car accident on the Golden Gate bridge last night .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - British rock band Led Zeppelin enjoyed jamming together again last year in a charity concert but wo n’t have another session before September at the earliest , lead guitarist Jimmy Page said in Tokyo on Monday .

Page poses for photographers before a news conference to promote the band 's album of live performances entitled " Mothership " in Tokyo , January 28 , 2008 .

A successful reunion show in London in December rekindled hopes of a world tour , but Page said that singer Robert Plant ’s tour with U.S. country singer Alison Krauss is keeping him busy for now .
“ I can assure you the amount of work that we put into the O2 ( concert ) , for ourselves rehearsing and the staging of it , was probably what you put into a world tour , ” Page said .
But , “ Robert Plant also had a parallel project running and he ’s really busy with that project , certainly until September , so I ca n’t give you any news . ”
Page , in Tokyo to promote a greatest hits release , painted a happy picture of the reunion .
“ It was exhilarating , fantastic , every week was a week to look forward to , ” he said .
“ We did the show and it was great . ”
The band , formed in 1968 by Page , Plant , bass guitarist John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham , became arguably the world ’s biggest rock group by the early 1970s .
Their fourth album , released in 1971 , included their most famous song , “ Stairway to Heaven , ” while the band has sold an estimated 300 million albums worldwide .
The group decided to break up shortly after Bonham died in September 1980 , although Page and Plant collaborated at times over the years .
Plant , Page and Jones performed together in London before about 20,000 fans on December 10 , with Bonham ’s son Jason on the drums .
When the concert was announced , the Internet site selling tickets crashed with applications , while the possibility of a new world tour had fans around the globe excited .
Page said after many years the song indeed remained the same .
“ That is what was so thrilling really -- to come together after all this time and find that there was so much chemistry and so much electricity involved in these four characters . ”
I am assuming you have beginning to intermediate experience with vector editing software .
If you do n't some tutorials should have you up to speed quickly .
- Open your vector editing program .
- Take the measurements you made in Step 2 and create a file with dimensions that match that size .
If your sign was 30 inches tall by 50 inches wide , set up your file to the same dimensions .
Create guides along those lines if they can be helpful for you .
- Take your straightened digital image and place it on a layer .
We 'll call that the base image .
Align the base image so the outside edges of the sign in the picture match up with the correct dimensions and / or guides .
Lock that layer .
- Start recreating the sign on the layers above the base image .
Work up until you have eliminated the base image entirely and you have a new sign .
- use your digital image as a guide to placement .
- use the eyedropper tool to match colors
- since you know the fonts , use the base image to gauge the correct sizes .
Note :
You can be off a couple inches and it wont make to big a difference .
Using this method should get a close enough match to the look and feel of the sign to be passable .

Claim : Children ’s Webkinz are being murdered online .
Status : False .
Examples :
[ Collected via e-mail , April 2007 ]
My children came home from school today , and all the talk in first and second grade was of some kind of webkinz malware .
A black , red or yellow box appears in your webkinz world .
If you click on the black box , a neopet pops out with a knife , and chops your webkinz ’ head off .
The red box does the same thing .
If you click on a yellow box , you loose all your webkinz possessions and “ money ” .
It sounds like a legend to me .
But little kids are telling my kids , “ This happened to me . ”
Not sure what to think .
[ Collected via e-mail , February 2007 ]
My kids came home from school yesterday telling me they heard of a computer virus issues associated with their webkins ( or webkinz ) .
webkinz are stuffed animals which you can buy and then somehow use the web to play games , etc. with friends who also have the animals .
The virus comes on the screen as a penguin with red eyes and ruins your PC .
[ Collected via e-mail , March 2007 ]
What I am hearing is that several of the kids at school have logged onto their webkinz and when they check their house , there is a killer bear roaming around with a knife and it stabs the other animals .
Supposedly a neighbor logged into hers and one of her animals was found lying in a pool of blood .
[ Collected via e-mail , April 2007 ]
This webkinz virus thing is TOTALLY true .
it happened 2 half my friends on webkinz .
there is either some kind of gift on the floor or some kind of bomby thingy .
it pops out like you got a gift .
then Dr. Quack or Miss Birdie pops up , lights go out , red eyes come , it makes slashing noises on your computer , and then the lights turn on and your webkinz are dead on the floor with blood on them .
You probably think that webkinz people would never do that .
you are right , but NEOPETS would .
Why ?
because they got angry that everyone went on webkinz and nobody went on neopets anymore , so they hacked into webkinz and put in some kind of virus .
It is pretty scary for kids , so be careful with what you do with your webkinz and DONT GO TO YOUR ROOM !!!
Origins :
In 2005 toymaker Ganz created “ Webkinz , ” a series of plush toys fashioned in the shape of fuzzy animals .
These playthings can be dressed in outfits specifically sold for such purpose and played with in the real world by their young owners , but what sets these particular dolls apart from other collections of “ plushies ” ( e.g. , Beanie Babies , Ty Punkies ) is that each Webkinz
comes with a secret code that gives its owner access to the online Webkinz World where the purchased “ pet ” can also be created and then played with as an online version of itself .
Webkinz owners buy toys , clothes and even furnishings for their pets ’ rooms in this cyber playland , paying for such purchases with Kinzcash , a virtual type of money gained by playing educational games on the web site or by spinning the site ’s “ Wheel of Wow . ”
As in the face - to - face world , little girls who play with their dollies in the online world fear for their charges ’ safety .
In the face - to - face world , what needs to be feared are horrid boys who will rip off dolls ’ heads just to make their owners cry , but in cyberspace it ’s the “ Webkinz Killer , ” a maliciously - placed element that randomly appears in Webkinz World to lay waste to the cyber versions of children ’s cherished plush toys .
Early in 2007 , the online playground was swept by rumors of this killer , which was said to lurk within Webkinz World .
The rumor has taken many forms :
Some say the killer is a virus that appears on the user ’s screen as penguin with red eyes that first lays waste to the user ’s Webkinz , then ruins her computer .
Or that “ a black , red or yellow box appears in your webkinz world .
If you click on the black box , a neopet pops out with a knife , and chops your webkinz ’ head off . ”
( A Neopet is another type of virtual pet found on a competing site . )
Or that various creatures within the Webkinz World ( such as a penguin , Dr. Quack , Mrs. Duck , Ms. Birdy , or a “ killer Chihuahua ” or “ killer bear ” ) randomly pop up within the game to slay users ’ beloved
playthings .
As to what happens to Webkinz who encounter the “ killer , ” rumor asserts they “ have their heads chopped off ” or are set upon “ with chainsaws . ”
The killer (s ) “ hides behind trees and kills Webkinz ” or “ comes after them with a knife if they clicked on them in a certain way . ”
Or the innocent playthings meet their gruesome ends by stooping to pick up “ some kind of gift on the floor or some kind of bomby thingy . ”
Others describe that the attack or virus “ makes slashing noises on your computer , and then the lights turn on and your webkinz are dead on the floor with blood on them . ”
Blood and gore appear to play large roles in these virtual deaths .
Dr. Quack , the game ’s online physician , is frequently fingered as the Webkinz Killer .
( Like their Tamagotchi predecessors , online Webkinz get sick if they ’re not tended to every few days .
Unlike Tamagotchi , however , sick Webkinz do n’t die ; they merely display as having green snouts and ice packs on their heads .
A visit to Dr. Quack and the forking over of some Kinzcash sets that malady to rights . )
As the Webkinz Killer , Dr. Quack supposedly “ will appear with red eyes and a knife and will kill the Webkinz ” or take after them “ with a chainsaw . ”
Likewise , Ms. Birdy ( the penguin who helps new owners through the online registration process of their pets ) is also said to come after Webkinz with a chainsaw or to chase them down with a knife after her eyes turn a fiery red .
As to who might have set these killers loose within the game , the rumors offer a variety of theories , such as a random computer virus somehow came to infect the Webkinz site , or the playground was deliberately assaulted by clubpenguin.com and Neopets.com ( competing online virtual pet sites ) , or “ some kind of past employee ” caused the mayhem .
( The “ angered ex-employee ” routinely appears in other rumors about something objectionable having been slipped into a product one would think wholly innocuous , such as the tale about a disgruntled artist who deliberately drew a male body part into the cover art for The Little Mermaid or the lexicographer who inserted an unusual definition for ‘ mutton ‘ into the 1999 edition of Random House ’s dictionary . )
All the tales about a “ Webkinz Killer ” are false ; there just is n’t any such critter .
As Webkinz says about the rumor :
Many people have been writing in , asking about a rumor that is going around .
The rumor is about something in Webkinz World hurting Webkinz pets .
The most important thing to know is that this rumor is not true at all .
Nothing in Webkinz World would ever hurt your Webkinz pets .
Many people have been writing in , asking about a rumor that is going around .
The rumor is about something in Webkinz World hurting Webkinz pets .
The most important thing to know is that this rumor is not true at all .
Nothing in Webkinz World would ever hurt your Webkinz pets .
Everyone at Webkinz World Headquarters works really hard to make Webkinz World a safe , happy and fun place to play .
We want you and your Webkinz pets to have a great time playing on the site .
Please make sure to tell your friends that their pets are safe and the rumor is not true .
Remember that we would never allow anything to hurt your Webkinz pets .
In the online world at least , Webkinz ca n’t die .
While they might at times get sick , they can always be restored to the pink of health by a visit to Dr. Quack .
Other Webkinz rumors have come to our attention .
They too are false :
[ Collected via e-mail , April 2007 ]
They were also told that if they kick their Webkinz ( again , online ) , they will get special prizes and their Webkinz would bleed .
And then there was the rumor that if they put “ evil ” in their user names , their pets would die !
[ Collected via e-mail , November 2007 ]
Rumor going around Bexley , OH that there is a Webkinz thief that can steal your Webkinz pets while you are logged onto the site , so people are being warned not to use the site .
Have heard there is a “ bloody hand ” that appears when the “ thief ” is stealing the pets / information .
Rumors about bad things happening to cyberspatial Webkinz are just that : rumors .
They are expressions of anxiety , specifically that the more one cherishes something , the more one fears harm will come to it .
Few things are beloved more by little girls and boys than their favorite toys , so it is far from suprising that a rumor about these playthings being laid waste to in gory fashion in their cyberspace playground would both spread far and wide and be deeply believed by the children who have put so much of their time , energy , and even their love into their online pets .
While an actual stuffed toy can be clutched to one ’s bosom and hidden from harm under the covers , online expressions of same cannot be so safeguarded , hence the anxiety that something will get them .

An interview with Martha Stout
Martha Stout , author of The Sociopath Next Door , explains how to recognize a sociopath , outlines her thirteen rules for dealing with sociopaths in everyday life , and gives specific advice for dealing with them in the workplace .
How do you spot a sociopath ?
A sociopath has no conscience , no ability to feel shame , guilt or remorse .
Since 1 in 25 ordinary Americans is a sociopath , you almost certainly know one or more than one already .
How can you recognize him or her ?
Sociopaths learn early on to show sham emotion , but underneath they live only to dominate others and win .
They have a kind of glow or charisma that makes them more charming or interesting than the other people around them .
They are more spontaneous , more intense , complex , or even sexier than everyone else .
They crave stimulation and excitement , often showing brief intense enthusiasms that they later drop .
They are seductive , encouraging others to take risks .
They will tell you that you are just like them .
Do n't believe it .
Who is the devil you know ?
Could it be your lying , cheating ex-husband ?
Your sadistic high school gym teacher ?
Your boss who loves to humiliate people in meetings ?
Sometimes you just know 'em when you see 'em .
Historical sociopaths : Hitler , Stalin , Rasputin , Eichmann , Pol Pot , John Gotti
Thirteen Rules for Dealing with Sociopaths in Everyday Life
The first rule involves the bitter pill of accepting that some people literally have no conscience , and that these people do not often look like Charles Manson or a Ferengi bartender .
They look like us .
In a contest between your instincts and what is implied by the role a person has taken on -- educator , doctor , leader , animal - lover , humanist , parent -- go with your instincts .
Whether you want to be or not , you are a constant observer of human behavior , and your unfiltered impressions , though alarming and seemingly outlandish , may well help you out if you will let them .
Your best self understands , without being told , that impressive and moral - sounding labels do not bestow conscience on anyone who did not have it to begin with .
When considering a new relationship of any kind , practice the Rule of Threes regarding the claims and promises a person makes , and the responsibilities he or she has .
Make the Rule of Threes your personal policy .
One lie , one broken promise , or a single neglected responsibility may be a misunderstanding instead .
Two may involve a serious mistake .
But three lies says you 're dealing with a liar , and deceit is the linchpin of conscienceless behavior .
Cut your losses and get out as soon as you can .
Leaving , though it may be hard , will be easier now than later , and less costly .
Do not give your money , your work , your secrets , or your affection to a three - timer .
Your valuable gifts will be wasted .
Question authority .
Once again -- trust your own instincts and anxieties , especially those concerning people who claim that dominating others , violence , war , or some other violation of your conscience is the grand solution to some problem .
Do this even when , or especially when , everyone around you has completely stopped questioning authority .
Recite to yourself what Stanley Milgram taught us about obedience .
( At least six out of ten people will blindly obey a present , official - looking authority to the bitter end . )
The good news is that having social support makes people somewhat more likely to challenge authority .
Encourage those around you to question , too .
Suspect flattery .
Compliments are lovely , especially when they are sincere .
In contrast , flattery is extreme , and appeals to our egos in unrealistic ways .
It is the material of counterfeit charm , and nearly always involves an intent to manipulate .
Manipulation through flattery is sometimes innocuous and sometimes sinister .
Peek over your massaged ego and remember to suspect flattery .
This " flattery rule " applies on an individual basis , and also at the level of groups and even whole nations .
Throughout all of human history and to the present , the call to war has included the flattering claim that one 's own forces are about to accomplish a victory that will change the world for the better , a triumph that is morally laudable , justified by its humane outcome , unique in human endeavor , righteous , and worthy of enormous gratitude .
Since we began to record the human story , all of our major wars have been framed in this way , on all sides of the conflict , and in all languages the adjective most often applied to the word war is the word holy .
An argument can easily be made that humanity will have peace when nations of people are at last able to see through this masterful flattery .
If necessary , redefine your concept of respect .
Too often , we mistake fear for respect , and the more fearful we are of someone , the more we view him or her as deserving of our respect .
I have a spotted Bengal cat who was named Muscle Man by my daughter when she was a toddler , because even as a kitten he looked like a professional wrestler .
Grown now , he is much larger than most other domestic cats .
His formidable claws resemble those of his Asian leopard - cat ancestors , but by temperament , he is gentle and peace - loving .
My neighbor has a little calico who visits .
Evidently the calico's predatory charisma is huge , and she is brilliant at directing the evil eye at other cats .
Whenever she is within fifty feet , Muscle Man , all fifteen pounds of him to her seven , cringes and crouches in fear and feline deference .
Muscle Man is a splendid cat .
He is warm and loving , and he is close to my heart .
Nonetheless , I would like to believe that some of his reactions are more primitive than mine .
I hope I do not mistake fear for respect , because to do so would be to ensure my own victimization .
Let us use our big human brains to overpower our animal tendency to bow to predators , so we can disentangle the reflexive confusion of anxiety and awe .
In a perfect world , human respect would be an automatic reaction only to those who are strong , kind , and morally courageous .
The person who profits from frightening you is not likely to be any of these .
The resolve to keep respect separate from fear is even more crucial for groups and nations .
The politician , small or lofty , who menaces the people with frequent reminders of the possibility of crime , violence , or terrorism , and who then uses their magnified fear to gain allegiance is more likely to be a successful con artist than a legitimate leader .
This too has been true throughout human history .
Do not join the game .
Intrigue is a sociopath 's tool .
Resist the temptation to compete with a seductive sociopath , to outsmart him , psychoanalyze , or even banter with him .
In addition to reducing yourself to his level , you would be distracting yourself from what is really important , which is to protect yourself .
The best way to protect yourself from a sociopath is to avoid him , to refuse any kind of contact or communication .
Psychologists do not usually like to recommend avoidance , but in this case , I make a very deliberate exception .
The only truly effective method for dealing with a sociopath you have identified is to disallow him or her from your life altogether .
Sociopaths live completely outside of the social contract , and therefore to include them in relationships or other social arrangements is perilous .
Begin this exclusion of them in the context of your own relationships and social life .
You will not hurt anyone 's feelings .
Strange as it seems , and though they may try to pretend otherwise , sociopaths do not have any such feelings to hurt .
You may never be able to make your family and friends understand why you are avoiding a particular individual .
Sociopathy is surprisingly difficult to see , and harder to explain .
Avoid hi /her anyway .
If total avoidance is impossible , make plans to come as close as you can to the goal of total avoidance .
Question your tendency to pity too easily .
Respect should be reserved for the kind and the morally courageous .
Pity is another socially valuable response , and should be reserved for innocent people who are in genuine pain or who have fallen on misfortune .
If , instead , you find yourself often pitying someone who consistently hurts you or other people , and who actively campaigns for your sympathy , the chances are close to one hundred percent that you are dealing with a sociopath .
Related to this -- I recommend that you severely challenge your need to be polite in absolutely all situations .
For normal adults in our culture , being what we think of as " civilized " is like a reflex , and often we find ourselves being automatically decorous even when someone has enraged us , repeatedly lied to us , or figuratively stabbed us in the back .
Sociopaths take huge advantage of this automatic courtesy in exploitive situations .
Do not be afraid to be unsmiling and calmly to the point .
Do not try to redeem the unredeemable .
Second ( third , fourth , and fifth ) chances are for people who possess conscience .
If you are dealing with a person who has no conscience , know how to swallow hard and cut your losses .
At some point , most of us need to learn the important if disappointing life lesson that , no matter how good our intentions , we cannot control the behavior -- let alone the character structures -- of other people .
Learn this fact of human life , and avoid the irony of getting caught up in the same ambition he has -- to control .
If you do not desire control , but instead want to help people , then help only those who truly want to be helped .
I think you will find this does not include the person who has no conscience .
The sociopath 's behavior is not your fault , not in any way whatsoever .
It is also not your mission .
Your mission is your own life .
Never agree , out of pity or for any other reason , to help a sociopath conceal his or her true character .
" Please do n't tell , " often spoken tearfully and with great gnashing of teeth , is the trademark plea of thieves , child abusers -- and sociopaths .
Do not listen to this siren - song .
Other people deserve to be warned more than sociopaths deserve to have you keep their secrets .
If someone without conscience insists that you " owe " him or her , recall what you are about to read here -- that " You owe me " has been the standard line of sociopaths for thousands of years , quite literally , and is still so .
It is what Rasputin told the Empress of Russia .
It is what Hannah 's father implied to her , after her eye - opening conversation with him at the prison .
We tend to experience " You owe me " as a compelling claim , but it is simply not true .
Do not listen .
Also , ignore the one that goes , " You are just like me . "
You are not .
Defend your psyche .
Do not allow someone without conscience , or even a string of such people , to convince you that humanity is a failure .
Most human beings do possess conscience .
Most human beings are able to love .
Living well is the best revenge .
Advice For The Workplace
Is there a bully where you work ?
Are you concerned that your coworker may be lying about you behind your back ?
Does your boss insult you , or seem to want to make your life more difficult ?
Have you ever suspected that someone at the top is cheating ?
If so , you may actually be dealing with a sociopath , a person who literally has no conscience , who loves to make people jump just for the fun of it -- a person who can do anything at all without the slightest twinge of guilt .
Four percent of Americans are sociopaths , meaning that they have no conscience , and this statistic probably gets larger as one goes up the ladder of success .
At the top echelons of success in big business , sociopaths are probably even more plentiful .
Most sociopaths in business are not physically violent , and they do n't look like Charles Manson .
They look like we do .
In your daily work life , how can you identify and cope effectively with such people ?
Here are some guidelines :
SUSPECT FLATTERY .
Sincere compliments from a coworker or a boss are nice , but outrageous flattery is often an attempt to draw you into a sociopath 's snare .
If you feel your ego is being massaged , you may be dealing with a sociopath .
Be careful .
TAKE LABELS AND TITLES WITH A GRAIN OF SALT .
Just because someone is older than you , has a higher position or more degrees , or is wealthier than you does not mean his or her moral judgment is better than yours .
IN YOUR ASSESSMENTS OF THE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH , PRACTICE THE RULE OF THREES .
( The author will explain what this is . )
ALWAYS QUESTION AUTHORITY WHEN IT CONFLICTS WITH YOUR OWN SENSE OF RIGHT AND WRONG .
This may be hard to do , but it is crucial to your own career and well - being .
NEVER AGREE TO HELP A SOCIOPATH CONCEAL HIS OR HER SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES AT WORK .
If you are afraid of your boss , NEVER CONFUSE THESE FEELINGS WITH RESPECT .
NEVER HAVE A PRIVATE ARGUMENT WITH A SOCIOPATH AT WORK .
( The author will explain why not . )
REALISTICALLY ASSESS THE DAMAGE TO YOUR LIFE .
If it 's too great , you may have to leave .
Remember that living well is the best revenge .

To Charlie Thomas , it must have seemed like a wizard idea .
Spotting a discarded traffic cone , the imaginative three - year - old immediately saw its potential as an impromptu Harry Potter outfit .
But after placing it carefully on his head to show his family , the magic soon disappeared .
The plastic cone became firmly stuck and despite the best efforts of the toddler 's parents , it refused to budge .
Scroll down for more ...
Perhaps a Potter - style cry of ' Expelliarmus ! ' might have helped .
But in the end they had to call the fire brigade - and it took a crew of six half an hour to release Charlie using cutting tools and pliers .
Yesterday , his mother said Charlie was left with a slight bruising to his head - and pride - after his attempt to mimic his Hogwarts hero .
Louisa Thomas , 34 , said : " He loves Harry Potter and when he put the cone on he was so pleased with himself , it was very sweet .
" But when we could n't get it off it was a bit scary .
" We should n't have laughed but we had a chuckle - he looked so comical even though he was a bit upset . "
Scroll down for more ...
The bank worker added : " He was very good while the firemen were there and he did n't panic .
They got him out by pouring water down the top of the cone for lubrication and cutting the rim .
" He looks quite sorry for himself in the photo and he's not going to thank me when he sees that in the future . "
Charlie , who turned three at the weekend , was on a family outing to fly his brand new kite when the incident happened .
Scroll down for more ...
After lunch with his parents , grandparents and sisters Emily , eight , and Isabella , four , the family visited a playing field near their home in Cullompton , Devon .
But before the kite was in the air , he had picked up the cone from the side of the field and put it on his head .
Mrs Thomas and her husband Martin , a car sprayer , tried wiggling him free , pulling the cone and using soapy water .
Scroll down for more ...
When they thought their only option was to cut the cone , they called the fire brigade for help , who spent 30 minutes cutting him free using small levers , cutting tools and pliers .
Mrs Thomas said : " We had gone across to the school field with the kite when Charlie picked up the cone and wore it as a wizard 's hat .
Then he ran over and said , ' It 's stuck ' .
Scroll down for more ...
" We tried to pull it off , tried laying him down and wiggling him free but that did n't work .
We tried soapy water but that did n't do the trick so we had to call the fire brigade to cut it . "
Mr Thomas said Charlie was very excited by Halloween which , combined with his love for Harry Potter , meant the cone was an irresistible temptation .
He said : " My first reaction was laughter .
It was n't until I got over to him and realised it was really stuck that I got worried . "
CompUSA will live on , thanks to a deal with electronics marketer Systemax .
Systemax , which owns popular computer parts reseller ( and CompUSA competitor ) TigerDirect , announced yesterday that it has entered into an agreement to purchase the CompUSA brand , trademarks , and e-commerce business .
It also plans to acquire select assets and retail stores from the company , and says that it expects to close various parts of the deal throughout the first quarter of the year .
" We believe the value of the CompUSA brand remains very high .
The company has a long legacy of value pricing , service and customer loyalty among consumers nationwide , " said Systemax CEO Richard Leeds in a statement .
" We view this acquisition as a strong complementary business to our TigerDirect operation . "
The announcement comes exactly a month after CompUSA announced that it had been sold to restructuring firm Gordon Brothers Group to close the remainder of its 103 stores .
At the time , Gordon Brothers Group said that it planned to sell select stores in key markets in addition to CompUSA.com and the company 's tech service business , and it was widely rumored that TigerDirect would swoop in to buy those assets .
Retail stores that were n't in the process of being sold were closed just after the holidays .
TigerDirect has been a popular stop online for computer enthusiasts looking for a good deal for many years , but has been growing its brick - and - mortar presence as of late .
TigerDirect already operates 11 retail stores in several states and one in Canada ; Systemax says that it is currently looking at up to 16 CompUSA locations in Florida , Texas , and Puerto Rico , which it says will be integrated into TigerDirect 's existing retail environment .
CompUSA.com , on the other hand , will continue to operate under its own name , but under Systemax 's ownership once the agreement is closed .
Systemax expects the direct costs of the acquisition to come to about $ 30 million , not counting legal fees , inventory , and other expenses .
Although the purchase will mean plenty of changes for CompUSA 's stores , website , and brand , it 's strangely comforting to know that it will go on under new ownership .
[ Majikthise Exclusive ]
A retired CIA agent who led the team that waterboarded terror suspect Abu Zubaydah went on to work as a security consultant for the film adaptation of The Kite Runner ( 2007 ) .
Lobbyists for Viacom helped the producers of the film retain retired CIA agent and " countererrorism expert " , John Kiriakou , according an Oct 4 article in the International Herald Tribune - - before Kirkakou went public about his career as a torturer .
The producers of Kite Runner realized belatedly that the film 's release might put movie 's child stars in serious danger :
In late July , with violence worsening in Kabul , studio executives looked for experts who could help them chart a safe course .
Aided by lobbyists for Viacom , Paramount 's parent company , they found John Kiriakou , the retired CIA operative with experience in the region , and had him conduct interviews in Washington and Kabul .
" They wanted to do the right thing , but they wanted to understand what the right thing was , " Kiriakou said .
[ IHT ]
The Kite Runner is an adaptation of a Khaled Husseini novel that touches on ethnic tensions in Afghanistan , rape , and the Taliban .
The release of the film was delayed for several weeks because the boys were getting threats and the producers needed time to get them out of Afghanistan .
On Dec. 5 , the IHT reported that four young actors and accompanying adult relatives had been whisked off to the United Arab Emirates for their own protection :
Months of spadework by at least 20 studio executives , relief workers , diplomats and even a former CIA counterterrorism operative culminated last week when the boys , who were in the midst of final exams , obtained visas and boarded a plane for the United Arab Emirates . [ IHT ]
The film opens on Dec. 14 .
Majikthise is first publication to report on Kiriakou 's work as a security consultant in light of his torture revelations .

Evidence suggests New York Times editors deliberately held McCain lobbyist story John Byrne
Published : Thursday February 21 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Hints that Washington Post also had elements of story The New York Times faces a gathering storm after a panoply of new reports suggest the paper sat on a story detailing an alleged romantic involvement between Sen.
John McCain ( R - AZ ) and 40 - year - old Washington lobbyist Vicki Iseman .
Last night , two Times staffers told Politico the second lead reporter on the Times story , Marilyn Thompson , announced she was leaving her job at the Times Feb. 12 after concerns the piece had not yet run .
Thompson said she was returning to the Washington Post .
" Rumors had circulated internally that Thompson had been working on the McCain piece and was dissatisfied it had not yet run , according to two Times staffers , " the site 's Jonathan Martin and Michael Calderone wrote .
Martin asked Times Washington Bureau chief Dean Baquet if sitting on the piece had anything to do with her departure .
" I 'm not going to go into stories that may or may not run in the paper , " Baquet said .
" I had long conversations with Marilyn , and it 's about her regarding the Post as home . "
Thompson 's byline is the only one of the four authors not linked on the Times piece .
What 's more , McCain aide Charlie Black said late last night that the Times had only moved their piece because another piece was to come out in The New Republic .
After The New Republic 's reporter began making phone calls to the Times , they decided to publish , he said .
The magazine posted its piece detailing behind the scenes efforts at the Times Thursday afternoon .
" It pitted the reporters investigating the story , who believed they had nailed it , against executive editor Bill Keller , who believed they hadn't , " writes TNR 's Gabriel Sherman .
" It likely cost the paper one investigative reporter , who decided to leave in frustration .
And the Times ended up publishing a piece in which the institutional tensions about just what the story should be are palpable . "
Sherman says the four reporters assigned to the McCain story came from both its Washington and New York bureaus , which have feuded in recent years .
The Drudge Reports first post on the developing Times ' story came two days after the reporters met with McCain 's attorney Bob Bennett , who previously represented Bill Clinton .
The source of that Dec. 20 Drudge post remains unknown .
In a blog post , The New Republic 's senior editor Noam Scheiber wrote : " The McCain campaign is apparently blaming TNR for forcing the Times ' hand on this story .
We can't yet confirm that .
But we can say this : TNR correspondent Gabe Sherman is working on a piece about the Times ' foot - dragging on the McCain story , and the back - and - forth within the paper about whether to publish it .
Gabe 's story will be online tomorrow . "
Drudge fingered story in December Last December , the conservative news and gossip site The Drudge Report floated a story averring that McCain was in a " ferocious behind the scenes battle " not to publish a report saying McCain had given special treatment to a female lobbyist .
During the 2004 election campaign , Drudge published an apocryphal story alleging Sen. John Kerry ( D - MA ) had an affair , so Drudge 's McCain story seemed to be of dubious authenticity .
But Drudge 's claim may warrant a fresh look following the story 's release .
" Just weeks away from a possible surprise victory in the primaries , Republican presidential candidate Sen .
John McCain , R - Ariz has been waging a ferocious behind the scenes battle with the NEW YORK TIMES , the DRUDGE REPORT has learned , " the site remarked , " and has hired DC power lawyer Bob Bennett to mount a bold defense against charges of giving special treatment to a lobbyist ! "
" McCain has personally pleaded with NY TIMES editor Bill Keller [ at left ] not to publish the high - impact report involving key telecom legislation before the Senate Commerce Committee , newsroom insiders tell the DRUDGE REPORT , " Drudge continued .
" The paper 's Jim Rutenberg has been leading the investigation and is described as beyond frustrated with McCain 's aggressive and angry efforts to stop any and all publication . "
" The drama involves a woman lobbyist who may have helped to write key telecom legislation , " he added .
" The woman in question has retained counsel and strongly denies receiving any special treatment from McCain . "
The lead author on the Times piece : Jim Rutenberg .
Within hours ,
Post had several anonymous sources A 1,000 word piece in Thursday 's Washington Post -- which quotes four anonymous sources dealing with an alleged " inappropriate " liaison between Sen.
John McCain ( R - AZ ) could suggest the paper already had a story ready to roll , raising new questions about why media outlets held a story that was apparently in the works as early as December .
The Post piece , " McCain 's Ties To Lobbyist Worried Aides , " by Michael Shear and Jeffrey Birnbaum , did not draw from the rich panoply of sources the Times piece did , and did not as strongly suggest McCain had had an affair .
The Washington Post receives early copies of the Times under an agreement whereby the Post is able to rewrite short form versions of Times pieces .
The Times story , " For McCain , Self - Confidence on Ethics Poses Its Own Risk " was posted early Wednesday evening .
But its emergence on the same day as the Times piece -- with four sources of its own -- adds new kindling to claims that major media outlets sat on the story last year .
Author floated rumor LA Times held story Journalist and author Ron Rosenbaum wrote in a blog post from October of last year that he'd heard the Los Angeles Times was sitting on a sex story about a presidential candidate .
Rosenbaum said he'd " run into a well - connected media person , who told me flatly , unequivocally that ' everyone knows '
The LA Times was sitting on a story , all wrapped up and ready to go about what is a potentially devastating sexual scandal involving a leading Presidential candidate . "
The LA Times apparently never did publish the piece , if it is indeed the same story as reported by the New York Times .
The LA Times , however , did not publish an exclusive piece on the topic Thursday .
Their article , " McCain 's ties to female lobbyist questioned , " relied on compiled wire reports from the Post and the Times , to which the Los Angeles paper is a subscriber .
The Post piece cited a senior McCain aide as the main source for their story .
The Times cited the same aide , though with less emphasis .
" John Weaver , who was McCain 's closest confidant until leaving his current campaign last year , said he met with Vicki Iseman at the Center Cafe at Union Station and urged her to stay away from McCain , " the authors wrote .
" Association with a lobbyist would undermine his image as an opponent of special interests , aides had concluded . "
" We were running a campaign about reforming Washington , and her showing up at events and saying she had close ties to McCain was harmful , " another anonymous aide said .
" ' The aide said the message to Iseman that day at Union Station in 1999 was clear : ' She should get lost . '
The aide said Iseman stood up and left angrily . "
Three " telecom lobbyists " and a former McCain aide spoke on condition of anonymity to the Post .
It 's unclear whether Weaver was a fifth source .
" I never discussed with him alleged things I had ' told people , ' that had made their way " back to him , " she wrote in an e-mail message .
She said she never received special treatment from Mr. McCain 's office .
Perhaps most damning in the Times piece is its second paragraph : " A female lobbyist had been turning up with him at fund - raisers , visiting his offices and accompanying him on a client 's corporate jet .
Convinced the relationship had become romantic , some of his top advisers intervened to protect the candidate from himself -- instructing staff members to block the woman 's access , privately warning her away and repeatedly confronting him , several people involved in the campaign said on the condition of anonymity . "
According to the Post , the lobbyist 's firm is " heavy with municipalities and local government entities , which suggests that its major emphasis is on the controversial business of winning narrowly targeted , or ' earmarked , ' appropriations . "
Both the Times and the Post shied away from making direct sexual allegations , focusing instead on a tamer line : that McCain 's close association with a lobbyist undermined his issue as a vociferous supporter of campaign finance reform .
Times no stranger to ' holding story ' claims
The New York Times is no stranger to criticism over holding explosive content .
In late 2005 , the Times published their now famous piece revealing a secret National Security Agency wiretapping program .
Though its lead author , James Risen ( at right ) , has refused to comment about events leading up to its publication under an agreement with the paper , a soon - to - be released book project seems to have pushed the Times to publish the piece , the details of which they 'd had for some time .
" According to multiple newsroom sources close to Mr. Risen , the reporter was vocal in his desire to get the wiretapping piece into print , and he informed Times Washington bureau chief Philip Taubman that the material would be appearing in his book , " the New York Observer wrote in early 2006 .
" Mr. Risen left the paper on book leave in January 2005 and resumed his campaign to get The Times to publish the wiretapping piece when he returned to the bureau last June .
That set off a renewed push by The Times to get the story into print .
Mr. Taubman resumed discussions with senior Bush administration officials over the paper 's interest in publishing the scoop , according to sources with knowledge of the events , culminating in the Dec. 6 Oval Office face - off pitting President George W. Bush against Mr. Keller , Mr. Taubman and Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. "
In the final story , the authors admitted they had held the piece for a year because of concern from Bush Administration officials .
" The White House asked The New York Times not to publish this article , arguing that it could jeopardize continuing investigations and alert would - be terrorists that they might be under scrutiny , " the authors wrote .
" After meeting with senior administration officials to hear their concerns , the newspaper delayed publication for a year to conduct additional reporting . "
Co-bylined with Eric Lichtblau , Risen 's story , " Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts , " appeared in the paper Dec. 16 , 2005 .

The last WWII soldier : did n't surrender until 1974 !
Published on 10/26/2007
On December 17 , 1944 , the Japanese army sent a twenty - three year old soldier named Hiroo Onoda to the Philippines to join the Sugi Brigade .
He was stationed on the small island of Lubang ( Philippines ) , and his orders were to lead the Lubang Garrison in guerrilla warfare .
As Onoda was departing to begin his mission , his division commander told him , " You are absolutely forbidden to die by your own hand .
It may take three years , it may take five , but whatever happens , we 'll come back for you .
Until then , so long as you have one soldier , you are to continue to lead him .
You may have to live on coconuts .
If that 's the case , live on coconuts !
Under no circumstances are you to give up your life voluntarily . "
It turns out that Onoda was exceptionally good at following orders , and it would be 29 years before he finally laid down his arms and surrendered .
In February 1945 , towards the conclusion of World War II , he was still there when the Lubang Island was reclaimed by the Allies , but Onoda , and several other men , hid in the dense jungle .
Onoda continued his campaign , initially living in the mountains with three fellow soldiers , Akatsu , Shimada , and Kozuka .
One of his comrades , Akatsu , eventually surrendered to Filipino forces , and the other two were killed in gun battles with local forces — one in 1954 , the other in 1972 — leaving Onoda alone in the mountains .
For 29 years , he refused to surrender , dismissing every attempt to convince him that the war was over as a ruse .
In 1959 , Onoda was declared legally dead in Japan .
Found by a Japanese student , Norio Suzuki , Onoda still refused to accept that the war was over unless he received orders to lay down his arms from his superior officer .
Suzuki offered his help , and returned to Japan with photographs of himself and Onoda as proof of their encounter .
In 1974 the Japanese government located Onoda 's commanding officer , Major Taniguchi , who had since become a bookseller .
He flew to Lubang and informed Onoda of the defeat of Japan in WWII and ordered him to lay down his arms .
Lieutenant Onoda emerged from the jungle 29 years after the end of World War II , and accepted the commanding officer 's order of surrender in his dress uniform and sword , with his Arisaka Type 99 rifle still in operating condition , 500 rounds of ammunition and several hand grenades .
Though he had killed some thirty Philippine inhabitants of the island and engaged in several shootouts with the police , the circumstances of these events were taken into consideration , and Onoda received a pardon from President Ferdinand Marcos .
After his surrender , Onoda moved to Brazil , where he became a cattle farmer .
He released an autobiography , No Surrender : My Thirty - Year War , shortly after his surrender , detailing his life as a guerrilla fighter in a war that was long over .
He revisited Lubang Island in 1996 , donating $ 10,000 for the local school on Lubang .
He then married a Japanese woman and moved back to Japan where he established a nature camp for kids .
At the camp Onoda shares what he learned about survival through resourcefulness and ingenuity .
As of 2007 , Onoda is still living in Japan .

Last week , candidates were complaining about their not being included in some debates .
This week , low attendance is forcing National Public Radio to cancel its forum with the Republican candidates in Columbia , S.C .
“ We had commitments , we had some people whose schedules were fluid , and the ultimate decision was to cancel it , ” said Andi Sporkin , a spokeswoman for NPR .
The debate , scheduled for next Wednesday , would have come one day after the Michigan primary , which is shaping up to be a pivotal race for the Republicans .
South Carolina ’s Republican primary will be on Jan. 19 .
It is not the first political gathering to be canceled or postponed this season .
When the top - tier contenders declined to attend his Republican forum on public television in September , the host , Tavis Smiley , held the event anyway , with the absent candidates ’ names on lonely lecterns .
Professor Pengchen ( Patrick )
Fu is using cyanobacteria to produce ethanol from sunlight , carbon dioxide , and water .
I got to see this first - hand at Wired NextFest .
This is exceedingly cool since ethanol , a useful fuel , burns cleanly to produce energy , carbon dioxide , and water .
See the pattern ?
It ’s a sustainable cycle , essentially storing solar energy in a fuel that we already know and love .
There is very little waste in this process , and it ’s quite harmless , in the form of oxygen and some dead bacteria at the end of their natural life cycles .
This is already cool enough that I think I need to sit down for a while and take it all in , but there is more !
In case the photo did n’t make things amply evident , let me state clearly : Pengchen ( Patrick )
Fu has come up with a possible solution for renewable energy using large , glowing cylinders full of bubbling green liquid .
These things look like they came straight off the set of a science fiction movie .
You know , the good kind , with lots of explosions .
[ update ]
Some more details :
The tubes shown in the pic each yield about 5 grams of ethanol per day .
Fu expects improvements to this yield after more research into the process .
He also talked about setting up kiloliter - sized tanks of this stuff for larger output .
[ speculations ]
5 grams of ethanol contains about 134 kilojoules of energy .
If we had solar panels instead , assuming about 8 kWh / m^2/day , and 40 % efficient solar panels , we would need about 116 square centimeters of solar panel to get the same yield ( an 11 cm x 11 cm patch would do ) .
I would estimate that Fu’s process is therefore less than one order of magnitude less efficient than the best solar cells at the moment .
That ’s not shabby , considering that the energy is stored in a fuel instead of a ( costly ) battery .
Deeper vats of the stuff would mean more sunlight gets absorbed by the cyanobacteria , so the kiloliter tanks would probably have much better efficiency .
They never offer a real apology .
It ’s always some well - scripted line about how they did n’t mean to offend you , or they ’re sorry if you were offended .
They ’re not sorry for what they said .
They ’re sorry if you misunderstood it .
To wit :
This idiot Republican Congressman , Rep. Bill Sali of Idaho , who said that the Founding Fathers never intended Muslims to be elected to Congress .
“ We have not only a Hindu prayer being offered in the Senate , we have a Muslim member of the House of Representatives now , Keith Ellison from Minnesota .
Those are changes — and they are not what was envisioned by the Founding Fathers , ” Sali said , according to an article on the network ’s Web site .
Now he ’s offered an “ apology . ”
Sali responded days later , sending Ellison an e-mail explaining he meant no offense .
“ He said that he wanted to make sure that Congressman Ellison understood that he meant no harm or disrespect , ” Sali spokesman Wayne Hoffman said .
Did you get that ?
He meant no offense , harm , or disrespect when he said that the Founding Fathers would have never wanted a Muslim - American elected to high office in America .
Then what exactly did he mean ?
What does he think of the substance of what he said ?
Why does the media accept these non-apologies as true apologies .
A real apology would be : I was wrong , I was rude , I was offensive , and I ’m sorry .
In this case , the congressman actually pretty much stood behind what he said , all he ’s talking about what his “ motivation ” in saying it .
Well that ’s nice .
But lots of bigotry in America is n’t motivated by a desire to be a bigot .
It ’s usually motivated by your sense that you ’re correct , that you have morality and God and history on your side .
Very few people with bigoted views actually intend to be bigots .
Usually , they intend to be Godly .
But they ’re still bigots .
When your website gets indexed by Google it will be added to Google ’s regular crawling .
This means that Google will load pages from your site at a regular interval .
If your website is popular ( high traffic and many inbound links ) it will be crawled more often than if it is seen as a less important site .
Google tries to adjust the crawling to hours to when it ’s easier to access your site .
If your site is seen as unreliable by Google you can be punished by losing positions in the search engine result pages .
“ Unreliable ” can mean that your website is slow or that Google has had several issues with indexing your website .
If your site is completely down or responds with a server error page , Google will come back later and try again .
After several attempts they will however give up and remove you from their index .
In other words , you lose all the traffic you get from searches in Google .
Above : Graph showing how organic search traffic from Google can be affected if your site is dropped from the search index due to downtime .
Matt Cutts , a Google employee , and Vanessa Fox , a former Google employee , have said the following regarding Google indexing and downtime :
“ Googlebot will try a few times before the pages drop from the index . ” – Vanessa Fox
“ As for how long it takes for a page to get back in once the site is back up , that really depends on a number of factors , such as how often the site is crawled in general . ”
– Vanessa Fox
“ Sometimes temporarily down pages turn into truly - gone - forever pages , so we have to drop those pages at some point .
But it ’s also true that we go back and revisit those pages pretty often and try to recrawl them in case the site comes back up . ” – Matt Cutts
It seems that depending on the size of your website , luck (! ) and the type of issues you are having , anything can happen between nothing and being completely removed from Google ’s index .
From all the discussions about this topic you can only come to one conclusion : uptime is very important if you do n’t want to rely on pure luck .

The true scale of climate change emissions from shipping is almost three times higher than previously believed , according to a leaked UN study seen by the Guardian .
It calculates that annual emissions from the world 's merchant fleet have already reached 1.12 bn tonnes of CO 2 , or nearly 4.5 % of all global emissions of the main greenhouse gas .
The report suggests that shipping emissions - which are not taken into account by European targets for cutting global warming - will become one of the largest single sources of manmade CO 2 after cars , housing , agriculture and industry .
By comparison , the aviation industry , which has been under heavy pressure to clean up , is responsible for about 650 m tonnes of CO 2 emissions a year , just over half that from shipping .
Until now , the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated shipping emissions to be a maximum 400 m tonnes , but the new draft report by a group of international scientists is a more sophisticated measure , using data collected from the oil and shipping industries for the International Maritime Organisation , the UN agency tasked with monitoring pollution from ships .
It not only shows emissions are much worse than feared , but warns CO 2 emissions are set to rise by a further 30 % by 2020 .
Contacted about the contents of the report , Dr Rajendra Pachauri , chair of the IPCC , said : " This is a clear failure of the system .
The shipping industry has so far escaped publicity .
It has been left out of the climate change discussion .
I hope [ shipping emissions ] will be included in the next UN agreement .
It would be a cop - out if it was not .
It tells me that we have been ineffective at tackling climate change so far . "
The figure is highly embarrassing for the four governments , including Britain , that paid for the report .
Governments and the EU have consistently played down the climate impact of shipping , saying it is less than 2 % of global emissions and failing to include shipping emissions in their national estimates for CO 2 emissions .
Pressure is now expected to increase on shipowners to switch to better fuels and on the EU to include shipping in its emission trading scheme .
Last month aviation was provisionally included following intense pressure - but shipping escaped .
Previous attempts by the industry to calculate levels of carbon emissions were largely based on the quantity of low grade fuel bought by shipowners .
The latest UN figures are considered more accurate because they are based on the known engine size of the world 's ships , as well as the time they spend at sea and the amount of low grade fuel sold to shipowners .
The UN report also reveals that other pollutants from shipping are rising even faster than CO 2 emissions .
Sulphur and soot emissions , which give rise to lung cancers , acid rain and respiratory problems are expected to rise more than 30 % over the next 12 years .
The health implications of shipping emissions are most acute for Britain and other countries bordering the English Channel , one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes .
A recent peer - reviewed study of shipping emissions found world shipping led directly to 60,000 deaths a year .
Peter Swift , managing director of Intertanko , the grouping of the world 's largest tanker operators which provided data for the report , said the industry was taking steps to cut emissions .
" World trade and ship numbers have seen a steady increase , but in parallel there have been economies of scale with larger , more efficient ships .
Individual ships have steadily been reducing their fuel consumption for the last 20 years .
One litre of fuel on a modern very large crude carrier moves one tonne of cargo more than 2,800 km ; this is more than twice as far as 20 years ago . "
Caroline Lucas , Green MEP for south - east England , said : " These new figures highlight the shocking complacency of governments which have completely ignored shipping emissions .
It is essential that our own government 's new climate change bill includes both shipping and aviation emissions and measures are urgently brought forward at EU level . "
A spokesman for the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs said the government would support the development of a global emissions trading scheme through the IMO , and was also " investigating the feasibility of including maritime emissions " in the EU 's trading scheme .
He said the shipping industry must take its " share of responsibility " for tackling climate change .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The top three U.S. banks have agreed on the structure of a backup fund of at least $ 75 billion to stabilize credit markets , The New York Times reported on Sunday .
Citing a person involved in the discussions , who spoke on condition of anonymity , the Times said that Bank of America BAC.N , Citigroup Inc. C.N and JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM.N officials reached agreement late on Friday , approving a more simplified structure than had been proposed during the course of some two months of negotiations .
“ We cleared all the big hurdles , ” the newspaper quoted its source as saying .
“ We agreed to a much simpler structure that we think can get done , rather than optimize it for everyone , ” the person added .
Discussions began in early autumn when the U.S. Treasury Department convened a meeting .
Previous versions of a backup fund had been widely considered infeasible , spurring doubts about the prospect for a final plan , the Times said .
The proposed fund could begin operating by the end of the year , the newspaper reported , and the banks could start asking some 60 financial institutions to contribute to the fund in the next five to 10 days .
Treasury Department officials declined to comment , the newspaper said .
The fund is meant to avoid a severe credit market disruption , according to its organizers , by either providing time for asset prices to recover or , more likely , at least discourage structured investment vehicles from unloading their holdings en masse , the Times said .
The fund also needs the major credit rating agencies ’ blessings .

I ’ve never understood people ’s fuss over the water they drink when they go to hotels , let alone their willingness to pay for what is otherwise free in most western countries .
When I ’m out in cities where you can drink tap water , that ’s what I ask for ; when I have to buy mineral water , I ask for the cheapest .
Water is water is water .
Having said that , I agree that sometimes the taste is distinct .
For example , here in Madrid , mineral water Bezoya and Aquafina taste strange to me ; I will drink them if I have to , but I avoid buying those brands — I do n’t like water that tastes like something ( it ’s not supposed to taste like anything ! ) , but otherwise I ’m not fussed .
The whole “ tap water is n’t good for you ” conundrum does n’t phase me in any way .
It totally ruffles my feathers when I go to a posh hotel and people I go with actually have a preference of mineral water , so I would go absolutely bonkers if I went to Claridge ’s Luxury Hotel in London and was given a water menu with 30 international brands to choose from .
30 !
According to a recent article in the BBC :
For the most refined palette there is fine artesian water from Japan at $ 30 a bottle and $ 40 a bottle , or Mahaolo from Hawaii , described on the menu as “ rare deep sea water ” that is “ very old . ”
And Just Born Spring Drops from India is apparently “ light and not aggressive , ” at $ 42 per bottle .
WHAT !?
THAT’S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A GOOD BOTTLE OF WINE !
And this stuff sells ?
“ We would n’t do this if there was n’t a demand for it , ” says the hotel ’s public relations manager .
Apparently guests not only ask for berg or glacial water , but water with no sodium content or water fortified with calcium and magnesium ; they even specify the region from where they want the water !
“ People are so very , very careful about what they eat these days that it ’s moved into water . ”
Have I completely lost perspective here or do you find this as absurd as I do ?
On November 19 2002 , four months before the invasion of Iraq , Tony Blair made a rare attempt to seek out expert views beyond the circle of his official advisers .
Six distinguished academics were invited to Downing Street : three specialists on Iraq , and three on international security .
George Joffe , an Arabist from Cambridge University , and Charles Tripp and Toby Dodge , who had both written books on Iraq 's history , made opening statements of about five minutes each .
They decided not to alienate the prime minister by discussing whether an invasion was sensible or necessary , but only what its consequences might be .
" We all pretty much said the same thing , " Joffe recalls .
" Iraq is a very complicated country , there are tremendous intercommunal resentments , and do n't imagine you 'll be welcomed . "
He remembers how Blair reacted .
" He looked at me and said , ' But the man 's uniquely evil , is n't he ? '
I was a bit nonplussed .
It did n't seem to be very relevant . "
Recovering , Joffe went on to argue that Saddam was constrained by various factors , to which Blair merely repeated his first point : " He can make choices , ca n't he ? "
As Joffe puts it , " He meant he can choose to be good or evil , I suppose . "
Joffe got the impression of " someone with a very shallow mind , who 's not interested in issues other than the personalities of the top people , no interest in social forces , political trends , etc " .
Dodge also struggled to convince Blair of the obstacles that would face anyone who occupied Iraq .
" Much of the rhetoric from Washington appeared to depict Saddam 's regime as something separate from Iraqi society , " he remembers .
" All you had to do was remove him and the 60 bad men around him .
What we wanted to get across was that over 35 years the regime had embedded itself into Iraqi society , broken it down and totally transformed it .
We would be going into a vacuum , where there were no allies to be found , except possibly for the Kurds . "
The experts did n't seem to make much of an impression .
Blair " was n't focused " , Tripp recalls .
" I felt he wanted us to reinforce his gut instinct that Saddam was a monster .
It was a weird mixture of total cynicism and moral fervour . "
The brief meeting was unique .
" I can't remember participating in any meaningful seminar on Iraq with the Foreign Office , " Tripp says .
" We were not asked to brief officials in the Middle East department . "
What has since become clear is that Joffe , Dodge and Tripp were not the only experts to be left out in the cold .
In April 2004 , after a weekend in which rockets , helicopter attacks and shootings left dozens of Iraqis dead , 52 retired British diplomats , most of them career specialists on the Middle East , wrote an extraordinary open letter to Blair deploring Britain 's lack of proper prewar analysis .
They described Iraq as the region 's most complex country and said it was naive for the Americans and British to think they could create a democratic society , however much some Iraqis might want one .
" All those with experience of the area predicted that the occupation of Iraq by the coalition forces would meet serious and stubborn resistance , as has proved to be the case .
To describe the resistance as led by terrorists , fanatics and foreigners is neither convincing nor helpful , " they declared .
The letter caused a political sensation .
Retired diplomats do not often go on record in such direct opposition to their former employer , nor in such numbers .
Here was the voice of the Foreign Office 's senior Arabists , ranged against a prime minister who did not understand the region .
At the time , many analysts assumed the writers ' views were shared by their colleagues still in government service .
What the 52 were saying must surely be an on - the - record distillation of what the Foreign Office 's officials were telling Jack Straw , their minister , and Downing Street in private .
Astonishingly , this was not the case .
Interviews with top Foreign Office officials involved in the prewar discussions as well as Arabic - speaking British ambassadors in the region reveal a damaging vacuum in the department 's advice .
The predictions that the 52 claimed were made by " all those with experience of the area " may have been shared privately inside the Foreign Office 's grand Italianate mansion in Whitehall , but they did not circulate as official thinking or reach ministers .
While some senior officials in Britain 's intelligence agencies expressed their doubts that Saddam was genuinely stockpiling weapons of mass destruction , no serious qualms were raised by the government 's foreign policy experts about the equally important problem of whether occupying Iraq could work .
Analysing the likely consequences of invading one of the major Arab states should have been a crucial element in judging whether it was in Britain 's interest , let alone that of ordinary Iraqis , to go to war .
Yet such analysis was simply absent .
Ministers never asked for it ; officials never offered it .
Neither of the Foreign Office 's top two officials , Sir Michael Jay , the permanent under- secretary , and Sir Peter Ricketts , the political director , were Arabists .
In Downing Street Blair 's top foreign policy adviser , Sir David Manning , had been Britain 's ambassador in Israel from 1995 to 1998 but never served in an Arab capital .
No one in Whitehall rang alarm balls by recalling the difficulties of Britain 's imperial involvement with Iraq and the long years of resistance to British occupation , particularly in the largely Shia south .
British colonisers had invaded the country , defeated the Ottoman army , and assumed total control in 1918 .
They abolished the elected municipal councils , imposed a foreign Sunni monarchy , and dealt with resistance by means of massive military repression .
Weak on Iraqi history , officials were also poor in forecasting future scenarios .
No one pointed out that Saddam 's removal would very probably give a boost to Shia Islamists and strengthen the Islamist parties that were allied to Iran .
This would make nonsense of hopes for Iraq to become pro-western while remaining , as Saddam 's Iraq was , a bastion against the mullahs in Tehran .
If the government ever answers calls for a full - scale inquiry into the policy discussions that led to the invasion of Iraq , there is a danger that it will focus on WMDs , or blunders such as the failure to control mass looting or the decision to dissolve the Iraqi army .
But what about the serious lapses in political analysis ?
It is often argued that the occupation stumbled because of a lack of prewar planning , but the real problem was a failure to comprehend that western armies cannot successfully take over Arab countries and force them to run along western lines .
The occupation was doomed from the start .
No matter how efficient , sensitive , generous and intelligent the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) had been , it could not have succeeded .
Occupations are inherently humiliating .
People prefer to run their own affairs ; they resent foreigners taking over their country .
A foreign army that topples a regime needs to leave within weeks or at most months .
Otherwise , suspicion will grow quickly that the foreigners ' real aims are imperial - to run the country directly or through the locals they put in charge , and to exploit its resources .
Nowhere is this truer than in the Middle East , where feelings of dignity , honour , sovereignty and humiliation are the currency of daily life .
With blithe self - confidence , and without even asking his officials for expertise , however , Blair assumed it would be easy for the US and UK to run the country after Saddam was toppled .
His style was not to encourage his policy preferences to be questioned , or call for nuanced assessments of possible consequences .
Of course , it is highly unlikely that Blair would have changed his mind and refused to send British troops to Iraq if he had been given expert warnings that an occupation would meet serious resistance from Iraqi nationalists , that Islamists would fill the vacuum after Saddam was removed , and that Iraq would help al - Qaida find new recruits .
He was set on going to war at Bush 's side under any circumstances .
But questions still need to be asked as to why the government 's analysts did not do a better job of predicting the invasion 's disastrous aftermath .
Blair 's lack of interest in detail became clear to Britain 's diplomats when he summoned key ambassadors back to London in January 2003 as war planning accelerated in Washington and arguments over a second Security Council resolution to authorise an invasion hotted up at the UN .
In a lengthy speech , the prime minister outlined British policy on Iraq and the Middle East in general , naturally without conceding that a decision to invade had already been taken .
He was telling the ambassadors how to sell the line rather than seeking their advice .
" Blair basically harangued us .
I do n't remember anyone giving any feedback , " I was told by one ambassador who had come back from the Gulf for the occasion , and has since retired .
The following day Mike O'Brien , the foreign office minister responsible for the region , held a smaller meeting with British heads of mission in the Middle East .
" He told us they were trying to impose democracy in the Middle East .
I said I did n't think it would work , but we were not asked for our advice and we did n't give any , " the former ambassador recalled .
" The issue was not posited in the context of , ' Should we invade or not ? ' "
Another British ambassador who attended the meetings and talked to colleagues about the looming invasion said : " Everyone was underprepared for the aftermath . "
He admitted that " to my shame I was in the complacent camp ...
We underestimated the insurgency .
I did n't hear anyone say , ' It 'll be a disaster , and it 'll all come unstuck . '
People felt it was a leap in the dark , but not that we were staring disaster in the face . "
The leader of the country where he served was far more perceptive about post - Saddam Iraq than the Foreign Office 's Arabists .
" He predicted it would all fall to pieces on sectarian grounds .
He was unhappy about the invasion , even though he was a host to US forces and the top US brass came through regularly , " the ambassador told me .
In London the Foreign Office set up a special Iraq policy unit in the run-up to the war .
But it had a narrow brief , concentrating on contingency planning for the invasion and its short - term effects , according to a diplomat who attended its meetings .
What would happen if Saddam 's forces used chemical weapons and British forces took heavy casualties ?
The government had plans to commandeer hospitals in Britain 's National Health Service , if army hospitals were swamped .
What if hundreds of thousands of Iraqis fled the bombing ?
Plans were made for huge tented camps and emergency food supplies , to be run with the United Nations .
The Department for Trade and Industry tried to guess what would happen to oil prices in the event of war .
The Department for International Development focused on humanitarian assistance to refugees , and reconstruction .
No discussions were held on vital issues such as how to choose Iraq 's future government after Saddam fell , and what role the occupiers should play .
Would Iraqis or the Americans be in charge ?
According to Clare Short , the secretary of state for international department who resigned from the government shortly after the invasion , the cabinet had only informal prewar discussions on Iraq .
" There were never any papers or proper analysis of the underlying dangers and the political , diplomatic and military options .
The whole crisis was handled by Tony Blair and his entourage with considerable informality , " she recorded later .
Her worry was that without a UN resolution the occupiers would have no legal right to make political changes in Iraq .
Peter Hain confirmed that the cabinet saw no papers on postwar Iraq .
" In Iraq the failures of covert intelligence were compounded by the absence of political intelligence : a comprehensive lack of the understanding of sectarian forces and fault lines present across the country , " he disclosed recently .
Blair was not interested in these matters .
He took the view that it was in Britain 's strategic interest to go along with whatever Bush decided .
Civil servants and senior British military sources repeatedly complained that he never raised difficult problems with Bush , even when he had been briefed to mention them before going to Washington .
He either lacked consideration for the consequences of an invasion , or perhaps he feared risking his friendship with Bush by sounding like a sceptic or a wimp .
He thought he had considerable influence in the White House , and his various trips to Washington , which always culminated with a press conferences at Bush 's side , were designed to give the impression that as a major contributor of troops he was an equal partner in decision - making .
British officials were under no such illusions .
" We were n't plugged into the state department 's detailed planning exercise .
We tried but could n't get into it .
It was the first warning sign that we were n't part of it , " one senior diplomat told me .
In the words of another : " The UK supplied 10 % of the invasion force .
We provided 10 % of the staff of the Coalition Provisional Authority .
We had 10 % of input into policy . "
In the final weeks before the invasion , the Pentagon wrested control of postwar planning away from the state department , leaving British ministers even more in the dark .
A senior British officer was attached to US central command in Florida , but the main issues of Iraq 's postwar governance were not discussed there .
Even in Washington , among the neocons who were leading the drive for an invasion , there was no clear idea whether to appoint Iraqis to run the country or put a US overlord in charge .
This was only decided after Saddam was toppled .
Unlike France , Germany and Italy , the British had no embassy in Baghdad in Saddam 's final 12 years of rule .
This left them bereft of good on - the - ground intelligence .
It also meant there were few people in the Foreign Office with direct experience and knowledge of Iraq .
As a result , the British did not predict the rise of Iraq 's Islamists , whose strength destroyed the American neoconservative project for a liberal , secular and US - friendly democracy .
" The conventional view was that Iraq was one of the most western - oriented of Arab states , with its British - educated , urban and secular professionals .
I do n't think anyone in London appreciated how far Islamism had gone , not just among the Shia , but the Sunnis , too , " Christopher Segar , who took part in the prewar discussions and headed the British office in Baghdad after the invasion , told me .
Thanks partly to their Baghdad embassy , the French were better informed .
They saw the potential for tensions between religious and secular forces in Iraq if Saddam were toppled .
They also sensed that occupation would create resistance .
" We believe that the use of force can arouse rancour and hatred , fuel a clash of identities , of cultures , " Dominique de Villepin , the French foreign minister , declared in a speech to the UN Security Council two weeks before the invasion .
For his part , president Jacques Chirac argued that the war would be perceived in the Arab and Muslim world as an attack on Islam .
" A war of this kind cannot help giving a big lift to terrorism , " he told Time magazine .
" It would create a large number of little Bin Ladens . "
The British government got almost everything wrong before the war .
A senior Foreign Office official , who saw the few papers that were written about the invasion 's likely consequences , told me : " The basic assumption that turned out to be false was that Iraqis felt themselves more Iraqi than Sunni or Shia . "
The papers also predicted that " in the south there would be a welcome and it would be less difficult than in Baghdad , where it would be harder to manage a transition " .
" We underestimated the difficulties .
No one realised how difficult it would be , " the official said .
British ambassadors in the region concentrated on telling London what sort of support for the invasion was likely to be given , publicly and privately , by the Arab governments to which they were accredited .
The Gulf states and Jordan wanted Saddam removed .
Syria did not .
There was little analysis of what the " Arab street " would feel or what their official Arab contacts saw as the fallout in Iraq .
British diplomats at the UN also failed to warn London , either by not seeking their Arab colleagues ' advice or not passing it on .
In this they were less efficient than diplomats from the countries that were on the Security Council , but not as permanent veto - bearing members .
Juan Gabriel Valdes , a former foreign minister of Chile who served as his country 's UN envoy in 2003 , represented one of the 10 countries that the British wooed hard for support for a second UN resolution .
The British claimed to have intelligence about Saddam 's efforts to cheat the UN weapons inspectors - evidence that the Chilean ambassador and his colleagues did not find convincing , even though they had no evidence of their own .
" The fact that we did n't have intelligence did n't mean that we did n't have good common sense , " Valdes said later .
He and his colleagues decided to talk to " every one of the members of the Arab group at the UN , but particularly with Jordan and specially with Saudi Arabia and other countries that were good friends of the US " .
They predicted , in private , " exactly what has happened historically in Iraq .
It was not very difficult to get that information - that if the war happens , Iran would take an enormous role , that the situation would be absolutely catastrophic , and that the turn of events would leave the US and Great Britain involved in an atrocious situation . "
A senior Foreign Office official admitted to worrying that Iran would benefit from the invasion more than other countries .
" I remember saying to myself that we might be in a position of having destroyed Iraq and leaving a resurgent Iran , " he told me .
Typically , he never communicated his concern to ministers .
His reason , he said , was that as the war drew nearer , the mood in Downing Street discouraged officials from raising problems .

Criminals risk death or serious injury to steal metal
Even churches do not escape attack .
In 2007 , Ecclesiastical Insurance received more than 1,800 claims from Anglican churches , at a cost of nearly £ 5.8 m , for the theft mainly of lead from roofs .
Metal theft is a global problem , driven by the rising price and high demand for metal across the world .
In addition to causing severe disruption to train services , gas or electricity supplies , it can have a serious impact on people 's lives .
Risk of death
" It is not a victimless crime , " Det Ch Insp Simon Jones , of the British Transport Police ( BTP ) , said .
" Metal theft is a serious crime and has a negative impact on the public in a number of ways . "
The force said recent examples included theft of cabling from a back - up generator at a hospital in Kent , which could have put the lives of patients at risk .
Hundreds of people were left without telephone services in villages in Lancashire and Cambridgeshire after large sections of underground cable were stolen .
You get small - time offenders at one end , maybe feeding a drug habit , all way to the organised groups at the other end of the spectrum
Det Ch Insp Simon Jones
And in Kent , more than 250 memorial plaques were stolen from a crematorium .
It is not just the victims of metal theft whose lives are affected .
In the first nine months of 2007 , one person died and eight were seriously injured while trying to steal metal from electricity sub-stations .
" If you are going to do this you are likely to kill or critically injure yourself , " Mr Jones said .
The BTP is now leading a task force set up to tackle what has been described as an " explosion " in metal theft across the country .
The force compared a four - month period in 2007 with the corresponding dates a year earlier and found there had been a 150 % rise in metal theft .
A national " day of action " , held in January and co-ordinated by the BTP , saw arrests made by police forces across the country .
Mr Jones said : " Within the BTP we have taken the lead in recognising the problem and taking the opportunity to say that this is n't going to go away in the short term . "
Officers are using the latest technology to disrupt criminals
' Drone ' in action
Part of the force 's work involves engaging with scrap metal dealers , ensuring they are aware of the law and urging them to report any suspicious offers of metal .
Mr Jones said industrial areas , such as the North East , the North West and the Midlands , were particular areas of concern .
He said : " In these areas there is a concentration of scrap metal dealers , so there is a marketplace .
" For us , scrap metal dealers over the last 10 years have dropped off the radar .
" Part of our campaign is to make them aware of the law .
" There are criminals who are either working alone or working in co-operation with scrap metal dealers .
" Like most crimes you get small - time offenders at one end , maybe feeding a drug habit , all the way to organised groups at the other end of the spectrum . "
The BTP said forces across the country were employing a wide range of tactics to disrupt criminal activity .
The latest technology being used in the fight is a remote controlled helicopter which hovers above railway lines and beams video footage back to operators on the ground .

Colleagues , An intriguing study was published last week in the journal Chemical Researchin Toxicology assessing the concentrations of respiratory pollutantsproduced by marijuana combustion to those produced by smoking tobacco .
Fortunately , folks can download the entire text of the study and read it forthemselves here : " A comparison of mainstream and sidestream marijuana and tobacco cigarettesmoke produced under two machine smoking conditions " Unfortunately , it appears that few if any reporters actually did this beforepenning widely disseminated articles such as this one : Study Shows Toxins In Marijuana SmokeDec 17 , 2007 ( WebMD )
New research from Canada shows that some toxins may be more abundantin marijuana cigarettes than tobacco cigarettes .
The researchers burned 30 marijuana cigarettes and 30 tobacco cigarettes ona machine in their lab , measuring levels of chemicals in the smoke .
Ammonia levels were up to 20 times higher in marijuana smoke than in tobaccosmoke .
Levels of hydrogen cyanide and nitrogen - related chemicals were threeto five times higher in marijuana smoke than in tobacco smoke .
The nitrogen - based fertilizer used on the marijuana plants -- which all camefrom the same batch of Canadian pot plants -- may have affected the results .
The temperatures used to burn the cigarettes may also have been a factor .
Marijuana smoke and tobacco smoke shared many of the same chemicals .
But thetwo types of smoke were n't identical .
For instance , marijuana does n't contain nicotine .
And tobacco doesn' tcontain cannabinoids , which include THC , marijuana 's active ingredientTobacco has long been linked to cancer and other health problems .
Marijuanasmoke has n't been tied to cancer in the past , note theresearchers , who included David Moir of the Safe Environments Programme inKitchener , Ontario .
Moir and colleagues report their findings in the advance online edition ofChemical Research in Toxicology .
They promise to compare the toxicity of marijuana smoke and tobacco smoke inanimals in another study .

A few comments responding to this news item that are apparent reading thestudy :
1) Investigators reported that mainstream marijuana smoke contained lowerlevels of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( cancer causing agents ) compared to tobacco .
2 ) Nicotine , tobacco - specific nitrosamines , arsenic , and lead were notpresent in marijuana smoke .3 ) HCN forms from protein at temperatures above 700 degrees C , and wouldlikely be reduced or eliminated by vaporization .
4 ) Clinical trials have shown that vaporization -- whereby marijuana isheated to a temperature where active cannabis vapors form , but below thepoint of combustion -- can greatly reduce or eliminate the presence of manypolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .
Most recently , investigators at SanFrancisco General Hospital reported in the journal Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics that the " vaporization of marijuana does not result in exposureto combustion gases , ... and is preferred by most subjects compared tomarijuana cigarette . "
A previous clinical trial published in 2006 in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences reported that vaporization is " safe andeffective " cannabinoid delivery system that " avoid [s ] the respiratorydisadvantages of smoking .
²5 ) The higher presence of ammonia , HCN , and aromatic amines ( nitrogen - related chemicals ) in marijuana were likely all due to the factthat Prairie Plant Systems cultivated the pot used in the trial with a highnitrate fertilizer .
( By contrast , the tobacco used in the study was nottreated with a similar fertilizer . )
I know that in the past PhilippeLucas / The VICS has been outspoken in his criticism of Prairie Plant Systemsgrow techniques , and I 'd imagine that these latest findings will only addfuel to his fire .

Our planet and its inhabitants - including we humans - are in a precarious position as we approach Earth Day , April 22 .
While global warming is widely accepted as a reality by scientists and many governments and industrial leaders , progress to curb greenhouse gases and other forms of pollution remains limited .
The current economic climate will likely make pollution control efforts more difficult , analysts say .
Recent studies , as well as the 2007 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) have pointed to some of the likely effects of uncurbed greenhouse gas emissions : rising global temperatures , rising sea levels , Arctic sea ice melt , the disappear of glaciers , epic floods in some areas and intense drought in others .
These effects are intensified when combined with other forms of pollution the world 's rising population .
Humans will face widespread water shortages .
Famine and disease will increase .
Earth ’s landscape will transform radically , with a quarter of plants and animals at risk of extinction .
While putting specific dates on these traumatic potential events is challenging , this timeline paints the big picture and details Earth 's future based on several recent studies and the longer scientific version of the IPCC report .
This timeline is an updated version of one first published by LiveScience in 2007 .
2008
Arctic sea ice hits its second lowest summer ice extent on record ( the lowest extent was in 2007 ) .
A massive chunk of ice breaks away from Greenland 's Petermann Glacier .
Several breakups of ice shelves in Antarctica are observed .

Global oil production peaks sometime between 2008 and 2018 , according to a model by a Swedish physicist .
Others say this turning point , known as " Hubbert ’s Peak , " wo n’t occur until after 2020 .
Once Hubbert ’s Peak is reached , global oil production will begin an irreversible decline , possibly triggering a global recession , food shortages and conflict between nations over dwindling oil supplies .

The poles are closer to the Earth ’s axis of rotation , so having more mass there should speed up the planet ’s rotation .

At a recent Guitar Hero III battle at our friend Dave 's house , one combatant suggested that the game would be a lot more fun if Activision were to release an SDK ( Song Development Kit ) to allow bands or their labels to create Guitar Hero versions of their songs , which users could then download from the online marketplaces accessible from today 's gaming consoles .
Until then , there 's Super Crazy Guitar Maniac Deluxe 2 – a surprisingly evolved online flash game that lets you play a Guitar Hero - like game using keyboard commands .
Like the real game , this site awards points for hitting notes on time , deducts them if you miss , requires that some notes be held for a certain amount of time , and increases the multiplier when you 're on a roll .
It also saves your progress automatically , so you can unlock new songsand guitars as you go .
If you find yourself in the grip of a brutal Guitar Hero addiction , a quick lunchtime fix of SCGMD2 just might tide you over until you can get home to your plastic guitar .
Update : Super Crazy Guitar Maniac Deluxe 3 has been released , including 14 new songs , 10 new guitars and a smattering of new features .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton ridiculed rival Barack Obama as all talk and little substance on Wednesday , trying to slow the momentum that has given him 10 straight victories in the race for the party ’s U.S. presidential nomination .
The New York senator and former first lady sharpened her attack on Obama ahead of the March 4 Democratic contests in Texas and Ohio , which have become critical to her presidential aspirations following her losses on Tuesday to Obama in Wisconsin and Hawaii .
But support for the first - term Illinois senator , whose powerful “ yes we can ” speaking style has propelled him to the front - runner ’s position , continued to mount , with the 1.25 million member Teamsters union formally endorsing him on Wednesday .
His long string of victories put Clinton in the awkward position of telling supporters , in media interviews and speeches , “ Do n’t give up on this ! ” and “ This campaign goes on ! ” while her aides explained how she would close the gap with Obama by the time of the Puerto Rico contest in June .
But Obama has used his string of victories to broaden his voting coalition and has taken control of the race to decide the Democratic nominee for the November election .
He has wins in 25 of the state - by - state contests while Clinton has 11 , and he has begun to erode support among her core base of women .
At a fund - raising event in New York , Clinton belittled Obama as an inexperienced choice for commander - in - chief in a dangerous world , for advocating a health care plan that is not as expansive as hers and for giving airy speeches .
“ It ’s about picking a president who relies not just on words but on work , on hard work , ” she said .
“ We need to make a choice between speeches and solutions , because while words matter greatly , the greatest words in the world are not enough unless you match them with action . ”
“ Now others might be joining a movement , ” she said .
“ Well , I ’m joining you on the night shift , and on the day shift . ”
Obama rejected her criticisms while campaigning in Texas , telling a crowd of some 17,000 in Dallas Clinton was right that the race was about choices but wrong about everything else .
“ Contrary to what she ’s been saying , it ’s not a choice between speeches and solutions , ” he said .
“ It ’s a choice between a politics that offers more of the same divisions and distractions that did n’t work in South Carolina and did n’t work in Wisconsin and will not work in Texas .
Or a politics of common sense , of common purpose , of shared sacrifice and shared prosperity . ”
BUILDING A NATIONAL LEAD
Underscoring Clinton ’s high negative ratings in public opinion polls , he added : “ It ’s a choice between going into the general election with Republicans and independents already united against us or running with a campaign that has already united Americans of all parties around the agenda for change .
That ’s the choice . ”

Clinton was asked about a controversy involving Obama ’s wife , Michelle , who said in Wisconsin this week she felt pride in the United States for the first time in her adult life because it felt like hope was returning to the nation .
The former first lady , questioned about the remark , did not criticize Michelle Obama ’s comment but said : “ I think we ’ve all been disappointed in our country , but I ’ve been proud of America on many occasions during my lifetime . ”
She cited the fall of the Soviet Union and the Berlin Wall , advances in the United States on voting rights and civil rights and some accomplishments during her husband ’s presidency , such as his work to stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo .
Slideshow ( 28 images )
A new Reuters / Zogby poll released on Wednesday indicated Obama has leaped past Clinton and built a big national lead in the U.S. Democratic presidential race .
The poll showed Obama , who would be the first black president , with a 14 - point edge over Clinton , 52 percent to 38 percent , after being in a statistical tie with the New York senator last month .
Clinton was flying to Texas for events in Hidalgo and Brownsville before a Thursday night debate in Austin with Obama that is one of her last chances to take him on face - to - face .
Analysts believe she can only turn around her campaign by winning big victories in two weeks in Texas and Ohio .
The two states offer a rich trove of 334 delegates to the Democratic nominating convention this summer , giving Clinton the chance to catch up with Obama after falling behind in the delegate count .
Obama and the likely Republican nominee , Arizona Sen .
John McCain , were already tossing barbs at each other in what could be a preview of the general election campaign .
In Wisconsin on Tuesday night , McCain asked : “ Will we risk the confused leadership of an inexperienced candidate ? ”
Obama fired back that McCain backed President George W. Bush ’s economic policies and wants to keep U.S. troops in Iraq indefinitely , while he would withdraw them quickly .

Shared hosting is the most affordable way to have a website on the internet .
The upsides are the low price point and that you do n’t need to know how to set up and maintain a server of your own .
But there is a downside as well :
You are sharing a server with potentially hundreds of other websites .
This can often work fine , as long as the websites you are sharing the server with do n’t get too much traffic , and do n’t use lots of resources .
The problem is when one or more of those websites start using more than their fair share of the web server ’s resources .
This can cause a slow - down for all the websites on that server , including yours .
Common performance culprits
There are a lot of factors that can make the websites on a shared server slow down .
Here are some examples :
Scripts ( for example PHP scripts ) .
Badly coded and possibly buggy scripts can take up large parts of the server resources or in some cases even block all resources while they are executing .
For example , it is very common that web developers use the web server as their test environment , and use trial and error to solve bugs .
Database performance or connection problems .
A script for a website can use up a lot of database connections ( if not all ) either because of a bug , bad coding or a lot of traffic .
This will of course be a problem for other sites trying to use the same database server .
High - traffic website on the same server .
Either naturally or through the likes of Digg .
It ’s worth noting that a web server normally has a limited number of simultaneous connections it can handle .
This limit is usually shared amongst all sites on the server .
Oversold web server .
Too many sites running on the same server will put a lot of strain on the resources , even if they are all “ well behaved ” .
Backups of web servers or databases .
Many hosting companies make backups during the night .
This can often make databases and web servers non responsive or really slow during that time .
Since many outside the US are using US hosting companies , that can mean that these slowdowns are extra inconvenient due to time zone differences , for example occurring early in the day or in the evening .
Bandwidth problems during peak hours .
Some hosting companies will wait as long as possible with buying more bandwidth when they are growing .
This means that due to these growing pains , the websites and all other services of this hosting company ( e.g. email ) will respond and work slower due to bandwidth limitations during peak hours .
Monitor your website ’s response time
It ’s not enough to just check that the server and network is up ( for example by pinging the server ) .
This will only tell you that the server is physically up and the network connection is working .
It will not tell you that your website is loading correctly .
You need to monitor how quickly your actual website loads ( and that it loads at all , of course ) .
Above :
An actual real - life example of response time increase on a shared server over a month .
During two days the load time for the HTML alone was an abnormally high 6 seconds instead of under 2 seconds as it had been before .
The owner of the website talked to his web host who were able to fix the problem eventually .
By monitoring your website ’s response time ( for example with Pingdom ) , you will be able to see if your website starts being slow .
As we explained above , all it takes is for your host to add one misbehaving ( or very popular ) website to the same server that you are on , and the performance for all websites on that server can be drastically changed for the worse .
If you are unlucky , your website can become so slow that it ca n’t be loaded at all .
What can you do ?
If you find that your website suddenly becomes slow for no apparent reason , contact your hosting provider and explain the problem .
Ask if they can either move your website to another server with less load , or find and move whatever website or other reason that is causing the performance problem .
This is of course provided the increased response times ( and load times ) are not caused by changes you yourself have made to your website .
At this time , it is a good idea to test the performance of all elements of your website , something you can do with a website load - time test .
If it is your own site that has become more resource intensive , it may be time to start looking for a VPS or dedicated server .
Conclusion
Shared hosting is an affordable starting point when you want to publish a website on the internet , and in many cases you will never need to take the step up to dedicated hosting .
Just make sure you keep on top of the performance of your website .
This is of course the case for any website , but for shared hosting there are more external factors affecting your performance .
( Note : This kind of monitoring is also something that a hosting company itself can do .
If you are a hosting company , put a test website on each of your web servers and monitor their performance .
That way you will be able to detect problems quickly and avoid unhappy customers . )
The Chinese government is continuing its war on undesirable topics — at least on the Internet — by asking a number of domestic web sites to sign a self - censorship pact to keep the Internet clean , friendly , " healthy , and orderly . "
News and media organizations , ISPs , and other state - sanctioned web sites were all sent copies of the pact that asks them to promise to keep porn , violence , references to gambling , and " horror " ( among other topics ) off the ' Net for fear of corrupting young people .
" Decadent , backward thoughts and culture must be boycotted by all , " wrote China 's Administration of Radio , Film and Television .
So far , eight major web sites in China signed the pact , according to Reuters , including the Xinhua news agency and the People 's Daily newspaper .
There is no indication of penalties for noncompliance ( it is being passed off by the government as voluntary ) , although knowing China , it 's best to fall in line the government 's voluntary initiatives .
Still , it 's unclear what the government is trying to achieve with this agreement , seeing as all state - controlled media is already under heavy censorship and everything accessed on the Internet in China is carefully filtered .
The pact does , however , require the sites to delete user - uploaded content that does n't comply with the strict standards for being " healthy . "
China has never exactly been porn - friendly , but it began a more concentrated effort to eradicate it in the last year and a half .
The former operator of the country 's largest porn site was arrested and jailed , and the government then issued stern warnings against porn that perverts " China 's young minds . "
The same goes for online gaming : beginning in July last year , kids who spend too much time gaming could lose half ( or all ) of their earned credits within the games .
And of course , certain topics are always verboten , such as Nazi Germany , discussions about democracy , anything critical of Communism , and certain events in Chinese history ( such as Tiananmen Square ) .
As China 's massive population continues to go online in droves , it will become increasingly difficult to police the actions of each and every citizen sitting behind a computer .
Still , China appears fully committed to what will be an unending battle to control what its citizens can access and see online .

Facebook Cities are cracking down on charities that feed the homeless , adopting rules that restrict food giveaways to certain locations , require charities to get permits or limit the number of free meals they can provide .
Orlando , Dallas , Las Vegas and Wilmington , N.C. , began enforcing such laws last year .
Some are being challenged .
Last November , a federal judge blocked the Las Vegas law banning food giveaways to the poor in city parks .
In Dallas , two ministries are suing , arguing that the law violates religious freedom .
DALLAS HOMLESS : The ' Lord 's table ' deemed illegal " Going after the volunteers is new , " says Michael Stoops of the National Coalition for the Homeless .
" They think that by not feeding people , it will make the homeless people leave . "
City officials say the rules were prompted by complaints about crime and food safety .
Some say they want control over locations so homeless people can also get services such as addiction counseling and job training .
" The feedings were happening several times a week " in parking lots and sidewalks downtown , says Dewey Harris , director of Wilmington 's Community Services Department .
" A lot of the merchants said , ' We feel uncomfortable when you have all these homeless being fed downtown when we 're trying to attract tourists . ' " Last March , the city restricted meals on public property to designated locations and required a permit .
One spot has been approved : a city park parking lot .
Dallas also limits outdoor food giveaways to approved locations .
Those distributing food must take a food - handling course and get a city permit , says Karen Rayzer , director of environmental and health services .
A violator can be fined $ 2,000 .
Orlando adopted an ordinance in July that requires a permit to serve more than 25 people in a park within 2 miles of City Hall , where most food giveaways were taking place .
An applicant may serve twice a year in each park .
" This ordinance was n't established to ban feeding , " says city spokeswoman Heather Allebaugh .
She acknowledges that some groups ignore the law .
City Commissioner Robert Stuart voted against it .
He is executive director of the Christian Service Center for Central Florida , which feeds 325 homeless people a day but , as private property , is not affected .
" It 's not fair to take a population without a home and make them criminals , " he says .
" And I do n't think we ought to be limiting the opportunity to help others . "
Does your city have a better way of taking care of its homeless population ?

( CNN ) -- East Timor President Jose Ramos - Horta has regained consciousness and spoken to family members after emerging from an induced coma following an assassination attempt , the country 's deputy prime minister told CNN Thursday .
" One of his first words was to mention to his close relatives to look after the people of East Timor , " Deputy Prime Minister Jose Luis Guterres told CNN .
" Even in his critical condition , his mind is still with the people of East Timor , and we 're very proud to have a president like this . "
Ramos - Horta slowly woke up on Wednesday at the Australian hospital where he is recuperating .
But it may be another month before he is discharged and several more months for him to fully recover , Guterres said .
The president was " aware " of the circumstances that led to his hospitalization , but doctors and family members have not brought up the assassination attempt , Guterres said .
" Since there is no interest in stimulating him very much under the circumstances he is in now , people are not asking questions , " Guterres said .
" They are just there showing solidarity and friendship . "
On February 11 , gunmen in the capital Dili shot Ramos - Horta in the back twice , with one of the bullets tearing through his abdomen .
The attackers also ambushed Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao on the same day , but he escaped unhurt .
The 58 - year - old Ramos - Horta was flown to the Royal Darwin Hospital in Darwin , Australia , where doctors performed reconstructive surgery to repair the bullet wounds .
He faces the possibility of additional surgeries .
An investigation continues into the assassination attempt , Guterres said .
" I think we have to wait until the end of the investigation in order to give full account of what happened and to bring to justice those who were behind it , " he said .
" The people of East Timor need to know . "
Ramos - Horta shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Carlos Belo , bishop of East Timor , in 1996 for work on behalf of East Timorese during the country 's quarter - century occupation by Indonesia .
Since the attacks , Australia has sent more than 200 troops and police to help stabilize East Timor .
They reinforce an international stabilization force of about 1,000 soldiers from Australia , Malaysia , Portugal and New Zealand that have been in East Timor since it gained independence from Indonesia in 2002 .
The attack has been blamed on rebel soldiers led by Maj .
Alfredo Reinado , who was killed in the assault , along with another attacker and a presidential bodyguard .
The Australian - trained former head of East Timor 's police , Reinado became the leader of disaffected soldiers and was wanted as a fugitive at the time of the presidential attack .

Have a small business offering wifi access ?
Have a home wireless connection that you ’ve not secured ?
Well , consider yourself “ deputized ” .
You may not know how to even track your who is using your internet connection , but you may soon be legally required to do so :
What ’s SAFE ?
It stands for the Securing Adolescents From Exploitation - Online Act , and its reach could be unprecedented .
Namely , it holds that anyone offering any public electronic communications service ( including an open Wi- Fi connection or internet kiosk ) must create a sort of dossier on anyone they suspect might be viewing child pornography over their network and submit it to the government .
( Presumably the culprit would have to be caught in the act ; the bill does n’t really say . )
The service provider will also have to maintain an archive of all the suspect ’s files for use as evidence .
It sounds bad at first , but the definition of child pornography in this case is especially surprising .
Per Cnet ’s Declan McCullagh , the definition of such images include those featuring fully - clothed children in “ lascivious ” poses and even drawings of such obsenity .
( That would include the popular form of hentai anime , which sites like cartoon porno xxx have an extensive catalog of . )
Failure to comply could result in a first - offense fine of $ 150,000 and $ 300,000 after that .
That means every library , coffee shop , and even private homes that offer open wireless access could face crushing penalties if they do n’t eavesdrop on their clientÃ¨le .
In other words :
The government wants you to do its dirty work and play Big Brother on its behalf .
Creepy .
Yep .
You ’d better know what people are using your internet connection for , or you might be in trouble .
The government does n’t have the time nor resources to catch criminals on their own , so you need to do it for them !
Personally , while this might get a lot of airtime , I would n’t worry too much about it .
A government too incompetent to catch criminals on their own will most likely be too incompetent to catch you if you do n’t understand that someone is using your internet connection for nefarious purposes .
I ’d say that I do n’t care and would continue to offer free wi-fi , but I ’ve kept my own connection secure just as general principle since I ’ve had it , so it does n’t affect me much .
That and the fact that I wo n’t be viewing material from the likes of toonsex.xxx and similar websites that could potentially breach what the government might see as offending pornography .
Oh , but one little bit takes the cake on this one :
Additionally scary :
This legislation never received a committee vote or public hearing and was never made available for public review .
Way to sneak one past the goalie , Congress !
I do n’t know what ’s more sad …
The fact that Congress often passes bills like this ( without review ) , or the fact that the original author did n’t quite realize that Congress often passes bills like this .
After all , they want to make sure you do n’t get any crazy animehentaivideos xxx hentai through your connection to the series of tubes .

America ’s original battle over church and state
America ’s founding faiths
UU World Magazine Winter 2007 , published by the Unitarian Universalist Association
UU Identity , Church & State
One week after the Union debacle at Bull Run in July 1861 , the Reverend Horace Bushnell ascended his Hartford , Connecticut , pulpit to issue a lament : “ Our statesmen , or politicians , not being generally religious men , take up with difficulty conceptions of government . . . that suppose the higher rule of God . ”
Bushnell traced this failure of moral imagination back to the founders .
In his view the nation ’s story opened blasphemously .
Where a faithful citizen would expect to find “ In the beginning , God . . . , ” the story read , “ In the beginning , Thomas Jefferson . . . . ”
Recognizing how profoundly Enlightenment influences shaped the Declaration of Independence and American Constitution , Bushnell called on the people to reject the founders ’ vision .
Ironically , his modern - day counterparts beseech their fellow Americans to return to the founders to resurrect a Christian America .
But Bushnell ’s quest to save America by reestablishing the nation on sounder religious footing was by no means novel .
As early as 1800 , in the first hotly contested presidential campaign , Federalist Party preachers denounced Jefferson as an “ infidel ” and rallied behind John Adams ’s “ God- fearing ” presidency .
From the outset of our experiment in government , in fact , the founders fought tooth and nail in a contest over American values , a vigorous , sometimes savage , yet nearly forgotten thirty - year conflict to redeem the nation ’s soul .
Bushnell called for the creation of a Common­wealth of God. Jefferson spoke as wistfully of establishing an Empire of Liberty .
Both visions arose from spiritual first principles — call them divine order and sacred liberty .
Cast in terms of the nation ’s motto , “ E pluribus unum ” ( “ Out of many , one ” ) , the advocates of divine order believed that to uphold one nation under God , the secular and sacred realms must rest on a single foundation .
Without a united sense of purpose and clear moral vision , they argued , liberty would lapse into license .
Champions of sacred liberty believed that to promote liberty and justice for all , the secular and religious realms must be kept autonomous .
Government attempts to impose religious ( or moral ) values suppress religion instead , they claimed , by violating individual freedom of conscience .
American politicians may not have been “ religious men ” — not one of the nation ’s early presidents was an orthodox Christian , for example — but Bushnell was mistaken in lumping the founders together in secular opposition to their Puritan forebears .
The early nation ’s pastors were divided as well .
In league with many Presbyterians and Quakers , church leaders accustomed to operating under state aegis ( old - school Episcopalians , Congregationalists , and , yes , Unitarians ) believed that the nation would not survive independent of a strong Christian government .
An equal majority of sectarian Protestants ( Scots Presbyterians , Baptists , Methodists , etc. ) together with Jews , Roman Catholics , and a smattering of influential Deists championed strict church - state separation as a guarantor of the religious liberty they long had labored to secure .
When political parties emerged at the turn of the nineteenth century , their constituencies mustered for battle across the same spiritual divide .
Pitting order versus liberty , England versus France , the established church versus champions of church - state separation , and America ’s original Puritan versus its new Enlightenment inheritance , the first great culture war in American political history — waged from George Washington ’s inauguration in 1789 to the outset of James Monroe ’s presidency in 1817 — was joined .
George Washington ’s fear of ‘ faction ’
A Virginia gentleman was judged on appearances .
The negative print image of a good New England Calvinist , trained not to care a whit for life ’s trappings as long as her conscience was clear with God , for George Washing­ton appearances were everything .
Virtue proved itself by deeds apparent to all , not by a contrite heart or spotless soul .
This made him no less moral .
On the contrary , his attentiveness to outward propriety protected him from moral embarrassment as readily as the dread of guilt in the eyes of God might restrain a devout Puritan .
To Washington , virtue and honor coalesced into a single overriding aspiration : “ to do my duty in this world as well as I am capable of performing it , & to merit the good opinion of all men . ”
Washington was elected America ’s first president by acclamation ; he received every electoral vote .
New Englanders could n’t help but think of “ election ” theologically .
In Puritan theology , the saved were God ’s “ elect . ”
Viewing himself ( if in a very different light ) among the chosen , Washing­ton , too , would honor his election by striving to prove himself worthy of it .
In so doing , his thinking was Roman , not Christian ; duty called , not God ; and honor , not salvation , would be his reward .
Yet his destiny , he was certain , was written in the stars .
Washington felt anointed as the protagonist in a divine drama .
The entire country , in fact , was cast to play a providential role .
“ The citizens of America , ” he said , were “ the actors of a conspicuous theatre , which seems to be peculiarly designated by Providence for the display of human greatness and felicity . ”
Baptized into the Church of Virginia , Washington was elected to the church vestry shortly after his marriage .
Religious fervor , or church membership for that matter , was not a prerequisite for service in the vestry , though it smoothed Washington ’s way in Virginia politics .
To the end of his days he would stand with the other noncommunicants during prayers and leave following the sermon right before the service of the Lord ’s Supper on Communion Sundays , while Martha kneeled with the faithful and remained to partake of the Eucharist .
He was culturally Christian , to be sure , but throughout volumes of correspondence Washington mentions Christ by name only once .
Contrasting him with fellow Deists Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson , both of whom expressed sincere admiration for Jesus , the most fastidious student of Washington ’s religion calls his muteness concerning Jesus “ truly remarkable . ”
On his watch , the government was by no means Christian , but neither was it constructed on a purely secular foundation .
As long as the language employed was inclusive , for example , Washington had no qualms about calling his fellow citizens to prayer .
On September 26 , 1789 , one day after the House of Representatives passed the First Amendment to the Constitution avowing that “ Congress shall enact no legislation respecting the establishment of religion or the free practice thereof , ” it pivoted on its heels and recommended that the president proclaim a National Day of Prayer and Thanksgiving to honor God for “ affording them an opportunity peacefully to establish a constitutional government for their safety and happiness . ”
A week later Washington submitted the proclamation as requested , marking November 26 , 1789 , as the first national thanksgiving to be celebrated under the new Constitution .
The president ’s philosophy toward church and state was simple : Religious freedom would be honored fastidiously as long as the church behaved .
When America ’s Baptists appealed to the newly inaugurated president to support the addition of a Bill of Rights to the Constitution to protect the “ liberty of conscience , ” Washington agreed that “ every man , conducting himself as a good citizen and being accountable to God alone for his religious opinions , ought to be protected in worshipping the Deity according to the dictates of his own conscience . ”
Washington never lost sight of a second priority , “ quiet to the state . ”
He would uphold religious freedom , but religion had no business intruding itself in government affairs .
When a delegation of Quakers appealed to him in October 1789 to support “ unfeigned righteousness in public as well as private stations , ” and again a few months later to promote the abolition of slavery , Washington dismissed their proposals as “ very mal - apropos . ”
Quaker meetings were coming to the divinely inspired conclusion that slavery was an evil that must be eradicated from society .
Washington , however , believed that if individuals or self - sanctioned groups should attempt to impose their moral or political agenda on society at large , the nation would be beset by faction .
The United States , at least on paper , began as a one - party state .
There was no official opposition , loyal or otherwise .
Parties emerged only after Washington left office .
Yet , however much he scorned them , factions did exist , with tempers between them growing shorter throughout his tenure .
Since faction was a four - letter word in early American politics , champions of liberty and order alike were quick to pin its tag on their opponents , each “ antifactional ” party bidding to preserve the peace by eliminating the other .
At the outset of his second term , with growing evidence to gird his anxieties , Washington saw disorder everywhere .
He viewed the disruptions in American politics as a foreign import from France , where the revolution that drew inspiration from Lady Liberty ’s triumph in America was running amok .
His principal obsession was the Franco­phile Demo­cratic Societies , founded in cities across the country to advance the revolutionary gospel of “ liberty , equality , and fraternity . ”
They gathered to keep the revolutionary spirit of ’ 76 alive , but the president viewed them as rabble - rousing anarchists .
There is no doubt that the democratic clubs were party seedlings dedicated to advancing the principle of sacred liberty .
In denouncing them , Washington reawakened a sizable cadre of New England clergymen eager to defend the government .
By the middle of 1795 , the battle lines between friends of order and friends of liberty had been drawn .
Hamilton and Jefferson marshaled their respective forces secretly as long as Washington remained in office ; the fight for America ’s soul was set to begin .
John Adams ’s partisan call to prayer
John Adams is the most vivid American founder .
Everything Adams touched bore the imprint of his nature : petty , querulous , and vain ; yet also candid , playful , and curious .
Adams elevated self - scrutiny into an art .
His diary drips with Puritan angst , yet Adams fell several tenets short of the basic requirements of Christian orthodoxy .
For starters , he rejected original sin and the doctrine of predestination ; the Atonement — “ Christ died for our sins ” — fit nowhere in his theology .
He did n’t think like a true believer , but he felt like a true believer .
A lifelong churchgoing animal like his fathers and mothers before him , to Adams the Bible was the best book in the world and Christianity the one indispensable guarantor of public morality .
Adams , Washington ’s vice - president , narrowly de­feated Jefferson in the election of 1796 .
As he took office , Americans were dividing .
Was America going to fritter away its moral capital in a presumptuous pursuit of happiness or would it return to the Puritan pursuit of godliness that sanctified the government of its Bible - toting forebears ?
To Federalist eyes , American “ Jacobins ” in French tricolor ribbons had taken the Fourth of July hostage ; Puritan pillar John Lowell warned his Boston listeners to beware “ the seductive doctrines of ‘ Liberty ’ and ‘ Equality . ’ ”
Adams appointed a national day of fasting and repentance in May 1798 .
To Adams , the covenant his forebears made with their God in establishing a Christian commonwealth anticipated a yet more momentous compact — that between God and the new republic .
When Washington spoke of Provi­dence favoring America , his words were generic and theologically inclusive .
Adams uttered them with a strong New England accent .
The fast day unified the progovernment faction , but it also raised populist hackles , alienating untold numbers of Baptists and Methodists , whose churches were not languishing as New England divines complained theirs to be , but flourishing and multiplying , lifted on the wings of religious freedom .
As Adams ran for reelection against Jefferson in 1800 , ferocious attacks filled the Federalist press .
The president of Yale , Timothy Dwight , posed this question about the Deist from Monticello : “ Is he an infidel ?
Then you cannot elect him without betraying our Lord . ”
One parson cautioned : “ Look at every leading Jacobin as at a ravening wolf . ”
More than one Republican apologist fairly pointed out that the unitarian Jefferson was no greater an infidel than the unitarian Adams .
Another Republican made the religious case for Jefferson ’s election by posing what was fast becoming the real religious question of the hour : “ The captain of salvation is not so weak as to need an army and a navy and a majority in Congress to support his cause . ”
The spirited Republican defense of Jefferson resonated in particular with America ’s religious minorities , already a near majority of the Christian electorate .
The Baptists and Methodists together soon would eclipse the establishment churches in both spiritual and temporal clout .
As if on political cue , the Second Great Awakening opened with a bang during the height of the 1800 campaign .
By the thousands , seekers gathered at interfaith , evangelical camp meetings , hoping to be liberated by the gospel of freedom in Christ from all earthly authorities , including the established church .
Due in no small measure to the religious wars galvanizing the electorate , voter turnout practically doubled .
Jefferson claimed 80 percent of the southern vote , Adams an even higher percentage in the north , but Jefferson prevailed .
Thomas Jefferson ’s ‘ wall of separation ’
Thomas Jefferson is best remembered for seven words , the unalienable rights he enumerated as “ life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ” in the Preamble to the Declaration of Independence .
He grounded these rights in an Enlightenment metaphysic , guaranteeing them as a universal bequest from nature and nature ’s God .
To Jefferson , they were interdependent ideals .
“ The God who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time , ” he said .
True happiness , in turn , could arise only in a life free from the shackles of tyranny .
The result was a civil ethic , in which the individual conscience received unprecedented priority .
The transcendent point of reference was no longer the monarch but the people themselves , whose rights he endowed with sovereign , even divine , authority .
Jefferson ’s participation in organized religion can be sketched in a few brief lines .
Although he was elected to an Anglican parish vestry , no record exists of his having served in that capacity .
He was famous for not attending church and did so semiregularly only during his presidency and near the end of his life .
To friends , he referred to himself variously as a “ Theist , ” “ Deist , ” “ Unitarian , ” “ Rational Christian , ” and “ Epicurean ” ; “ I am a sect unto myself , as far as I know , ” he wrote .
He worked for seven years ( with James Madison and strong Baptist support ) to reverse almost two centuries of Anglican hegemony in Virginia , and numbered the Statute for Establishing Religious Freedom in Virginia among his most significant accomplishments .
Jefferson ’s 1802 letter to the Danbury , Connecti­cut , Baptists remains the single most influential presidential document in the history of American church - state relations .
Its central passage encapsulates a lifetime of thought and effort dedicated to liberating the individual from government interference in matters of religion : “ Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God , . . . that the legislative powers of government reach actions only , and not opinions , I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ‘ make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof , ’ thus building a wall of separation between church and state . ”
The wall he built has proved both time - worthy and abidingly controversial ; it endures as a delineating symbol for American church - state separation .
Jefferson held faithful to his intention never to declare a national prayer day .
He won reelection in 1804 by a landslide .
James Madison ’s Jeffersonian call to prayer
James Madison , Jefferson ’s acolyte and devout champion of sacred liberty , followed him into the presidency in 1809 .
At once , the prospect of war between the United States and Great Britain reawakened the clergy , and before long the president found himself fighting to defend the Empire of Liberty on two fronts : against England in the War of 1812 and New England in the battle for the nation ’s soul .
The nation split right down the middle , with New England soon muttering about secession .
In Jefferson ’s estimation , for America to reign triumphant all that remained was “ to include [ Canada ] in our confederacy , ” the spoils of which would give America “ an empire for liberty as [ the world ] has never surveyed since the creation . ”
But militant expansion struck other Americans as wicked .
During Madison ’s first year in office , a Federalist Christian newspaper pronounced that waging war against England “ would be a GROSS IMPIETY . ”
Madison asked for a declaration of war in 1812 , securing support for his reelection , but the country was militarily unprepared .
Worse , a third of the nation was cheering for Great Britain .
The Presbyterian and Dutch Reformed churches joined forces to proclaim a national day of repentance .
From Madison ’s perspective , ecclesiastical critics of the war were softening national resolve .
Eager to regain the religious upper hand , the Republican Congress instructed him to issue a patriotic summons to prayer , invoking God ’s aid and favor in prosecuting the war .
Madison ’s call to prayer — he issued four during the course of the war — stood the American religious body politic on its head .
Southern Christians who had balked at Adams ’s fast days as an infringement on their liberty welcomed Madison ’s religious proclamations , whereas the Standing Orders of New England , which repeatedly had chastised Repub­lican presidents for refusing to issue such declarations , scorched Madison for doing so .
By 1814 , with British troops in Maine and laying siege to Washington , some Massachusetts townships were openly toying with the idea of secession .
Their fondness for the mother country may have united New Englanders , but it divided New England from the rest of the Union .
However poorly Madison ’s
War was going , to credit the nation ’s humiliation to God , who was , by the severe logic of covenant theology , punishing the United States for abetting atheistic France in her struggle against Christian England , offended more Christians than it seduced .
Then , in a dramatic reversal of fortunes , the very war that threatened to be America ’s undoing brought her people together instead .
The British withdrew ; America had won .
( Canada , however , did not fall . )
The doomsayers who had scorned Madi­son ’s godless leadership by predicting American defeat at the hands of Christian England were served up crow for Madison ’s final fast day in 1815 .
In one of history ’s endless ironies , out of a thirty - month national embarrassment arose a new sense of nationhood .
James Monroe and the transformation of religious politics
James Monroe , elected in 1816 , was able to enjoy the religious peace for one reason above all others :
The New England Federalist clerics , so long dedicated to preserving the sanctity of state religion , lost their political franchise .
After the War of 1812 , Baptists — joined by Episcopalians and Methodists — plotted the end of state support for Connecticut ’s Congregational churches .
In early 1818 , a narrow majority of voters approved a written constitution guaranteeing equal rights and privileges to all denominations .
With their establishment in ruins and the government in secular hands , the deposed lords of Connec­ticut wasted little time nursing their wounds .
Having lost first the White House and then the State House , they set their sights higher : on the entire nation .
They rededicated their smoldering moral ambition to educating ministers , disseminating Christian tracts , battling intemperance , defending the Sabbath day , and abolishing the curse of slavery , rekindling from old embers what Congre­gational impresario Lyman Beecher called a “ voluntary establishment ” that , even more effectively than the old involuntary one , promised to transform American moral discourse .
Their new strategy for America ’s moral redemption would have lasting impact on American sacred politics .
Voluntary associations had begun locally in pockets throughout the country years before , but emerged as a nationwide movement only after the War of 1812 .
Beginning in earnest in 1816 , a bevy of national Christian associations leapt into action , their mission : to propagate the gospel and save the nation ’s soul , one Christian at a time .
Monroe did n’t obsess about the clergy in the way that his predecessors had .
As long as the church was not imposing its theological strictures on government , Monroe welcomed its activities as a stabilizing force in society .
In return , not recognizing him as an enemy , Christians of all denominations embraced their president as a friend .
On reflection , given the ferocity of the decades - long contest to redeem the government and save the nation ’s soul , the pulpit silence concerning presidential faith and Christian government during Monroe ’s presidency is breathtaking to behold .
This silence echoes even more tellingly , given Monroe ’s notable indifference to Christianity and the negligible ceremonial role the church played in his administration .
Monroe ’s balancing act — keeping God out of the White House without offending the churches — would be passed along to his presidential successors .
They would adapt his model of a religiously neutral and disengaged White House , more or less successfully and regardless of faith or party , throughout ten succeeding administrations .
Religion and politics would continue to mix , sometimes combustively , in the country at large , but for decades to come no president would have to suffer anything close to the religious calumnies that spiritual partisans had lavished on Adams , Jefferson , and Madison during the height of American ’s first great culture war .
With the collapse of New England ’s Standing Orders and their reemergence at the vanguard of a voluntary establishment of religion , the battle to save the American government , either from French infidelity or Puritan theocracy , had finally ended .
Only with the coming of the Civil War and the emergence of Abraham Lincoln as national theologian did God reenter the White House .
But that is another story .

Campaigners say Gendun will be marking his birthday in captivity
Gendun Cheokyi Nyima , now 18 years old , was named Panchen Lama aged five but has not been seen in public since .
The Chinese authorities rejected his appointment and named their own Panchen Lama , Gyaltsen Norbu , in 1995 .
Beijing says Gendun is living a free life but campaigners say he has been under house arrest during childhood .
Kate Saunders , who represents a Washington - based group , the International Campaign for Tibet ( ICT ) , said little was known about his whereabouts .
" It 's most likely that he 's being held somewhere in the vicinity of Beijing itself because that 's where the authorities could probably control him the best .
" But there 's no doubt that it will be in a very secure environment , " she said .
' Religious persecution '
The ICT has produced a report on religious freedom to coincide with the birthday of Gendun Cheokyi Nyima .
Gyaltsen Norbu was appointed by Beijing as Panchen Lama in 1995
It accuses the Chinese authorities of launching a new campaign to curb the influence in Tibet of the Dalai Lama , who lives in exile in northern India .
Ms Saunders says the Panchen Lama who disappeared is a victim of China 's attempts to control Tibetan religious thinking .
" His plight and also the installation of an alternative candidate by Beijing has come to symbolise for many Tibetans the crisis facing the survival of their religious culture in Tibet . "
The Chinese foreign ministry has angrily rejected the accusations of religious persecution in Tibet .
A spokesman said Tibetans were guaranteed normal religious freedoms , but he refused to reveal where Gendun Cheokyi Nyima was living .
Campaigners hope the boy 's 18th birthday may change the approach of the Chinese authorities to his situation .
Scientists performing experimental brain surgery on a man aged 50 have stumbled across a mechanism that could unlock how memory works .
The accidental breakthrough came during an experiment originally intended to suppress the obese man 's appetite , using the increasingly successful technique of deep - brain stimulation .
Electrodes were pushed into the man 's brain and stimulated with an electric current .
Instead of losing appetite , the patient instead had an intense experience of déjà vu .
He recalled , in intricate detail , a scene from 30 years earlier .
More tests showed his ability to learn was dramatically improved when the current was switched on and his brain stimulated .
Scientists are now applying the technique in the first trial of the treatment in patients with Alzheimer 's disease .
If successful , it could offer hope to sufferers from the degenerative condition , which affects 450,000 people in Britain alone , by providing a " pacemaker " for the brain .

Three patients have been treated and initial results are promising , according to Andres Lozano , a professor of neurosurgery at the Toronto Western Hospital , Ontario , who is leading the research .
Professor Lozano said : " This is the first time that anyone has had electrodes implanted in the brain which have been shown to improve memory .
We are driving the activity of the brain by increasing its sensitivity – turning up the volume of the memory circuits .
Any event that involves the memory circuits is more likely to be stored and retained . "
The discovery had caught him and his team " completely by surprise " , Professor Lozano said .
They had been operating on the man , who weighed 190 kg ( 30st ) , to treat his obesity by locating the point in his brain that controls appetite .
All other attempts to curb his eating had failed and brain surgery was the last resort .
The treatment for obesity was unsuccessful .
But , while the researchers were identifying potential appetite suppressant points in the hypothalamus , the part of the brain associated with hunger , the man suddenly began to say that memory was flooding back .
" He reported the experience of being in a park with friends from when he was around 20 years old and , as the intensity of stimulation increased , the details became more vivid .
He recognised his girlfriend [ from the time ] ...
The scene was in colour .
People were wearing identifiable clothes and were talking , but he could not decipher what they were saying , " the researchers write in Annals of Neurology , published today .
The man , who has not been identified , was also tested on his ability to learn lists of paired objects .
After three weeks of continuous hypothalamic stimulation , his performance on two learning tests was significantly improved .
He was also much more likely to remember a list of unrelated paired objects with the electrodes turned on than when turned off .
Speaking to The Independent yesterday , Professor Lozano said : " His performance improved dramatically .
As we turned the current up , we first drove his memory circuits and improved his learning .
As we increased the intensity of the current , we got spontaneous memories of discrete events .
At a certain intensity , he would slash to the scene [ in the park ] .
When the intensity was increased further , he got more detail but , when the current was turned off , it rapidly decayed . "

The discovery surprised the scientists as the hypothalamus has not usually been identified as a seat of memory .
The contacts that most readily produced the memories were located close to a structure called the fornix , an arched bundle of fibres that carries signals within the limbic system , which is involved in memory and emotions and is situated next to the hypothalamus .
Professor Lozano is a world authority on deep - brain stimulation who has undertaken 400 operations on Parkinson 's disease sufferers and is developing the technique as a treatment for depression , for which he has performed 28 operations .
He said the discovery of its role in stimulating memory had wide implications .
" It gives us insight into which brain structures are involved in memory .
It gives us a means of intervening in the way we have already done in Parkinson 's and for mood disorders such as depression , and it may have therapeutic benefit in people with memory problems , " he said .
The researchers are testing the approach in six Alzheimer 's patients in a Phase 1 safety study .
Three have so far had electrodes surgically implanted .
The electrodes are attached via a cable that runs below the skull and down the neck to a battery pack stitched under the skin of the chest .
The " pacemaker " delivers a constant low - level current that stimulates the brain but cannot be perceived by the patient .
Professor Lozano said : " It is the same device as is used for Parkinson 's disease .
We have placed the electrodes in exactly the same area of the hypothalamus because we want to see if we can reproduce the findings in the earlier experiment .
We believe the memory circuits we are stimulating are close by , physically touching the hypothalamus .
" It is a very effective treatment for the motor problems associated with Parkinson 's disease and it has been used on 40,000 people .
We are in the early stages of using it with Alzheimer 's patients and we do n't know if it will work .
We want to assess if we can reach the memory circuits and drive improvement .
It is a novel approach to dealing with this problem . "
British researchers welcomed the discovery .
Andrea Malizia , a senior lecturer in psychopharmacology at the University of Bristol who is studying deep - brain stimulation as a treatment for depression , said : " If they had said let 's stick an electrode in the hypothalamus to modify Alzheimer 's disease , I would have said ' Why start there ? '
But , if they have had a serendipitous finding , then that is as good .
Serendipitous findings are how a lot of discoveries in science have been made . "
Ayesha Khan , a scientific liaison officer at the Alzheimer 's Disease Society , said : " This is very cutting - edge research .
It is exciting , but the initial result is in one person .
It will need much further investigation . "
How deep - brain stimulation works
Deep - brain stimulation has been used for more than a decade to treat a range of conditions including depression , chronic pain , Parkinson 's disease and other movement disorders .
It has been so successful in treating Parkinson's that 40,000 patients worldwide now have electrodes implanted in their brains driven by pacemakers stitched into their chests .
As the devices become smaller , requiring less risky surgery , and the target areas of the brain requiring stimulation are more precisely identified , demand for the treatment is expected to leap .
Although it is expensive , the potential savings in care and treatment costs are immense .
It does not lead to dependence on drugs and is reversible .
The electrodes are implanted under local anaesthesia while the patient is awake .
Before the operation , the neurosurgeon performs an MRI scan and establishes the target location for the electrodes .
He then carries out a craniotomy – lifting a section of the skull – and inserts the electrodes and leads .
By stimulating the electrodes and checking the patient 's response , the surgeon can check that they are positioned in the right place .
Different areas of the brain are targeted for different conditions .
For Parkinson 's disease , they are placed in the subthalamic nucleus ; for depression , in area 25 of the cingulate cortex .
Deep - brain stimulation was developed in France and first licensed by the Food and Drug Administration in the US in 1997 as a treatment for tremor .
In the UK , the surgery is performed at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London , in Bristol , in Oxford and at a handful of other centres .
The name of the procedure is in some ways a misnomer as it often involves inhibiting electrical activity in an area of the brain rather than stimulating it .
The technique is as much about restoring balance between competing brain areas which leads to the tremor characteristic of some types of Parkinson 's disease .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President George W. Bush said on Friday the United States would have a long - term presence in Iraq that could “ easily ” last a decade , but that it would be at the invitation of the Iraqi government .
In an interview with NBC News , Bush was asked about recent comments by Republican presidential hopeful Sen .
John McCain that it would be fine with him to have a U.S. military presence in Iraq for 100 years .
“ That ’s a long time , ” Bush replied , adding that there “ could very well be ” a long - term U.S. presence in Iraq at the invitation of the government in Baghdad .
When asked if it could be 10 years , Bush replied : “ It could easily be that , absolutely . ”
Bush was interviewed in Jerusalem as he was wrapping up his first presidential visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories .
There has been a slow , steady shift in consumer sentiment towards debt since the beginning of the year .
For quite some time , many were debating whether it was even happening .
At Thanksgiving , the first real hints of what was coming could be found in poor turnout for pre-Christmas sales .
Still , most assumed consumers would come through at Christmas like " they always do " .
Except this time they did n't .
Christmas Retail Sales Disappointed in spite of bigger than ever discounts .
After Christmas sales disappointed as well .
Consumers Are Retrenching
It 's now clear to everyone that Consumers Are Retrenching As The Economy Weakens .
Joi Freemont , a dentist in suburban Atlanta , does n't have to look further than her appointment book to tell that people are worried about money .
Patients who used to get their teeth whitened all the time " now want to think about it a bit , " she said .
Braces ?
" People were getting them for the kids , for themselves , but now they 're waiting , " she added .
And when people get cavities , they have their fillings done one a month , not five or six at a time , she said .
As a result , Freemont and her husband are worried their income could drop and are trying to be more prudent with their money .
They 're monitoring spending more closely and continuing to whittle down their credit card balances and her dental school debt , she said .
And so the consumer balance sheet repair meme continues to grow .
As those who have read Five Things over the past couple of years know , this is not a behavior that began in August or September as the credit crunch began to manifest , it 's something that has been building for years .
Consider talk show host and television personality Dave Ramsey .
Chances are pretty good that by now you know who Dave Ramsey is , but just in case , he 's the host of a popular , widely - syndicated show , " The Dave Ramsey Show , " that is heard on the more than 300 radio stations and seen on Fox Business Television .
Ramsey has been talking about the evils of debt and the virtues of debt - free living for more than a decade .
In fact , his career began in 1992 when he began selling books on financial health following his own personal bankruptcy crisis in the late 1980s .
But only recently has Ramsey really been able penetrate the mass public 's consciousness .
Why ?
It 's not because Ramsey suddenly improved his message , it 's because social mood finally reached a point where his message is not just acceptable but sought out .
The psychological factors that have made Ramsey a household name are the same factors now working against the ability of the Federal Reserve and the government to stimulate credit demand .
U.S. consumers pull back on spending , worry more about debt as economy weakens
Consumers are cutting back
US consumers worry about debt , pull back on spending
Consumers pull back as economy weakens
Americans buckle up for slowing economy
Empty Malls as Economic Fears Spread
Americans tightening their belts
Consumers now spending less , worrying more
More consumers start to show financial restraint

Homeowners just Walking Away
WHAT do banks call it when a troubled borrower abandons her home , sending them the keys ?
“ Jingle mail . ”
And what do they call it when an irate borrower abandons his home , yanking electrical outlets from walls , leaving faucets running and otherwise trashing it on the way out ?
“ Taking the inside of the house with you . ”
From the Wachovia conference call : “ Part of one of the challenges is , and we 've mentioned this before , a lot of this current losses have been coming out of California and it's -- they 've been from people that have otherwise had the capacity to pay , but have basically just decided not to ... "
This echoes the comments of BofA CEO Kenneth Lewis last month : " There 's been a change in social attitudes toward default , " Mr. Lewis says .
...
" We 're seeing people who are current on their credit cards but are defaulting on their mortgages , " Mr. Lewis says .
" I 'm astonished that people would walk away from their homes . "
Should People Just Walk Away ?
If Americans immediately walked away from negatively amortized mortgages , the crisis would end much faster .
Here ’s why :
1. Stressed homeowners who walk away from their properties can move into a rental and cut their monthly expenses , easing financial stress .
Yes , their credit would be wrecked for a few years , but not as severely as if they foreclose or declare bankruptcy .
2. Financial institutions could unload properties more quickly because they would gain control faster than in foreclosure proceedings .
By the way , this is already happening to some degree .
The less time a home spends in limbo , the less likely it is to be damaged .
3 . Here ’s the really painful part : home prices would plummet , forcing additional homeowners to consider unloading properties .
This was going to happen anyway , but bailouts and lower interest rates will just prolong the whole mess .
4. Financial institutions would be forced to come clean much faster than to date .
Trust would be restored in surviving institutions once the carnage ended .
5 . The economy will go into a full recession too fast for the Fed to lower rates and for politicians to enact wasteful bailouts .
6 . Once home prices reach a low enough level , investors will snatch properties up and offer them as rentals .
7 . This will stabilize the home market and offer a steady income source for property investors .
( Currently , home prices are too high for leasing purposes . )
8 . After the initial pain , the economy should begin its rebound .
Of course , few economists will ever make a suggestion such as this .
Why ?
It sounds defeatist .
It ’s cruel to homeowners .
It ’s anti-American .
Financial institutions would howl in protest .
Throwing Away Money
The secular trend towards consumption has peaked .

We 've caught the dirty tricksters on video .
As you know , California Counts -- a cabal of right - wing political operatives linked to Rudy Giuliani -- is working hard to steal the White House ( again ) in 2008 .
They want to fool California voters into changing the rules so Giuliani -- or some other regressive Republican presidential nominee -- can rob at least 20 Electoral College votes from California next November .
When Steven Attewell , an eagle - eyed member of the blog Daily Kos , alerted me that California Counts petition - gatherers at UC Santa Barbara were gathering signatures to help " children with cancer , " I headed out to investigate .
And , sure enough , when I looked carefully at what they wanted me to sign , I noticed that " children with cancer " was just a sneaky tactic to get people to sign the so - called " Electoral College Reform Initiative " -- what we call the dirty trick initiative .
Now , Secretary of State Debra Bowen is considering whether to open an investigation -- if enough of us come forward with stories like what I saw at UCSB .
Click here to watch my YouTube video of the sneaky petitioners trying to trick college students .
If you 've seen a signature gatherer using sneaky tactics to obtain signatures for the Dirty Trick Initiative , please let us know and we will pass on the information to Secretary Bowen :
http://www.couragecampaign.org/sneaky
It 's against the law to obscure or misrepresent petitions .
Saying " I'm helping children with cancer " to get people to sign a petition about changing the Electoral College is just plain wrong -- and it might be illegal .
As Secretary Bowen 's office told the Daily Nexus , the UCSB newspaper , they will open an investigation into the " California Counts " campaign if enough people come forward with information about wrongdoing :
" Secretary Bowen takes allegations of elections fraud seriously , " [ Bowen Press Secretary Kate ] Folmar wrote .
" She encourages anyone who has witnessed a violation of the California Elections Code to contact the Secretary of State 's Fraud Investigations Unit .
Potential violations brought to the fraud unit 's attention are thoroughly investigated and referred for prosecution when there is sufficient evidence of wrongdoing . "
The Courage Campaign is in touch with the Secretary of State 's Fraud Investigations Unit and will be passing on my video to aid in any potential investigation .
Send this YouTube to your friends and tell them to keep their eyes peeled for dirty tricksters when they go holiday shopping this weekend .
If you encounter a petitioner trying to trick you with a line about " children with cancer , " then click here to report when and where you saw the dirty tricksters :

Let 's put these California Counts signature gatherers on notice and collect evidence for the Secretary of State to launch a formal investigation .
Canadian designer Lida Baday created an all - season jacket for the homeless that can be stuffed with newspaper for insulation !
" Newspapers are also easy for anyone to get their hands on , " says Baday , who found the project a technical challenge .
After researching fabrics , she settled on black Aquamax , a waterproof , breathable fabric laminated with a nonporous membrane .
The coat is an anorak - style , with drawstrings at the waist and hem .
A hood can be folded into the collar .
Two pockets in the hood , four on the chest , a large one on the back , and a long one down each sleeve can be stuffed with crumpled newspaper as the temperature drops .
" You stuff or unstuff the pouches as you need to , so the same jacket that keeps you dry in the rain , becomes something that can protect you from extreme temperatures , " Baday says .
In warm , dry weather , the entire jacket can be folded into one of the pockets and there are straps so it can be carried as a backpack or used as a pillow .
BEIJING , China ( CNN ) -- Wei Wenhua was a model communist and is now a bloggers ' hero -- a " citizen journalist " turned martyr .
The construction company manager was driving his car when he witnessed an ugly scene : a team of about 50 city inspectors beating villagers who tried to block trucks from unloading trash near their homes .
Wei took out his cell phone and began taking pictures .
The city inspectors saw Wei and then attacked him in a beating that lasted five minutes .
By the time it was over , the 41 - year - old Wei was slumped unconscious .
He was rushed to the hospital but was dead on arrival .
His death earlier this month continues to stir controversy .
In China 's mainstream media and in the blogosphere , angry Chinese are demanding action .
After the Web site sina.com published news of Wei's beating , readers promptly expressed their outrage .
In one day alone , more than 8,000 posted comments .
Bloggers inside and outside China bluntly condemned the brutal killing .
Watch the swirling controversy over Wei 's death »
" City inspectors are worse than the mafia , " wrote one Chinese blogger .
" They are violent civil servants acting in the name of law enforcement . "
Another blogger asked , " Just who gave these city inspectors such absurd powers ? "
Known as " chengguan " in Chinese , city inspectors are auxiliary support for police .
They are expected to deal with petty crimes .
Their tasks include cracking down on unlicensed trading .
They frequently are seen chasing street vendors off the streets and confiscating their goods .
Critics have said they often abuse their authority and prey on the weak .
In the central city of Zhengzhou last year , 1,000 college students scuffled with police and overturned cars after city inspectors roughed up a female student who had set up a street stall .
These incidents prompted the government to redefine the role of city inspectors .
Still , observed Jeremy Goldkorn , editor in chief of Danwei.org , " Some bloggers [ are ] saying this whole chengguan system is prone to corruption and abuse and it should be disbanded . "
Beijing scholar Xiong Peiyun wrote in Wednesday 's Southern Metropolis Daily , " Perhaps no one wishes to face this question .
Wei Wenhua 's death stands as clear proof of the violent ways of local city inspectors .
It 's 2008 and another citizen goes down .
When will we stand up and restrain the law enforcement violence of this city inspectors system ? "
More and more victims of abuse already are standing up .
" It 's the latest in a series of incidents which have pit provincial government authorities against citizens -- those who are protesting against something who are recording and blogging and writing about something that they consider scandalous , " Goldkorn said .
Some journalists and bloggers have even compared Wei's fatal beating to the Rodney King case , when the Los Angeles police repeatedly clubbed him .
Others say this is reminiscent of the 2003 death of graphic designer Sun Zhigang in the Chinese city of in Guangzhou .
The 27 - year - old college graduate was fatally beaten while in detention for not carrying proper identification .
The public outcry , amplified in the country 's blogosphere , prompted China 's premier to restrict police powers of detention .
Years ago , killings such as these would not have received such attention , and victims would have been forgotten , but with modern technology in the hands of ordinary citizens , abusive officials are getting caught in the act .
China 's burgeoning economy allows a relatively freer flow of information .
In September , China had 172 million Internet users , 10 million more than the last official count was released in July .
Officials said about 4 million Chinese go online for the first time every month .
Millions have opened blogs , too .
Mobile phone users also reached more than half a billion in September , according to the government .
Even though Article 35 of the Chinese Constitution is supposed to guarantee freedom of speech , China continues to restrict the flow of information .
Fearful of the surge in Internet and mobile phone usage -- and the information they are able to transmit -- the Chinese authorities are stepping up efforts to monitor and restrict their use , according to Reporters Without Borders , which fights against censorship and laws that undermine press freedom .
A few Internet data centers have been closed down , along with thousands of Web sites .
Controversial blogs are blocked and unblocked multiple times .
But silencing these citizen journalists is getting more difficult .
Days after Wei's January 7 death , a government official in Tianmen city , Wei 's hometown , was fired , four others detained and more than 100 placed under investigation .
Chinese authorities now appear to be taking these cases seriously .
Goldkorn said : " It 's the kind of trouble that is very threatening to the party and the government , because it 's the kind of trouble that questions their reason d'etre .
So when looking at things like this , in the back of their minds , is always , ' Could this develop into a real mass incident that has the power to threaten the stability of China ? ' "
Meanwhile , bloggers are heaping eulogies for Wei .
So far , no one has seen the pictures Wei took that day .
It is thought his camera was destroyed in the beating .
" Eternal repose to Citizen Wei Wenhua , " wrote blogger Wang Gongquan .
" In the face of violence and brute power , he lifted a citizen 's rights , conscience , responsibility and courage . "
Reporters Without Borders said , " Wei is the first ' citizen journalist ' to die in China because of what he was trying to film . "

Why is interest forbidden in Islam ?
During the time of the Prophet Muhammad ( peace be upon him ) , many people made gains by lending money at extortionate
rates .
They made financial gain at the expense and misfortune of others .
As a result , the payment of interest was forbidden
because it was unjust .
Islam teaches that money must be used in a useful way .
You can�t make money from money .
But you can generate wealth
through legitimate trade in goods and items .
But you must share the risks and rewards .
Quote : If my Islamic Account is interest - free , how does it work ?
Your money is kept in accordance with Shariah .
This means that we don�t use the money you keep with us for any interest
based business activities .
As with all bank accounts , you should manage your Islamic Account in a responsible way .
If you do go overdrawn we will
charge you a fee .
Details of these charges can be found at : http://www.lloydstsb.com/rates_and_charges.asp
You can also call us on 0845 6007 786 or visit one of our branches .
Because charging interest is prohibited in Islam , we don�t offer an interest - based overdraft on the Islamic Account .
I do think it seems they are saying non-islamic banking is not ethical , buy conforming to this " Islamic Banking " - however I think it is well within human rights that anyone regardless of faith should be able to use this service - I think in the European Court of Human Rights , the latter would win .
As the world marks the sixth anniversary of the arrival of the first orange - jumpsuit - clad prisoners at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , human rights groups are attempting to focus public and congressional scrutiny on what some are calling " the other Gitmo . "
It is a prison located on the U.S. military base in the ancient city of Bagram near Charikar in Parvan , Afghanistan .
The detention center was set up by the U.S. military as a temporary screening site after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan overthrew the Taliban .
It currently houses some 630 prisoners  close to three times as many as are still held at Guantanamo .
In 2005 , following well - documented accounts of detainee deaths , torture , and " disappeared " prisoners , the U.S. undertook efforts to turn the facility over to the Afghan government .
But thanks to a series of legal , bureaucratic , and administrative missteps , the prison is still under U.S. military control .
And a recent confidential report from the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) has reportedly complained about the continued mistreatment of prisoners .
The ICRC report is said to cite massive overcrowding , " harsh " conditions , lack of clarity about the legal basis for detention , prisoners held " incommunicado , " in " a previously undisclosed warren of isolation cells , " and " sometimes subjected to cruel treatment in violation of the Geneva Conventions . "
Some prisoners have been held without charges or lawyers for more than five years .
According to Hina Shamsi of the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , " Bagram appears to be just as bad , if not worse , than Guantanamo .
When a prisoner is in American custody and under American control , our values are at stake and our commitment to the rule of law is tested . "
She told IPS , " The abuses cited by the Red Cross give us cause for concern that we may be failing the test .
The George W. Bush administration is not content to limit its regime of illegal detention to Guantanamo , and has tried to foist it on Afghanistan . "
The problems at Bagram burst into the headlines in 2005 , after the New York Times obtained a 2,000 - page U.S. Army report concerning the deaths of two unarmed civilian Afghani prisoners guarded by U.S. armed forces in 2002 .
U.S. military officials in Afghanistan initially said the deaths were from natural causes .
Lt. Gen. Daniel K. McNeill , the commander of allied forces in Afghanistan at the time , denied then that prisoners had been chained to the ceiling or that conditions at Bagram endangered the lives of prisoners .
But after an investigation by the New York Times , the Army acknowledged that the deaths were homicides .
The prisoners were chained to the ceiling and beaten , causing their deaths .
Military coroners ruled that both the prisoners ’ deaths were homicide .
Autopsies revealed severe trauma to both prisoners ’ legs , describing the trauma as comparable to being run over by a bus .
Last fall , Army investigators implicated 28 soldiers and reservists and recommended that they face criminal charges , including negligent homicide .
The U.S. military has spent more than $ 30 million to build an Afghan prison outside Kabul that meets international humane treatment standards and has trained Afghan guards .
But the number of detainees keeps growing , due to the intensifying combat in Afghanistan .
One result is that there is room for only about half the prisoners the U.S. originally planned to put in the new detention center .
Efforts to transfer Bagram ’s 630 - plus prisoners to Afghan control have run into myriad other problems .
First , there were turf battles between the different ministries of the Afghan government .
Then Afghan officials rejected pressure from Washington to adopt a detention system modeled on the Bush administration ’s " enemy combatant " legal framework , with military commissions such as those at Guantánamo .
The ACLU ’s Shamsi says that , " While conditions at Bagram have improved , at least since the universal revulsion at the revelations of Abu Ghraib and Congress ’ passage of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 , the tragic mistakes of the past may be in danger of repetition . "
She also raises the possibility that there may be prisoners in Afghanistan who are not " Department of Defense detainees , " as one Pentagon official has referred to them , but are instead held by the CIA or another civilian agency .
" We know that the CIA was holding ‘ ghost prisoners ’  prisoners held in secret , hidden from the Red Cross  at a secret facility called the ‘ Salt Pit ’ in Afghanistan , " Shamsi says .
She notes that the administration has never renounced the CIA ’s illegal secret detention and interrogation program that President Bush revealed in September 2006 .
She adds concern that Special Operations forces may not be following Department of Defense directives on the registration of prisoners .
According to Shamsi , " It is clear that another lesson from the torture scandal seems to have been ignored : different rules for different agencies and different prisoners are an invitation to abuse . "
The situation at Bagram has been largely overshadowed by the continuing controversy surrounding Guantanamo .
Just last week , a U.S. appeals court ruled that four former Guantanamo prisoners , all British citizens , have no right to sue top Pentagon officials and military officers for torture , abuse , and violations of their religious rights .
The four who brought the lawsuit were released from Guantanamo in 2004 after being held for more than two years .
The suit sought $ 10 million in damages and named then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and 10 military commanders .
The men claimed they were subjected to various forms of torture , harassed as they practiced their religion , and forced to shave their religious beards .
In one instance , a guard threw a Koran in a toilet bucket , according to the lawsuit .
The appeals court cited a lack of jurisdiction over the lawsuit , ruled the defendants enjoyed qualified immunity for acts taken within the scope of their government jobs , and held the religious right law did not apply to the detainees .
Eric Lewis , the attorney who argued the case for the detainees , vowed to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court .
" It is an awful day for the rule of law and common decency when a court finds that torture is all in a days ’ work for the secretary of defense and senior generals , " Lewis said .
Another attorney for the plaintiffs , Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights , expressed disappointment that the appeals court failed to hold " Rumsfeld and the chain of command accountable for torture at Guantanamo . "
Guantanamo and Bagram have been virtually ignored by candidates for the 2008 presidential nomination .
One exception is former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee , who acknowledged that Guantanamo has become a damaging symbol for the United States and is " not in our best interests . "
President Bush has said he would like to close Guantanamo , but he has taken no action to do so .
In June 2007 , Bush ’s former Secretary of State Colin Powell said , " If it was up to me , I would close Guantanamo  not tomorrow , this afternoon , " explaining that " we have shaken the belief that the world had in America ’s justice system by keeping a place like Guantanamo open . "
And Defense Secretary Robert Gates has reportedly pushed to close the facility because he felt it had " become so tainted abroad that legal proceedings at Guantanamo would be viewed as illegitimate . "
Hope springs eternal and we sing that the sun will come out tomorrow despite the lack of hard evidence to support upbeat forecasts .
Now some scientists know why .
They 've identified the brain clusters responsible for optimism .
Optimism is a common human trait .
For instance , people tend to expect to live longer and be more successful than average , and underestimate their chances of getting divorced .
" In a class I taught with about 200 students , when I asked them how many thought they'd get married or be involved in a marriage - like relationship , many raised their hands , but when I asked how many thought they'd get divorced , only four raised their hands , and we know that 's not what the odds are with divorce , " said researcher Elizabeth Phelps , a neuroscientist at New York University .
" Most people do n't think they 'll fall into the lower half of the odds . "
To find out how the brain generates optimism for the future , researchers at New York University scanned the brains of 15 volunteers while they imagined possible future life events , such as " winning an award " or " the end of a romantic relationship . "
The scientists discovered positive future events led to increased activity in the same brain clusters that seem to malfunction in depression — the amygdala , which helps form and store emotional memories , and the rostral anterior cingulate , which helps regulate emotional responses .
The researchers also found that when volunteers had optimistic personalities , as rated by psychological exams , these brain clusters activated more .
Although extreme optimism can lead people to underestimate risks and put themselves in harm 's way , a moderate level of hopefulness " has been linked to physical and mental health , " Phelps told LiveScience .
" A little optimism helps promote actions that lead to good outcomes .
Not everything in life will turn out great , but if you thought everything will turn out bad , you 'd never do anything . "
Phelps , with neuroscientist Tali Sharot and colleagues , detailed their findings online October 24 in the journal Nature .

In a terrifying front - page article Saturday , the Post outlines the latest in US government surveillance .
According to officials , the records are intended " to assess the security threat posed by all travelers entering the country .
Officials say the records , which are analyzed by the department 's Automated Targeting System , help border officials distinguish potential terrorists from innocent people entering the country . "
The new details suggest a much broader net than that .
The details of the program were revealed when a group of activists requested copies of records on their travel and found someone had written a note about their flashlight carrying the symbol of a marijuana leaf .
" The Automated Targeting System has been used to screen passengers since the mid-1990s , but the collection of data for it has been greatly expanded and automated since 2002 , according to former DHS officials , " the Post said .
" The federal government is trying to build a surveillance society , " said John Gilmore , a civil liberties activist in San Francisco whose records were requested and then first revealed in Wired News .
The government , he said , " may be doing it with the best or worst of intentions .
. . .
But the job of building a surveillance database and populating it with information about us is happening largely without our awareness and without our consent . "
According to Wired , passengers pulled aside for extra screening are those most likely to enter the record books .
Gilmore had been pulled aside and border patrol officials took notes of his belongings .

Homeland Security officials defended the program .
" I flatly reject the premise that the department is interested in what travelers are reading , " DHS spokesman Russ Knocke told the paper .
" We are completely uninterested in the latest Tom Clancy novel that the traveler may be reading . "
According to the Post , " The DHS database generally includes ' passenger name record ' ( PNR ) information , as well as notes taken during secondary screenings of travelers .
PNR data -- often provided to airlines and other companies when reservations are made -- routinely include names , addresses and credit - card information , as well as telephone and e-mail contact details , itineraries , hotel and rental car reservations , and even the type of bed requested in a hotel . "
The millions of travelers whose records are kept by the government are generally unaware of what their records say , and the government has not created an effective mechanism for reviewing the data and correcting any errors , activists said , the paper said .
The activists alleged that the data collection effort , as carried out now , violates the Privacy Act , which bars the gathering of data related to Americans ' exercise of their First Amendment rights , such as their choice of reading material or persons with whom to associate , according to the report .

The letter did not define any of the circumstances .
Mr. Leahy said in a statement late Tuesday night that the letter “ echoes what other administration officials have said about the use of waterboarding ” but that it did not “ answer the critical questions we have been asking about its legality . ”
He said that Mr. Mukasey “ knows that this will not end the matter ” and that he can expect “ to be asked serious questions at the hearing tomorrow . ”
The Bush administration has confirmed that the Central Intelligence Agency used waterboarding against a small number of Qaeda figures captured after the terror attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The administration has said waterboarding was stopped several years ago in the wake of protests over the practice , in which suspects are placed on a flat surface , cloth or cellophane is put over their faces , and water is then poured over them .
The question of whether waterboarding amounts to torture nearly derailed Mr. Mukasey ’s nomination for attorney general .
At his Senate confirmation hearings in October , he refused to say whether he considered the technique to be torture or to be otherwise illegal .
He said he needed to withhold judgment until he had received classified briefings on the subject if confirmed .
Several Democratic senators said then that his refusal to define waterboarding as torture had led them to oppose confirmation .
He was confirmed on a vote of 53 to 40 , and the 13 - vote margin was the narrowest for a nominee to the post in more than 50 years .
Mr. Leahy and the nine other Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee wrote to Mr. Mukasey last week to insist again that he answer the question of whether waterboarding was torture .
The attorney general suggested in comments to reporters at a news conference last Friday that he might never feel compelled to answer the question , no matter how often it was asked by lawmakers and the press .
Ban the Bomb – But Only in Iran
When will Bush and Brown acknowledge that there is already a nuclear power in the Middle East ?
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 20th November 2007
George Bush and Gordon Brown are right : there should be no nuclear weapons in the Middle East .
The risk of a nuclear conflagration could be greater there than anywhere else .
Any nation developing them should expect a firm diplomatic response .
So when will they impose sanctions on Israel ?
Like them , I believe that Iran is trying to acquire the bomb .
I also believe it should be discouraged , by a combination of economic pressure and bribery , from doing so ( a military response would of course be disastrous ) .
I believe that Bush and Brown – who maintain their nuclear arsenals in defiance of the non-proliferation treaty – are in no position to lecture anyone else .
But if , as Mr Bush claims , the proliferation of such weapons “ would be a dangerous threat to world peace ” ( 1 ) , why does neither man mention the fact that Israel , according to a secret briefing by the US Defense Intelligence Agency , possesses between 60 and 80 of them ?
( 2 )
Officially , the Israeli government maintains a position of “ nuclear ambiguity ” : neither confirming nor denying its possession of nuclear weapons .
But everyone who has studied the issue knows that this is a formula with a simple purpose : to give the United States an excuse to keep breaking its own laws , which forbid it to grant aid to a country with unauthorised weapons of mass destruction ( 3 ) .
The fiction of ambiguity is fiercely guarded .
In 1986 , when the nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu handed photographs of Israel ’s bomb factory to the Sunday Times , he was lured from Britain to Rome , drugged and kidnapped by Mossad agents , tried in secret and sentenced to 18 years .
He served 12 of them in solitary confinement and was banged up again – for six months – soon after he was released .
But in December last year , the Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert accidentally let slip that Israel , like “ America , France and Russia ” had nuclear weapons ( 4 ) .
Opposition politicians were furious .
They attacked him for “ a lack of caution bordering on irresponsibility .
” ( 5 ) But US aid continues to flow without impediment .
As the fascinating papers released last year by the National Security Archive show , the US government was aware in 1968 that Israel was developing a nuclear device ( what it did n’t know is that the first one had already been built by then ) .
(6) The contrast to the efforts now being made to prevent Iran from acquiring the bomb could scarcely be starker .
At first , US diplomats urged the government to make its sale of 50 F4 Phantom jets conditional on Israel ’s abandonment of its nuclear programme .
As a note sent from the Near East Bureau to the Secretary of State in October 1968 reveals , the order would make the US “ the principal supplier of Israel ’s military needs ” for the first time .
In return it should require “ commitments that would make it more difficult for Israel to take the critical decision to go nuclear . ” ( 7 ) Such pressure , the memo suggested , was urgently required : France had just delivered the first of a consignment of medium range missiles , and Israel intended to equip them with nuclear warheads .
Twenty days later , on November 4th 1968 , when the assistant defense secretary met Yitzhak Rabin ( then the Israeli ambassador to Washington ) , Rabin “ did not dispute in any way our information on Israel ’s nuclear or missile capability ” ( 8 ) .
He simply refused to discuss it .
Four days after that , Rabin announced that the proposal was “ completely unacceptable to us ” ( 9 ) .
On November 27th , Lyndon Johnson ’s administration accepted Israel ’s assurance that “ it will not be the first power in the Middle East to introduce nuclear weapons ” ( 10 ) .
As the memos show , US officials knew that this assurance had been broken even before it was made .
A record of a phone conversation between Henry Kissinger and another official in July 1969 reveals that Richard Nixon was “ very leary of cutting off the Phantoms ” ( 11 ) , despite Israel ’s blatant disregard of the agreement .
The deal went ahead , and from then on the US administration sought to bamboozle its own officials in order to defend Israel ’s lie .
In August 1969 , US officials were sent to “ inspect ” Israel ’s Dimona nuclear plant .
But a memo from the State Department reveals that “ the US government is not prepared to support a “ real ” inspection effort in which the team members can feel authorised to ask directly pertinent questions and / or insist on being allowed to look at records , logs , materials and the like .
The team has in many subtle ways been cautioned to avoid controversy , “ be gentlemen ” and not take issue with the obvious will of the hosts . ” ( 12 ) Nixon refused to pass the minutes of the conversation he ’d had with the Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir to the US Ambassador To Israel , Wally Barbour ( 13 ) .
Meir and Nixon appear to have agreed that the Israeli programme could go ahead , as long as it was kept secret .
The US government has continued to protect it .
Every six months , the intelligence agencies provide Congress with a report on technology acquired by foreign states that ’s “ useful for the development or production of weapons of mass destruction . ”
These reports discuss the programmes in India , Pakistan , North Korea , Iran and other nations , but not in Israel ( 14 ) .
Whenever other states have tried to press Israel to join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , the US and European governments have blocked them ( 15 ) .
Israel has also exempted itself from the biological and chemical weapons conventions ( 16 ) .
By refusing to sign these treaties , it ensures that it needs never be inspected .
While the IAEA ’s inspectors crawl round Iran ’s factories , put seals on its uranium tanks and blow the whistle when it fails to cooperate , they have no legal authority to inspect facilities in Israel ( 17 ) .
So when the Israeli government complains , as it did last week , that the head of the IAEA is “ sticking his head in the sand over Iran ’s nuclear programme ” ( 18 ) , you can only gape at its chutzpah .
Israel is constantly racking up the pressure for action against Iran , aware that no powerful state will press for action against Israel .
Yes , Iran under Ahmadinejad is a dangerous and unpredictable state involved in acts of terror abroad .
The president is a Holocaust denier opposed to the existence of Israel .
During the Iran - Iraq war , Iran responded to Saddam Hussein ’s toxic bombardments with chemical weapons of its own ( 19 ) .
But Israel under Ehud Olmert is also a dangerous and unpredictable state involved in acts of terror abroad .
Two months ago it bombed a site in Syria ( whose function is fiercely disputed ) .
Last year it launched a war of aggression against Lebanon .
It remains in occupation of Palestinian lands .
In February 2001 , according to the BBC , it used chemical weapons in Gaza : 180 people were admitted to hospital with severe convulsions ( 20 ) .
Nuclear weapons in Israel ’s hands are surely just as dangerous as nuclear weapons in Iran’s .
So when will our governments speak up ?
When will they acknowledge that there is already a nuclear power in the Middle East , and that it presents an existential threat to its neighbours ?
When will they admit that Iran is not starting a nuclear arms race , but joining one ?
When will they demand that the rules they impose on Iran should also apply to Israel ?

Facebook 's success could make it less popular with younger people
Users fell 5 % to 8.5 million in January from 8.9 million in December , according to data from Nielsen Online .
This was the first drop in user numbers since July 2006 when Nielsen began compiling data on the site .
Nic Howell , deputy editor of industry magazine New Media Age , said the site was no longer as popular among its core audience of young people .
" Social networking is as much about who is n't on the site as who is - when Tory MPs and major corporations start profiles on Facebook , its brand is devalued , driving its core user base into the arms of newer and more credible alternatives , " he said .
Plateau
Facebook , along with its main rivals Bebo and MySpace , lets users set up personal web pages and communicate with each other .
TOP 10 UK SOCIAL NETWORKS Facebook MySpace Bebo Windows Live Spaces BBC Communities Friends Reunited Yahoo !

Alex Burmaster , European internet analyst at Nielsen Online , said that it was inevitable that the site 's early growth rates could not be sustained and user numbers were likely to plateau .
Nielsen 's figures showed that there are 712 % more Facebook users than a year ago .
" Just as one swallow does n't make a summer , so one month of falling audiences does n't spell the decline of Facebook or social networking , " Mr Burmaster said .
" However , real growth potential lies in the niche networks - those based on a particular lifestyle or interest , such as travel , music , wealth or business , " he added .
The data showed that MySpace users had fallen by 5 % in January , while Bebo 's audience had fallen 2 % .
Less popular social networking sites such as Windows Live Space , BBC Communities and Friends Reunited saw a rise in users in January , Mr Burmaster said .
Ten Mistakes Women Make When Having Sex With A Man
In my previous post , I described in general terms how state transformations are represented in functional languages like Haskell that do n't have the concept of mutable state ( assignment to variables ) .
There are different ways to do this , but the way that most closely simulates the way things work in imperative languages is by using state monads .
This involves taking an imperative computation and breaking it down into very small subcomputations , each of which is a very simple state transformation .
In this post , I 'm going to expand on this , showing what I mean by " simple state transformation " .
I 'm going to try to explain not only how state monads work in Haskell , but why they work the way they do .
To model an imperative computation in Haskell , you do this :
Break the whole state - modifying computation into small state - modifying transformations , expressed as functions called state transformers .
Figure out a way to combine ( compose ) the individual state transformers into a single big state transformer which represents the entire imperative computation .
I 'll call the resulting state transformer the " composite " state transformer .
Run the computation by taking an initial state and giving it as an argument to the composite state transformer .
The result of this function application is the final state .
Get the result from the final state .
It 's important to realize that the individual state transformers you work with are just ordinary functions that happen to act on the state in some way .
Furthermore , they are pure functions , which means that they have no effects other than the way that they transform their inputs into their outputs ( this is the mathematical notion of what a function is ) .
Essentially , we 've taken an impure computation ( one where at least some of the statements implicitly alter the shared state ) and turned it into a series of pure computations ( where the alterations to the shared state are made explicit by passing the state as one of the arguments to each function , also known as threading the state ) which are in turn composed to make a single pure computation .
Then we " run " the pure computation ( function ) on the initial state to get the final state , and that final state includes our desired answer .
Let 's look at what the individual state transformer functions are going to look like .
It stands to reason that they will involve the shared state in some way .
Let 's assume that the shared state has been packaged up into a single data type called State ( we saw how we could do that last post using a newtype declaration ) .
Our state transformer functions may also be working with arguments and / or results which are of types different from the State type ; these could represent components of the state or something else .
We 'll informally refer to one such data type as being of type Value ; of course , in a real situation there could be multiple value types .
The question becomes : what kinds of state transformer functions are there ?
We 'll classify them by their type signatures .
They could include :
Functions that take a state as input , modify the state , and return the new state as output .
These will have type State -> State .
Functions that take a state as input , leave it alone but extract some value from it , and return the extracted value .
These will have type State -> Value .
Functions that take a state and a value as input , modify the state , and return the new state .
These will have type ( State , Value ) -> State .
Functions that take a state as input , modify the state , and return the new state as well as some other value ( possibly extracted from the state ) .
These will have type State -> ( State , Value ) Functions that take a state and a value as input , modify the state , and return the state as well as a value ( possibly extracted from the state ) .
The output value may be of a different type than the input value .
These will have the type ( State , Value ) -> ( State , Value ' ) where Value and Value ' are two distinct types ( though in some cases they may be the same ) .
That 's quite a few distinct possibilities .
If we want to be able to compose these functions with each other , then we have 25 different cases to consider ( each of the 5 different type signatures combined with each of the others ) .
If we want to have a generic way of dealing with state transformations , we would rather not have to deal with 25 different cases , so let 's see if we can reduce this to something more manageable .
First off , notice that case 2 can be considered a degenerate version of case 4 , where the output state is the same as the input state .
So we can discard state 2 altogether .
It turns out that case 2 is used in what is called the " Reader " monad in Haskell , which models computations that have shared state that is read from but not mutated .
We want something more general than that , so we 'll just use case 4 in place of case 2 .
Similarly , we can get rid of case 1 by realizing that Haskell contains the " unit " type which is a value that represents nothing .
Technically , a unit type is a type with only one value ; in Haskell , that value is represented by an empty tuple , or ( ) .
So we could replace case 1 by any of cases 3 , 4 , or 5 by making the Value type be the unit type .
We 'll choose to replace it with case 4 , so that if we have a function of type State ->
State , we 'll replace it by a function of type State -> ( State , ( ) ) , which is of the same form as case 4 .
Note that the Value type does n't represent a specific type but simply stands in for any type we might want to use .
Here , we use the unit type ( ) in place of Value .
At this point , we will use a trick to get rid of cases 3 and 5 , so that we 'll be left with only case 4 .
Both cases 3 and 5 have the input argument ( State , Value ) , which is a tuple composed of the state along with some value .
We can break up this tuple so that case 3 has the type Value -> State ->
State and case 5 has the type Value -> State -> ( State , Value ' ) .
This is perfectly usable in practice ; it just means that instead of using functions that take two arguments in a tuple , we use functions that take one of the two arguments ( the one with the Value type ) and return a new function which takes an argument of type State and returns a tuple of type ( State , Value ' ) .
This process is called " currying " in functional programming ( a reference to Haskell Curry , a pioneer in mathematical logic and the person the Haskell language is named after ) .
What we 're doing here is thus to take some kinds of state transformations and turn them into functions which take a value and return another function , which happens to be a simpler kind of state transformation .
By doing this , we can make the state transformation functions all of the same type , which will be very useful when designing a generic scheme for composing them .
This previous paragraph may have been somewhat confusing , so feel free to reread it and email me any questions you might have .
Make sure you understand it , because it 's going to be critical in what follows .
In summary , all of our state transformation functions are going to have the type signature State -> ( State , Value ) , for some state and value types .
We can define a new type for this as follows :
newtype StateTrans s a = ST ( s -> ( s , a ) )
This defines a new family of types called StateTrans ( technically , this is called a polymorphic type which means that it's a type family parameterized on some other types ) .
The s and a are type variables ; substituting specific types into s and a gives you a concrete ( non-polymorphic ) type .
The s types represent the state types and the a types represent the value types .
Typically , in a particular computation all the state types are the same ( representing the shared state of the computation ) , while the value types can differ for each state transformer that takes part in the overall computation .
One thing to note about this family of types is that a single " value " of type StateTrans s a is actually a function ; in other words , StateTrans values are functions .
This is fine in Haskell ( and in any functional language ) , where functions are first - class values , but it does sometimes lead to some confusion because the same entity can be spoken of as a value or as a function .
One more little tweak : Haskell actually defines the above type like this :
newtype ST s a = ST ( s -> ( s , a ) )
In other words , the same name ST is used as the name of the type family and as the name of the type constructor .
This is legal in Haskell ; type names and type constructor names live in different namespaces .
We 'll use this definition from now on .
For experts : yes , I know that there are strict and lazy versions of this polymorphic type , but I 'll ignore that here .
If you look back a few paragraphs to the trick I used to get rid of cases 3 and 5 , recall that those cases will be represented by functions of the type Value -> State -> ( State , Value ' ) ( where Value ' will be the unit type ( ) for case 3 ) .
Expressing this in terms of our new ST types , we see that these cases are handled by functions of the type a -> ST s b .
All I 've done here is substitute a for Value , b for Value ' , s for State and ST s b for State -> ( State , Value ' ) ( or , if you prefer , for s -> ( s , b ) ) .
The story so far : all of our state transformers have one of two types :
ST s a a -> ST s b
The first kind of state transformer is used for state transformers that may alter the state and return a value .
The second kind is used for state transformers that do that , and in addition require an input value ( which may be used to modify the state , for instance ) .
Our job now will be to figure out a way to compose these state transformers to make more complex state transformers .
That will be where monads come in , and that will be the topic of later posts in this series .
Before I finish this post , I 'd like to consider the question of why we can't have all of our state transformers be of type State -> State ( case 1 ) .
If they were of that type , it would certainly be easy to compose them ; you could just use regular function composition , and the output state of one state transformer would be the input state of the next state transformer .
Furthermore , the trick I used to get rid of cases 3 and 5 will work here , so we can also handle state transformers of the type ( State , Value ) ->
State by changing them to type Value -> State ->
State which becomes a state transformer of type State ->
State once you apply the first state transformer to a value of type Value .
However , if we do this our system has the severe limitation that you can't pull anything out of the state until the computation is done .
This is bad because you often have to extract components of the state during a computation ( for instance , in order to pass that component as an argument to a function and do something with the result ) .
To get around this problem we either have to do one of two things :
Every time we want to pull a value out of the state , we stop the entire computation , extract the value , and restart the computation .
This will make our code very tedious to write .
Alternatively , we can take any function which needs to work on a component of the state and turn it into a function of type State ->
State ( ignoring the parts of the state it does n't need and putting the results back into the state appropriately ) , and then using that as a new state transformer that would be composed with the other state transformers .
This would also be very tedious to write ( and to understand ) .
Although I suppose this could be done , it turns out to be more straightforward to simply work with state transformers using the ST s a types described above .
That 's all for this post .
In the next post , I 'm going to revisit the GCD function from the last post and show how its component parts can be expressed as state transformers , and then later I 'll show how all of this gets put into the monad framework and how we would write that function using state monads .
Ouch , we just tested and confirmed that one of the smallest ( and thus likeliest to fit ) USB EV - DO modems around , the Sprint / Novatel U727 , wo n't even come close to fitting in the cramped , foldaway USB port on the MacBook Air .
Most flash drives will probably be okay , but it looks like 3G users might need powered USB hubs or a USB extension cable to get online where WiFi is n't available ( read : most places ) .
Of course , your mileage may vary -- we recommend testing your modem of choice on a live machine in an Apple store before dropping any coin .
Lord Carey is among report ’s authors
The poll , carried out across 21 countries , found “ widespread anti-immigration sentiment ” , but warned Europe ’s Muslim population will treble in the next 17 years . [ > [>
It reported “ a severe deficit of trust is found between the Western and Muslim communities ” , with most people wanting less interaction with the Muslim world . [> [>
Last night an MP warned it showed that political leaders in Britain who preach the benefits of unlimited immigration were dangerously out of touch with the public . [>

The study , whose authors include the former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey , was commissioned for leaders at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos , Switzerland . [ > [>
It reports “ a growing fear among Europeans of a perceived Islamic threat to their cultural identities , driven in part by immigration from predominantly Muslim nations ” . [>

And it concludes : “ An overwhelming majority of the surveyed populations in Europe believe greater interaction between Islam and the West is a threat . ” Backbench Tory MP David Davies told the Sunday Express : “ I am not surprised by these findings .
People are fed up with multiculturalism and being told they have to give up their way of life . [ > [>
“ Most people in Britain expect anyone who comes here to be willing to learn our language and fit in with us . ” [>

“ A lot of people are very uncomfortable with the changes being caused by immigration and politicians have been too slow to wake up to that . ” [ >

The nursery says only parents and staff will be registered
The biometric security system at Mes Enfants nursery in Mumbles , Swansea , allows only authorised parents and staff to access the building .
When registered people swipe their finger , their details also flash up on a computer so staff know who is there .
Nursery owner Rebecca Treharne said the aim was to give parents and staff added confidence .
The nursery has been running for five - and - a - half years and has 100 children on its books , aged from four months to four - and - a - half years old .
It believes it could be the first nursery in Wales to adopt such a system for staff and parents .
Ms Treharne said : " I like the nursery to be quite forward thinking and modern in approach .
I think this is the way forward .
' Eased workload '
" Parents are automatically conscious of security , happiness and wellbeing .
In nursery this has to be a priority .
Security has to be on top of the list . "
Feedback from parents had been positive , said Ms Treharne , and the new system - which also has video and audio - was better than the buzzer and intercom they previously had .
It also eased the workload on staff , she added , as they did not have to leave children to open the front door so can spend more time supervising their pupils .
The system was installed by UK Biometrics Ltd which also uses iris recognition and facial patterns in its security products .
The scanner registers a fingerprint in seconds and then stores an encrypted version for future comparison , protecting the identity of authorised users .
UK Biometrics director Ryan Hole said : " By fitting a biometric access system they now have the one key that cannot be lost , stolen , forged or hacked - the human fingerprint " .
This is just silly :
Hillary Clinton will take the Democratic nomination even if she does not win the popular vote , but persuades enough superdelegates to vote for her at the convention , her campaign advisers say .
The New York senator , who lost three primaries Tuesday night , now lags slightly behind her rival , Illinois Senator Barack Obama , in the delegate count .
She is even further behind in “ pledged ” delegates , those assigned by virtue of primaries and caucuses .
But Clinton will not concede the race to Obama if he wins a greater number of pledged delegates by the end of the primary season , and will count on the 796 elected officials and party bigwigs to put her over the top , if necessary , said Clinton ’s communications director , Howard Wolfson .
No shit .
And she would be completely within her rights to do so .
Would it be sleazy , and a sure way to make sure she depresses Democratic turn - out and probably make her so disliked her legislative agenda would go nowhere , even with a friendly Congress ?
Quite possibly .
But this is the Clintons we are talking about , and winning is everything ( and do n’t tell me that statement is Clinton hate - the dynamic duo have always considered themselves to be the pragmatic winners of the Democratic Party ) .
The Clinton campaign is banking on this scenario .
This is why we are getting with lubed up with all sorts of stories like this from Clinton surrogate Lanny Davis :
There is certainly a valid concern expressed by those who fear that the 796 “ superdelegates ” to the August 2008 Democratic National Convention —
Democratic elected officials , party officials and VIPs – might make the difference in delivering the nomination to the candidate who wins fewer pledged delegates out of the primaries and caucuses .
To some , such a result would seem “ undemocratic . ”
But let ’s not rewrite history .
When the superdelegates were first created by the Democratic National Committee in 1982 , they were intended to be independent , able to vote for any candidate , regardless of the outcome of the primaries or caucuses in their own congressional districts or states .
And this from Clinton pollster Mark Penn :
Again and again , this race has shown that it is voters and delegates who matter , not the pundits or perceived “ momentum . ”
After Iowa , every poll gave Barack Obama a strong lead in New Hampshire , but he ended up losing the state .
And after a defeat in South Carolina , Hillary Clinton went on to win by large margins in California , New York , Florida , New Jersey , Massachusetts , Arizona , Tennessee , Oklahoma and Arkansas .
As history shows , the Democratic nomination goes to the candidate who wins the most delegates – not the candidate who wins the most states .
In 1992 , Bill Clinton lost a string of primaries before clinching the nomination .
And this nonsense from Clinton surrogate Harold Ickes :
The person I spoke to paraphrases Ickes , who is spearheading Hillary ’s super - delegate hunt , this way : “ We ’re no longer using the phrase super delegates .
It creates a wrong impression .
They ’re called automatic delegates .
Because that ’s what they are . ”
The worry appears to be that the phrase “ super - delegates ” implies that “ they have super - powers or super influence when they do n’t , ” the source says , describing Ickes ’ thinking .
In other words , the phrase suggests that they have greater than average clout and that they have the power to overrule the democratic process , giving it the taint of back - room power politics .
The new term “ automatic delegates ” appears to be ostensibly a reference to the fact that these folks are super - delegates automatically , by virtue of their office or position .
It is right there in front of you - they intend to win this nomination even if they lose the popular vote .
They are just setting the groundwork for it right now , and anyone who is even remotely surprised that the Clinton camp would literally crawl over glass to win needs to have their head examined .
Which , of course , is why it is so important that you make sure you go out and vote for Obama .
Try to get him to win every state from here on out , and make the margins smaller when he loses .
Make the super - delegates think about going against the popular will .
A clean , undeniable win is the only thing that will stop her , as we KNOW they have no scruples about taking this nomination any way they can .

From the other side of this issue , Tom Watson .
I was totally blown away by this fantastic game !
It ’s got style , it ’s got game play and it ’s got some actual challenge to it .
It ’s not hard , so much as it makes you actually think about what you are doing .
It ’s not just a point and shoot action game , you have to think about how you can most effectively stop your enemies form stopping you first .
Once you figure out what you need to do , it ’s just a matter of doing it , unlike many modern shooters that seem to be more based on luck than actual thought and skill .
You feel a much greater sense of accomplishment when you figure out how to beat a boss in this than you do in other games when you finally manage to live long enough to fill the bosses with enough bullets to drop a Tyrannosaurus Rex .
I could play this game for hours on end and completely lose track of the time .
It ’s just so entertaining .
The consistently fast pace in this game keeps it very engaging and exhilarating –but be careful !
You just might forget you should have been in bed seven hours ago !
You start off as a member of a rebel group , fighting their way through wave after wave of well - armed baddies scattered throughout a city in Japan in the post - apocalyptic future .
The city is overrun by these strange mutant animals that resulted from an experimental species of animal created specifically as food and raised on the island of Hokkaido .
In this post - war future life is peaceful , but as a result ; overpopulation has rapidly accelerated and there is a rather immediate need for a more stable and replenish able food source .
A group of sceientists genetically engineer a specific creature for the cause , but mutations gradually occur and these new creatures begin hunting their own hunters and eventually escaping the confines of Hokkaido and invading greater Japan .
These creatures are referred to as the Ruffians .
Japan was in dire need of some saving at this point and commissioned the Armed Volunteers to save the country , however ; they saw it more fitting to oppress the citizens and try to take control for themselves .
The last hope of Japan seemed to be lost in the chaos , however ; a strange rumor began to surface .
A rogue group known as the Savior Group was on the hunt to take out some Ruffians and save the citizens of Japan .
What was strange about this rumor was that all the members of the group were said to have been cured of various illnesses via the miraculous power of a mysterious woman known as Achi .
The story follows two teenage members of the Savior Group , Saki and Airan , as they battle the Ruffians and try to retake Japan from it ’s seemingly hopeless state .
They , like many others , received the salvation of Achi and were healed of their illnesses on the condition that they devote themselves to fighting the Ruffians and saving Japan from spiraling into a state of chaos and despair .
The game plays like a standard , arcade style , on - rails shooter , but it is very unique in comparison and has a much more prevalent story progression than most on - rails , arcade shooters .
Everything is very anime themed , from the over dramatic story to the colorful and highly stylized graphics .
So if you like a good epic scifi anime adventure this game will sure fill the bill .
Sin & Punishment was a hit Nintendo 64 game in Japan that , for various reasons , never made it to North America .
But after an incredible number of requests for it to be included on Nintendo ’s Virtual Console it finally made it to the finger tips of millions of Wii owners all across North America .
This game was recognized by the game importing community for it ’s english voice acting with japanese subtitles , which made it a very popular game to import .
Flash forward a few years to the current and now you do n’t have to import it !
Just turn on your Wii , load up the Shopping Channel and download Sin & Punishment right off the Virtual Console section !
This game was created by legendary game developer , Treasure ; a game company known for making some of the biggest cult classic video games , but they ’ve laid dormant in recent years .
You may know them for Gunstar Heroes or Radiant Silvergun and it ’s sequel Ikaruga .
They are the creators of many of the most sought after imported games of all time , and now they are back to finally bring their fantastic futuristic adventure , Sin & Punishment , to the western hemisphere !
If you like the good old arcade style rail shooters or epic scifi anime ( or even both ! )
I very highly recommend you give this game a try !
It is most certainly worth the mere 1200 Wii Points it costs on the Virtual Console .
It is a rather challenging game , but in a way that makes you really want to keep trying to figure out what to do rather than just being frustratingly impossible .
Current
Gen game developers need to figure out that there is a difference between challenging game play and broken game play .

Zero -Bugs it is software for hotels developed by
1995 as company of services , offering management solutions and implantation of systems for professional companies and offices are based on .
Before the lack of management solutions for the hotel businesses we began that same year to develop our own application .
Zero -Bugs it was born as new line of business of our company and since then we continued working and innovating , anticipating us to the exigencies of the market .
The constant evolution of the technologies of the information applied to the tourist sector requires a great agility and capacity of reaction that is only possible to maintain if a company totally is involved in a project and we are it .
Our objective :
To offer solutions characterized by his innovation , creativity and quality that they allow the clients to improve his processes of business .
In all our projects we adopted a work methodology that describes the tasks to follow , from the study of the correct solution for the client to his definitive implantation and the later support for his improvement .
Our philosophy :
To generate frame of confidence with the client and to turn us into its technological partner to help to consolidate the growth of its business and of securing the success for its company .
Given the fact that most of the nanotech developments we 've seen have to do with making smaller transistors or generating electricity , we 're not exactly sure why a recent study conducted by the researchers at the University of Wisconsin - Madison found that two - thirds of American think nanotechnology is " morally unacceptable " -- perhaps they did n't hear about that team that used nanotech to inscribe the Bible on the head of a pin ?
Overall , Americans were far less accepting of pint - size technology than other countries -- 72 percent of French respondents thought nanotech was morally okay , as did 54 percent of the UK residents polled and 62 percent of the Germans .
Still , we 're left wondering why anyone would find a reason to object to nanotechnology -- unlike biotech , we just do n't see a lot of moral dilemmas posed by the research .
Well , apart from that whole gray goo thing -- but if that 's the risk we have to take to finally score a pair of electric pants , you can sign us right up .
Shell , the oil company that recently trumpeted its commitment to a low carbon future by signing a pre-Bali conference communique , has quietly sold off most of its solar business .
The move , taken with rival BP 's decision last week to invest in the world 's dirtiest oil production in Canada 's tar sands , indicates that Big Oil might be giving up its flirtation with renewables and going back to its roots .
Shell and BP are among the biggest producers of greenhouse gases in the world , but both have been keen to paint themselves green through a series of clean fuel initiatives .
BP , under its former chief executive , John Browne , promised to go " beyond petroleum " while Shell has spent millions advertising its serious interest in the future of the environment .
But at a time when interest in solar power is greater than ever , with the world 's first " solar city " being built at Phoenix , Arizona , a small announcement from Environ Energy Global of Singapore revealed that it had bought Shell 's photovoltaic operations in India and Sri Lanka , with more than 260 staff and 28 offices , for an undisclosed sum .
The sell - off , to be followed by similar ones in the Philippines and Indonesia , comes after another major disposal executed in a low - key way last year , when Shell hived off its solar module production business .
The division , with 600 staff and manufacturing plants in the US , Canada and Germany , went to Munich - based SolarWorld .
Shell has however formed a manufacturing link , with Saint - Gobain , and promised to build one plant in Germany .
The Anglo - Dutch oil group confirmed yesterday that it had pulled out of its rural business in India and Sri Lanka , saying it was not making enough money .
" It was not bringing in any profit for us there so we transferred it to another operator .
The buyer will be able to take it to the next level , " said a spokeswoman at Shell headquarters in London .
The oil group said it was continuing to move its renewables interests into a mainstream business and hoped to find one new power source that would " achieve materiality " for it .
Shell continues to invest in a number of wind farm schemes , such as the London Array offshore scheme , which has government approval .
Shell has also been concentrating its efforts on biofuels , but declined to say whether it had given up on solar power even though many smaller rivals continue to believe the technology has a bright future .
Environmental groups have always accused Shell of using clean energy initiatives as " greenwash " to deflect criticism from its core carbon operations , especially tar sands .
The latest pull - out has annoyed rival business leaders at London - based Solar Century and local Indian operation , Orb Energy , who fear the impact of a high - profile company selling off solar business .
Jeremy Leggett , chief executive of Solarcentury and a leading voice in renewable energy circles , said Shell was undermining the credibility of the business world in its fight against global warming .
" Shell and Solar Century were among the 150 companies that recently signed up to the hard - hitting Bali Declaration .
It is vital that companies act consistently with the rhetoric in such declarations , and as I have told Shell senior management on several occasions , an all - out assault on the Canadian tar sands and extracting oil from coal is completely inconsistent with climate protection .
" This latest evidence of half - heartedness or worse in Shell 's renewables activities leaves me even more disappointed .
Unless fossil - fuel energy companies evolve their core activities meaningfully , we are in deep trouble , " he said .
Damian Miller , former director of Shell Solar 's rural operations and now chief executive of Orb Energy , said Shell was missing an opportunity by pulling out at a time when renewables markets were starting to mature in the developing world .
He alleged some customers were complaining of being abandoned by Shell and worried about the servicing of equipment they could expect from Environ .
" We see former Shell customers who are highly disappointed not to be receiving proper service for the solar systems they have invested in .
These customers have often invested 20 - 30 % of their annual income in a system to ensure they have some minimum amount of lighting and access to radio , TV , or a fan , " said Miller .
He added that the oil majors , including Shell , had invested time and energy in promoting their plans for renewable energy in the press and on TV , but were not able to lead the transformation the world needs towards renewable energy and energy efficient solutions .
Shell declined to comment on these criticisms or talk about where its priorities lay .
But the chief executive , Jeroen van der Veer , did make a number of comments last summer which could have paved the way for a change in policy .
Alternative energy sources such as renewables will not fill the gap , he argued , forecasting that even with technological breakthroughs they could give supply only 30 % of global energy by the middle of the century .
" Contrary to public perceptions , renewable energy is not the silver bullet that will soon solve all our problems , " he said .
Meanwhile , BP has been accused by Greenpeace Canada of lining itself up to help commit " the biggest environmental crime in history " .
This follows its decision to swap assets with Husky Oil , giving it an entrance ticket to the Alberta tar sands , which are said to be five times more energy - intensive to extract compared to traditional oil .
John Browne , the group 's former chief executive , had said BP would not follow Shell into tar sands as he established an alternative energy division and pledged to take the group " beyond petroleum . "
The new boss , Tony Hayward , has pointed the corporate supertanker in a new direction although his public relations minders insist BP remains committed to exploring the potential of renewables .
" Tony Hayward has been part of the management team at BP for many years and has endorsed the low - carbon strategy that involved BP creating its alternative energy business late in 2005 .
We are spending $ 8 bn ( £ 4bn ) over ten years and are pressing ahead with 450 megawatts of wind production capacity in the US , " said a spokesman .
" The tar sands deal in Canada does not represent a change in direction , it was just a very good opportunity which represents a broadening of the portfolio . "
Greenpeace climate campaigner Joss Garman said : " If Shell is to survive the climate change age ... it needs to become not just an oil company but an energy company .
One wonders if Shell 's executives have noticed what 's happening in Bali or if we 'll see slick adverts on TV boasting about their retreat from renewables .
Probably not . "
We have a new article today , from Professor Graeme MacQueen , entitled –
“ Waiting for Seven : WTC 7 Collapse Warnings in the FDNY Oral Histories . ”
http://www.journalof911studies.com/volume/200701/MacQueenWaitingforSeven.pdf
Here are a few excerpts .
“ In the debate over the collapse of World Trade Center 7 , warnings of the building ’s collapse have come to play an important role .
In addition to the numerous collapse warnings mentioned in written documents , such as those I will be using in this article , we have seen a growing number of videotape fragments and interviews in which people appear to have been told in advance of Seven ’s collapse .
Many proponents of the controlled demolition hypothesis take these cases , both written and video , as evidence that the building ’s collapse was brought about deliberately . ”
“ But those who think that Seven ’s fall was natural rather than deliberate have not shied away from the collapse warnings .
They have simply interpreted them in a different way .
In essence , they have said that the warnings were rational and expected given the severe damage Seven had sustained . ”
Earthquake - prediction techniques could help develop a way to forecast epileptic seizures , according to research which found striking similarities between the electrical activity in the brain before and during seizures and seismological data around earthquakes .
Both are usually preceded by small , barely detectable tremors and , as with an earthquake , the longer it has been since a seizure , the longer it will be until the next one .
According to scientists , these shared features mean that the patterns are not random and could even be governed by similar mathematical rules .
Epilepsy comprises a set of conditions which disrupt the electrical activity in the brain and the main symptoms are recurrent , unprovoked seizures .
It is one of the most common long - term neurological disorders , affecting 456,000 people in the UK and around 50 million worldwide .
The condition can often be controlled by drugs that damp down the brain 's electrical activity , although surgery to remove the affected part of the brain is sometimes used in the most hard - to - treat cases .
Seizures often start suddenly in a region of the brain and can then spread to engulf the organ .
An earthquake also appears as a sudden , potentially damaging vibration focused around a relatively well - defined point .
The researchers said both seizures and earthquakes could be thought of as " relaxation events " , in which accumulated energy is suddenly dissipated .
In their study researchers led by neurologist Ivan Osorio from the University of Kansas showed the frequency of both earthquakes and epileptic seizures could be described by " power laws " , which can often explain the frequency of events that , on the surface , seem random .
In earthquake prediction power laws link the size of an individual quake with the time that passes between quakes of that size .
Osorio suggested that the similarities between electrical activity in the brain and seismic activity could bring prediction and prevention of seizures a step closer .
" This suggests a novel research direction for the prediction of seizures based on the notion that seizures beget seizures , " he wrote in a paper uploaded to the Arxiv website , where scientists swap research findings before they undergo peer - review .
Matthew Walker of the experimental epilepsy group at University College London told New Scientist magazine that the research was an " attractive concept " , adding that " a good predictive method could revolutionise people 's lives " .
But he cautioned that the Kansas team had yet to show that its method worked in practice .
Planning for Ubuntu 8.10ish - The Intrepid Ibex
With Hardy now past feature - freeze it's time to start to plan features that are being lined up for inclusion after Ubuntu 8.04 LTS is released in April .
And so I 'd like to introduce you to the Intrepid Ibex , the release which is planned for October 2008 , and which is likely to have the version number 8.10 .
During the 8.10 cycle we will be venturing into interesting new territory , and we 'll need the rugged adventurousness of a mountain goat to navigate tricky terrain .
Our desktop offering will once again be a focal point as we re-engineer the user interaction model so that Ubuntu works as well on a high - end workstation as it does on a feisty little subnotebook .
We 'll also be reaching new peaks of performance - aiming to make the mobile desktop as productive as possible .
A particular focus for us will be pervasive internet access , the ability to tap into bandwidth whenever and wherever you happen to be .
No longer will you need to be a tethered , domesticated animal - you 'll be able to roam ( and goats do roam ! ) the wild lands and access the web through a variety of wireless technologies .
We want you to be able to move from the office , to the train , and home , staying connected all the way .
The Intrepid Ibex will take shape at our next Ubuntu Developer Summit , an open event to which members of the Ubuntu community , upstream communities , corporate developers and other distributions are all invited .
That summit takes place in beautiful Prague , in the Czech Republic from 19th - 23rd May 2008 .
Together we will draw up detailed blueprints for Ubuntu 8.10 .
Please join us there to help define the Intrepid Ibex : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDS-Intrepid Ubuntu 8.10 will be our ninth release , and the fourth anniversary of the first release - 4.10 .
In those four years , Ubuntu has grown as a project , an ethos and a community .
The Ubuntu community have worked to set the benchmark for open , inclusive , and collaborative development processes .
We have open specifications , open governance structures and a willingness to empower everyone to make their unique contribution to the success of the project .
This has created an extraordinary diversity in participation ; a depth of talent including packagers , programmers , translators , writers , testers , advocates , technical support , artists and many others .
Those contributions come as much from the corporate world - Canonical and other companies that have embraced Ubuntu as a core of their offering - as from a huge number of individual professionals .
It is this combination of expertise and perspectives that makes it such a pleasure for me to be part of this project , and I thank all of you for your continued passion , participation , and energy .
Hardy is our best development cycle yet , delivering on our promise of reliability and stability for the Heron .
We must stay focused on that goal .
To the extent that you have a brilliant idea for the future , you now have a peg to hang it on - the Intrepid Ibex .
When the Hardy Heron has taken flight we will engage fully with the Ibex .
Give it horns !

10 - Year Chinese Haunting Finally Debunked
This 5 story “ haunted ” building in the GuangXi province of China has scared most of it ’s owners away .
Anyone who ever lived in the house , heard horribly spooky sounds coming from somewhere in the house .
In ten years , the house has been sold to four different owners , and soon after each moved in , they moved out because of the haunting .
The building is actually very nice and used to be valued at about $ 34,000 , but with the haunting no one wanted to buy it until two brothers paid $ 6,500 and bought it .
The small town Chan brothers did not believe in haunted houses and could not pass on the great price for such a large building .
Each night , the brothers would hold their breath and try to find where in the house the noise was coming from .
After numerous nights of searching , they figured out the noise sounded like something flapping in the water and it came from the bathroom pipe on the first floor .
The decided to break the pipe open and immediately found what was haunting the house .
About 10 catfish were found swimming in the sewer .
Two were about 10 pounds and the rest were about 5 pounds each .
So it turns out the haunting was nothing more than some catfish in the sewer system , but … how did they get their in the first place ?
In 1995 , the first owner of the house was a catfish lover .
One day , he bought a bucket full of cat fish for dinner and left them in the bathroom waiting to be gutted .
Apparently , two of them escaped through the toilet bowl and made a happy family of 10 living in the sewage pond .
Now that the ghost is gone , the price tag of the house soon rocketed to over $ 133,000 .
Not too bad for a little myth busting …

What is the correct masturbation method ?
Is there a right way ?
Is the masturbation method you are doing wrong ?
Should I do it with my fingers ?
Is it bad for you to use sex toys ?
I think there are various questions .
This article answers that question .
As with me , I did n’t ask anyone to teach me how to masturbate , but I thought I would make myself feel good .
Is it good for the body in the first place ?
Do you have any thoughts or side effects ?
I was also wondering .
Honestly , knowledge of these sexuality is essential to protect oneself .
An environment where sexuality is taboo is also a problem , but the important thing is to separate the information you need and the information you do not need .
I have decided that this item of masturbation is very important for my life , so I write the correct sexuality information from the rules of thumb that I think of as sexual knowledge for women with the same problem .
What is a woman doing masturbation ?
Masturbation is the act of stimulating yourself , such as the chest or genitals , where you feel comfortable and getting a pleasant sensation .
Masturbation recently called self - pleasure .
Masturbation may be embarrassing for men and women for women , and it may seem embarrassing to be like a person with a strong sexual desire , but it is not embarrassing for women to masturbate .
What a nonsense !!
What has masturbation has to do with woman empowerment .
Sex & pleasure is one of the human need .
We are country with Kamasutra .

Rather , for the female body , there are many benefits that can be obtained by masturbating .
There is also an example of a woman who , through masturbation , has reached an orgasm through sex with her partner .
However , some women say that they have never masturbated and do n’t know how to do it , but they have done so , but they do n’t feel comfortable because they do n’t know how to orgasm .
The body of a woman is very delicate , so depending on how you masturbate , you may end up hurt yourself or become less likely to orgasm .
This time , I will explain the correct way of masturbation that women do and the method of masturbation that allows you to orgasm comfortably .
80 % of women masturbate more than once a week !
According to the questionnaire about masturbation targeted at women , about 80 % of women answered that they masturbate at least once a week .
doctor : the average of woman masturbation is 4 x a week me : u mean a day ?
doctor : what me : what — may ( @rippedkitten ) March 20 , 2020
I investigated what kind of time a woman , like a man , who would not collect semen unless he masturbates regularly , wants to masturbate .
When you see a naughty scene in a movie , drama , manga , etc .
When you want to relax a little before going to bed
When you miss your skin and become lonely
When you have spare time
When stress is accumulated
When you feel horny due to hormone balance , such as before menstruation
In this way , it can be seen that women not only want to eliminate libido but also want to masturbate depending on the mental and hormonal balance at that time .
It can be said that masturbation is not only for females but also for beauty , relaxation and stress relief .
By masturbating , a woman stimulates the secretion of the female hormone estrogen .
This hormone called estrogen has the effect of producing collagen , which is very effective for women ’s beauty such as elasticity and firmness on the skin and bust enhancement .
Modest masturbation of women is full of benefits for both body and spirit !
In addition , masturbation also promotes the secretion of a substance in the brain called “ love hormone ” called oxytocin , which can be expected to have the effect of relieving stress and relaxing and allowing a good night ’s sleep .
In other words , masturbation is not only pleasant but also has many pleasant effects on the female body .
There are two types of female masturbation !
I have found that masturbation is necessary for women , but I ca n’t just say it in a word .
There are actually two types of female masturbation .
Active masturbation
Active masturbation , which is one type of female masturbation , is very similar to masturbation performed by men .
With the positive feeling of wanting to feel good , you can masturbate using your fingers or adult guts ( sex toys ) to get a pleasant feeling and feel refreshed .
Meet your sexual desires that have sprung up after having not had sex with your partner for a while or watching a movie with a naughty scene and sexual desires that are sexual desires that occur before menstruation , before ovulation , etc .
It can be said that it is masturbation to fulfil a clear purpose .
If you are interested in other sex toys , you can find a sex toy that suits you here .

Emotional masturbation
Emotional masturbation , on the other hand , is the masturbation that you perform to maintain your body and satisfy your feelings , just as if you were going to massage your body or go out to eat your favourite sweets .
It is intended to relieve your tension by masturbation and to have a relaxing effect , so it does not have a clear purpose or desire to eliminate it , but it can be said to be done to relax naturally and to please yourself .

Why masturbation makes you feel orgasm
In a survey on women ’s masturbation , we asked for the first time whether orgasm , that is , whether it was sex with a partner or masturbation that reached sexual cum , 76 % of women said , “ The first orgasm is masturbation I have experienced it . ”
In addition to the first orgasm , there are many women who find that masturbation tends to reach orgasm rather than sex after that .
What is the reason for this ?
The reason is that in masturbation , you can stimulate your own feeling , that is , the erogenous zone , as you like .
Since sex is a partner , it may be matched with the other party ’s way and pace .
I wonder if there are many women who ca n’t say , “ Because it feels good here , do it more . ”
In addition , when I have sex , I also want to make my partner feel good , and I can not be absorbed in pursuing sexual cum , and eventually , I can not reach orgasm .
Some women are embarrassed to see their disorder in their partner .
In that respect , if you are masturbating , you can relax without worrying about the reaction of the other party , you can feel the strength you feel most at your own pace , you can pursue the pleasure of your own by adding the rhythm stimulation , so it is better than sex It ’s easy to reach orgasm .
How to improve your sensitivity with correct masturbation
Even women who have never reached orgasm or have ever experienced orgasm may be able to have sex with their partner if they increase their sensitivity with masturbation .
From here , I will explain the correct masturbation method to increase sensitivity .
Clit masturbation
Clit masturbation is the easiest masturbation for a woman to try and reach orgasm .
Do you know what the clitoris part is ?
The clitoris , also called the clitoris , is a small protrusion on the upper part of the female genital area , where the labia minora meet , which is equivalent to a penis in men .
The clitoris may be covered with skin like a male penis , so if it is difficult to find it , open your legs and gently pull up the skin at the top of the crack of the female genital area at the lower part of the pubic mound , and the tip will be slightly broken .
Make a face .
The size is about 5 to 7 mm for an adult woman , and the nerves that get sexual pleasure are densely packed in the small part , so when you are stimulated you feel sexually excited , like a male penis .
A so - called erection occurs , which is hyperemia and swelling .
The clitoris is one of the most sensitive areas of the female erogenous zone and is also a place where you can easily remember strong pleasure .
However , if you suddenly apply strong stimulation , you may feel pain .
If you know the location of the clitoris , first try to stimulate it gently .
Stimulate little by stroking from the bottom to the top with your fingertips , and when you start to feel comfortable , try scratching lightly or pinching with your Japanese finger to gradually increase the stimulation .
The clitoris expands when stimulated and becomes hard , making it easier to pinch it with your fingertips .
When that happens , next try to pinch your fingers and knead them to apply stimulation .
You may experience a sensation of tingling pleasure into a sensation of numbness , and a sensation of cramping when the clitoris squeezes , or a sensation of numbness throughout the body .
That is a clitoris orgasm .
Also called outside orgasm , it is an orgasm greeted by clitoris masturbation .

The G - spot is a small area just below the pubis and above the anterior upper part of the vaginal wall , named after the initials of the German obstetrician and gynaecologist Ernst Greenberg .
The G - spot is a part of the cavernosa of the urethra , which in males corresponds to the prostate .
The G - spot is the female ’s erogenous zone , which is the second most famous female body after the clitoris , but many people may not know where it is .
Unlike the clitoris , the G spot is hard to find because it is inside the body , and it is not a pinpoint but a coin - like area in terms of size , and the detailed location differs depending on the person .
To find the G spot , first , lie on your back , raise your knees , open your legs , and bend your middle finger gently to the navel side to insert it into the vaginal opening .
There is a rough part where the belly of the finger hits , about 3 to 5 cm from the vaginal opening where the second joint of the middle finger enters or does not enter .
This is said to be the G spot .
The way to do G - spot masturbation is to insert your finger and find the G - spot first .
When you find a rough part with your fingertips and apply stimulation by pushing it up with your finger , first you get a sensation that resembles an urge to urinate , and at the same time the amount of secretory fluid , also called love juice , increases .
If you continue to stimulate from this feeling of urination , it will become a big wave while a small wave of pleasure is repeated , and you will feel a feeling that your body is softly floating or your head is pure white .
This is what is called orgasm in G - spot or middle orgasm .
It is said that the G - spot orgasm is not a sharp sensation like a clitoris orgasm , but rather a strong sensation that slowly rises from deep inside the body and continues for a long time .
Also , in the G - spot orgasm , vaginal discharge , which is called squirting , may occur .
Since it is necessary to develop from the tips and experience in order to go to the G spot , I recommend that you continue to challenge G spot masturbation with the feeling that you develop your own erogenous zone .

Chestnut and G spot masturbation
There is also a masturbation method called both orgasms that stimulates the clitoris and G - spot at the same time and tastes the outer orgasm and the middle orgasm at the same time .
You can use one hand to stimulate the clitoris while the other hand stimulates the G - spot , or if it is difficult , you can use the adult guts that we will introduce later .
Secretion increases by first reaching the orgasm with the clitoris , and if both fingers are easily stimulated and then both are stimulated at the same time , a deeper and stronger orgasm that can enjoy both pleasures can be reached .
Portio Masturbation
Middle orgasm in women can be enjoyed not only in the G spot but also in the erotic zone called portio .
Orgasm in portio is also called Oku orgasm .
Portio is the erogenous zone near the uterine ostium in the back of a woman ’s vagina and is the part of the cervix that pops out toward the vagina .
The length of the ostium of the vagina and uterine ostium varies from person to person , so the position of the portio also varies slightly depending on the person .
To find the portio , insert the middle finger into the vaginal opening in the same way as the G spot .
The G - spot was the second joint as a guide , but Porcio is a slightly crunchy protrusion that hits the tip of the finger by inserting the finger further into the vagina .
The G spot was on the navel side , but Porcio is an image on the hip side .
When you touch it for the first time , you often feel discomfort such as dull pain , so instead of stimulating violently from the beginning , apply it slowly and slowly .
As I push the portio while swaying it with my fingertips and tapping it , I get a pleasant sensation .
Pleasure in portio is not something that rubs and stimulates like a clitoris or G - spot to create a pleasant sensation but is obtained by being pressed or poked .
It is said that the orgasm in the portio masturbation is the ultimate orgasm that even a woman who faints with fainting pleasure runs around the body repeatedly enough to spread from the top of the head to the toes of the foot .
Since it is deep inside the vagina , it is difficult to find with female fingers , but since the female body has a structure in which the uterine ostium naturally lowers when sexual excitement is felt , clitoris and It may be easier to find G by stimulating the G - spot and getting excited enough to explore Portico .
Portio , like G Spot , will rarely reach orgasm from the beginning .
You do n’t have to be intensely stimulated from the beginning , so if you develop yourself little by little while searching for the part you feel comfortable with , you will eventually experience intense orgasm .
Recommended Goods for Masturbation
Even if you are masturbating with your own fingers , if you ca n’t reach the comfortable part or if you want more stimulation , I recommend using Adult Goods .
Recently , many guts for female masturbation are sold , but people who have never used adult guts may not know which to choose .
For the masturbation you feel comfortable with , you need to choose the guts that suit your pleasure , whether you want to have a clitoris orgasm , a medium orgasm , or stimulation at the same time .
From here , we will explain the details of Adult Goods in three major categories , and also introduce the items to use sex toys more safely .
Egg Vibrator – Rotor
The rotor is generally called a pink rotor , and it is a gut that stimulates the erogenous zone with the vibration function and leads to external orgasm .
It can be used by stimulating the nipple or inserting it in the vagina , but it is often used mainly to stimulate the clitoris .
They can be purchased at low prices at love hotel vending machines , etc. , and since many are compact and compact , they can be easily carried and used .
These days , rotors are well - designed , and some are shaped like lipsticks and some are pretty like mascots .
Even people who have high hurdles to purchasing adult guts too seriously can probably buy it without any resistance as long as it is a rotor .
It is battery - powered and simple in construction , so vibration is not too violent , so it is recommended for adult guts beginners , but it may be unsatisfactory for those who seek hard stimulation .

Dildo
A dildo is a very old type of guts that looks like a male genital and is also called a dildo .
Mainly made for the purpose of middle orgasm , it is placed on the floor or held in the hand and inserted to stimulate the vagina .
If you have a suction cup , you can attach it to the wall , fix it , and insert it from the back .
As a result , some women use it to get used to body positions such as back and cowgirl .
Recently , there are things that swell and vibrate electrically , but most of them are used by moving them by themselves after inserting them , or by putting them in and out by hand .
It has the appearance and shape of male genitalia , and it feels like a real insertion when you ’re having sex .
In addition , there are various sizes , shapes , and hardness , so you can choose the dildo that suits you .
If you do n’t want your family members to listen to it , it ’s recommended because it does n’t make any noise when you use it .
However , since it looks like male genitalia , there is a feeling that it looks like Adult Goods .

Lotion & condom
Most guts are made of soft materials such as silicone so as not to hurt a woman ’s body , but when masturbating with guts , if you are not ready for your body , you will feel the pain due to friction .
You may remember .
At that time , if you apply lotion to Guts , you can reduce friction and insert it smoothly , and you may feel more comfortable with a slimy feel .
Since it is used in delicate places , it is safer to use a commercially available lotion instead of using baby oil or the like .
For those who care about the ingredients and those with sensitive skin , additive - free and safe products are also sold .
Furthermore , let ’s prepare a condom as a consumable item like lotion .
When using dildos or vibes it is hygienic to cover with a condom and it is easy to clean after using lotion .
Recently , condoms are also on sale to cover Adult Goods .
We recommend that you also purchase lotions and condoms when purchasing goodies .
Nowadays you can easily buy it on the Internet mail order site , and if it is a site dedicated to Adult Goods , it will be sent with the product name clearly stated as cosmetics and health equipment , so it is safe even if your family receives it .

Precautions when masturbating
Masturbation is the act of touching your most delicate place .
When masturbating , cut your nails short so that you do not scratch or damage your clitoris , and wash your hands to keep them clean before starting .
If your fingers are unsanitary and touch the genitals , bacteria may enter the vagina and cause vaginitis .
During your period , your sexual desire may increase due to hormone balance , and you may want to masturbate .
However , the vagina is extremely delicate during menstruation .
In particular , clean your hands and guts and take a shower before and after masturbation to prevent germs from entering .
Also , masturbation performed only with a specific posture , such as masturbation that gives too much stimulation or legs stretched out , may not be good unless it is masturbation , and it may not be good for sex with a partner .
Let ’s watch out .
Summary
In the past , masturbation was done by men , and adult guts were only for men , and only a little grotesque thing that I had only seen on porn video was sold .
Recently , however , there are many adult goods that sell stylish and pop designs for women , and you can enjoy shopping just like choosing cosmetics , and you can easily purchase them on the Internet without going to the adult shop .
AV has been created with a focus on romance elements and storylines so that women can enjoy and enjoy it , and it can be said that now is the time when women can fully enjoy their sex without being embarrassed .
Just as men and women make different bodies , masturbation for men is different from masturbation for women .
For women , masturbation is not just about satisfying sexual desire , it is an effective action that heals your mind and body and leads you to a better condition .
Masturbation is by no means shame or embarrassment .
Just like going on a trip or eating something delicious , masturbation may be a way to please your body and soul .

According to man-about - town , Robert X. Cringely , Samsung is readying not one , but two separate Android - based phones , one of which is due in September , with another model following around Christmas .
If you believe what you read ( and what his tipster says ) , these phones will not be labeled Samsung , rather they will be released as Google - branded gPhones .
The model released in the Fall will be a " higher - end " model which apparently looks " somewhat like a Blackberry Pearl " but with a screen that flips and " a keyboard for texting " ( though to be honest , that description makes little sense , as the Pearl has a keyboard ) .
The second device will be a cheaper model ( under $ 100 ) , and will likely be released after the holidays .
Of course , right now this is just speculation -- given the large gap of time between now and September , these plans could be completely rearranged or nixed altogether ... even if they are accurate .

High prices for gasoline and home heating oil are here to stay .
The U.S. is at war in the Middle East at least in part to protect its foreign oil interests .
And as China , India and other nations rapidly increase their demand for fossil fuels , future fighting over energy looms large .
In the meantime , power plants that burn coal , oil and natural gas , as well as vehicles everywhere , continue to pour millions of tons of pollutants and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere annually , threatening the planet .
Well - meaning scientists , engineers , economists and politicians have proposed various steps that could slightly reduce fossil - fuel use and emissions .
These steps are not enough .
The U.S. needs a bold plan to free itself from fossil fuels .
Our analysis convinces us that a massive switch to solar power is the logical answer .
Solar energy ’s potential is off the chart .
The energy in sunlight striking the earth for 40 minutes is equivalent to global energy consumption for a year .
The U.S. is lucky to be endowed with a vast resource ; at least 250,000 square miles of land in the Southwest alone are suitable for constructing solar power plants , and that land receives more than 4,500 quadrillion British thermal units ( Btu ) of solar radiation a year .
Converting only 2.5 percent of that radiation into electricity would match the nation ’s total energy consumption in 2006 .
To convert the country to solar power , huge tracts of land would have to be covered with photovoltaic panels and solar heating troughs .
A direct - current ( DC ) transmission backbone would also have to be erected to send that energy efficiently across the nation .
The technology is ready .
On the following pages we present a grand plan that could provide 69 percent of the U.S. ’s electricity and 35 percent of its total energy ( which includes transportation ) with solar power by 2050 .
We project that this energy could be sold to consumers at rates equivalent to today ’s rates for conventional power sources , about five cents per kilowatt - hour ( kWh ) .
If wind , biomass and geothermal sources were also developed , renewable energy could provide 100 percent of the nation ’s electricity and 90 percent of its energy by 2100 .
Actor Christopher Allport Dies in California Avalanche ( Photos )

Dog steps on gun , kills Baytown teacher 1 / 5 Back to Gallery
In a freak hunting accident , a Baytown man was killed over the weekend when his dog stepped on his loaded shotgun , triggering a discharge that penetrated his truck 's tailgate and then struck him , officials said .
Perry Alvin Price III was hunting on a lease near Stowell in Chambers County Saturday and had shot down a goose but had not seen where it landed , sheriff 's investigators said .
The 46 - year - old math teacher from Baytown 's Robert E. Lee High School then put his shotgun in the back of his truck and was about to open the tailgate to release his tracking dog when the shotgun fired , investigators said .
The blast struck Price in the thigh .
Price died from severe blood loss from his femoral artery shortly after arriving about 6:20 p.m. at Winnie Medical Center .
Price 's hunting companion and a former student , Daniel Groberg , said he tried to stop the bleeding with clothing before taking him from the hunting lease off FM 1941 .
Paw prints from Price 's beloved chocolate Labrador retriever , Arthur , were found on the muddy shotgun , said Chambers County Sheriff Joe LaRive .
" It 's the strangest case that I 've seen , " LaRive said .
" We could n't talk to Perry and Groberg was at the front of the truck when he heard the shotgun blast and did n't see what happened . "
Price 's sister speculated that the dog was anxious to begin the pursuit .
" His dog was so excited , " said Patricia Payne .
" He was jumping all around , because he was about to get out and go get that goose .
" That gun had to be knocked around just right to fire .
I believe the dog knocked the safety off and hit the trigger , too , " she said .
" Price was always so careful . "
Since the shooting , the dog and Price 's other pet , a yellow Labrador retriever , Leon , have been looking lost and sad at his Baytown home where he lives with his wife , Kelli , and his two stepchildren , Payne said .
The dogs were " like children to him , " his sister said .
His classroom at Lee is also filled with photographs of his dogs which he used to get his students ' attention , she said .
A teaching colleague , Melanie Turner , recalled how Price developed a special award this year that was indicative of his love for hunting .
For students who exhibited extra perseverance and determination , he would hand out T - shirts naming them " Bird Dog of the Week . "
" His loss will be felt for quite some time , " Turner said .
Teachers in the Goose Creek district held a moment of silence in honor of Price on Monday .
Counselors today saw students , who talked about grieving over the loss of their teacher .
Price had been a fixture on that campus for 20 years .
He graduated from Texas A&M with a civil engineering degree but chose to dedicate his life to teaching instead , his sister said .
Teaching in Baytown has been a family tradition , as not only Price but also Payne and his other sister and brother - in - law , Nancy and Andy Jacobs , teach there .
" Price was a highly respected educator , whose wonderful rapport with students was key in helping them to understand and even joy mathematics , " said Barbara Sultis , Baytown 's superintendent .
" Everyone remembers him for his smile , " said Kathy Clausen , the district 's spokeswoman .
Teachers praised his ability to help the slower learners and remembered his love of hunting .
" I always enjoyed talking to him about the outdoors , especially about his wild hog trap and his taxidermy , " said Calvin Jeffrey , another math teacher .
Sheriff LaRive said even experienced , safety - conscious hunters like Price must double check themselves when in the field .
LaRive said the safety should always be kept on any gun that is not immediately being fired and that a gun should be stored in a protected place with its barrel pointed away from people .
In October , a 37 - year - old Tama , Iowa man was shot in the leg at close range by his dog , who stepped on his shotgun and tripped the trigger .
James Harris was hit in the calf on the opening day of pheasant season .
The wound was not life - threatening .
Visitation for Price is scheduled for 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday at the Navarre Funeral Home in Baytown .

The United States is on its way to losing the war in Afghanistan .
The eventual defeat will be political not military .
Public sentiment is shifting in Europe .
The people have had enough .
They want to get out .
When European troops withdrawal from Afghanistan ; NATO will gradually unravel and the Transatlantic Alliance will collapse .
That will be a disaster for America .
The US will again be isolated by two great oceans .
But not by choice .
America 's days as an empire will be over .
That 's why the US perseveres in Afghanistan even though there is nothing to gain .
Pipelines corridors will continue to be blocked by enemy fighters for the foreseeable future .
The guerrilla war will intensify .
American fatalities will mount .
Political opposition at home will grow .
The Taliban can't be beaten .
They 've already taken over more than half the country and they are steadily advancing on the Capital .
By next spring , there 'll be fighting in the neighborhoods of Kabul , just like there is now in Baghdad .
American troops will be barricaded in little Greenzones spread across the countryside .
Karzai will be locked away in the Presidential Palace surrounded by American mercenaries .
There 'll be no more foolish talk about " democracy " and " women 's rights " .
The air war will escalate causing more and more civilian casualties .
Protests will break out in the cities and tribal leaders will call for an end to the occupation .
Politicians in Germany and France will demand a timetable for withdrawal .
Most of these things are already happening .
There 's no policy in Afghanistan and there never has been .
Reconstruction is a myth and security is non-existent .
The country is a failed , narco - state governed by warlords and drug kingpins .
Women are nearly as bad off as under the Taliban .
" Every month dozens of women commit self - immolation to end their desolation , " says Afghan Parliament member , Malalai Joya .
Bush did n't invade Afghanistan to liberate women anyway .
It was all a hoax .
Bush believed that Taliban would recognize America 's superior firepower and run for the hills .
They did .
But now they 're back .
And the tide has turned .
The Taliban have regrouped , filled their ranks with new recruits , and now they 're stronger than ever .
Morale is high .
The world 's best - equipped , high - tech war machine is being beaten by a ragtag collection of medieval - minded fundamentalists armed with muskets and sabers .
It 's a bigger fiasco than Iraq .
The war in Afghanistan , Operation Enduring Freedom , is a failure of ideology .
The Bush Doctrine , the National Security Strategy , and the New World Order are all in ruins .
The apologists for " preemption " on the op - ed pages of the Wall Street Journal have suddenly fallen silent .
They 've lost their voice .
The bravado and chest - thumping has stopped .
The Afghan resistance has succeeded where Congress , the UN and 10 million protesters failed .
They stopped Bush 's army in its tracks .
In time , the Americans will leave as did the Russians before them .
The war is lost .
Democracy does n't come from the barrel of an M - 16 and it can't be dropped from 30,000 ft like a Daisy Cutter .
The Bush war in Afghanistan has brought only suffering and devastation .
Thousands have been killed or displaced .
Vast swathes of the countryside have been contaminated with radioactive dust that collects in clouds and sweeps across the interior - plains poisoning the groundwater and spreading cancer ; another tragic memento of the US occupation that will last for decades .
Afghanistan was supposed to be " the Good War " .
Originally , 95 % of the American people supported the invasion as the proper response to the attacks of September 11 .
Liberals and conservatives alike joined the rush to war .
The world needed to see America 's iron - fisted wrath .
It was " payback time " .
Tariq
Ali called it , " A crude war of revenge " .
He was right .
The buildup to the war was all glitz and showmanship ; a real public relations extravaganza .
The media unfurled the flags and pounded the war drums every day until the Bombay - doors opened and the plumes of black smoke began rising everywhere across Afghanistan .
Bush promised to bring them back " Dead or Alive " .
We were going to " smoke them out of their caves " .
No one talks about caves anymore - or smoke .
The pre-war zeal is gone .
Vanished .
The " hearts and minds " campaign is lost , too .
" The American war on terror is a mockery and so is the US support of the present government in Afghanistan which is dominated by Northern Alliance terrorists , " says Malalai Joya .
" Far more civilians have been killed by the US military in Afghanistan than were killed in the US in the tragedy of September 11 .
More Afghan civilians have been killed by the US than were ever killed by the Taliban ..... The US should withdrawal as soon as possible .
We need liberation not occupation . "
( " The War on Terror is a Mockery " , Elsa Rassbach , Z Magazine Nov 2007 )
The Bush administration has reneged on every commitment it made to the Afghan people .
There was never any attempt to provide security beyond the capital .
Never .
The US handed over the countryside to the warlords who run their fiefdoms like Mafia Dons .
There 's no freedom .
There 's no safety .
There 's no rule of law .
It 's all a fabrication --- another made - for - TV invasion that 's 99 % fiction .
Last week the Senlis Council released a report saying that , " Afghanistan is facing a humanitarian crisis in which millions face severe hardship comparable with sub-Saharan Africa " .
The vast majority of Afghans are still living in grinding poverty exacerbated by the constant threat of violence .
Civilian casualties are soaring and the " The security situation has reached crisis proportion . "
The Senlis Report adds that the Taliban are " gaining more and more political legitimacy in the minds of the Afghan people who have a long history of shifting alliances and regime change . "
The US has worn out its welcome .
A number of independent journalists confirm that the Taliban has garnered substantial support in the South from disenchanted Afghans who 're tired of the broken promises , the lack of employment and reconstruction , and the random bombing of innocent civilians .
Last year , there were four times as many air strikes by international forces in Afghanistan than in Iraq .
The rising death toll has shocked the public and turned the people against the occupying army .
On Monday , 14 engineers and laborers were killed by NATO air strikes in Nuristan Province .
The workers , WHO WERE HIRED BY THE US MILITARY TO BUILD A ROAD THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS WERE SLEEPING IN THEIR TENTS WHEN THEY WERE KILLED .
" All of our workers have been killed " , said Sayed Jalili .
( UK Guardian )
And so it goes .
The US is steadily losing its grip while the tidal wave of resistance continues to grow .
Another year of frustration , and the European allies will " pack it in " .
NATO be damned .
Tariq
Ali explained why the United States would eventually fail in Afghanistan in a recent interview with Sherry Wolf of the Socialist Worker :
" Far from being a " good war " , Afghanistan is turning out to be a nasty , unpleasant war , and there 's no way the US or other Western forces are going to be able to stay there for too long ....
The situation is a total mess .
The US can never win that war , and the main reason is that the Afghans do n't like being occupied .
They kicked out the British in the 19th century , the Russians in the 20th century , and , now , they 're fighting against the US and its NATO allies . "
( " Afghanistan Today : six years of a war on Terror , Sherry Wolf , znet )
Yes , " they do n't like being occupied " .
It 's time to leave .

Brain cells communicate with their neighbors by sending a chemical burst from their axonal endings , across a space called the synapse , to stimulate the spine on the next cell .
If the chemical bath is strong enough , the receiving spine bulges forward  strengthening the connection between the spines .
This is thought to be the fundamental process underlying learning .
But the researchers , Christopher D. Harvey and Karel Svoboda , found something unusual when they stimulated a single spine .
Not only did the spine bulge , but it also somehow made its neighbors more sensitive to chemical signals  standing ready , in effect , to digest any spillover of information .
Imagine every neighbor on the block calling up to offer a corner of his basement for storage , just in case .
The combined effect of these helpers multiplies the capacity of any single brain cell , the authors concluded .
Neuroscientists had theorized that this effect , called clustered plasticity , might help account for the tremendous capacity of the brain , but they had not seen it in action .
“ The traditional view was that each synapse functioned independently , and the strength of individual connections modulated memory storage , ” said Mr. Harvey , a graduate student at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island .
“ What we ’ve shown is that neighboring synapses may function together , which leads to the idea that information is stored in a clustered manner , with related things concentrated in the same neighborhood . ”
The ability to watch a synapse in action is itself a scientific accomplishment .
The average human brain has about 100 billion neurons , and about 1,000 times that many synapses .
To zero in on a single one , the researchers used mice that were genetically engineered so their brains produced a fluorescent protein that glowed only in specific cells of the hippocampus .
Peering through a high - powered microscope at a slice of this tissue , the researchers could zero in on a single synapse .
Your Brain Is In 10 Kinds of Trouble
February 24 , 2008
Ever feel a little anxious ?
Here 's 10 modern mental pitfalls familiar to today 's office worker .
These problems can seem to blend into each other , but are each distinct problems , that can be attacked separately .
problems
Information overload News overload Skill reinvention Always on Interruptions and alarms Increasing expectations Multi tasking Paradox of choice Fractured time Sociopathic social overload
Information overload
There is so much information available that no human being can possibly digest it .
This concept is so familiar now that it 's almost docile in relation to the problems that follow .
Alvin Toffler first coined the term , way back in 1970 before most of you were even born .
News overload
If too much information was the only problem , then you could slowly digest it , or read summaries of it .
Eventually , throughout your lifetime , you 'd move closer to having a handle on it all .
But in fact there 's a stream of new information being added to the information overload , and the rate of new information is increasing .
Every day , regardless of how much effort you make to learn , you know an ever smaller percentage of what is knowable .
Skill reinvention
New stuff is not just meaningless gossip either .
Some of it is very deep and useful .
New technical skills are harder to absorb than news items .
By definition , you can't acquire a skill by reading about it alone .
You have to practice it , over and over , to have any hope of acquiring it .
And no sooner have you begun to master an important new technical skill , than a new technical skill is announced as The Way .
( Coping hints here )
The first three problems add up to create a classic Red Queen 's Race :
" ... it takes all the running you can do , to keep in the same place .
If you want to get somewhere else , you must run at least twice as fast as that ! "
Always on
The information , news and new skills do n't turn up at nicely scheduled times , either .
Thanks to mobile phones , blackberries , pdas , ipods , laptops and home offices , it 's possible to be voluntarily connected to the infomonster at every moment and in every place .
Consider this : evolution is a nasty business where only the fittest survive .
Yet evolution has n't cured us of the need to sleep eight hours a day .
Primative society was also rough and mean -- yet it afforded its members a day of rest each week .
Modern technology is rougher and meaner than both evolution and primative societies put together .
Work harder you damn slacker !
Interruptions and alarms
Information does n't sneak up quietly : it noisily announces itself , with alarms and popups designed to put you on edge !
IM , skype , email and all the afore mentioned ' always on ' devices are just waiting to rattle your nerves .
The layout in a Cubicle farm does nothing to limit physical / noise interruptions .
There are also car alarms , home alarms , fire alarms , smoke alarms , and many others , all equally ' important ' .
( Raganwald 's lashed out about this in the past )
Increasing expectations
Our standards increase to swallow most productivity gains .
For example ( I heard this on a gtd or .net podcast ... if anyone knows the source , please share )
Prior to the 1950's , there were no washing machines , and the avg .
household spent 6 hours per week washing clothes .
The invention of the common domestic washing machine was proclaimed to be a great liberator ... but the net effect today ?
We continue to spend 6 hours per week washing clothes , only we now do 10 times as much washing .
i.e we have cleaner clothes & more of them -- but we 're still just as much a slave of our tasks .
Similarly , producing a document today in Word 11 takes just as much time as it did in WordPerfect 1.1 -- the output should be considerably nicer , but then again , the reader is expecting a nicer output .
So what did we gain exactly ?
Apparent multi-tasking
Our operating systems support the appearance of performing more than one task at once .
We humans trick ourselves into believing we 're capable of working on more than one task at a time .
Favourite articles on this include , Human Task Switches Considered Harmful - Joel on Software and Coding Horror : The Multi-Tasking Myth .
A symptom of the previous three , is the concept of " Busy Work " -- the ability to appear busy while not actually getting anything done .
Example : checking your email .
" No one really multitasks .
You just spend less time on any one thing . "
( from ADT Article )
Sociopathic social overload
I can't even begin to explain this one .
You can talk to 150 IM buddies , send and receive a hundred emails -- complete social overload really ... and yet this can be accompanied by no real physical interaction with anyone at all , ever .
Facial expressions , body language , voice intonation , the wonders of touch ... all of this gets compressed into a couple of emoticons .
Weird .
Here 's an example from a friend of mine .
He described how his son was sitting on the couch , playing with his Nintendo DS , when he was supposed to be taking the dog for a walk .
Nothing too unusual there ... except , he was playing Nintendogs ( a virtual pet simulation ) in which he 'd created a virtual dog based on his real dog .
His real life pet ended up being returned to the pound .
Seriosly .
I think that 's a sign of something ... we 're overdue for an apocalypse I guess .
Paradox of choice
There are more options than ever before .
And even the most trivial choices require some amount of thought .
You can't opt out of all the options -- yet the cost of taking the time , choosing wisely , will often outweigh the benefit of a wise choice -- Analysis Paralysis .
Barry Schwartz is the guru who explains this best :
... we assume that more choice means better options and greater satisfaction .
But beware of excessive choice : choice overload can make you question the decisions you make before you even make them , it can set you up for unrealistically high expectations , and it can make you blame yourself for any and all failures .
In the long run , this can lead to decision - making paralysis .
And in a culture that tells us that there is no excuse for falling short of perfection when your options are limitless , too much choice can lead to clinical depression .
( from Barry 's page at Swarthmore )
Further info , Barry gave a talk at google explaining the Paradox of Choice .
He has a book called ' The Paradox of Choice : Why More Is Less ' .
( Ironically , the book is available new or used , with or without super shipping , possibly as a companion to ' The Wisdom of Crowds ' , at any one of 58 different prices , depending on who you buy from -- aaargh ! )
( Also -- there is this book " The Progress Paradox : How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse " by Gregg Easterbrook which seems to be thematically similar ... or you might want to peruse " The Era of Choice : The Ability to Choose and Its Transformation of Contemporary Life " by Edward C. Rosenthal ... personally i do n't know which one to choose ! )
I think Segal 's Law is quite relevant :
" A man with a watch knows what time it is .
A man with two watches is never sure . "
Fractured time
Everything is now available in ' Near Real Time ' -- effectively meaning that every action involves a small delay .
Rather than large delays which can be scheduled around and dealt with , we have many thousands of tiny delays , which cut up our time and give us just fractions of slack time -- a second , ten seconds , one minute , here , there and everywhere .
Click a link and wait a tiny bit .
Put food in a microwave and wait one minute .
Switch from design view to source view -- and wait a few seconds .
Compile your code , and wait a bit .
If the waits were much bigger we could schedule for them and find a use for them .
If the waits were reduced to zero seconds , then there 'd be no ' mental stack stress ' .
But instead our attention is cut to pieces by this effect , and it provides a nucleation point for distraction .
Steve McConnell touches on this concept in the blog entry , " Is Faster Always Faster ? " .
What I have n't seen investigated is the net effect of time - fracture on a person 's psychological well - being .
Okay .
Next week , let 's write about how to deal with all of this .
If we can find the time .
My book " Choose Your First Product " is available now .
It gives you 4 easy steps to find and validate a humble product idea .

Auzen X - Fi Prelude 7.1 Sound Card Did the Auzen X - Fi Prelude 7.1 live up to the hype ?
In my view , very much so !
For one thing , you get seriously excellent audio quality , rivaling that of a Creative X - Fi Elite Pro at just around US $ 200 .
Sure , you do n't get as many inputs , but the most important thing is the audio quality is just the same .
A good contender would be the EMU - 1212 M that is about the same price as the X - Fi Prelude .
It has the balanced outputs and other professional goodies that the X - Fi Prelude does not .
The Auzen X - Fi Prelude , of course , boasts the same audio quality and at the same time , add EAX and multi-channel support .
Undoubtedly , this is a superb sound card at a nice price .
It 's great for those that want a card like the Creative Sound Blaster X - Fi Elite Pro , but without its ugly breakout box .
Of course , it has its weaknesses here and there .
Nothing is perfect .
The lack of support of some formats is also somewhat disappointing , but do n't let that put you off this card .
If you 're in the market for an audiophile - grade sound card with gaming capabilities , this is the card for you .
Because of its superb audio fidelity , great connectivity options and value for money , we would like to award it our Reviewer 's Choice Award .
Congratulations , Auzentech , and keep up the great work !

spyware
( n. )
Any software that covertly gathers user information through the user 's Internet connection without his or her knowledge , usually for advertising purposes .
Spyware applications are typically bundled as a hidden component of freeware or shareware programs that can be downloaded from the Internet ; however , it should be noted that the majority of shareware and freeware applications do not come with spyware .
Once installed , the spyware monitors user activity on the Internet and transmits that information in the background to someone else .
Spyware can also gather information about e-mail addresses and even passwords and credit card numbers .
Spyware is similar to a Trojan horse in that users unwittingly install the product when they install something else .
A common way to become a victim of spyware is to download certain peer - to - peer file swapping products that are available today .
Aside from the questions of ethics and privacy , spyware steals from the user by using the computer 's memory resources and also by eating bandwidth as it sends information back to the spyware 's home base via the user 's Internet connection .
Because spyware is using memory and system resources , the applications running in the background can lead to system crashes or general system instability .
Because spyware exists as independent executable programs , they have the ability to monitor keystrokes , scan files on the hard drive , snoop other applications , such as chat programs or word processors , install other spyware programs , read cookies , change the default home page on the Web browser , consistently relaying this information back to the spyware author who will either use it for advertising / marketing purposes or sell the information to another party .
Licensing agreements that accompany software downloads sometimes warn the user that a spyware program will be installed along with the requested software , but the licensing agreements may not always be read completely because the notice of a spyware installation is often couched in obtuse , hard - to - read legal disclaimers .

Warren E. Buffett , the billionaire investor , said on Tuesday that he had offered to reinsure the municipal bond portfolios of three troubled bond guarantors but had been rebuffed by at least one of them .
Speaking on CNBC , Mr. Buffett said his new bond insurance firm , Berkshire Hathaway Assurance , was willing to reinsure as much as $ 800 billion in municipal bonds that have been insured by MBIA , the Ambac Financial Group and the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company .
Mr. Buffett ’s offer helped drive stocks higher most of the day , though share prices fell back in the final hour .
At the close , the Dow Jones industrial average was up 133.40 , to 12,373.41 , a gain of 1.1 percent , and the Standard & Poor ’s 500 stock index rose 0.7 percent .
Shares of financial companies , which might benefit from having a strong firm like Berkshire backing municipal bonds , were up 1.4 percent .
But shares of the guarantors fell as investors considered the ramifications of Mr. Buffett ’s statements on their business .
The offer would do little to alleviate the problems the companies are facing on the guarantees they have made to investors who hold securities backed by mortgages , consumer loans and other assets .
In fact , reinsuring municipal bonds with Mr. Buffett could make the guarantors more vulnerable because they would be left with the riskiest insurance contracts .

( I ) n Warren , Michigan on Monday , Huckabee declared his personal crusade to amend the Constitution by copying and pasting from the Bible :
" I have opponents in this race who do not want to change the Constitution .
But I believe it 's a lot easier to change the Constitution than it would be to change the word of the living God .
And thats what we need to do is amend the Constitution so it's in God 's standards rather than trying to change God 's standards so it lines up with some contemporary view of how we treat each other and how we treat the family . "
In case there was any remaining doubt , that astounding statement eviscerated Huckabee 's pretense of upholding the separation of church and state .
In December , Governor Huckabee offered this charade on Meet the Press , words which obviously are no longer operative :
" The key issue of real faith is that it never can be forced on someone .
And never would I want to use the government institutions to impose mine or anybody else 's faith or to restrict . "
As it turns out , using the institutions of government to impose his faith is exactly what Mike Huckabee has in mind .
Quick to denounce sharia law and " Islamofascism , " Huckabee is seems quite eager to embrace a Christian version of God 's law here at home .

Most of us want to save time and money throughout the day .
Whether your schedule is jam - packed or you just wish there were a few more hours in the day , being able to do less on your own and still get things accomplished probably sounds nice .
While time is one of the most important assets we have , money is pretty high up there as well .
If you tell someone that they can actually save time and money by doing something , you will likely grab their attention .
Nowadays , there are so many practical hacks and resources to help you save time and money .
As a working mom , I know how important it is to stay organized and find a happy medium between outsourcing and doing it yourself .
Here are 5 keys areas of your life that I recommend streamlining if you want to save some time and money .
1. Preparing Meals
This is one of the biggest time - consuming tasks for families today .
Everyone has to eat so that means that someone needs to cook and plan meals each day .
If you ’re working , taking care of kids , running errands , or pursuing a passion project , setting time aside to cook can seem like a real chore .
One thing you can start doing to save time is limit how many times you do your grocery shopping .
Instead of going every week , my family and I shop twice a month and it ’s been life - changing .
You can even order groceries with sites like Instacart or by using the Walmart Grocery pick - up service .
Be sure to plan your meals out weekly so you know exactly what you ’ll be eating .
You can also take one day out of the week to prep all your meals .
I recently started doing this and it took my 90 minutes to cook several meals and sides for the entire week .
By shopping less , planning your meals and prepping food , you ’ll save time in the kitchen throughout the week and you ’ll save money by avoiding fast food .
Make life easier using these tips to save time and money .

2. Bills and Savings
Managing your money can either be a ton of work , or it can be streamlined .
Since you know you have to pay bills anyway , set up a bill payment calendar based on the due dates and see if you can automate payments .
So long as you have a budget in place and track your spending weekly , the automatic withdrawals wo n’t come as a surprise and you wo n’t have to spend extra time planning out how you ’ll pay the bill .
Do the same with savings .
I have a few short - term savings goals like for Christmas , travel , medical bills , etc .
I set automatic transfers so I can contribute to those funds consistently each month .
By automating your bills and savings , you can avoid costly late fees and grow your savings account balance faster .
3. Chores Around the House
My family gets crazy busy throughout the week and sometimes on weekends we just want to relax and decompress .
We ’ve struggled with finding time to take care of chores and keep the house tidy in the past .
That was until I found a cool chores whiteboard chart at Target .
Using it allowed us to get organized and determine who is doing what on each day .
Everyone pitches in so it does n’t take too much time and effort from one person .
You may also want to consider hiring a cleaner if you really want to free up more time .
I know people who would charge $ 60 per cleaning for a home my size so it ’s really not that bad if we tried it once every two weeks .
You may think that hiring a cleaner means you ’ll lose money but it can free up more time to do other things like a side hustle or spend time with family .
Plus , a clean and organized house means you do n’t have to waste money rebuying things you lost or ca n’t find .
4. Exercise and Fitness
One of the biggest excuses for not being able to work out is that people claim they do n’t have time .
I get it .
We ’re all busy , but that still does n’t mean you should forego exercising and maintaining your health .
Start by putting exercise on the calendar .
Consider working out at home so you do n’t have to spend time driving to and from the gym .
You can exercise at home for free so you ’ll save money on a pricey gym membership .
There are plenty of free apps and videos that you can check out online to help you come up with a fitness routine .
Plan to exercise early in the day and stick to 30 - minute workout in the beginning .
Turn on some music or a podcast to play in the background and the time will fly by .
5. Driving / Commuting
Many people drive daily whether it involves running errands , getting to and from work , etc .
Driving has gotten particularly expensive in my state since they just raised the gas tax .
Plus , it wears on your car and unless you find commuting relaxing , it can seem like a huge time waster .
To save money in this area , consider trying public transit a few times or even asking if your employer will allow you to work from home during one day of the week .
To save time , block out a few hours each week to run all your errands in bulk so you ’re not driving back and forth to the store .
You can also consider handling a lot of your affairs online .
Nowadays , order things online , pay bills , and even manage your banking all from the computer .
These are just a few key areas of your life to streamline so you can save time and money .
I ’m sure list goes further than these things but this is a solid start .
Go through your budget and look at your schedule to see what is costing you the most time and money .
Then , develop a strategy to cut back .
' Link Iraq to Iran , ' Rumsfeld argued before proof Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday November 1 , 2007

Ten months before the US aired formal proof of Iranian involvement in funding Iraqi insurgents , then - Secretary of Defense warned in secret Pentagon memos that Iran should be the " concern of the American people " and he issued explicit instructions to the military .
" [ L]ink Iraq to Iran , " Rumsfeld wrote in one of thousands of " snowflakes " -- short memos distributed throughout the Pentagon during his tenure .
The Washington Post obtained a handful of the memos and published excerpts from them Thursday .
A newly disclosed memo , written in April 2006 as Rumsfeld faced retired generals ' calls for his resignation , tied Iran and Iraq together and claimed failure in the latter " will advantage Iran . "
The memo came as Rumsfeld was going to great lengths in public to avoid explicitly tying Iran 's government to Iraqi insurgents -- although that was precisely the impression he left .
In March 2006 , Rumsfeld and Army Gen. Peter Pace were asked about recent claims about Iranian - made weapons found in Iraq .
Did the military have any " proof " Iran 's government was fueling the insurgency ?
" I do not , " Pace acknowledged .
Rumsfeld gave a more open - ended response .
" Unless you physically see it coming in ... , you can't know it , " he said .
" All you know is that you find equipment -- weapons , explosives , whatever -- in a country that came from the neighboring country . "
The following month , when he was privately circulating the Iran - Iraq link , Rumsfeld publicly downplayed suggestions that the US was planning a military or nuclear strike against Iran .
" You know , someone comes up with an idea , runs it in a magazine or a paper ; other papers pick it up and reprint it ; editorialists then say , oh , Henny Penny , the sky is falling , and is n't -- opine on this and opine on that .
And to the extent anyone starts responding to the kinds of things that have been circulated , it 's endless , " he said , insisting that America was on a " diplomatic track " in dealing with Iran .
It would be more than a year until Vice President Dick Cheney took to the deck of an aircraft carrier floating in the Persian Gulf in an apparent effort to antagonize Iran .
And it was February of this year by the time American intelligence agencies were reported to have reached a " broad agreement " that Iran was supplying weapons to Insurgents .
The New York Times reported the assessment in February of this year , based largely on anonymous administration and intelligence sources .
It acknowledged that specious administration claims four years ago could create difficulty in paving the way to war with Iran .
" Administration officials said they recognized that intelligence failures related to prewar American claims about Iraqs weapons arsenal could make critics skeptical about the American claims , " reported Michael Gordon , the Times scribe whose by - lined accompanied Judith Miller 's on several key discredited pre-Iraq reports .
New memos reveal Rumsfeld 's PR efforts , from arguments with columnists to attempts to re-brand the ' War on Terror '
The memos also show that Rumsfeld , who left the Pentagon 's top job the day after last year 's Democratic sweep of Congress , kept a tight reign on the military 's image .
He issued a flurry of memos instructing his staff to respond to critical news reports and suggesting " bumper sticker statements " to rally public support .
He also mulled re-branding President Bush 's signature foreign policy adventure , the " Global War on Terror . "
" Rumsfeld , whose sometimes abrasive approach often alienated other Cabinet members and White House staff members , produced 20 to 60 snowflakes a day and regularly poured out his thoughts in writing as the basis for developing policy , aides said .
The memos are not classified but are marked ' for official use only , ' " reports the Washington Post which obtained a sampling of the memos Wednesday .
The memos reveal Rumsfeld was concerned about how Americans viewed the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and he suggested strategies to improve public opinion .
" Make the American people realize they are surrounded in the world by violent extremists , " Rumsfeld wrote in April of 2006 after retired generals began calling for his resignation .
He suggested that people would " rally " to sacrifice .
" They are looking for leadership .
Sacrifice = Victory . "
Rumsfeld suggested that the when the Pentagon responded to war criticism aides should " push people back , rather than just defending "
Iraq policy , and he acknowledged privately that no " terminal event " would signal an end to the fight against terrorism .
Eighteen months ago , Rumsfeld also urged military aides to begin connecting the war in Iraq to threats from Iran -- a strategy that has since become de rigueur within the Bush administration .
" Iran is the concern of the American people , and if we fail in Iraq , it will advantage Iran , " he wrote in April 2006 .
Rumsfeld also displayed concern with how the " war on terror " was being sold to the American people , and he suggested redefining the campaign as a " worldwide insurgency , " according to the Post , and he even proposed focus grouping the proposed name change .
" [ T ] est what the results could be , " if the war on terror were renamed , he advised aides .
A Pentagon spokesman accused the Post of using " selective quotations and gross mischaracterizations " from " some 20,000 " memos Rumsfeld penned as defense secretary .
Indeed , Rumsfeld 's snowflake production was prolific , and his instructions covered nearly every aspect of the Pentagon and were distributed to employees at all levels of the bureaucracy , sometimes rankling aides .
" Rumsfeld was into everyone 's business .
No one was immune , " Bob Woodward recounted last year in State of Denial , which examined the Bush war policy .
" Many in the Pentagon looked at the snowflakes as an annoyance .
Others found them intrusive and at times petty .
For some there was no way to keep up . "
According to memos obtained by the newspaper , Rumsfeld displayed an increasing concern with battling a pessimistic media that focused on missteps and setbacks in the Iraq war .
A handful of snowflakes asked aides to respond to columns in the New York Post and Philadelphia Inquirer that were critical of the war .
Rumsfeld even asked for clarification of his own assessments of the war .
" Please have someone find precisely when I said ' dead - ender ' and what the context was , " he ordered one aide in September 2006 .
Two months later , Rumsfeld 's tenure at the Pentagon reached its own dead end .

Ryanair has taken the EU short haul market by storm
The new Open Skies agreement between the European Union and the United States , which is to come into effect on 30 March , will end decades of strict regulation of transatlantic flights .
Under the agreement , any European or American airline will be allowed to fly from anywhere in Europe to anywhere in the US .
The most expensive real estate in the world is n't in Manhattan or Tokyo , it 's the space in the business class cabin
Travel writer Simon Calder
It will cancel out the privileges for long - established carriers such as British Airways , which is one of only four airlines currently enjoying the right to fly the lucrative London Heathrow to US routes .
The question is whether increased competition from the Open Skies policy will create a price war similar to that which followed the deregulation of European airspace in the 1990s .
That move ushered in the era of Ryanair and Easyjet and transformed short - haul air travel in Europe Who will benefit ?
The different nature of transatlantic aviation means that the benefits to the 50,000 people who fly daily from the UK to the US will be less evident , at least in the short term .
TRANSATLANTIC DEREGULATION
1944 : Chicago Convention sets framework for civil aviation 1946 : Bermuda deal regulates flying between US , UK 1977 : Bermuda II keeps rule that only 2 UK , 2 US carriers can fly out of Heathrow 2007 : Open Skies agreement deregulates transatlantic travel , opens the EU market to US 2010 : Open Skies II deadline to open the American domestic market to EU airlines
See the trailer
In economy , the basic cost for an airline to fly a passenger to the US is a bit more than £ 200 .
If you add taxes to that , it is clear that off - peak fares cannot drop any lower than they already are unless the price of oil falls .
Where competition can make a difference is in peak - time transatlantic fares , which are currently £ 700 or more .
With Air France , Delta , Northwest , and Continental Airlines launching new routes within days of Open Skies coming into effect , the prices of economy tickets during the summer and Christmas holidays should drop .
Bob Schumacher , senior director at Continental , looks forward to challenging the Heathrow old guard .
" We can finally take them on their own turf , " he says .
" They 've been living in a protected commercial environment for many years and at long last we can fly our flag next to theirs and the customer can choose . "
Business class competition
The real action , however , will be at the front of the cabin in business class .
Continental hopes to benefit from the changes
This is where the majority of profits are made .
British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have been able to charge more than £ 4,000 return in business class between Heathrow and JFK .
As travel writer Simon Calder points out , " the most expensive real estate in the world is n't in Manhattan or Tokyo , it 's the space in the business class cabin . "
That is a stupendous amount of cash helped by the fact that much of the competition is excluded . "
That competition has already begun in the form of several start - up airlines launching business - only services from Luton and Stansted to New York .
But Willie Walsh , the boss of British Airways , is not worried : .
" We 've seen one of these all - premium carriers [ Maxjet ] already go into bankruptcy , " he says .
" I have n't seen the latest financial figures for EOS and Silverjet , but I know from press reports that I 've read that they are not profitable at this stage .
" So it 's a difficult market for them and it's difficult because it's a competitive market . "
US rivals But with Open Skies , BA will face much stronger opposition from Air France and the American giants Continental and Delta .
As a result , business travellers can expect the airlines to vie for them by offering more choice , lower prices , and improvements in service such as the new Virgin Atlantic VIP check - in at Heathrow .
In response , BA will be launching a new business - only route to New York from London City Airport , as well as a service competing with Air France on their own turf : Paris to New York .
Long - haul budget carriers
The flurry of activity at Heathrow will also provide opportunities for budget carriers such as Zoom Airlines .
It caused a stir last summer by launching flights from Gatwick to New York for just £ 129 one - way .
Thanks to Open Skies , Zoom will be able to fly to cheaper regional airports in the US .
It will be using spare take - off slots , left behind by airlines moving to Heathrow , in order to launch budget flights to Fort Lauderdale and San Diego this spring .
That is reminiscent of the strategies of no-frills airlines within Europe .
Indeed , Simon Calder predicts that " from the traveller 's point of view , the real excitement over Open Skies is some way away .
It 's going to be when someone like Michael O'Leary from Ryanair gets involved . "

GENEVA ( Reuters ) - Myanmar ’s military rulers may have cremated bodies , including those of monks , to hide the number of those killed in their crackdown on protests earlier this year , a United Nations expert said on Friday .
Thousands of monks march through the Yangon city center as bystanders join in an anti-government demonstration September 24 , 2007 .
Over ten thousand monks marched through the streets of Yangon as tens of thousands of bystanders joined in , cheering them on with claps and prayers .
REUTERS / Adrees Latif
Paulo Sergio Pinheiro , U.N. envoy on the situation of human rights in Myanmar , was denied access to the Ye Way crematorium in Yangon during his five - day trip to the country last month .
In a report on that visit to assess the human rights fallout from the suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in September , Pinheiro cited “ very disturbing ” accounts that a large number of bodies wrapped in plastic and rice bags were burned at the Ye Way site during the nights of September 27 -30 .
“ At least one report indicates that some of the deceased being cremated had shaved heads and some had signs of serious injuries , ” he said .
Myanmar ’s Buddhist monks , who led the uprising that captured worldwide attention , traditionally have shaved heads .
In his report to the U.N. Human Rights Council , which meets next week in Geneva , Pinheiro said it was not usual for the crematorium to operate at night , and that regular staff had been told by state security officials to keep away .
Witnesses also reported seeing security forces remove dead bodies during the crackdown , the country ’s largest since 1988 , and from night raids on some monasteries .
“ Without expressing at this stage an opinion on the accuracy of these reports , careful attention should be given to this allegation as it may explain why the government has not been able , so far , to provide information on the whereabouts of a number of detainees and missing persons , ” he said .
AMMUNITION , GRENADES , BAMBOO STICKS
While the Myanmar government has said 15 people died in the protests , Pinheiro said that figure “ may greatly underestimate the reality . ”
He said he has requested information about 16 more people who died in the crackdown by army and riot police .
“ This included the use of live ammunition , rubber bullets , tear gas and smoke grenades , bamboo and wooden sticks , rubber batons and catapults ( slingshots ) , ” the report found .
It said although state forces “ showed some diligence in preventing a massacre , ” their decision “ to shoot and kill and to severely beat protesters causing death constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of life and violates the right to life . ”
Myanmar , formerly known as Burma , has suffered economic decay since its 1962 military coup despite possessing rich resources in gas , timber and mining .
Between 3,000 and 4,000 people were arrested in September and October in connection with the demonstrations , sparked after the government hiked fuel prices 500 percent .
Pinheiro estimated that between 500 and 1,000 people were still detained as of last month , in addition to the 1,150 political prisoners held prior to the demonstrations .
Pinheiro called on Myanmar authorities in his report to reveal the whereabouts of those still detained or missing , to return the remains of the dead to their families , and to give the Red Cross immediate access to all prisoners in the country , some of whom are held in difficult and degrading conditions .
He also urged the government to invite an international commission of inquiry to fully investigate reports of killings , beatings , torture and disappearances , and to assess the campaign of reprisals against monks , nuns , political activists , rights defenders and other protesters , as well as their family members .
Dan Cole checked out of his Connecticut hotel early on a Saturday morning last month and found an unwelcome surprise .
The Courtyard Marriott Hartford - Farmington had slapped him with a $ 250 charge for smoking in his nonsmoking room .
Mr. Cole is a smoker but insists he did n't light up in the room .
He got busted , he thinks , for throwing a few cigarette butts he had stowed in his pants pocket into the room 's trash .
He pleaded his case to the front desk , but the clerk refused to take off the charge .
The next day , Mr. Cole fired ...
Some nice points made by a columnist at Yahoo Finance .
I extracted the 6 points that she has mentioned and put it in here .
Hope you find them useful .
1. Understand what you can control , and what you can’t .
“ Too many investors spend time trying to predict what the market will do , where interest rates will go , or which fund manager will have the best year — things that , ultimately , they have no control over , ” says Fran Kinniry , principal in Vanguard ’s Investment Counseling and Research Department .
“ Meanwhile , they ’re not focused on the things they can control , such as keeping their investment costs down ; maintaining a proper , balanced , tax - efficient portfolio ; and taking maximum advantage of savings opportunities , such as an employer match in a 401 ( k ) , ” Kinniry says .
“ Understanding and acting on the things you can control is the best way to prepare for long - term investment success . ”
2 . You know more than you think .
“ Do n’t believe you ca n’t learn enough to be a savvy investor , ” says Karen Sheridan , founder of Money Mystique Asset Management in Lake Oswego , Ore .
“ You know more than you think you know .
[ Financial services company ]
State Street had an ad in the New York Times that actually compared investing to brain surgery .
It says , ‘ No one ever said investing was easy .
Make one false move and you could start hemorrhaging money . ’
Ads like these are unconscionable . ”
3 . Moonlight when you ’re young , and invest the income .
“ Take on a second source of income and direct that income exclusively toward an investment vehicle , ” says Robert Manning , director of the Center for Consumer Finances at the Rochester Institute of Technology , and author of “ Credit Card Nation : The Consequences of America ’s Addiction to Credit . ”
Whether it ’s freelance data - entry work or waiting tables once a week , invest the extra cash rather than spending it , or even paying off debt .
“ It ’s a step up psychologically to make yourself part of investor class rather than the debtor class , ” Manning says .
“ It ’s a huge opportunity to demonstrate that you ’re taking control of your financial life , even though you ’re not making much money . ”
4 . Take a small step toward big success .
“ Sometimes , clients are overwhelmed with financial tasks and expect perfection of themselves , ” says Candace Bahr , managing partner at Bahr Investment Group .
“ They may get ‘ stuck ’ for months or even years , and ignore their financial lives . ”
Bahr says that even the smallest step can make a difference .
“ If someone spends just 15 minutes a day on their financial well - being , in the course of a year they ’ll have spent over two full work weeks improving their financial life .
That ’s got to help ! ”
Bahr suggests other small steps on her Money Clubs web site .
5. Consider a tax - managed fund .
The average equity mutual fund lost 1.8 percent a year to taxes over a 10 - year period ending Dec. 31 , 2005 , according to a study conducted by Morningstar .
Sound small ?
It ’s actually a difference of nearly 20 percent in terms of total annual return .
Over the long haul , losing 20 percent of your gain each year to taxes can translate into a loss of tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars .
One solution : tax - managed funds .
“ These funds come in various permutations — and not all are good — but they can be immensely useful tools for investors , ” says Christine Benz , Morningstar ’s Director of Mutual Fund Analysis .
Such funds , which come in many investment categories , employ a variety of tax - reduction techniques to avoid making income or capital - gains payouts , helping the investor keep a bigger portion of his or her return .
( Do n’t choose these funds within a tax - advantaged vehicle like a 401 ( k ) . )
For higher - income savers who max out their company retirement plans , there are n’t many other ways to shield investments from taxes .
Individual Retirement Account contributions limits are low ( or an investor ’s income may make him ineligible to contribute to a Roth IRA ) .
For an investor who wants to build an ultra-low - maintenance portfolio composed exclusively of tax - managed funds , Benz recommends Vanguard Tax - Managed Capital Appreciation ( VMCAX ) , Vanguard Tax - Managed International ( VTMGX ) , one of the firm ’s municipal - bond funds , and a municipal money market fund .
6 . Do n’t shift your assets to your minor child .
“ The Uniform Transfers to Minors Act ( UTMA ) is the newest four - letter word , ” says Joe Hurley , founder and CEO of Savingforcollege.com .
“ A small investment fund in your child ’s or grandchild ’s name is probably fine — you may save some taxes by shifting the investment income onto your child ’s tax return .
But put too much money into the UTMA and you are asking for trouble . ”
The potential savings are limited now that the kiddie tax has been expanded to children under the age of 18 ( the cut - off used to be age 14 ) .
Even if the child ’s account stays below the $ 1,700 income threshold for triggering the tax , earnings beyond $ 850 require the headache of filing a federal income tax return .
“ You might devise a strategy using tax - efficient mutual funds that keeps the kiddie tax at bay , ” says Hurley .
“ But the capital gains at some point come home to roost , and the tax hit may happen at the wrong time . ”
Moreover , investments in a child ’s name are counted heavily against financial aid eligibility .
Most importantly , a parent loses custodial control over a UTMA when the child reaches age 18 or 21 .
“ You do n’t have to look too hard to find parents who have regretted their children ’s decisions regarding the use of such newfound ‘ wealth , ' ” Hurley says .

" In my home county of Wake County , North Carolina " , Scott " Malone " wrote in , " when you request library books from another branch , an automated telephone system will call you back when the books arrive at your local branch .
However , whenever my wife reserves books , the telephone system calls up and lets ' Suzanne the 1000th Malone ' know her books are ready . "
The messages sounded just like this : suzanne1000.mp3 .
Or , if you can't listen to that message :
This is the Wake County Public Library .
Suzanne , the 1000th , Malone , you have materials waiting for you at the Cameron Village branch .
They will remain on hold for three days before returning to circulation .
Thank you , and have a good day .
Scott continued , " This has been going on for years and it had simply been an inside joke for us .
Who knows , there must have been 999 other Suzanne Malones in Wake County . "
" However , after a nine year hiatus , I actually stepped foot in the library .
Suzanne the 1000th Malone had forgotten to return some books and the automated system was calling daily , counting down the days until it was going to send out the automated goons to collect . "
" While returning the late books and paying my $ 8 fine , I asked the librarian why the automated telephone system referred to my wife as Suzanne The 1000th Malone .
She looks at the entry in her database and everything looks fine :
Name : Suzanne M. Malone
" Now if you look at that for a minute , you will see the reason for one of the most absurd software bugs I have ever encountered .
Yes , ' M ' ( her middle name is Marie ) is 1000 in Roman numerals .
I guess if my name were ' Pope John Paul IV ' , then I would want the system to interpret Roman numerals .
Of course interpreting Roman numerals in the person 's middle name or something on the order of ' M ' , is just plain stupid .
" I guess all those poor saps out there whose middle initial are I , V , L , X , C , D or M have their own inside jokes too .
Note : Scott & Suzanne 's last name was changed ( and the message re-recorded via AT&T TTS ) to protect the innocent .
DES MOINES , Iowa ( Reuters ) - Americans criticized a White House plan to help troubled homeowners as both too little and too much on Thursday , split over whether borrowers and lenders should be rescued in a bid to avert a U.S. recession .

“ It ’s not the government ’s problem .
People got into this with the help of the banks and they overbought , most likely , and now we ’re seeing the bailout , ” said Gene Kaberline , 57 , a Republican who has just moved to Iowa from California .
But Democrat Sue Repplinger , 66 , who worked years ago in the real estate industry but is now retired , said the plan unveiled by President George W. Bush came too late for many borrowers whose homes have already been foreclosed .
“ Those who played by the rules who have already lost their homes , what about them ? ” asked Repplinger .
“ We need a broader package than this .
This is affecting the entire economy . ”
The government ’s plan , worked out with private lenders , would allow some borrowers with interest rates that are slated to rise sharply in the coming months to either refinance the loan or have their current rate frozen for five years .
But because the program is designed to help only those whose mortgage rates are set to adjust after January 1 -- and will not be available to those who have already fallen behind on their payments -- some homeowners will be left out .
“ I was expecting a broader outreach .
Why ca n’t the plan extend out to people like me ? ” asked Maryanne Hernandez , who bought her home in southern California in 2003 with an adjustable rate , sub - prime mortgage .
Hernandez and her husband , who have two children , were left scrambling when their adjustable rate began rising in 2006 , They are now four months behind in payments and their neighborhood is full of foreclosed homes .
“ A lot of people will benefit from the plan but it wo n’t help everybody that needs help .
It wo n’t help me , ” she said .
FEELING MISLED
California single mother Maricela Vargas , 41 , also wo n’t qualify .
She is one of many borrowers who feel they were misled by lenders into signing unfair loans .
“ There are a lot of women like me who trusted people to do this paperwork , people that seemed to be honest .
They charged more than they should .
It ’s my fault , but it ’s not all my fault , ” said Vargas , who is $ 9,000 behind in payments .
“ I ’ve been making calls for months , I called here , I called there .
No one knows how to help . ”
The timing of Bush ’s announcement , which comes less than a month before the midwestern state of Iowa kicks off voting for the November 2008 presidential election , was also criticized .
University of Maryland School of Business analyst Peter Morici said the aid program only delays inevitable pain .
“ Freezing adjustable mortgages at teaser rates will only push the problem to the next president , ” Morici said .
Supporters of the plan say that without help for troubled homeowners there will be a knock - on effect hitting every part of the economy , from consumer spending to job losses .
But others said the program goes too far , rewarding irresponsible borrowers and lenders who got greedy during the five - year housing boom that ended in 2005 .
Phoenix dentist Lawrence Freedman , 45 , had a mixed view of the package , which he said would only “ support a system that clearly was n’t working . ”
“ It will probably ease the carnage , but was it a smart move ?
Absolutely not .
I think the chips should have been left to fall where they may . ”
Kansas mother of three Becca Dopheide , was also skeptical , saying some borrowers deserved the help but others did not .
“ People go into loans with variable interest rates and balloons and all that stuff ... but they do n’t worry about it because they just want what they want , ” said Dopheide , 39 .
“ That bothers me that they ’re getting a bailout .
It is n’t going to help enough people and is n’t going to help the right people . ”
The Irish government says there is evidence of " citizenship tourism "
With tallying completed in all 34 counting centres , 79.17 % of voters wanted to end the automatic citizenship right for all babies born in Ireland .
The government said change was needed because foreign women were travelling to Ireland to give birth in order to get an EU passport for their babies .
Ireland has been the only EU country to grant such a right .
The poll results showed that 20.83 % of voters rejected the proposed changes .
The turnout was 59.95 % .
Voters were making their decision on the constitutional issue at the same time as they elected MEPs to the European Union 's parliament .
To be approved , the government 's referendum on a constitutional amendment requires only a simple majority .
The amendment will allow the government to pass a bill that would allow Irish - born children to receive automatic citizenship only if at least one parent is Irish or if parents have been resident in Ireland for at least three years .
Delicate issue
Ireland 's Justice Minister Michael McDowell said there was evidence of what he termed " citizenship tourism " .
The government says the law , as it stands , provides a loophole that is being exploited .
Opponents - including political parties such as the Labour Party , Sinn Fein and the Greens - see the situation differently .
They say the government is playing politics with the delicate issue of race and immigration .
Critics believe there is no reason to hold a referendum on this matter and say the numbers of women coming to Ireland to give birth is so small that it does not warrant a poll .

Bucking the industry trend towards Hydrogen fuel cells , Subaru has released a vastly improved second cut at a plug - in a battery - electric commuter car .
The 65 - kilowatt , 5 - seater G4e ’s new high energy - density lithium - ion batteries give it a 200 km range from a charge ( more than double the previous R1e ’s range ) and using a quick - charger it can be topped up to 80 % in only 15 minutes .
The new Subaru ’s stats make it an instantly viable commuter , while underlining the exciting potential this fledgling sector will offer .
With 40 units of Subaru ’s older EV R1e battery - electric vehicle already out and being evaluated by TEPCO ’s regional sales team and local government officials , Subaru has announced the arrival of an updated 5 - door version with more than twice the range thanks to advances in lithium - ion battery technology .
The G4e ( which apparently stands for “ Good 4 Earth ” ) has a 65 kw maintenance - free electric motor .
The aerodynamically - efficient exterior helps to get the most from the battery pack , which is located under the floor of the vehicle to keep a low , stable center of gravity .
Range and charging times are the current bugbears of plug - in battery - electric vehicles , and Subaru has taken a strong step forward in this area .
Using a new high - capacity vanadium battery material , they are able to load two to three times more lithium ions onto the positive battery terminal , resulting in an energy density about double what was possible on the previous model .
A normal full charge requires nothing more than a power point and takes around 8 hours to reach full capacity , which will deliver around 200 km of normal driving .
Subaru has also developed a quick - charger that would allow the battery to be brought up to 80 % charge in around 15 minutes .
The company envisages that such quick - chargers could be easily located in carparks outside supermarkets and other public facilities .
Either way , energy per mile is a lot cheaper than gasoline – as low as a tenth of the price if using off - peak overnight rates .
With snappy looks that stick it straight in the middle of the compact car segment , the G4e does n’t have the outrageous looks of many concept cars – this is encouraging , as it shows the company might be looking seriously at a production version not too far down the track .
And as battery technology seems to be advancing at a rate of knots , and these concepts already look more than viable for the majority of commuters , we wonder how long until something like it does hit the showroom of a major manufacturer .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?

The enduring image of a British picket line is one of men in donkey jackets huddled around a fire on a rusty brazier .
But pictures from the writers ' strike in the US show a very different practice - the picketers are on the move , often walking round in circles while holding their placards .
The tradition is a source of amusement for one of the striking writers , Eric Stangel .
THE ANSWER
They walk to avoid breaking state laws governing the obstruction of buildings
It 's not a ritual peculiar to screenwriters - all US pickets walk in circles .
There 's a cultural reason for the moving picket line , says Sherry Goldman , spokeswoman for the Writers Guild of America .
" They walk back and forth because they are picketing a company so they walk up and down in front of the entrance , " she says .
" It 's not necessarily a circle , sometimes it could be an oval or just walking up , turning round and coming back . "
UK picket lines are less mobile
There is also a legal dimension , says Pete Hoefer , who teaches at the National Labor College in Maryland .
And it 's about complying with laws existing at state level that prohibit blocking entry and exit to buildings .
Donald Oliver , a partner in the law firm of Blitman & King , which represents labour organisations in New York state , picks up the theme .
" I believe that the reason that picketers walk either in a circle or patrol back and forth is so that they can permissibly walk in front of a gate or entrance of a picketed establishment without blocking or impeding ingress or egress , which is prohibited by law . "
Picket or parade ?
But there is also a practical reason , which is that picketers can more effectively convey their message while on the move , Mr Oliver adds , rather than standing to one side next to a brazier ( which , even in January , would be a little excessive in Los Angeles ) .
And being on the move makes crossing the picket line all the harder .
Dave Keefe , a lecturer in US law , says walking in circles could be more a matter of style or expedience than law .
" It appears that picketers ' claims of ' passage ' were swept aside early on in favour of judicial attempts to strike a balance between the right of free speech and expression , protected by the first amendment , on the one hand , versus the rights of those affected by protests on the other . "
So picketing is restricted outside places such as abortion clinics and polling booths .
There could also be the consideration that walking in a straight line constitutes a parade , says Professor Peter Ling of the School of American Studies at the University of Nottingham .
And that requires a permit in many parts of the US .

A US official in Washington says a charred body has been found in the US embassy in Belgrade , which was attacked and set on fire this morning by Serb rioters protesting at Kosovo 's declaration of independence .
US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said that all American personnel at the embassy had been accounted for and there was nothing to suggest the body was an embassy employee .
Mr McCormack could not say that all embassy personnel who were not US citizens were accounted for .
William Wanland , a spokesman for the US Embassy in Belgrade , told CNN the body appeared to have been a protester .
" It appeared to have been a protester who was caught in the fire , " he said , adding the death had not been caused by any interaction with US security forces at the embassy .
Mr Wanland said about 70 American diplomats served in the Belgrade embassy .
The US ambassador to the United Nations says he 's " outraged " at the actions of the rioters .
The storming of the US embassy came during a state - backed rally to protest at Kosovo 's secession attended by around 200,000 people , which was otherwise peaceful .
Some rooms at the embassy were set on fire .
Police were not protecting the building , which had been closed and boarded up after rioters stoned it earlier in the week .
Black smoke billowed out of the embassy .
Papers and chairs were thrown out of the windows , with doors wedged in the window frames and burning .
One protester climbed up to the first floor of the building , ripped the Stars and Stripes off its pole and briefly put up a Serbian flag in its place .
Some protesters jumped up and down on the embassy balcony , holding up a Serbian flag as the crowd below of about 1,000 people cheered them on , shouting " Serbia , Serbia " .
The rioters were mainly young men , some of whom wore balaclavas and scarves to hide their faces .
They had attacked the building with sticks and metal bars and destroyed two guard boxes outside .
Protesters ripped some metal grilles from the embassy windows and also tore a handrail off the building 's entrance and used it as a battering ram against the main door .

One of Hollywood 's biggest foes is about to be called on the carpet .
After years of steering Web surfers to free entertainment , the organizers of a massive directory of pirated movies , music and software in Sweden could finally face serious legal repercussions .
Based on evidence collected in a 2006 raid on the offices of The Pirate Bay , Swedish prosecutors say that by the end of January they expect to charge the individuals who operate the file - sharing service with conspiracy to breach copyrights .

Mr. Ofer has his eye on China , with its increasing car penetration , oil consumption and environmental pollution , where he has interest from a Chinese car company , Chery , for a similar joint venture .
Renault will offer a small number of electric models of existing vehicles , like the Megane sedan , at prices roughly comparable to gasoline models .
The batteries will come from Mr. Agassi .
The tax breaks for “ clean ” electric vehicles , which Israel promises to keep until at least 2015 , will make the cars cheaper to consumers than gasoline - engine cars .
“ You ’ll be able to get a nice , high - end car at a price roughly half that of the gasoline model today , ” Mr. Agassi said .
He contends that operating expenses will be half of those for gasoline - driven vehicles , especially in Europe and Israel , where gasoline taxes are high .
The company , and the consumers who use it , will normally recharge their batteries at night , when the electricity is cheapest , and they expect the batteries to have a life of 7,000 charges , though Mr. Agassi says he is counting on only 1,500 charges , which is roughly 150,000 miles , the life of the average car .
“ Because the price of gasoline fluctuates so much during the life of a car , it ’s hard to predict the cost basis for driving , ” Mr. Agassi said .
“ But electricity fluctuates less , and you can buy it in advance , so I can give you a guaranteed price per mile , cheaper than the price of gas today . ”
Mr. Agassi predicts that a few thousand electric cars will be on Israeli roads in 2009 and 100,000 by the end of 2010 ; Israel has two million cars on the road , and about 10 percent are replaced each year .
Mr. Agassi suggested this model for the electric car  concentrating on infrastructure rather than on car production  at a 2006 meeting of the Saban Forum of the Brookings Institution , which Mr. Peres attended .
He was enthralled by the idea .
Mr. Peres , who is sometimes dismissed as a dreamer by more cynical Israelis , has in the past embraced and helped to develop some successful notions  like Israel ’s nuclear weapons program .
He is a strong believer in Israel ’s mission to better the world , he says , and not simply sell arms to it .
Israel is the 11th - largest arms exporter , as measured by dollar sales , according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute .
Sadly , my own national team , Northern Ireland , has n’t reached the finals since 1982 .
Football ( or soccer for North Americans and Australians ) holds a World Cup every four years .
Sadly , my own national team , Northern Ireland , has n’t reached the finals since 1982 , and despite the recent goal - scoring feats of David Healy , does n’t look like doing so anytime soon .
Tears aside , here ’s the first in a series of posts featuring sport logos , this time showcasing World Cup logos from Brazil in 1950 to South Africa in 2010 .
I ’ve added a little trivia for the football buffs .
Brazil 1950 logo
The 1950 World Cup was the first to include British participants .
British teams withdrew from FIFA in 1920 , partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with , and partly as a protest against a foreign influence on football .
FINAL SCORE : Uruguay 2 - 1 Brazil ( there was no actual final this year , and the tournament was decided by a round - robin between four teams , with this match considered the decisive result to crown Uruguay world champions )
Switzerland 1954 logo
The World Cup was first televised in 1954 and is now the most widely - viewed and followed sporting event in the world , exceeding even the Olympic Games .
The cumulative audience of the 2006 World Cup ( including all of the matches ) is estimated to be 26.29 billion .
715.1 million individuals watched the final match of this tournament ( a ninth of the entire population of the planet ) .
FINAL SCORE : West Germany 3 - 2 Hungary
Sweden 1958 logo
This tournament was won by Brazil , who beat Sweden 5 - 2 in the final for their first title .
The World Cup marked the debut on the world stage of 17 - year - old Pelé , who would grow to be considered by many the greatest footballer of all time .
FINAL SCORE : Brazil 5 - 2 Sweden
Chile 1962 logo
The competition was marred by overly defensive and often violent tactics .
This poisonous atmosphere culminated in the infamous first - round match between host nation Chile and Italy ( 2 - 0 ) , known as the Battle of Santiago .
Two Italian journalists had written unflattering articles about the host country .
Although only two players ( both of them Italian ) were sent off by the overly weak English referee Ken Aston , the match saw repeated , deliberate attempts from players on both sides to harm opponents , and the Italian team needed police protection to leave the field in safety .
FINAL SCORE : Brazil 3 - 1 Czechoslovakia
England 1966 logo
London ’s Wembley Stadium provided the venue for the final , and 98,000 people crammed inside to watch England take on West Germany .
BBC commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme ’s description of the match ’s closing moments has gone down in history , “ Some people are on the pitch .
They think it ’s all over . ”
( Geoff Hurst scores his third to make it 4 - 2 ) “ It is now ! ” .
FINAL SCORE : England 4 - 2 West Germany ( after extra-time )
Mexico 1970 logo
The Brazilian team , featuring the likes of Pelé ( who was in his fourth and final World Cup ) , Carlos Alberto , Clodoaldo , Gérson , Jairzinho , Rivelino , and Tostão , is usually regarded as the greatest attacking World Cup team ever .
This tournament is still considered by many fans to be the finest World Cup in history .
FINAL SCORE : Brazil 4 - 1 Italy
West Germany 1974 logo
Ninety - eight countries took part in the qualifying tournament , and as usual there were some high - profile failures on the road to the finals .
England were among them , having lost out to Poland in their qualifying group .
France , Spain and Hungary also failed to reach the finals .
FINAL SCORE : West Germany 2 - 1 Netherlands
Argentina 1978 logo
A controversial fact surrounding the 1978 World Cup was that Argentina had suffered a military coup only two years before the cup .
Because of this , some countries , most notably the Netherlands , considered publicly whether they should participate in the cup .
Despite this , all teams eventually participated without restrictions although the Dutch team attended without its star , Johan Cruijff , who refused to participate .
FINAL SCORE : Argentina 3 - 1 Netherlands ( after extra-time )
Spain 1982 logo
There was a controversial match between West Germany and Austria in the group stages .
Both teams knew that a West German win by 1 or 2 goals would qualify them both , while a larger German victory would qualify Algeria over Austria , and a draw or an Austrian win would eliminate the Germans .
After 10 minutes of furious attack , Germany succeeded in scoring through a goal by Horst Hrubesch .
After the goal was scored , the two German - speaking teams went into an unspoken agreement and just kicked the ball around aimlessly for the rest of the match .
Chants of “ Fuera , fuera ” ( “ Out , out ” ) were screamed by the appalled Spanish crowd , while angry Algerian supporters waved banknotes at the players .
This sham performance was widely deplored , even by the German and Austrian fans who had hoped for a hot rematch of the 1978 FIFA World Cup match in which Austria had beaten West Germany .
One German fan was so upset by his team ’s display that he burnt his German flag in disgust .
As a result of the outcome , FIFA introduced a revised qualification system at subsequent World Cups in which the final two games in each group were played simultaneously .
FINAL SCORE : Italy 3 - 1
West Germany ( Northern Ireland managed to beat host nation Spain 1 - 0 in the group stages – a very proud moment , even though I was only three years old )
Mexico 1986 logo
Colombia was originally chosen as hosts by FIFA .
However , the Colombian authorities declared in November 1982 that they could not afford to host the World Cup under the terms that FIFA demanded .
Mexico was selected on May 20 , 1983 as the replacement hosts , beating the bids of Canada , and the United States ( who eventually hosted the 1994 World Cup ) , and became the first nation to host two World Cups .
This second World Cup in Mexico came only 16 years after the first one in 1970 .
FINAL SCORE : Argentina 3 - 2 West Germany
Italy 1990 logo
With its third title ( and three second place finishes )
West Germany became the most successful World Cup nation for four years , until Brazil won their fourth title in 1994 .
West German team manager Franz Beckenbauer became the second footballer , after Mário Zagallo of Brazil , to win the World Cup as a player ( in 1974 ) and as team manager .
In doing so , Beckenbauer also became the first captain of a winning team to later manage a winning squad .
Italy ’s Salvatore Schillaci won both the Golden Boot as the tournament ’s top goalscorer , with six goals , and the Golden Ball as the tournament ’s best player .
FINAL SCORE : West Germany 1 - 0 Argentina
USA 1994 logo
The average stadium attendance for the tournament was 69,000 while the total attendance was 3.6 million .
The 1994 World Cup holds the record for the highest attendance in World Cup history .
It was also the highest - attended single sport sporting event in United States history .
FINAL SCORE : Brazil 0 - 0 Italy ( Brazil win 3 - 2 on penalties )
France 1998 logo
For the first time ever , the final featured the host nation and the defending champions .
Zinedine Zidane scored two headers from corners in the 26th minute and in first half stoppage time respectively , and Emmanuel Petit added a late goal in second half stoppage time to give France a 3 - 0 win over Brazil .
Brazil ’s star player Ronaldo played poorly , having a mysterious fit the night before and many questioned his reinstatement in the starting lineup .
An estimated one million people took to the Paris streets to celebrate through the night .
France became the seventh world champions , joining Uruguay , Italy , Germany , Brazil , England and Argentina .
FINAL SCORE : France 3 - 0 Brazil
Korea Japan 2002 logo
For the first time in its history , the World Cup was organized by two countries .
It was also the first World Cup held in Asia , and the first held outside South America , Europe , and North America .
South Korea and Japan each provided ten stadia , the vast majority of them newly built for the tournament .
FINAL SCORE : Brazil 2 - 0 Germany
Germany 2006 logo
Teams representing 198 national football associations from all six populated continents participated in the qualification process which began in September 2003 .
Thirty - one teams qualified from this process , along with the host nation , Germany , for the finals tournament .
FINAL SCORE : Italy 1 - 1 France ( Italy win 5 - 3 on penalties )
South Africa 2010 logo
Several non-governmental organisations and poor people ’s movements have expressed major concern about plans to regulate the prevalence of squatter camp shelters to improve the image of the World Cup venues .
Concerns are particularly acute in Durban where local politicians have promised to ‘ clear the slums by 2010 ’ .
It has also been argued that it is inappropriate to invest so much public money on stadia when much of the population lacks basic services and housing .
Voting for the official World Cup poster was opened to the public , and I was pleased to see the second option was chosen .
Proposed FINAL SCORE : Northern Ireland 5 - 0 Brazil ( Airey becomes the first player to score 5 goals in a final )
My favourites
Mexico 70 get the thumbs - up .
Simple and stylish , albeit obvious .
The type treatment is n’t good at small sizes .
Choosing a favourite was almost as difficult as choosing my least favourite , because there is n’t a design that really stands out amongst the rest .
Germany 06 gets the thumbs - down .
Design by committee gone horribly wrong .
“ Put this here .
Add that .
Do n’t forget the … ”
It was n’t easy choosing the worst design , as there are quite a few I do n’t like .
Some would even be better used as posters than logos , and I guess this was in the thinking during the design stage .
If you know of any further info on each design , I ’d appreciate you leaving a comment .
What ’s your favourite ?
I am still not clear how 8 cores is particularly useful for any one application .
In a virtual environment ( servers ) , it makes sense since you have a dozen different virtual machines accessing the CPU .
But , in a personal system used for a single game , or maybe a couple of applications ?
Seems like a complete waste .

Find­ing Alzheimer ’s ( Mind­Hacks )
- “ Researchers are increas­ing­ly talk­ing about ‘ cog­ni­tive reserve ’ , a mea­sure of ‘ wear and tear ’ or ‘ fit­ness ’ of the brain , with the idea that the dis­ease hap­pens where var­i­ous fac­tors tip the brain ‘ over the thresh­old ’ into phys­i­cal decline . ”
Build Your Cog­ni­tive Reserve - Yaakov Stern ( our inter­view with a lead­ing Cog­ni­tive Reserve researcher )
- “ The con­cept of a Cog­ni­tive Reserve has been around since 1989 , when a post mortem analy­sis of 137 peo­ple with Alzheimer ’s Dis­ease showed that some patients exhib­it­ed few­er clin­i­cal symp­toms than their actu­al pathol­o­gy sug­gest­ed .
These patients also showed high­er brain weights and greater num­ber of neu­rons when com­pared to age - matched con­trols .
The inves­ti­ga­tors hypoth­e­sized that the patients had a larg­er “ reserve ” of neu­rons and abil­i­ties that enable them to off­set the loss­es caused by Alzheimer ’s .
Since then , the con­cept of Cog­ni­tive Reserve has been defined as the abil­i­ty of an indi­vid­ual to tol­er­ate pro­gres­sive brain pathol­o­gy with­out demon­strat­ing clin­i­cal cog­ni­tive symp­toms . ” - AF ( Alvaro Fer­nan­dez ) : … let ’s now fast for­ward , say , 60 years from our high - school years , and sup­pose that per­sons A and B both tech­ni­cal­ly have Alzheimer ’s ( plaques and tan­gles appear in the brain ) , but only A is show­ing the dis­ease symp­toms .
What may explain this dis­crep­an­cy ?
- YS ( Yaakov Stern ) : Indi­vid­u­als who lead men­tal­ly stim­u­lat­ing lives , through edu­ca­tion , occu­pa­tion and leisure activ­i­ties , have reduced risk of devel­op­ing Alzheimer ’s .
Stud­ies sug­gest that they have 35 – 40 % less risk of man­i­fest­ing the dis­ease .
The pathol­o­gy will still occur , but they are able to cope with it bet­ter .
Some wo n’t ever be diag­nosed with Alzheimer ’s because they do n’t present any symp­toms .
In stud­ies that fol­low healthy elders over time and then get autop­sies , up to 20 % of peo­ple who did not present any sig­nif­i­cant prob­lem in the dai­ly lives have full blown Alzheimer ’s pathol­o­gy in their brains .
Food for thought for our New Year Res­o­lu­tions : we can only expect bet­ter tests in the future to detect Mild Cog­ni­tive Impair­ment and Alzheimer ’s .
We will also see good drugs to help delay or per­haps ful­ly pre­vent the dis­ease .
Now , the good news TODAY is that there is no need to wait for tomor­row to reduce the risk of devel­op­ing Alzheimer ’s symp­toms .
We can do so via our very own , side - effect free , lifestyle options regard­ing nutri­tion , phys­i­cal and men­tal exer­cise , and stress man­age­ment .

Just last week Bush vetoed $ 35 billion for sick children , but now he needs $ 46 billion more for the occupation in Iraq .
" The Iraq war is now costing $ 330 million a day .
That could pay for 1700 more border patrol agents , or provide health - care for an extra 45,000 military veterans , or the funds from just one day in Iraq would give 270,000 more kids coverage under SCHIP . "
On Wed the House will have another hearing on the long - term cost of the war .
The last time the figure was $ 1 trillion and it's a no - brainer the new figure is going to be much higher .
Jack Cafferty : " I 've got a quick question Wolf .

Wolf Blitzer : The United States Congress Jack Cafferty :
Oh yeah .
right .
Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi and those Democrats who were elected to do something about the war .
I forgot .
Also , surprise !

Gaza City
Saturday January 19 , 2008
Moin al - Wadia lay on his hospital bed beneath a window yesterday , soaking up the last of the day 's winter sunshine .
Around him sat his family , with boxes of sweet pastries and bouquets of flowers , as they tried to explain the growing anger and frustration of the people of Gaza .
Wadia had been working at a mechanics ' market on Tuesday morning when the Israeli military launched a major ground incursion , beginning a new round of intense fighting in Gaza .
When he heard the sound of gunfire , Wadia began to leave but was knocked to the ground by the force of an Israeli shell .
It sliced off his left foot , shattered his right leg and shrapnel lacerated his stomach .
Doctors at the Shifa hospital have told him his best chance for any kind of recovery is to leave for treatment abroad , perhaps in Jordan .
But Israel closed the crossings into Gaza yesterday and prevented even UN trucks from delivering food aid .
It was the latest stage in an intensified Israeli operation in Gaza , but one which now effectively prevents food assistance coming in and people and exports going out .
The UN refugee agency said the latest closure left it unable to deliver 15 truckloads of aid yesterday and warned of growing despair in Gaza , where 80 % of the population already relies on UN food .
" It is my right to live and for my wife and children to live , " Wadia said .
" But the ordinary people are getting lost in this dispute .
Of course we have to stop these rockets .
Only a peace agreement can put an end to this violence and destruction . "
His wife , Wassima , said : " We just do n't know what is happening .
People talk about peace , but we see the opposite . "
Last night the Gaza death toll over the past four days stood at 34 , among them at least 10 civilians .
An Israeli warplane bombed the offices of the Palestinian interior ministry yesterday , flattening one wing of the empty building , killing a woman attending a wedding party next door and wounding at least 46 other civilians , some of them children playing football in the street , hospital staff said .
Yesterday , Israel sealed all border crossings with the Gaza Strip , in an attempt to pressure Hamas to halt the rocket fire , but the attacks continued , with 16 missiles falling in southern Israel , including one that damaged a daycare centre , although it caused no casualties .
Palestinian militants have fired more than 160 makeshift rockets into southern Israel and on Tuesday shot dead an Ecuadorian kibbutz volunteer .
Israel 's defence minister , Ehud Barak , said no shipment would cross into Gaza without his personal approval .
A spokesman for the defence ministry said the closure was a " signal " to Hamas , the Islamist group that won Palestinian elections two years ago and last summer seized full control of Gaza .
The Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , warned that his military operations in Gaza would continue " without compromise , without concessions and without mercy " .
The fighting , the worst for more than a year , raises serious questions about the viability of recently renewed peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians .
On the other side of Gaza City yesterday , Ahmad Yazagi received mourners at a funeral tent near his home .
A few hundred metres away at midday on Wednesday his two brothers , Mohammad , 27 , and Amr , 38 , and his nephew Amir , eight , were killed when their car was struck by an Israeli missile .
The Israeli military later admitted it was a mistake , but Yazagi said his family had received no explanation , apology or offer of compensation .
" What is our guilt ?
We ask to live in peace and we ask them to leave us alone , " he said , surrounded by family and neighbours .
" With one hand the Israelis talk about peace , with the other they continue fighting . "
The deaths left Yazagi , 26 , the sole wage earner for his extended family .
He earns 1,000 shekels ( �135 ) a month as a temporary labourer at the health ministry and inherits the � 15,000 debt of his brother , who was setting up a scrap metal business .
The UN says about half the strip 's 1.5 million people no longer have access to fresh water , because Israel has restricted fuel supplies , which in turn halts pumps and reduces electricity production .
Although the UN has food for the next two months in its warehouses , the closure of crossings has limited supplies and forced up prices .
Introduction
Since its inception , XML has been criticized for the overhead it introduces into the enterprise infrastructure .
Business data encoded in XML takes 5 to 10 times more bandwidth to transmit in the network , and proportionally more disk space to store .
While most agree that verbosity is inherent to XML's way of encoding information ( e.g. , extensive use of tags and pointy brackets ) , the explanation of XML 's perceived performance issue remains inconclusive .
A popular belief is that since XML is human - readable text , it has to be slow and inefficient .
By the same token , proponents of binary XML seem to suggest that a compact encoding format , most noticeably the binary XML , would automatically lead to better processing performance .
Does it make sense for doctors to prescribe medicine without a diagnosis ?
Whether those perceptions and beliefs have a grain of truth or not , one thing is certain : without a solid understanding of XML 's performance issue , it will be difficult , if not impossible , to devise meaningful solutions .
So in this article , I 'll attempt to dissect XML 's performance issue by focusing on the following three key questions :
Does XML have a performance issue ?
What is the real culprit behind XML 's slow performance ?
Can binary XML fundamentally solve the problem ?
Performance is Not an XML Issue Per Se
In networking system design , the OSI ( Open System Interconnect ) stack is the standard model that divides the functions of the network into seven layers .
Each layer only uses the layer below , and only exports functionalities to the layer above .
Compared with monolithic approaches , the advantages of OSI 's layered approach are the robustness , resilience , and extensibility of the networking system in the face of rapid technology evolution .
For example , any Voice over IP application will work without knowing the physical layer of the networks ( e.g. , using copper , fiber cable , or Wi - Fi ) or the data link layer ( e.g. , Ethernet , Frame Relay , or ATM ) .
Likewise , we can take a similar layered approach to modeling XML - based applications .
Figure 1 is a simplified view of this " XML protocol stack " consisting of three layers : the XML data layer , the XML parsing layer , and the application layer .
The application layer only uses functions exported by the XML parsing layer , which translates the data from its physical representation ( XML ) into its logical representation ( the infoset ) .
Figure 1 . XML Application Stack
Several observations can be made concerning the perceived performance issue of XML .
First and foremost , because the XML application can only go as fast as the XML parsers can process XML messages , performance is actually not an issue of XML per se , but instead an issue of the XML parsing layer .
If an XML routing application ( assuming minimum overhead at the application layer ) can't keep pace with incoming XML messages at a gigabit per second , it 's most likely because the throughput of XML parsing is less than that of the network .
Consequently , the correct way to boost the application performance is to optimize the XML parsing layer .
Just like tuning any software application , the best way to do it is to discover and then find ways to reduce or eliminate the overhead in XML parsers .
Object Allocation - The Real Culprit
To get a feel of the performance offered by current XML parsing technologies , I benchmarked the parsing throughput of the two types of widely used XML parsers : Xerces DOM and Xerces SAX .
The benchmark applications are quite simple .
They first read an XML document into memory , and then invoke parser routines to parse the document for a large number of iterations .
The parsing throughput is calculated by dividing the file size by the average latency of each parsing iteration .
For SAX parsing , the content handler is set to NULL .
Several XML documents in varying sizes , tagginess , and structural complexity were chosen for the benchmark .
The results , produced by a two - year old 1.7GHz Pentium M laptop , are summarized in Figure 2 .
The complete report -- which includes test setup , methodology , and code -- is available online here .
Figure 2 . Parsing Performance Comparison Between DOM , SAX , Pull , and VTD - XML
The benchmark results are quite consistent with the well - known performance characteristics of DOM and SAX .
First of all , the raw parsing throughput of SAX , at between 20 MB / sec~30 MB / sec , is actually quite respectable .
However , by not exposing the inherent structural information , SAX essentially treats XML as CSV with " pointy brackets , " often making it prohibitively difficult to use and unsuitable as a general - purpose XML parser .
DOM , on the other hand , lets developers navigate in - memory tree structures .
However , the benchmark results also show that , except for very small files , DOM is typically three to five times slower than SAX .
Because DOM parsers usually use SAX internally to tokenize XML , by comparing the performance differences , it 's clear that building the in -memory tree structure is where the bottleneck is .
In other words , allocating all the objects and connecting them together dramatically slows everything down .
As the next step , I ran JProfiler ( from ej - Ttechnologies ) to identify where DOM and SAX parsing spend all the CPU cycles .
The results confirmed my early suspicion that the overhead of object allocation overwhelmingly bottlenecks DOM parsing and , to a lesser ( but still significant ) degree , SAX parsing as well .
Some readers may argue that DOM -- only an API specification -- does n't preclude efficient , less object - intensive , implementations .
Not so .
The DOM spec is , in fact , based completely on the assumption that the hierarchical structure consists entirely of objects exposing the Node interface .
The most any DOM implementation can do is alter the implementation of the object sitting behind the Node interface , and it 's impossible to rip away the objects altogether .
So , if the object creation is the main culprit , the DOM spec itself is the accomplice that makes any performance - oriented optimization prohibitively difficult .
This is why , after the past eight years and countless efforts by all major IT companies , every implementation of DOM has only seen marginal performance improvement .
Binary XML Solves the Wrong Problem
Can binary XML fundamentally solve the performance issue of XML ?
Well , since the performance issue belongs to XML parsers , a better question to ask is whether binary XML can help make parsing more efficient .
The answer has two parts : one for SAX , and the other for DOM .
Binary XML can improve the raw SAX parsing speed .
There are a lot of XML - specific syntax features that binary XML can choose not to inherit .
For example , binary XML can replace the ending tags with something more efficient , entirely avoiding attributes so SAX parsing no longer does uniqueness checking , or find other ways to represent the document structure .
There are many ways to trim CPU cycles off SAX 's tokenization cost .
Proponents of binary XML often cite up to a 10 x speed - up for the binary XML version of SAX over text XML .
However , they ignore the simple fact that SAX has serious usability issues .
The awkward forward - only nature of SAX parsing not only requires extra implementation effort , but also incurs performance penalties when the document structure becomes only slightly complex .
If developers choose not to scan the document multiple times , they 'll have to buffer the document or build custom object models .
In addition , SAX does n't work well with XPath and , in general , can't drive XSLT processing ( binary XML has to be transformed as well , right ? ) .
So pointing to SAX 's raw performance for binary XML as a proof of binary XML 's merit is both unfair and misleading .
The bottom line : for an XML processing model to be broadly useful , the API must expose the inherent structure of XML .
Unfortunately , binary XML wo n't make much difference improving DOM parsing .
This is for the simple reason that DOM parsing generally spends most CPU cycles on building in - memory tree structures , not on tokenization .
So , the speed - up of DOM due to faster SAX parsing is quite limited .
In other words , DOM parsing for binary XML will be slow as well .
Going one step further , an object - graph based parser will have the same kind of performance issue for virtually any data format such as DCOM , RMI , or CORBA .
XML is merely the scapegoat .
Reduce Object Creation - The Correct Approach
From my benchmark and profiling results , it 's quite easy to see that the best way to remove the performance bottleneck in XML parsing is to reduce the object - creation cost of building the in-memory hierarchical structure .
The possibilities are , in fact , endless , and only limited by the imagination .
Good solutions can and will emerge , and among them is VTD - XML .
To achieve high performance , VTD - XML approaches XML parsing through the two object - less steps :
Non-extractive tokenization , and Hierarchical - directory - based random access
The result : VTD - XML drastically reduces the number of objects while still exporting the hierarchical structure to application developers and significantly outperforming SAX .
( See Figure 3 . )
Figure 3 : Memory Usage Comparison Between DOM and VTD -XML
Conclusion
To summarize , the right way is to find better parsing techniques beyond DOM and SAX that significantly reduce the object - creation cost of building XML 's tree structure .
Binary XML wo n't fundamentally solve XML 's performance issue because the problem belongs to XML parsers , not XML .
History
Answers to questions from students of Software Engineering
[ The approximate reconstruction of the questions is left as an exercise to the reader . ]
Gadgets are not necessarily an improvement , vide the succession
Blackboard -> Overhead Projector -> Power Point
And I do n't need to waste my time with a computer just because I am a computer scientist .
[ Medical researchers are not required to suffer from the diseases they investigate . ]
It is not the business of computing science to promote " computerization " , say by developing demanding applications so as to create a market for the next generation of hardware .
[ Medical researchers are not required to develop new diseases so as to create a market for more pharmaceutical products . ]
It is not the task of the University to offer what society asks for , but to give what society needs .
[ The things society asks for are generally understood , and you do n't need a University for that ; the university has to offer what no one else can provide . ]
We are all shaped by the tools we use , in particular : the formalisms we use shape our thinking habits , for better or for worse , and that means that we have to be very careful in the choice of what we learn and teach , for unlearning is not really possible .
[ Many years ago , if I could use a new assistant , one prerequisite would be " No prior exposure to FORTRAN " , and at high schools in Siberia , the teaching of BASIC was not allowed . ]
A programmer has to be able to demonstrate that his program has the required properties .
If this comes as an afterthought , it is all but certain that he wo n't be able to meet this obligation : only if he allows this obligation to influence his design , there is hope he can meet it .
Pure a posteriori verification denies you that whole - some influence and is therefore putting the cart before the horse , but that is exactly what happens in the software houses where " programming " and " quality assurance " are done by different groups .
[ Needless to say , those houses deliver without warranty . ]
The required techniques of effective reasoning are pretty formal , but as long as programming is done by people that do n't master them , the software crisis will remain with us and will be considered an incurable disease .
And you know what incurable diseases do : they invite the quacks and charlatans in , who in this case take the form of Software Engineering gurus .
Some of you doubt that aforementioned " techniques of effective reasoning " , nice as they are for small programs , will scale up , I quote " given the daunting size and sheer complexity of most programs " .
Well , they will be powerless if you try to use them to disentangle the horrendous mess produced by a group of incompetent , unorganized programmers .
Their power manifests itself in the construction phase where ( i ) they tend to lead to much shorter texts than would be produced otherwise and ( ii ) lengths of program derivations tend to grow not much more than linearly with the lengths of the programs derived .
Finally the programs thus produced are infinitely better than the usual junk .
We should never forget that programmers live in a world of artefacts , a fact that distinguishes them from most other scientists .
The programmer should not ask how applicable the techniques of sound programming are , he should create a world in which they are applicable ; it is his only way of delivering a high - quality design .
To which I should add a quotation from EWD898 ( 1984 )
" Machine capacities now give us room galore for making a mess of it .
Opportunities unlimited for fouling things up !
Developing the austere intellectual discipline of keeping things sufficiently simple is in this environment a formidable challenge , both technically and educationally . "
In reply to questions why we teach useless things that industry ignores , I refer you to EWD920 ( 1985 ) .
Let me quote here one paragraph
" Back to our original question : can computing science save the computer industry ?
My answer is " If the computer industry can be saved , only computing science can do it . " .
But it may take a long time before the computer industry — in particular the well - established companies — will share this view .
It will almost certainly take longer than the limited period over which they plan their futures .
In the mean time , the academic world — which traditionally plans much further ahead — has no choice .
It has to refine and to teach to the best of its abilities how computing should be done ; would it ever yield to the pressure to propagate the malpractice of today , it had better fold up . " .
But to stress how much patience we need , let me give you another old quotation ( from 1988 ) " Too few people recognize that the high technology so celebrated today is essentially a mathematical technology . " ( from the 2nd David - report , so named after the committee 's chairman Dr. E. E. David Jr. )
No , I 'm afraid that computer science has suffered from the popularity of the Internet .
It has attracted an increasing — not to say : overwhelming ! — number of students with very little scientific inclination and in research it has only strengthened the prevailing ( and somewhat vulgar ) obsession with speed and capacity .
Yes , I share your concern : how to program well — though a teachable topic — is hardly taught .
The situation is similar to that in mathematics , where the explicit curriculum is confined to mathematical results ; how to do mathematics is something the student must absorb by osmosis , so to speak .
One reason for preferring symbol - manipulating , calculating arguments is that their design is much better teachable than the design of verbal / pictorial arguments .
Large - scale introduction of courses on such calculational methodology , however , would encounter unsurmountable political problems .
In the software business there are many enterprises for which it is not clear that science can help them ; that science should try is not clear either .

FOR women , it is supposed to trigger one of the most intense orgasms imaginable , with waves of pleasure spreading out across the whole body .
If the “ G spot orgasm ” seems semi-mythical , however , that ’s because there has been scant evidence of its existence .
Now for the first time gynaecological scans have revealed clear anatomical differences between women who claim to experience vaginal orgasms involving a G spot and those who do n’t .
It might mean that there is a G spot , after all .
What ’s more , a simple test could tell you if it ’s time to give up the hunt , or if your partner just needs to try harder . …
By Jennifer Umolac of ImpeachforPeace.org —
On Tuesday , October 23rd , Impeach for Peace was granted a meeting with Representative John Conyers in Washington DC to discuss H. Res 333 and the status of impeachment .
The meeting took place in the Judiciary Offices of the Rayburn building and was attended by Rep. John Conyers , an aide to Rep. Conyers and myself .
There was no scheduled endtime for the meeting and ultimately the meeting lasted nearly 45 minutes .
During this time many different aspects of the impeachment process were discussed .
Representative Conyers was very generous with his time and made it very clear that he considers it very important for him to continue these conversations about impeachment .
Unlike during his visit to Minneapolis , Rep. Conyers did not mention the matter of “ time ” as one of the factors against bringing forward H. Res 333 .
His most prominent rationale for not bringing forward the resolution was that he felt there would n’t be support for the measure and subsequently that it would n’t go anywhere .
He spoke about all of the freshman Congresspeople who were elected in Red States and how they were unlikely to come out in favor of impeachment .
He then stated that if he were n’t in his position , he would be “ one of you …lobbying for impeachment . ”
I implored him to be one of us IN his position and to lobby his fellow Representatives in support of H. Res 333 .
I also mentioned to him that I had a conversation with a Minnesota Representative , Tim Walz , who was in exactly that position , representing a traditionally conservative area that had narrowly elected him .
In our conversation on impeachment , Rep .
Walz had stated that though he would n’t sign on to H. Res 333 , he would support articles of impeachment should they come to the floor .
I suggested that this might be a far more widespread stance than he would expect .
Representative Conyers then discussed some of the on - going investigations and mentioned that the Judiciary Committee was going to go forward with Contempt of Congress charges against Harriet Myers , and that the best way to hold this Administration was by continuing with the investigations .
At this point in our meeting we were joined by Congressman Keith Ellison , who represents the 5th District of Minneapolis , home to ImpeachforPeace.org .
Congressman Ellison is a co-sponsor of H. Res 333 .
There was much discussion of the discontent with Congress and the perception of many that this Congress has done nothing to hold the Administration accountable for the many abuses of power that have occurred .
When I expressed dismay with Speaker Pelosi ’s leadership and asserted that , in my opinion , she had castrated the Democratic party by taking impeachment off the table , Congressman Conyers said “ well , maybe we should get new leadership . ”
As we were leaving the meeting room , on our way to a filming for BET , we were again discussing bringing forward H Res 333 and the Congressman turned to me and said , “ I really want you to convince me to do this . ”
When we arrived at the location for the filming , Rep. Maxine Waters was coming out of the room and Mr. Conyers stopped her and introduced me to her saying “ This is Jennifer and she ’s here to lobby me on impeachment . ”
To which Rep . Waters instantly replied , “ it ’s never going to happen . ”
She then said , “ I wish I could tell you something that would give you some hope , but I can ’t . ”
I said to her , “ Then maybe I can say something that will give you some hope , ” and launched into a quick lobbying effort .
I asked Rep. Waters if I could walk with her to her office , and we subsequently spent the next 5 minutes debating the “ practicalities ” of impeachment .
( How impractical to defend the Constitution ! )
She seemed most moved by the argument that the Democrats are in danger of blowing the 2008 elections if decisive actions are n’t taken to show the electorate that the Democratic party is interested in change .
Upon returning to the filming for the BET segment , I had the good fortune to catch Rep.
Conyers as he sung the praises of heroes such as Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King who led movements that brought about social change that at the onset seemed impossible .
Leaving the room , I mentioned to him how glad I was to hear him honor those leaders who had stood up for what was right , despite the odds , and urged him to be that same kind of leader for his country and bring forward the articles of impeachment .

Robert Naeye / Rob GutroGoddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md.301-286-4453 / 4044 Four years of observations from the European Space Agency ’s Integral ( INTErnational Gamma - Ray Astrophysics Laboratory ) satellite may have cleared up one of the most vexing mysteries in our Milky Way : the origin of a giant cloud of antimatter surrounding the galactic center .
As reported by an international team in the January 10 issue of Nature , Integral found that the cloud extends farther on the western side of the galactic center than it does on the eastern side .
This imbalance matches the distribution of a population of binary star systems that contain black holes or neutron stars , strongly suggesting that these binaries are churning out at least half of the antimatter , and perhaps all of it .
" The reported Integral detection of an asymmetry represents a significant step forward toward a solution of one of the major outstanding problems in high - energy astrophysics .
I think I can hear a collective sigh of relief emanating from the community , " says Marvin Leventhal , a University of Maryland professor emeritus and a pioneer in this field .
The cloud itself is roughly 10,000 light - years across , and generates the energy of about 10,000 Suns .
The cloud shines brightly in gamma rays due to a reaction governed by Einstein ’s famous equation E=mc^2 .
Negatively charged subatomic particles known as electrons collide with their antimatter counterparts , positively charged positrons .
When electrons and positrons meet , they can annihilate one another and convert all of their mass into gamma rays with energies of 511,000 electron - volts ( 511 keV ) .
The antimatter cloud was discovered in the 1970s by gamma-ray detectors flown on balloons .
Scientists have proposed a wide range of explanations for the origin of the antimatter , which is exceedingly rare in the cosmos .
For years , many theories centered around radioactive elements produced in supernovae , prodigious stellar explosions .
Others suggested that the positrons come from neutron stars , novae , or colliding stellar winds .
In recent years , some theorists championed the idea that particles of dark matter were annihilating one another , or with atomic matter , producing electrons and positrons that annihilate into 511 - keV gamma rays .
But other scientists remained skeptical , noting that the dark matter particles had to be significantly lighter than most theories predicted .
" The Integral results seem to rule out dark matter as the major source of the gamma rays , " says the Nature paper ’s second author Gerry Skinner , who currently works at NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , Skinner is a co-investigator of Integral ’s SPI ( SPectrometer for Integral ) instrument , which made this discovery .
Integral found certain types of binary systems near the galactic center are also skewed to the west .
These systems are known as hard low - mass X - ray binaries , since they light up in high - energy ( hard ) X - rays as gas from a low - mass star spirals into a companion black hole or neutron star .
Because the two " pictures " of antimatter and hard low - mass X - ray binaries line up strongly suggests the binaries are producing significant amounts of positrons .
" Simple estimates suggest that about half and possibly all the antimatter is coming from X - ray binaries , " says Georg Weidenspointer of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany , lead author of the Nature paper .
While Integral ’s discovery clears up one mystery , it raises a new one .
Scientists do n’t understand how low - mass X - ray binaries could produce enough positrons to explain the cloud , and they also do n’t know how they escape from these systems .
" We expected something unexpected , but we did not expect this , " says Skinner .
The antimatter is probably produced in a region near the neutron stars and black holes , where powerful magnetic fields launch jets of particles that rip through space at near - light speed .
NASA ’s Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope ( GLAST ) , scheduled to launch in 2008 , may help clarify how objects such as black holes launch particle jets .
Conceivably , it could even detect higher - energy gamma rays from heavier types of dark matter particles annihilating one another .
Launched in 2002 , Integral is an international mission involving scientists and engineers from dozens of nations .
NASA contributed scientists , hardware , and software for Integral , including part of the SPI instrument .
Santa Claus could be breaking privacy laws in his collection and use of data about British children , experts have warned .
Yuletide cheer - bringer Claus could be putting the personal data of millions of children at risk .
Data protection laws lay down strict conditions for the use of personal data and there is no evidence that Claus has an adequate compliance programme in place .
Children across Britain who write letters to Claus with a list of gift requests are not told for how long that data is kept , or if it will be used for other purposes such as marketing by third parties .
The Data Protection
Act stipulates that data should not be kept for longer than necessary , which would mean 25 December , though Claus may argue that he needs to keep the letters for six years to use in any gift - related lawsuits .
" There is a stream of questions Santa has yet to answer , " said William Malcolm , a data protection specialist at Pinsent Masons , the law firm behind OUT - LAW .
COM .
" Is this information used for anything other than present giving ?
Information passes out of the EU , so does Santa check the letters for unambiguous , specific and informed consent to this overseas transfer ? "
OUT - LAW 's attempts to put the questions to Claus were hindered by the lack of an office chimney .
Eventually , the questions were put up a domestic chimney but no response was received by time of publication .
The Data Protection
Act says that you must inform someone when you are collecting data about them , and tell them what the purpose of collection is .
" What about the naughty / nice database ? " said Malcolm .
" Are children given notice that behavioural data is being collected about them throughout the year ?
And does it qualify as covert monitoring , which would breach Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights ? "
People can make a subject access request of databases holding their personal information , but the database operator has 40 days in which to respond .
Children are now too late , therefore , to find out before Christmas if they are on the naughty or nice section of the system .

Steven Spielberg has finally decided he does not want to be part of a holocaust stamped " Made in China " .
It 's an overdue decision – but one that could now begin an Olympic chain reaction to save the starved survivors in Darfur .
Many people will react to this news by asking – what does China have to do with an African genocide unfolding thousands of miles away from its mainland anyway ?
The answer is stark .
China pays for the genocide .
China arms the genocide .
China obstructs all attempts to stop the genocide .
Indeed , the genocidal Sudanese dictatorship is so enmeshed with the Chinese Communist dictatorship that it should be rebranded as Chudan – a pooled government with pooled responsibility .
When I stood last summer on the borders of Darfur , the hacked and broken people I met were victims of Chudan .
Their catastrophe began in 2004 , when the local Muslim population of Darfur finally grew sick of being neglected and ignored by the oil - rich National Islamic Front government in Khartoum .
A few rebel groups began to rise up – and Khartoum reacted with deranged violence .
They sent the Arab Janjaweed – " men on horseback " – to slay the uppity black population , so they could never shout out again .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Osman Ibrahim was one of the lucky ones .
He 's my age – 29 – and when we met , he was running for his life with his wife and four children .
One morning a month before , Osman had been tending his crops in his village 30 miles away , when he heard the sound every black Darfuri dreads .
It was the whirr of the Sudanese military 's helicopters , followed by the approaching horses and machine - gun fire of the Janjaweed .
" The helicopters bombed my house , " Osman said , " and the Janjaweed started to kill everyone in the village . "
He gathered his children and ran .
If they had stayed , the Human Rights Watch reports suggest , his wife and children would have been gang - raped , and then they would have all been killed .
Some 450,000 people like them have died so far , with more than 2.5 million more on the run .
The helicopter that blew up Osman 's village , and the AK - 47s that were used to slaughter his friends , were provided and paid for by China .
Why ?
One word : oil .
Since 1993 , China has been scouring the earth for the few fossil fuels not seized and burned by Europe and America , and it found the friendliest pool of petrol in Sudan .
They have ploughed $ 10bn of capital investment into Sudan 's oilfields , and they snaffle 60 per cent of Sudan 's petrol : more than 400,000 barrels a day .
What does Sudan get in return ?
Enough cash to pay for the slaughter – but that 's only for starters .
Since 1996 , China has been Sudan 's main supplier of weapons .
On the international stage , China covers Sudan 's back .
Since the genocide began , the Chinese have been systematically obstructing any attempts at the UN to protect Darfur 's civilians .
China 's special envoy , Liu Guijin , visited Darfur and declared , " I did n't see a desperate scenario of people dying of hunger . "
No , he said – he simply saw people " grateful " for China 's " contribution " .
Then the threats to disrupt the Olympics came – and they began to shift their tone .
It was reported that China voted for a UN resolution authorising a force of 22,500 peacekeepers – but this was mere Sino - spin .
In reality , they announced they would only vote for the UN resolution provided a clause was added .
The UN must " invite the consent " of the genocidal regime in Khartoum before UN troops could be dispatched , they insisted .
Khartoum has predictably refused to consent – so the peacekeeping mission seems to have died in its crib .
Yet if China threatened to turn off the tap on Sudan 's economy , arms and international support , the dictatorship would almost certainly wind down the genocide rather than face implosion .
So can we make it happen ?
It 's notoriously hard to pressure the Chinese dictatorship .
They keep their population almost totally ignorant about Darfur , hidden away behind the Great Firewall of China – so internal anger on this issue is almost non-existent .
That 's why the Beijing Olympics are remarkably serendipitous , providing a rare pressure - point for the world 's worried citizens .
Enter ( and exit ) Spielberg .
He is a hefty international symbol , one the Chinese dictators cannot shrug off .
But alone , he is nothing like enough .
Luckily , for the Chinese coming - out party to go well , they need the guests to stick to the dress - code and the strict etiquette they lay down .
All moral people should refuse to play along – not for symbolism , but because each pint of shame changes China 's calculations .
We will succeed in stopping the genocide when the Chinese dictatorship is more frightened of having its $ 50bn party ruined than of losing 400,000 barrels of Sudanese oil a day .
The best people to help us achieve this are our athletes .
Before they are sportsmen , they are men .
Before they are sportswomen , they are women .
They have a responsibility to other men and women who are being raped and butchered , just for being black .
If we learned anything from the 20th century , it is that " I was told to say nothing " is the weakest excuse of all .
So let them pledge to unfurl Darfuri flags from their podiums if they win .
Let them promise to hold up pictures of burned Darfuri children .
Let them talk about Darfur at every Olympic press conference .
The Chinese Communists know they cannot black out every image : they will begin to panic .
Obscenely , the British Olympic Association ( BOA ) has tried to do the Communist Party 's work for it .
In the past week , it has attempted to ban all Olympic athletes competing under the Union Jack from even mentioning this holocaust , inserting a " gagging clause " about " politically sensitive subjects " into their contracts .
So far , only one outstanding athlete has refused to shut up about Darfur : the badminton player Richard Vaughan .
More need to speak out , today .
You can ask the chief executives of the BOA why they are trying to stop them at colin.moynihan@boa.org.uk and simon.clegg@boa.org.uk .
We can also pressure the advertisers .
The Chinese are raking in tens of billions from European and American corporations desperate to be associated with the Olympics .
The human rights group Dream For Darfur approached the major ones – Coca - Cola , Johnson and Johnson , Panasonic , Volkswagen and more – to ask them simply to speak out on Darfur .
They refused .
The campaigners called the report : " And now – not a word from our sponsors " .
If China thought they would lose this revenue , they could be panicked even more .
The first genocide of the 21st century is passing into the night , and the trail of blood runs right back to Beijing .
The only question now is – do we want to throw an Olympic party slipping and sliding in the slaughter , or do we want to use this moment to protect Osman and his terrorised countrymen ?

This page is about displaying the word ‘ lambda ’ using the Greek letter .
See also PrettySymbol .
Using prettify - symbols - mode
Emacs 24.4 introduced a minor mode called ‘ prettify - symbols - mode ’ .
( defun my - pretty - lambda ( ) " make some word or string show as pretty Unicode symbols " ( setq prettify - symbols - alist '( ( " lambda " . 955 ) ) ) ) ( add - hook ' scheme - mode - hook ' my - pretty - lambda ) ( global - prettify - symbols - mode 1 )
The snippet above works only when ‘ scheme - mode ’ is on .
Add more hooks if you wish to get other major modes working .
See also : http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_pretty_lambda.html
Using Character Composition
Library pretty - lambdada.el defines commands , including minor modes ( local and global ) , that let you do this , either for specific modes or generally .
The core display code is similar to the following snippet :
( defun pretty - lambdas ( ) ( font - lock - add - keywords nil ` ( ( " ( \ \ ( lambda \\ > \\ ) " ( 0 ( progn ( compose - region ( match - beginning 1 ) ( match- end 1 ) , ( make-char ' greek - iso8859-7 107 ) ) nil ) ) ) ) ) )
There are several versions of such snippets floating around .
The one above is from LawrenceMitchell , modified from StefanMonnier ’s rewrite of OliverScholz ’s rewrite of LukeGorrie ’s original pretty - lambda.el code ( http://fresh.homeunix.net/~luke/misc/emacs/pretty-lambda.el).
And here is a variant by TrentBuck :
( font - lock - add - keywords ' emacs - lisp - mode '( ( " ( \\ ( lambda \\ ) \\ > " ( 0 ( prog1 ( ) ( compose - region ( match - beginning 1 ) ( match-end 1 ) ? λ ) ) ) ) ) )
I stopped using pretty - lambda.el because Emacs was actually saving weird escape characters in my files such that when I reloaded them I ’d still get lambda - symbols , even with this turned off .
But it makes the files unreadable to other programs .
Does anyone else have this problem , and know the fix ?
Since it ’s all done in font - lock I did n’t expect the saved files to be affected .
– LukeGorrie
This should happen only if the file was saved in the coding system Emacs Mule , because emacs - mule preserves the composition property .
( Composition is actually part of Emacs ’ m 17n support . )
Normally you should not use emacs - mule ; however , auto - save files are saved in that coding system .
So if you restore a file after a crash , for instance , you can get something like what you describe .
A fix would be to use a hook to remove all composition properties before auto - saving .
– OliverScholz
Using Font - Lock and Overlays
This library defines a minor mode that uses font - lock and overlays to display ‘ lambda ’ as the Greek letter : http://dishevelled.net/elisp/lambda-mode.el.
I use the misc - fixed font instead of the default , so lambda - mode displayed what looked like a Korean character .
You can fix it by adding to your .emacs : ( setq lambda - symbol ( string # x1d77a ) )
Using an Image
Sugawara offers another approach : a minor mode that displays ‘ lambda ’ as a large Greek letter using an image .
( defvar big - lambda - image ( create - image ( base64 - decode - string " /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEASABIAAD/2wBDAAsICAoIBwsKCQoNDAsNERwSEQ8PESIZGhQcKSQrKigk JyctMkA3LTA9MCcnOEw5PUNFSElIKzZPVU5GVEBHSEX/2wBDAQwNDREPESESEiFFLicuRUVFRUVF

In 2002 , I spoke with Jerome Bressler , author of the damning FDA audit that exposed the corruption of the G. D. Searle Co. , originator of aspartame .
Bressler reported that rats killed by the poison were resurrected on paper , neoplasms filtered out and cancers caused by aspartame , were ignored and deleted from Searle 's records .
Today this rat poison and cancer stimulator is sold as NutraSweet and Equal and is in Diet Coke and thousands of other foods and drinks .
Bressler had retired and I wanted to thank him for being so honest .
But his reply was shocking .
He said , " If you think that 's bad , when the FDA retyped my report they left out the worst 20 % .
They deleted my cover letter and there are two mice studies you need to see .
Get those reports , they 're very important . "
Doctors H. J. Roberts ( Aspartame Disease : An Ignored Epidemic , www.sunsentpress.com ) and Russell Blaylock ( Excitotoxins : The Taste That Kills , www.russellblaylockmd.com ) also called Jerome Bressler and got the same information .
This report is suppose to be a matter of public record so Dr. Roberts asked his Congressman to get the record from the FDA .
They even refused his Congressman saying it was confidential .
We were amazed that the FDA could withhold public documents from United States Congressmen .
It 's incriminating that a government agency like the FDA who is suppose to be protecting the health of the public would sell its soul to drug and chemical companies .
[ See the Bressler Report at < http://www.dorway.com/bressler.txt>http://www.dorway.com/bressler.txt
Note that some tables are blacked out and parts of the text are omitted . ]
FDA took the Fifth .
But the fifth amendment to our Constitution does n't permit federal agencies to hide criminal collusion with firms it regulates .
So on November 13 , 2007 I sent a certified request to FDA , exercising my Freedom of Information rights to receive the 20 % of the report they deleted .
They said its confidential and denied my request .
I wrote back and explained that Jerome Bressler never gave permission for them to delete data from his FDA audit , and since this audit is public information they must release it .
http://www.mpwhi.com/letter_to_foia_fda.htm
FDA 's response arrived January 14 , 2008 from Chicago , signed by George F. Bailey , Freedom of Information Officer , stating this : " Due to the amount of time that has elapsed since the Bressler Report was written and based on the FDA 's Records Retention Schedule , records in our files of that age have been destroyed . "
They were confidential in November but when they realized there was no legal excuse to withhold what they had doctored they were simply deleted .
Jerome Bressler blew the cover on G. D. Searle 's perjuries .
Some FDA bureaucrat , to protect Searle , blue - penciled Bressler 's report , then the vital details of aspartame 's toxicity were denied to a congressman , and now its destroyed .
Balderdash !
This watchdog for the health of a Nation received more complaints on aspartame than on any other additive .
In 1995 they published a list of 10,000 consumer complaints .
Is n't it comforting to know they destroy the evidence of corruption , of deaths , disabilities and complications visited on the public from approved drugs that produce serious or fatal injuries .
With digital recording & storage technology that can maintain an infinity of data , FDA plunders it .
Call it criminal FDA - Gate !
Protecting industry is what the FDA does .
Jerome Bressler is not the only one who blew the whistle on the FDA .
In 1987 Dr. Jacqueline Verrett , a toxicologist and member of the Bressler Task Force , testified before a US Senate hearing .
She described the discrepancies found in the Searle tests of aspartame as ' serious departures from acceptable toxicological protocols . '
" It is unthinkable , " she said , ' that any reputable toxicologist giving a complete , objective evaluation of the data resulting from such a study could conclude anything other than that the study was uninterpretable and worthless and should be repeated . '
" On the crucial question itself : ' It would appear that the safety of aspartame and its breakdown products has still not been satisfactorily determined , since many of the flaws cited in these three studies were also present in all of the other studies submitted by Searle . ' "
What is particularly important about FDA toxicologist Dr. Verrett 's testimony is she is saying that aspartame still had not been proven safe in 1987 and it had been on the market since 1981 which was due to the political chicanery of Don Rumsfeld who was CEO of Searle .
Here is a clip about it from Sweet Misery : A Poisoned World : http://www.soundandfury.tv/pages/rumsfeld2.html
Dr. Verrett went even further on exposing the FDA .
She wrote the book in l973 " Eating May Be Hazardous To Your Health : The Case Against Food Additives " .
The Chicago Tribune said : " After spending 15 years as a research scientist for the Food and Drug Administration , Verrett decided to bite the hand that had been feeding her .
The FDA , she says , is not performing its duty ; it has the legal authority to end food pollution , but it has not done so and it appears that its aims are not in that direction .
Privy to a lot of inside information , Verrett ( with the aid of writer Carper ) makes a good case for the necessity of consumer protest .
Read it -- all you 've got to lose it your appetite . "
Heroine , Dr. Jacqueline Verrett was not the only FDA toxicologist who was on site and saw Searle 's studies , and exposed FDA .
On August 1 , l985 FDA toxicologist , Dr. Adrian Gross , told Congress at least one of Searle 's studies " has established beyond ANY REASONABLE DOUBT that aspartame is capable of inducing brain tumors in experimental animals and that this predisposition of it is of extremely high significance .
...
In view of these indications that the cancer causing potential of aspartame is a matter that had been established WAY BEYOND ANY REASONABLE DOUBT , one can ask :
What is the reason for the apparent refusal by the FDA to invoke for this food additive the so - called Delaney Amendment to the Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act ? "
The Delaney Amendment makes it illegal to allow any residues of cancer causing chemicals in foods .
In his concluding testimony Gross asked , " Given the cancer causing potential of aspartame how would the FDA justify its position that it views a certain amount of aspartame as constituting an allowable daily intake or ' safe ' level of it ?
Is that position in effect not equivalent to setting a ' tolerance ' for this food additive and thus a violation of that law ?
And if the FDA itself elects to violate the law , who is left to protect the health of the public ? "
Congressional Record SID835:131 ( August 1 , l985 )
So the FDA allowed a product on the market that had been proven to cause cancer and gave a carcinogen an allowable daily dose .
Then when the impeccable Ramazzini Study was released that proved aspartame to be a multipotential carcinogen in 2005 , which the FDA had always known , peer reviewed by 7 world experts , they announced in a report aspartame does n't cause cancer and completely ignored it .
To make matters worse they released this notice on a Friday prior to Dr. M. Soffritti releasing a second study the following day , April 23 , 2007 at the Mount Sinai Medical School of New York showing not only does aspartame trigger cancer but even in small amounts .
If a pregnant woman uses it and the baby survives since aspartame is a teratogen causing birth defects and mental retardation , that child can grow up and get cancer .
By releasing their report during the same time period they confused the public .
They have yet to comment on this damning second study .
Dr. Soffritti received the Irving J. Selikoff
Award for his work , a reward only given three times in history .
Barbara Metzler , Mission Possible New Jersey and myself attended .
The coverup of dangerous products by FDA cast upon the public is notorious .
Another example is the MSG fiasco .
Glutamate researchers used aspartame as a placebo in studies so they could say MSG would n't react anymore than the placebo .
MSG is also an excitotoxin like the aspartic acid in aspartame as discussed in Dr. Blaylock 's book , Excitotoxins : The Taste That Kills .
In 1993 Jack Samuels , President of the Truth in Labeling Campaign , was reviewing FDA docket files relating to an FDA study on the safety of amino acids in supplements .
In the files , he found a letter dated March 22 , 1991 , from Andrew G. Ebert , PhD , Chairman , International Glutamate Technical Committee - a glutamate industry organization - in which Ebert admitted that aspartame had been used since at least 1978 in test and placebo materials that his organization provided to scientists who study the safety of MSG .
www.truthinlabeling.org
A review of studies conducted with the above - referenced test material clearly indicates that some subjects reacted to both MSG test material , and placebo material .
Scientists conducting such studies concluded that since subjects reacted to both MSG and placebos , their reactions were not from MSG .
Even though such logic is highly questionable , we now know that subjects reacted to placebos because of the presence of aspartame , an additive that causes MSG - type responses in MSG responses in MSG - sensitive people .
Because of the disclosure of the use of aspartame in placebo material by Jack Samuels , the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology , in its July 1995 report on the safety of MSG in food , concluded that the use of aspartame in placebo materials was inappropriate .
Why were these early studies not destroyed too ?
Because the FDA was caught red-handed .
They had known all these years and done nothing .
They did not even slap the hands of the glutamate industry .
Is aspartame still being used as their placebo ?
In a Citizens Petition to ban six years ago I exposed the government documents showing aspartame had never been proven safe and the FDA had been lying to the public .
The law requires that FDA answer in 180 days .
They refused to answer it showing they serve above the law .
In October , 2007 I sent an amendment based on an imminent health hazard which must be answered immediately .
Again , FDA has not answered .
FDA - GATE requires Congress to immediately investigate aspartame approval , Don Rumsfeld 's part in this , and FDA 's collusion with the drug and chemical companies they regulate .
In July , 2007 I lectured in New Zealand and met with their Food Standards who admitted they had done no studies on aspartame and relied on FDA .
New Zealand has their own petition to ban .
So aspartame which is in reality an addictive excitoneurotoxic carcinogenic drug that interacts with drugs and vaccines is being consumed in over 100 countries of the world by an unwarned public , and has caused a global plague .
While the 47 members of the UK Parliament have asked for a ban Food Standards there also using FDA propaganda has basically ignored the issue except to say they will do an anecdotal study .
Aspartame was approved in the UK by Paul Turner with their agency through a business deal with Searle .
When Parliament found out they had a blow - out , the story was in the Guardian , but the poison was never rescinded .
When New Mexico attempted to ban aspartame from the state the capital was saturated with lobbyists lying to the Senate and House again using FDA propaganda .
Addressing the Senate was difficult with a large proportion of Senators sipping on addictive Diet Coke .
Dr. Ken Stoller also testified and told these Senators he did n't expect to get anywhere when they were using the product but at least consider the children .
The vote to table was actually by someone who does n't drink Diet Coke , the only physician in the legislature , Steve Komadina , MD from Corrales , an obstetrician and gynecologist who strongly advises his own patients not to use aspartame because of the formaldehyde neurotoxicity and the abortifacient effects on the fetus .
Which lobbyist got to this OB - GYN physician senator who did n't care about the rest of the babies in New Mexico ?
It was impossible for Searle to prove their neurotoxin is safe .
In one test on seven monkeys five had grand mal seizures and one died ; an 86 % casualty rate .
Records were destroyed to protect the guilty FDA regulators and their corporate sugar - daddies who provide more than half of FDA 's funding .
Who do you think they work for : you or the chemical factories ?
How bad can it get ?
How about a product that embalms living tissue and destroys DNA ?

I flew to Barcelona to speak to the researcher who told me it could kill 200 million people .
It already has .
Another study FDA has ignored .
Congress should immediately step in and investigate and Codex should ban aspartame from use .

DUBAI —
An estimated 1.7 million Internet users in the UAE have been affected by the recent undersea cable damage , an expert said yesterday , quoting recent figures published by TeleGeography , an international research Web site .
Internet data was majorly affected as it is the biggest capacity carried by the undersea cables .
However , all voice calls , corporate data and video traffic were also affected .
Two du experts yesterday briefed the media on the current methods being undertaken by the telecom provider to re-route the Internet traffic to provide normalcy to the users .
Quoting TeleGeography and describing the effect the cuts had on the Internet world , Mahesh Jaishanker , executive director , Business Development and Marketing , du , said , “ The submarine cable cuts in FLAG Europe - Asia cable 8.3 km away from Alexandria , Egypt and SeaMeWe - 4 affected at least 60 million users in India , 12 million in Pakistan , six million in Egypt and 4.7 million in Saudi Arabia . ”
A total of five cables being operated by two submarine cable operators have been damaged with a fault in each .
These are SeaMeWe - 4 ( South East Asia - Middle East - Western Europe - 4 ) near Penang , Malaysia , the FLAG Europe - Asia near Alexandria , FLAG near the Dubai coast , FALCON near Bandar Abbas in Iran and SeaMeWe - 4 , also near Alexandria .
The first cut in the undersea Internet cable occurred on January 23 , in the Flag Telcoms FALCON submarine cable which was not reported .
This has not been repaired yet and the cause remains unknown , explained Jaishanker .
A major cut affecting the UAE occurred on January 30 in the SeaMeWe - 4 ( South East Asia - Middle East - Western Europe - 4 ) .
“ This was followed by another cut on February 1 which was on the same cable ( FALCON ) .
This affected the du network majorly as connections from the Gulf were severed while there was limited connectivity within the region , ” said Khaled Tabbara , executive director , Carrier Relations , du .
He explained that the network was re-routed through Al Khobar in Saudi Arabia and was near normal now .
Almost 90 per cent of Internet traffic is routed through undersea cables and only 10 per cent is done through the satellite .
The experts also suggested that the cause of damage could have been a ship ’s anchor that was dragging due to inclement weather conditions in the region during that particular period .
“ About 60 - 80 per cent of damages to undersea cable are due to external factors and only 10 per cent on an average can be classified as component failure , ” said Tabbara .
Adobe Light - Field Lens
Adobe , the company we can thank for industry topping computer graphic and photo programs like PhotoShop , Illustrator and InDesign has branched into world of real products with the launch of a super camera lens .
If you 've ever seen a fly 's eye up close , then you 'll have a pretty good visual of what the super lens looks like .
Like a black honeycomb , the camera combines 19 lenses which act together to produce top of the line photographs as well as give the photographer the incredible ability to manipulate the focal length AFTER the image has been captured using software by Adobe .
Techeblog was able to capture footage of the incredible product which can be seen in the above video .
[ RANT ] Gibson Hates Hip Hop .
I ca n’t think anymore .
As I sit here in my piece of shit “ studio ” , with the dusty mixer that shorts out every other minute , working on this slow ass 1 Ghz dell PC that does n’t read CD - Rs and crashes my recording app every other take , which has a soundcard installed in it that refuses to accept MIDI , seated next to the tired ass prosumer keyboard whose sounds I ’ve raped for the past 8 years , turntables I ca n’t scratch on and this Shure mic that has a dent in it – I think to myself : “ GIBSON !!!! ”
Why , you ask ?
Remember that whole Lollapalooza ‘ Last Band Standing ’ competition I won back in 2006 ?
Well , Lollapalooza came through 100 % on their end of the prize package – but apparently the people over at Gibson do n’t feel they need to cater to Hip Hop artists .
See , I ’ve been as cooperative and patient as possible for nearly a year and a half , but I want what I ’m rightly entitled to .
The following is my account of what happened .
Let this serve as a warning to all musicians out there looking to get involved in any of these corporately sponsored competitions .
There ’s ALOT to read , so I apologize in advance for this absurdly long blog post .
Get your coffee mugs out .
I Should Have Seen It Coming
The final round of the Last Band Standing competition involved me flying out to Chicago to compete in a live performance round against the other 4 finalists .
( NOTE : This was all done out of pocket ) .
I was extremely excited to win , finally feeling like SOMETHING was going the right way in my career ( for once ) and the prospect of revamping my embarrassingly amateur ‘ studio ’ was a rush .
Immediately following the win , I was told that there was to be a photo shoot with a bunch of Gibson gear at Grant Park during the Lollapalooza festival the next morning .
Apparently , it was part of their PR campaign and these shots were to be used for magazines , internet , etc .
I was given a contact number for a Gibson rep to call in order to schedule a time to shoot .
I called several times , left messages , etc .
I never got so much as an email even .
Lollapalooza came and went without a Gibson shoot .
I guess I should have seen this whole fiasco coming .
Where ’s My Prize ?
Here ’s the itemized Grand Prize list .
I ’ve bolded what I DIDN ’T receive :
A spot on the lineup : an opening slot on a feature stage .
Artist passes for the entire weekend with access to catering , the artist lounge , and everywhere else bands get to go !
Rooms for the weekend at the House of Blues Hotel .
Festival tickets for your friends to see you play .
$ 10,000 worth of equipment from our friends at Gibson .
( yes , believe it ! )
An interview and in - store performance at Virgin Megastore .
Band promotion on the homepage of Lollapalooza.com and partner websites .
Plus countless other Lolla goodies and schwag .
Killer prize package , eh ?
Still , it ’s ironic that I DIDN ’T receive the $ 10 k prize from the bullet with the “ ( Yes , Believe It ! ) ” in parenthesis .
That ’s right …
GIBSON NEVER DELIVERED ON THEIR END .
Introducing Don Pitts …
Why did n’t I receive anything ?
I guess you ’d have to ask Don Pitts , Entertainment Liason for GIBSON Guitars .
He ’s the guy who apparently deals with artist sponsorships and the like .
He was the man in charge of this particular situation and who , in my opinion , handled it in an unorganized and sloppy manner .
I would leave phone messages , emails , etc that would take weeks for him to respond to .
Finally , I land him on the phone and tells me that he ’s ‘ inexperienced with how these types of contests run ’ , and he ’s ‘ not sure how to go about this ’ .
This conversation would set the tone for the entire ordeal .
But then he starts making statements that bug me .
He tells me , “ I mean , this is kind of weird , because you know , you DON ’T play the guitar or drums . ”
This definitely rubbed me the wrong way , because I already felt as though he was being unnecessarily difficult to contact and somewhat curt on the phone .
So , from that statement , I guess I could gather , that there are some reservations on the Gibson side as to whether they need to accommodate ‘ a rapper ’ with their gear .
Whatever man , I just wanted what I won fair and square .
So What The Fuck Happened ?
I was basically told to go to the Gibson website and browse the catalog to pick what I wanted .
Mind you , there were no price listings anywhere to be found on this site – so how was I supposed to tally anything ?
Well , I took the proactive route and used SamAsh.com and GuitarCenter.com for price references on the gear that was on the Gibson website .
For those of you who are n’t aware , Gibson is HUGE musical instrument manufacturer which mainly makes guitars , but their site included pianos and drums , etc .
It was at this point I realized that Baldwin was one of their companies .
Having my own piano has always been a dream of mine – I take to those things like ducks to water .
So , I decided …‘ Fuck it !
Let me take this opportunity to get that upright piano I could never afford ’ .
( Sidenote : Kno thought I was crazy for blowing the entire prize value on a piano ) .
Anyway , I responded with an email requesting the piano .
Don Pitts responds with :

FROM : Don Pitts @ Gibson
Baldwin is the only division that ’s not part of the deal … but … maybe I can ask … Was you looking at the 243 ( piano model ) ?
Firstly , all I was told was to go to Gibson and pick whatever I wanted .
I saw pianos and I picked one .
Now , suddenly , that ’s ‘ not part of the deal ’ ?
Hmmm .
But he says he ’d ask about it …
So , I ’ll give him the benefit of the doubt .
I called the next day and he seemed bothered as usual and reluctant to reach out to the piano folks .
So , I figured , ‘ Fuck it …let me just make this as painless as possible and just pick some guitars out .
I can turn this stuff around on eBay and buy the equipment I really need . ’
Done deal , right ?
So , I put together my initial wish list based off the prices on SamAsh & GuitarCenter , totaling just under $ 10 k .
The following text is the email correspondence that followed :

FROM : Tonedeff
Hey Don !
How are you sir ?
I ’m just following up and wondering if you had the chance to check availability , etc .
In terms of value , I actually went through and cross referenced all the items on the list with the going retail rates , and it adds up to a little under $ 10 k .
So , I ’m assuming everything should be cool .
Hope to hear from you soon .
Fri , August 18 , 2006 6:42 am
FROM : Don Pitts @ Gibson
Tony , I ’m sorry to inform you that you are wrong on the retail prices .. where did you get the prices ?
your not that far off , but I ’ll get you prices today … .
the only thing I see may be availabilty problem is the John Lennon 160e …. which we may do the Epiphone version … I ’ll get you the avail and list today … sorry it has taken this long .
Fri , August 18 , 2006 11:18 am
FROM : Don Pitts @ Gibson
Tony , hope your well , below is the retail price on each item you chose … let me know when is a good time to talk on phone … thanks !!
MSRP PRICE :
1 ) Gibson Acoustic John Lennon J-160E - – $ 3857.00
2 ) Gibson Les Paul Studio Electric Guitar [ Ebony Chrome ] – $ 1908.00
3 ) Les Paul Supreme Figured Electric Guitar [ Transparent Black ] – $ 4718.00

So the total is $ 13,896.97 ( did not count the Echoplex unit ) …. these prices are straight out of the 2006 Price List .. that was effective 2/15/06 .
Wrong prices ?
He ’s referencing a catalog I was n’t shown apparently .
Confused , I write back …
Friday , August 18 , 2006 12:05 PM
FROM : Tonedeff
Don ,
Thanks for getting back to me .
Hmmm .
I went through to all the major retailer sites and looked up the items and the prices are alot cheaper .
Like … the John lennon guitar is $ 1400 cheaper online than the catalogue price you listed .
For example …
• Gibson Acoustic John Lennon J -160E – $ 2499 @ [ Guitar Center ] | [ Mars Music ]
• Gibson Les Paul Studio Electric Guitar [ Ebony Chrome ] – $ 1369 @ [ Guitar Center ]
• Les Paul Supreme Figured Electric Guitar – $ 3,099 @ [ Guitar Center ]
• Gibson GA20RVT Amp – $ 999 @ [ Guitar Center ]
I ’m avaialable all day if you ’d like me to give you a call .
Fri , August 18 , 2006 12:09 pm
FROM : Don Pitts @ Gibson
Tony ,
Those are not retail prices , but MAP prices , as in Minimum Advertised Price a dealer can sell to the consumer .
What they advertise an instrument for is not the MSRP .
The Fine Print : MSRP vs MAP
At this point , I ’m a bit bummed .
The prize package is based off MSRP ( Manufacture ’s Suggested Retail Price ) as opposed to MAP ( Minimum Advertised Price aka Retail ) ?
In other words , a guitar that anyone can buy from any ole ’ music store for $ 3,099 is WORTH $ 4,718 to Gibson .
That ’s a $ 1,619 MARK UP !
This changes the entire prize package , because a ) I ’d only be able to get HALF the gear I ’d be able to get from a retailer for $ 10 k b ) I ’d have to turn this around on eBay as a USED item which knocks another grand off it and finally c ) I ’m still supposed to pay taxes on $ 10 k .
Fuckin Wow .
Look , I completely understand the situation .
But this entire thing up to this point could have been avoided by one of three ways :
1 ) Give me a catalog with PRICES in it to pick from or 2 ) Give me a $ 10 k gift certificate to a music store .
Would that have been too much to ask ?
Also , there were absolutely no rules or groundwork laid for this .
It all seemed whipped together ‘ as we went along ’ .
So , at this point I ’m logistically trying to lessen the headache this has become .
I email Don Pitts asking for the only logical thing I can think of :
Thursday , August 24 , 2006 12:34 PM
FROM : Tonedeff
Don ,
Ok , well please send me a link or PDF of Gibson catalog that has the MSRP listed .
It ’ll be much eaiser to figure this out .
Thu , August 24 , 2006 12:41 pm
FROM : Don Pitts @ Gibson
Tony …we do not have a PDF of our price list and we do NOT send it out ..
The list I responded to was the MSRP ’s straight from the price list ..
Please decide from that list of the items you want and I will send them to you , so we can get going .
Thanks !
“ So we can get going ? ” Huh ?
I ’M holding up the process now ?
Give me a fucking break , chief .
I ’ve been the most proactive one in this mess the entire time !
First , I ’m told to choose instruments blindly out of a catalog , then I ca n’t get the piano I want , then I ca n’t get the gear that I chose , and now I ’m supposed to just pick 2 guitars that are only worth 5k MAX @ retail when I was supposed to win $ 10 k ?
FUCK THAT .
I want what I won .
And the prize list ( as seen above ) stated $ 10 k worth of gear from Gibson .
‘ WORTH ’ seems to be the key word here .
So , after a night of thought , completely aggravated at the hassle of it all , I decide to try something different .
The Mandolin Maneuver
At this point , I figure , ‘ Fuck it …if they want to play the MSRP game so badly , then so be it .
I ’m finding the most expensive stringed instrument they make . ’
Once again , I proceeded to go online searching for Gibson products and referencing the listed MSRP .
( They ’re always listed below the retail price to show the SAVINGS you get ) .
With that , I found a line of mandolins from Gibson that were $ 9,999 MSRP .
Jackpot .
I won $ 10 k worth of Gibson gear , fair and square .
There ’s no way they can say I can’t have this , right ?
I sent an email asking for that item , saying , “ This should about cover it ” .
I never heard back from him after that .
I guess $ 10 k MSRP does n’t mean $ 10 k MSRP after all , eh ?
The Final Chapter
It had been weeks since I ’d heard from Don Pitts .
Suddenly , out of nowhere , I get an email from the Lollapalooza rep who from Day 1 was super supportive and came through 100 % with everything they ’d promised .
Here ’s the correspondence :
Wed , October 18 , 2006 2:25 pm
FROM : Kevin @ Lollapalooza
Tony , how are you bud ?
Did you ever get everything worked out with Gibson and your free stuff ?
Wednesday , October 18 , 2006 3:09 PM
FROM : Tonedeff
Kevin ,
Hey , good to hear from you !
I ’m doing well .
I ’m glad you reached out .
And no , unfortunately , Don Pitts has been awol .
I ’ve left several phone messages and written at least 3 emails to no avail .
I do n’t know what the hold up is .
Would you mind reaching out to him for me ?
I ’d love to get all of this squared away soon .
I hope all is well with you and I look forward to the recap and the gear .
Thanks !
Uh -oh spaghetti-o’s .
Apparently , the folks @ Lollapalooza had no idea about all of the back & forthing Don Pitts had set in motion .
This is was kind of disturbing because , all of this was happening off of their radar .
They did n’t know whether I got my prize or not .
So , I made a last ditch effort to contact Don .
Thursday , October 19 , 2006 2:01 PM
FROM : Tonedeff
Don , Hello !
I hope things are well .
I ’d really like to get this prize package situation sorted out asap .
Please get back to me as soon as you can .
Thanks !
Within a couple of minutes , Don Pitts finally returns to earth :
Thu , October 19 , 2006 2:05 pm
FROM : Don Pitts @ Gibson
Work with Kevin at CSE , he will contact me .
Thanks !
WOW .
Was the mandolin thing the final straw for ole ’
Don ?
Was it too much work for you to make a couple of phone calls or write an email ?
Not only was I civil throughout all of this , but I was PATIENT as HELL and now I ’m completely cut off from dealing with you ?
That ’s a total dick move .
So , now I have to go through the entire process again with Kevin @ Lollapalooza .
He hits me with the old piecemeal list I gave Don way at the beginning with the inflated prices and asks me to choose .
At this point , I ’m just completely sick of dealing with any of it .
I picked whatever added up to $ 10 k and replied .
Around this time , I had to hop on the Scandinavian Tour with CunninLynguists and was n’t able to do the correspondence thing , but I figured I ’d FINALLY have the gear once I got back .
But , to no avail , upon arrival I found no gear .
It was becoming clearer and clearer that this elusive $ 10 k prize was a myth .
So , I followed up with the standard , “ Hey , I ’m here ” message and got this :
Tue , December 19 , 2006 2:38 pm
FROM : Kevin @ Lollapalooza
Ok , already have some answers for you .
We ’re close to getting this stuff shipped …
Awesome !
It only took 4 months to get to this point and we ’re just now CLOSE to getting it shipped ?
[ Sigh ] .
Well , I responded to the subsequent emails and the like … but it ’s now January 22 , 2008 and I still have n’t seen shit .
Hence this ridiculously long post .
So , Why The Long Wait To Go Public With This ?
In all honesty , I held off on making this public because I was really trying to be a good sport about it .
I did n’t wanna cast a shadow on my name for future Lollapalooza events , etc .
I really did love the entire experience , top to bottom and I want to do it again .
I did n’t want any of this to mar the whole thing for me .
But I ca n’t hold my tongue anymore .
It ’s been a few months since I even bothered to contact anyone .
The last few times I contacted the Lollapalooza folks , they always seem surprised that I had n’t received anything yet .
I ’ve realized that it ’s basically useless to complain to them anymore , because it ’s clear that they ’re still dealing with Don Pitts .
I ’ve even tried calling him myself and no one answers .
( Surprise ! ) .
As of right now , I want the entire WORLD to know how horribly this entire situation was handled by Don Pitts @ Gibson .
And after all my troubles dealing with his lack of direction and continual roadblocks , I do n’t think it would be out of line to ask for $ 10 k in compensation from Gibson .
Think about it – I won $ 10 k worth of gear fair and square , but since they refused to give it to me , should n’t I be entitled to the same value in cash ?
ESPECIALLY after the treatment I ’ve gotten from their rep ?
Clearly , they have no intention on doing that either .
Which is why everyone ’s still in the dark about it .
Maybe they thought I ’d just “ go away ” .
WRONG .
It should n’t matter if I rap , played a spoon or did acapella like Bobby McFerrin – They OWE me , PERIOD .
I hope everyone reads this and sees how they tried to weasel their way out of this , and how they tried to play me cause I ’m a Hip Hop artist .
In Conclusion …
It ’s been a year and a half and I just ca n’t make music in here anymore .
I decided to bite the bullet and max out my credit cards getting an upgrade of gear to work on .
Honestly , I do n’t know how I ’m gonna pay for any of this shit , but I could n’t wait any longer for Gibson to come through with the prize that would have paid for it .
God knows I ’m not making that much off music .
It ’s really the only alternative I have at this point if I want to keep generating music .
I know what you ’re thinking , but filing a lawsuit would be pointless , cause the lawyer would probably end up getting more out of the suit than I would .
So , all I ’m left with is this blog and a heap of debt .
Hopefully , someday , I wo n’t have to ask for days off work to go on tour , or get what I ’m actually owed in this life .
But I guess that ’s all just wishful thinking , right ?

Gmail Plus Address is a very useful trick to save your mailbox from spam .
And if you ever get spammed , you know exactly which website / online service leaked your email address to spammers .
Gmail Plus Address
So what is a Gmail Plus address ?
Say you have an email address like billgates@gmail.com .
If you append a “ plus ” sign to your email username , Gmail will ignore anything written between the + and @ sign in the email address and still deliver the message to the same mailbox .
So any email address sent to billgates+microsoft@gmail.com or billgates+blog@gmail.com or billgates+website@gmail.com will still reach the Gmail inbox of billgates@gmail.com inbox though , technically , they are three different email aliases .
Thus , when you share your email with some non familiar service , like a newsletter , you can supply your existing email with a plus sign - like billgates+websitename@gmail.com .
If you ever receive spam addressed to that email alias , you know the exact source that ’s sending the spam and can easily block all emails using a GMail filter .
Gmail Dot Blindness
Gmail is blind to dots ( or periods ) in your email address .
You can place any number of dots in your email username and they ’ll still land in your inbox .
Going back to the previous address , bill.gates@gmail.com , bi.ll.gates@gmail.com and billgates@gmail.com are seen as the same email address by Gmail but other services may see them as separate email address .
You can use this technique to register multiple email accounts in online services that require unique email address per account .
For instance , if you ever need to create multiple accounts on Twitter , the Gmail Dot trick is the way to got .
Gmail Address Alias
There ’s one more Gmail address trick that may come handy .
When you create a Gmail account , you actually get two email addresses - one is the regular @gmail.com address while the second email address has @googlemail.com in the domain .
That means if your email address in Gmail is something like billgates@gmail.com , all email messages that are sent to billgates@googlemail.com will also be delivered to your own Gmail account .
That ’s two for the price of one .
Like the Gmail plus trick , you can take advantage of these two domains so that less spam reaches your Gmail mailbox .
For instance , give the @googlemail.com address to your close contacts ( put that in the visiting card ) while keep the @gmail.com address for public ( put it on your blog ) .
Then set a Gmail filter such that all email messages with @googlemail.com in the header go a special folder so you will never miss important email from close friends .
And if you multiple Twitter accounts , associate one with your main @gmail.com address and the other with your new @googlemail.com address .
One Thin Dime
Author : Bradley Hughes
E=mc2 .
The most famous formula ever .
Not that there ’s been a lot of competition .
Einstein ’s formula reveals that matter is just one of many forms of energy .
Energy is what gets you out of bed in the morning , and energy is what leaves a bruise if you fall on your face in the late afternoon .
Matter is just a form of energy : a new battery will have just the teensiest tiniest more mass now , than when it has run down .
If you pull back on a bow , you are adding energy to it , and so the bow has infinitesimally more mass when it ’s taunt , than when it ’s relaxed .
Even for something really energetic , like a thermonuclear explosion the amount of mass involved is n’t very big .
If you collected all the detritus from a 25 megaton bomb after the explosion , you would only be missing one kilogram of mass , and an average sized city .
One kilogram is probably close to the mass of that first stone used to help kill that first antelope , so very long ago .
But if you go the other way around , and instead of considering the amount of mass in energy , but the amount of energy you can get from a certain mass , then you ’re talking .
Think about all the energy your body uses in a day : getting up , walking , climbing stairs , pumping blood , breathing , thinking , remembering .
All of that energy is stored as chemical potential energy for a while before you use it .
Most of it dissipates as heat , some of it becomes motion , some becomes thought .
If you could get all of that energy from converting mass into energy , how much mass would you need ?
If , instead of eating and breathing , you could directly convert mass to energy for your whole life , how much extra mass would you need to carry around with you ?
If you lived to be eighty , you would only need a couple thousandths of a gram .
That ’s the mass contained in one thousandth of one thin dime .
Remember every challenge you ’ve surpassed , or run away from ; remember every thought , every passion , every need â€ “ all of it combined took less energy then is contained in the material missing from a scuff on a dime .
If you were a perfect machine , and you wanted to live among us , you would need to pass as human .
You would need to appear to breathe , your blood would pump , your glands would sweat , so you would use about the same amount of energy as we do .
But you would n’t need to power yourself from air and food .
With the right technology , you could convert mass directly to energy .
You could live for eighty thousand years on a dime .
You could live among us , observe us and compile your observations for almost as long as there have been humans .
Almost ten times as long as we have lived in settled communities and nearly twenty times as long as we have lived in cities .
For a quarter , you could live for almost two hundred thousand years .
That ’s as long as we ’ve existed as a species .
If you waited to join us until we started building cities , today you ’d still have one hundred ninety five thousand years left .
That ’s plenty of time to live as we do , to love as we do , and to study .
Then , when our species ’ time has come to an end , there will still be plenty of time to reach your conclusions , and to take them home .

Calling that thing pictured above a " case mod " is a near travesty , but we 're at a loss for words outside of that .
This box is almost devoid of specifications entirely , but judging by the artwork on the " chassis , " it 's powered by a totally rare Intel Pentium 3 CPU , hums along on Ubuntu and features a curiously placed fan , audio in / out , VGA output , a power supply and lots oftape .
Truth be told , we 're not even certain this concoction is capable of processing anything , but at least it 's primed for a shipping label should the creator opt to cut his / her losses .

Anonymous , a small group of scriptkiddies and high - level hackers started a war against the Church of Scientology this week .
Torrent Freak managed to get an exclusive Q&A with the controversial group , in which they ask Pirates to join their fight .
In an attempt to punish Scientology for abusing copyright laws and brainwashing of its members , Anonymous launched a series of DDoS attacks to remove the Church from the Internet .
It seems , however , like this this is only the beginning .
“ We will continue our efforts to bring down Scientology , but we need the help and support of another Freedom fighting community , the pirates . ” one of Anonymous ’ members told TorrentFreak , and the group gave us the opportunity to ask a couple of more questions .
TorrentFreak : Can you briefly describe what “ Project Chanology ” is ?
Anonymous : Project Chanology is the project to bring down Scientology .
Nothing more , nothing less .
Why that name ?
Well , we ’re working from IRC ‘ Channels ’ against ‘ Scientology ’ .
Mix those words together and add the project in front , and you have it .
TorrentFreak : How did Anonymous start ?
and how many people take part in it ?
Anonymous : Anonymous is an old group of friends .
I do n’t exactly know the date , but it has been raised by some friends who wanted to test out their hacking skills .
Since then , they created Anonymous , and let it be open for anyone who wants to join .
That made it into a new kind of hackers - group .
It consists of two spheres .
The outer sphere is for new people .
They mostly are low - skilled and are “ scriptkiddies ” .
Since they have a very good contact with the inner sphere ( we ’re all friends fast and easily ) , anyone is allowed to join the inner sphere of high - level hackers .
This is a loose representation since it does n’t fit always .
But , this made it for sure into a group of scriptkiddies with the right tools and high - level hackers with the right skills .
TorrentFreak :
What is your main motivation to ban Scientology from the Internet ?
Anonymous : Scientology is a malicious organization .
Here ’s a YouTube clip that proves more .
Also , they ’re frequently taking off content from the Internet .
Like a clip in which Cruise promotes Scientology too much , criticizing health science , etc … it would have brought Scientology in a bad situation .
So they took it off all sites with an army of lawyers .
This is censoring .
This is bad .
This is against Net Neutrality .
This is taking away our freedom and our right to fight for that freedom .
TorrentFreak :
Do n’t you think your actions violate the freedom of speech ?
Anonymous :
It does violate the freedom of speech .
Of course , we know that .
But there should be a refinement .
Anonymous fights for freedom of speech in a way they have always used , but a little bit rougher however .
For a greater sake .
TorrentFreak :
Do you see any parallels between your fight against Scientology and the conflicts between pirates and the entertainment industry ?
Anonymous : Yes .
Most of us are pirates too .
We have no big money to start lawsuits .
But the enemy , the MAFIAA and Scientology are both big companies .
They misguide the law , they change the law .
Scientology members have infiltrated in many governments .
Just like the MAFIAA .
TorrentFreak :
What is your ultimate goal for “ Operation Chanology ” ?
Anonymous :
Our ultimate goal is to let Scientology say in public that they are misleading many people .
And that they are destroying the futures of many people .
TorrentFreak :
How do you plan to accomplish this goal , apart from the DDoS attacks ?
Anonymous :
We have IRL raids in planning stage , we have real life protests and demonstrations coming up .
We are infiltrating their networks with zip bombs .
We are sentencing them .
TorrentFreak :
You told us that you wanted the pirates to help you to free the Internet , how can people help ?
Anonymous : People can help Anonymous by joining the IRC , get one of the DDoS tools and start firing the DoS. IRC is at irc.partyvan.org .
Channels are # Target , # Lazer and # Xenu .
There are also many local channels .
They can also help us by joining protests , by telling other people about this , by telling their media , etc …
The force of humanity will save many lives .
…
Update :
As many already argued , it turns out that the person interviewed here is an Anonymous member from the “ outer sphere ” , who is not as informed as he appeared to be .
Sorry .
“ I know that I ’m not as informed as the inner sphere .
However , I had a source which I thought was from there , providing me many answers .
He faked his status .
But we do not have one spokesperson .
We do not have a leader .
We unite as one , divided by none .
Together , we will bring them down in their glory .
We are Anonymous .
We are Legion .
We do not forgive .
We do not forget .
Expect us . ”
For the Democrats , who have a base of support that clearly wants out of Iraq , framing the issue in terms of Afghanistan makes it a lot easier , politically , to pull out of Iraq .
But leaving Iraq will be no easy thing .
Experts who side with Mr. McCain argue that a quick American exit from Iraq could lead to a conflagration in the Middle East that could end up involving Saudi Arabia and Iran in a Shia - Sunni - Kurd war  a conflict that would have few winners and would likely produce an enormous number of civilian casualties .
Beyond that , the logistics of pulling out 130,000 troops from Iraq would be daunting , and it could take close to a year to get all the equipment out .
Indeed , some military experts say that if the United States military was given a year to exit Iraq , it would be so consumed with the logistics that it would n’t be able to do anything else .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates entered the fray earlier this month , for a moment sounding almost like the ( gasp ! ) Clinton and Obama camps by urging Europeans to draw a distinction between the wars .
During remarks on his way to Munich to take the Europeans to task for not sending enough troops to support NATO in Afghanistan , Mr. Gates said part of the problem was that many Europeans were conflating Iraq with Afghanistan .
“ I worry that for many Europeans the missions in Iraq and Afghanistan are confused , ” Mr. Gates said .
“ I think they combine the two . ”
It was an unusually candid acknowledgment from a senior member of the Bush administration that the war in Iraq had exacted a cost , in NATO ’s chances for victory in Afghanistan .
Many Europeans , Mr. Gates said , “ have a problem with our involvement in Iraq and project that to Afghanistan , and do not understand the very different  for them  the very different kind of threat . ”
The problem is , with the United States Army stretched thin in Iraq , the Bush administration has , thus far , been left to hector its NATO allies to send additional troops to handle the growing Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan .
And European populations generally disapprove of their troops being sent into harm ’s way in Afghanistan .
No surprise , given the opposition on the streets of Europe to the American invasion of Iraq .
That ’s what Mr. Gates means when he says that Europeans conflate the two :
Why help the United States in Afghanistan , the European logic goes , when America would be able to handle Afghanistan much more easily if its G.I. ’s were n’t bogged down in Iraq ?
In any case , the dynamics of the two conflicts are not the same , many foreign policy experts stress .
The rapidly deteriorating situation on the Afghanistan / Pakistan border , the Musharraf government ’s increased inability to confront Islamist insurgents in its border provinces , combined with the resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan have turned AfPak into America ’s No. 1 national security problem , these experts say , even as parts of Iraq seem to have quieted since more American troops were sent there last year .
Conditions in Pakistan became even more volatile on Monday after the party of President Pervez Musharraf suffered a drubbing in parliamentary elections , leading some to question how long Mr. Musharraf will be able to cling to power and how much of his already diminished authority he can retain .
And Pakistan , the experts say , is inextricably linked to Afghanistan .
“ Losing Afghanistan would be far more consequential than losing Iraq , ” says Bruce Hoffman , a Georgetown University professor who was an adviser on counterterrorism to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad in 2004 .
“ If Pakistan , especially along the border , fell into complete disarray , the integrity of the Afghan country and its government will be even more threatened , and that would have far greater repercussions for us . ”
A judge in Nevada has just ordered MSNBC to include Rep. Dennis Kucinich in Tuesday 's Democratic Party presidential debate in Las Vegas or he will cancel the forum .
Senior Clark County District Court Judge Charles Thompson vowed to issue an injunction halting the nationally televised debate if MSNBC failed to comply .
Kucinich had filed a lawsuit seeking to be included just this morning .
( UPDATE : Late Monday , according to the Associated Press , NBC indicated that if Judge Thompson officially signed his order Tuesday morning , it would appeal that decision to the Nevada Supreme Court , seeking to keep Kucinich out of the evening 's debate . )
The judge ruled Monday it was a matter of fairness and Nevada voters would benefit from hearing from more than just Hillary Clinton , John Edwards and Barack Obama .
Kucinich had been invited to participate in the 6 p.m. Pacific debate Tuesday , but that invitation was rescinded last week following the ....
A confidential 2003 manual for operating the Guantánamo detention center shows that military officials had a policy of denying detainees access to independent monitors from the International Committee of the Red Cross .
The manual said one goal was to “ exploit the disorientation and disorganization felt by a newly arrived detainee , ” by denying access to the Koran and by preventing visits with Red Cross representatives , who have a long history of monitoring the conditions under which prisoners in international conflicts are held .
The document said that even after their initial weeks at Guantánamo , some detainees would not be permitted to see representatives of the International Red Cross , known as the I.C.R.C .
It was permissible , the document said , for some long - term detainees to have “ No access .
No contact of any kind with the I.C.R.C. ”
Some legal experts and advocates for detainees said yesterday that the policy might have violated international law , which provides for such monitoring to assure humanitarian treatment and to limit the ability of governments to hold detainees secretly .
Criminalizing the Customers Prostitution Ban Huge Success in Sweden
Sweden has drastically reduced human trafficking and prostitution by imposing a ban on the purchase of sexual services , the first of its kind worldwide .
But many sex workers argue the ban robs them of their livelihood and makes them more vulnerable to violence .

The practice of locking cell phones to a specific carrier is heading for court in the US .
The California Supreme Court has given the go - ahead to a lawsuit that targets T - Mobile for the practice , after the company had tried to get the suit dismissed .
The class action lawsuit , filed by Bruce Gatton and Christina Nguyen , also addresses the carrier 's required early termination fees .
If they succeed in court , the decision could carry some ramifications not just within California , but throughout the rest of the country .
Perhaps more importantly to many Apple fans , it could also affect the iPhone .
The suit asks for an injunction against T - Mobile , barring it from charging the $ 200 early termination fee to customers who choose to exit their contracts early .
The plaintiffs also seek an order that would force the carrier to unlock the handsets that it sells so that customers can take them to other carriers .
T - Mobile had originally asked for the suit to be thrown out , arguing that its terms of service agreement required customers to go through arbitration with a neutral mediator before taking the case to court .
The plaintiffs fought back against the motion , however , claiming that their cases were not arbitrable under the Unfair Competition Law and the state 's Consumer Legal Remedies Act .
T- Mobile lost the motion to compel arbitration because the trial court felt that the request for injunctive relief was for the benefit of the public , and also that the clause to arbitrate the unlocking claim was unconscionable .
T - mobile eventually appealed the decision to the California Supreme Court , but the seven - judge panel would n't hear it .
The California Supreme Court 's ruling means that the case will likely go to trial , where T - Mobile will have to duke it out with some undoubtedly angry customers .
And the outcome will matter to many more : if the case goes in favor of the plaintiffs , carriers in the US — or at least in California — will likely be forced to offer to unlock all handsets sold to the public and drop early contract termination fees .
The practice of locking phones to a carrier has been a hot topic among gadgetphiles lately due to a number high - profile lawsuits against Apple over the same issue .
Two class action suits targeting the iPhone - AT&T lock - in were filed this month in California , both pointing out that major carriers are often willing to provide unlock codes for handsets after a certain period of time with the carrier — something that AT&T refuses to do for the iPhone .
It is ( reasonably ) speculated that the strict lock - down of the iPhone to AT&T is due to the rumored revenue - sharing agreement between the two companies , which benefits everyone involved but the consumer .
Assuming T - Mobile loses its case , it could set in motion a chain of events that could result in unlocked iPhones floating around the state of California .
And if they 're in California , it wo n't be long before they make their way out to the rest of the US , or the world .
With at least one House committee rooting for the abolishment of anticompetitive lock - ins , pressure is building on the cellular carriers ' phone lock - in practices .
The parliamentarian assembly of the Council of Europe on Wednesday ( 23 January ) backed a report saying the use of terrorist black - lists by the UN and the EU violate fundamental rights .
Besides breaching human rights , the procedures used by both the UN Security Council and the EU to put individuals or groups suspected of having links with terrorism on a black - list are " completely arbitrary " , the Council of Europe lawmakers said in a statement .
" Even the members of the committee which decides on blacklisting are not given all the reasons for blacklisting particular persons or groups " , the assembly stated .
" Usually , those persons or groups are not told that blacklisting has been requested , given a hearing or even , in some cases , informed of the decision – until they try to cross a frontier or use a bank account .
There is no provision for independent review of these decisions , " it added .
According to the report , around 370 people and 130 groups or organisations are currently on the UN 's black - list , while the EU lists 60 people or groups – including the radical Palestinian group Hamas and the Basque separatists ETA .
Among other things , being on such a list means having one 's assets frozen , and being banned from travelling outside one 's country .
It is the governments who choose who is put on the black - lists , but they currently do it disrespecting the right to a fair trial , according to the author of the report , Dick Marty .
The former Swiss state prosecutor called for those that are about to be blacklisted to be notified and then compensated in cases where no evidence is found against them – as has happened .
However , " it is almost impossible " to be withdrawn from such a list , Mr Marty said , citing the case of The People 's Mujahedin of Iran ( PMOI ) as an example .
The PMOI had been classified as a terrorist organisation but protested and won its case at the European Court of Justice – however , it is today still on the EU 's black - list .
" People remain on these lists for years without knowing why , and their lives are ruined " , Mr Marty was quoted as saying by German news agency DPA .
The Council of Europe - an institution gathering 47 member states and aiming to protect human rights and promote democratic principles - concluded that " this kind of procedure is unworthy of international institutions like the UN and EU " .
I used to be really into politics before I realized that it's a soulcrushing venue full of pigs and jackals with few good guys to root for and not enough hope for anything good to ever really get done .
Well , if we had more politicians like Chris Knight around , maybe I 'd get interested again .
This commercial , which aired in Rockingham County , North Carolina , last year , is pretty much the best campaign ad ever created by a pretty sizable margin .
I do n't want to be too bold here , but might I suggest Colbert / Knight 2008 ?
Now that would energize the young voters of America .

Iraq has said the Turkish incursion could destabilise the region
" The shorter the better , " he said , adding that Ankara should attempt to reconcile with its Kurdish minority .
Turkish troops began an offensive against the Kurdistan Workers ' Party , the PKK , on Thursday .
The PKK says it has shot down a Turkish Cobra attack helicopter during clashes in the area .
Ahmed Danees , head of foreign relations for the PKK , made the claim - which has not been independently verified .
" At 6 pm ( 1500 GMT ) yesterday , our fighters shot down a Cobra helicopter , " he told Reuters news agency .
He added that this had happened in the remote Chamsku area , close to the border .
Grievances
Speaking at the end of a visit to Australia , Mr Gates said military strikes by Turkey would not be enough on their own to end the long - running dispute with Kurdish rebels .
Gates urged Turkey to respect Iraq 's sovereignty
He said America 's experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan showed that military muscle should be complemented by efforts to address grievances held by minority groups .
" These economic and political measures are really important because after a certain point people become inured to military attacks , " he said .
" And if you do n't blend them with these kinds of non-military initiatives then at a certain point the military efforts become less and less effective . "
Mr Gates also urged Turkey to respect Iraq 's sovereignty .
The American defence secretary will deliver his advice in person when he travels to Ankara next week .
' Terrorist group '
The Turkish authorities launched the cross - border attack after accusing the Iraqi government of failing to stop members of the PKK from using the area as a safe haven .
Iraq 's foreign minister has warned that any escalation of Turkey 's operation against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq could destabilise the region .
More than 30,000 people have been killed since the PKK began fighting for a Kurdish homeland in south - eastern Turkey in 1984 .
The US , the EU and Turkey consider the PKK to be a terrorist organisation .
SHOCKING – or De-sensitizing ?
2 December , 2007
Posted by paralleldivergence in advertising
GOVERNMENTS and authorities around the world have been using shock tactics in “ Public Service Announcements ” for several years now , but their use of graphic advertising has been on the increase .
Certainly , it is universally acknowledged that smoking , driving without a seat belt and drugs are dangerous and carry certain risks , but it seems the public needs to be reminded , often on a daily basis , of these dangers in gory detail .
In the above advertisement from Australia , we are shown the real , personal aftermath of a short lifetime of smoking .
This is literally one of hundreds of such ads now being aired in countries all over the planet .
These may cause smokers to try to quit , but will this stop people taking up smoking in the first place ?
Many young people have a short attention span and that is especially when it comes to thinking about the future .
If they know smoking is not going to kill you within days , then the youth wo n’t care .
This will again be dismissed as everyone who starts smoking believes they can quit at any time .
Despite these shock ads , that ’s not going to change .
Maybe authorities should move away from the graphic scare campaign and onto more behavior - related methods .
Most non-smokers ( young and old ) are turned off by smoking .
Seeing someone you find attractive turn and light up a cigarette is a huge turn - off for so many people .
If smokers realised this they might think about it a bit more .
Shame not scare .
Now what about all those “ horror ” safe - driving campaigns ?
The next one here is a quite powerful one from a series of UK ads based on the “ Think ! ” concept .
This one asks from two angles , “ How does what you do affect others ? ”
From Norway came a clever and highly visual example of how seat belts save lives .
Here is the Icelandic version of it .
And another of the UK “ Think ! ” ads , this time looking at how driving just a little over the speed limit can really alter a situation , with deadly consequences .
Finally , this is probably the most graphic Public Service Announcement I ’ve ever seen .
It ’s a Canadian Work Safety ad aiming to alert employees to be more vigilant and careful at work .
It also pulls at heartstrings by introducing the human in the story to the audience , so she ’s not just some nameless , faceless crash test dummy .
So , the real question is , do they work ?
Are smoking rates going down because of these ads or because its being banned from most indoor areas across the western world ?
Do more people wear seat belts and less people talk on their cell phone while driving because they ’ve been terrorised by these graphic public service announcements or because more and more people are being fined for these offences ?
Are people slowing down because they are terrified of killing a child or because of the ever growing use of speed cameras ?
And as for the last ad , hell , I do n’t know if I want to go to work tomorrow !
Whether the ads are working or not , there is a pretty serious side - effect .
The more these types of ads are shown , the more we as a society are being de-sensitized .
Most of the comments at YouTube attached to these ads are mocking the people and situations in them .
There ’s very little sense of horror and more of the opposite – hilarity .
The people commenting at YouTube are Internet veterans .
They ’ve seen everything there is to see .
From hostages being decapitated in Iraq through to the worst imaginable XXX porn .
All just a few clicks of the mouse away .
Just what will a de-sensitized society be like , I wonder ?
We may not have to wait too long to find out .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The chances of the United States avoiding a recession appear to be growing dimmer by the day , and any contraction in the economy will likely last longer and be more severe than other downturns in the past 20 years .

Recent reports have shown the housing market slump and rising defaults in the mortgage market are now taking their toll on job growth and on the manufacturing and services sector .
But heavy consumer debt , a growing federal budget gap , and rising prices could make any recession worse than Americans have experienced over the past two decades .
“ If we do go into recession , it ’s going to be more severe and long - lasting than the last one , ” said Jeffrey Frankel , a Harvard professor and member of the private - sector panel that dates U.S. recessions .
The nation ’s last two recessions , in 1990 - 1991 and 2001 , each lasted for just eight months .
But the two downturns that ended in 1975 and 1982 , when economic conditions bore some similarities to today , each lasted 16 months , making them the longest recessions since the Great Depression of the 1930s , according to the National Bureau of Economic Research , the accepted arbiter of U.S. recessions .
The U.S. economy entered the recessions of 1975 and 1982 saddled with huge government budget deficits from spending on social programs and the Vietnam war , and was suffering double - digit consumer price inflation .
Frankel said members of NBER ’s business - cycle dating panel have been in contact with each other over the prospect of a recession through e-mails , but it would likely take months , or perhaps even more than a year , for the panel to determine whether the economy had turned down .
Even though the latest data showed a loss of jobs in January , and the largest monthly decline on record in an index of service - sector activity , Frankel thinks a recession is not yet at hand .
“ My description is that we are teetering on the edge , ” he said .
WILL TOOLS WORK ?
Some economists warn against counting on government spending and lower interest rates , the tools commonly used to battle recession , because the fiscal deficit is already large and consumer price inflation rose to its highest level in 17 years in 2007 .
“ So far , the Federal Reserve has been having a lot of luck , ” said Eugenio Aleman , senior economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis , but Aleman thinks inflation will tie the Fed ’s hands .
“ But the Federal Reserve will be pushed to increase interest rates and then we are going to go into a true recession , a longer recession than what we are expecting today , ” he said .
The main factor keeping overall inflation high has been soaring energy prices , the largest single driver of inflation over the past year .
Crude oil prices reached a record $ 100 a barrel last month .
“ I would be happier to see if we got a real break on oil prices and that ’s not happening and that ’s a little bit disconcerting , ” said Bernard Baumohl , managing director at The Economic Outlook Group in Princeton Junction , New Jersey .
While the central bank has said it expects inflation to moderate , there are signs lofty energy prices have begun to filter through to prices more widely .
The government said last week that the Federal Reserve ’s favorite inflation gauge , the core price index for personal spending excluding food and energy , rose 2.2 percent last year , above the 2.0 percent ceiling seen as the top of the “ comfort zone ” for the index .
At the same time , the government ’s budget is moving further from balance .
On Monday , President George W. Bush released a budget plan that would see the U.S. deficit widen to $ 410 billion for the current fiscal year and $ 407 billion for fiscal 2009 , not far from the record hit in fiscal 2004 .
The last time the economy moved into recession , in 2001 , there was a budget surplus , providing an opportunity for extra government spending to boost economic growth .
In addition , consumers were not as heavily in debt and credit was more freely available .
Consumer spending represents for roughly two - thirds of total U.S. economic output and for the 2007 year consumer spending grew at the slowest pace since 2003 .
“ My biggest concern right now is the consumer .
The consumer is highly levered and when the economy faces a credit crunch on in a highly levered scenario , then you have trouble , ” warned Aleman .
Usually an FAQ starts with the easiest - to - answer questions .
Those are , after all , the ones that are asked frequently !
But today I wanted to handle some of the hardest - to - answer questions : questions about the paper coming from people who are extremely knowledgeable about selection in the genome .
We are working on three years of papers describing local and genome - wide scans of positive selection .
At this point , the " best " methods each have weaknesses , and our method ( the LDD , or " linkage disequilibrium decay " test ) is no exception .
People who know the weaknesses should be wondering , how have we taken them into account ?
In a tight six - page limit , it is impossible to answer every valid question .
We accentuated the most obvious ones , but we considered a wide array of others ( and dealt with many during peer review ) .
Still , it would be good to have a resource where these issues are hashed out for anyone to read them .
To that end , I 've compiled a list of " rarely asked questions " : what I see as some of the most critical problems with a study of recent selection like ours , and how we 've addressed these in a way that makes our study conservative .
I will be adding to this list as I come across new critiques .
And for those who are n't quite conversant with genomic techniques , I will be putting up a frequently asked question list tomorrow !
Methods to detect recent selection all have biases of one kind or another .
How can we be sure that one or more of these biases have n't really exaggerated the number of alleles in your dataset ?
We are working with a tremendous advantage that previous studies of recent selection have lacked : Mathematics .
Unquestionably , there are biases in the data , and as described below we have minimized these to the extent possible .
But unlike every other study , we actually describe the theoretical reasons why selection should have accelerated in the human genome .
Personally , I can't believe that nobody noticed how extreme these estimates of recent selection really are .
I guess that folks doing genomics just were n't as primed in evolutionary theory to perceive how weird the human estimates looked compared to what is measured in the wild on other species , or even over the span of human evolution !
In the earliest studies , when people were finding that 3 or 4 percent of a sample of genes had signs of recent selection , those numbers were already extremely high .
They got even higher , as more and more powerful methods of detecting selection came online .
Our current estimate is the highest yet , but even this very high number is perfectly consistent with theoretical predictions coming from human population numbers .
At one level , the mathematical answer is as simple as " more people means more mutations . "
But more deeply , we can predict a linear response of new selected alleles to population size , and we can model this response with respect to a particular frequency range .
The genome is a complicated place -- with different mutations originating at different times , selected at different strengths , consequently with different fixation probabilities and different current frequencies .
For some reason , nobody really tried to describe this mathematically before .
Now , our model is extremely simple -- it can be challenged on several specific bases .
For instance , population increase was not a simple exponential -- it grew in fits and starts , with some significant crashes .
The average strength of selected mutations probably changed over time , and the distribution of the strength of selection may have departed from our assumptions .
Even the adaptive mutation rate may have changed over time .
Still , the general prediction is quite clear : the population has grown , its conditions of existence have changed , and as a result selection on new mutations should have accelerated .
And the observed data fit our theoretical prediction exceptionally well .
Certainly we could do better if we made a more detailed model , and we will be doing some of that in future papers .
But mathematical simplicity has a great virtue : we can see precisely why human historical changes should have accelerated this aspect of our evolution , and we can see the magnitude of the response .
That magnitude greatly outweighs all potential biases .
I read on Gene Expression that the statistical power to detect selection varies based on allele age .
You have the greatest power to detect things in the last 20,000 years .
So it 's no surprise that you find the most variants in that time period .
How can you claim this is evidence of acceleration ?
P - ter 's post on this problem is well - detailed .
This is quite an obvious issue -- if we are trying to detect alleles between 20 and 80 percent frequency , it is clear that we are going to be detecting recent things -- many old things would already have been fixed .
But we wo n't detect just any recent things -- in fact , we will not be able to detect recent things that are weakly selected .
By contrast , we should detect older things that are weakly selected , but we will never detect older things that were strongly selected -- they 're the ones that are fixed now .
We find a peak in the number of selected variants around 5500 years ago in Europeans , around 8000 years ago in Africans .
That corresponds to a strength of selection around 3 percent or more .
We find relatively fewer variants -- in fact , many times fewer , with a strength of selection of 1 percent or less .
In theory , strongly selected mutations ought to be vanishingly rare .
In fact , they ought to be exponentially rarer than weakly selected mutations .
That does n't mean the theory has to be right , but it does mean we need some kind of explanation if we find that weakly selected things are rare , and strongly selected ones are common -- I mean , R. A . Fisher was wrong sometimes , but I 'm not going out on a limb on this one .
Acceleration can explain this reversal -- there simply were n't as many weakly selected mutations 15,000 years ago , because there were n't as many people .
The more strongly selected mutations in the last 8000 years actually were very rare per individual , but there were many , many more people to generate them .
But maybe ascertainment bias for recent alleles might explain this reversal of theoretical expectations ?
Here 's the problem : Suppose we are missing lots of selected alleles older than 10,000 years ago .
That means there has been even more selection than we now think in the last 40,000 years .
We were very careful in the paper not to tie the test of acceleration to the age distribution of selection .
The age distribution fits the acceleration theory beautifully , but this fit is not enough -- if we are willing to believe that selection was always intensely powerful and rapid in humans , then finding that it has recently powerful and rapid would be no surprise !
For this reason , we tested the theory of a constant rate of selection against other kinds of data -- data that are n't drawn from the LDD test .
We showed that a constant rate makes many false predictions -- it predicts a tenfold lower heterozygosity than we see genome - wide , it predicts a very powerful association of heterozygosity with recombination rate , it predicts an extremely large number of recently fixed alleles , and it predicts 6 million adaptive substitutions between humans and chimpanzees .
None of these predictions are close to reality .
The rate could n't always have been as high as it is now .
Now , suppose we missed a large fraction of old events with the LDD test .
That means that the total number of recent events would be much larger than we have estimated .
Which means that the recent rate of selection would have been much higher .
Which means that a constant rate at that much higher level is even further from reality .
The LDD test is better at detecting selection in areas with low recombination rates .
Is n't this is an obvious bias on the analysis ?
Possibly .
But it is a conservative bias .
Consider : if we have a higher power in some regions of the genome , then we are actually missing events in others .
That makes our assessments into underestimates of recent selection .
We have made this even more conservative by simply eliminating areas of the genome with very low recombination rates .
We did n't include such areas at all , even though other studies have found selected variants in them .
But more important , the denser dataset has allowed us greater power in finding selection in areas of higher recombination .
This has resulted in a broad addition of new variants to our list of selected alleles , particularly in the Yoruba sample were background LD is lower than the European or Asian samples .
One recent review ( Nielsen et al. 2007 ) showed that a high proportion of alleles found by the LDD test were in areas of low recombination .
But this comparison is very misleading -- that review limited itself to selected alleles shared in all sampled populations -- a tiny subset of 90 genes out of the total 1800 listed by Wang et al. ( 2006 ) .
These are predominantly the oldest alleles -- for which the age - related ascertainment bias is the greatest , and the power is strongest in low recombination regions .
Strikingly , we found that increasing the SNP density in the new HapMap made very little difference to the number of selected variants estimated for the CEU sample -- we believe this is because we are finding basically everything there for the method to find .
This leaves significant limits -- for instance , the limited frequency window we used .
But we do n't think we are missing lots of selection in high - recombination regions .
But wait a minute .
What if you are finding more variants in areas of low recombination because they are false positives -- in other words , because you are finding alleles that actually were n't selected ?
Ah , the opposite ascertainment bias .
This is what we have worked the hardest to avoid -- false positives .
We have deliberately excluded areas of the genome to avoid them , and we have used very conservative threshold values for our tests to minimize them .
There are several strong reasons to believe that we are not looking at neutral alleles .
Here 's what we wrote in the paper :
Recent genetic drift including founder effects would affect all genomic regions equally , but the candidate selected genes occur predominantly in genic regions , and preferentially include genes in functional classes that are plausible targets for recent adaptive changes .
Selection is the only explanation consistent with all these features .
Almost certainly , we have some false positives .
But they can not be very common , or they would distort these clear alternative signs of selection .
And more important , we are talking about a number of selected variants 100 times greater than we would expect under a constant rate .
If we overestimated by a third ( that would be a high error rate , which I think is very improbable ) , the rate has accelerated by 70 times .
If we threw 90 percent of our list away , we would still be looking at an acceleration of 10 times faster !
The numbers coming out of every other group looking at selection are within the ballpark of ours , so this is no surprise .
In other words , our tests of acceleration do not depend very finely on the ascertainment of these alleles .
I believe our assessments are correct and conservative -- if we made errors , they were by underestimating selection rather than overestimating it .
But every distribution has a tail .
If you use any kind of threshold , even a 99.5 % threshold , you are going to have false positives , are n't you ?
And across the whole genome , does n't that add up to a large number ?
Our assessment counts the most extreme 0.5 percent of LD clusters as positively selected .
Since the entire genome includes all the selected sites , this is conservative .
Simulations showed that this value produced very few false positives .
And we have a check against false positives -- if there were many neutral clusters in the data , they would not be associated in genic regions , sorted into certain functional categories , found across the entire range of frequencies , etc .
Also , false positives are very likely to be placed in the oldest time range where LD decay has proceeded to the greatest extent .
If false positives were very common , we would see an elevation in this time range , which we do n't see .
Why did n't you just used the phased data ?
Well , the HapMap phased data are freely downloadable now and I 've been working with them .
The advantage of working with phased data is that we can look for lower - frequency variants .
I 'll be giving an example of that next week .
But the phased data were n't available when we did the analysis .
And the LDD test really is an elegant way of dealing with unphased genotypes .
Do n't we expect evolution to be faster on shorter time scales ?
The " acceleration " you are finding could just be the fact you are looking at a short window of time .
Geneticists may not have seen this question , but paleontologists will be intimately familiar with it .
When we look at evolutionary changes over very long time scales , there is an averaging effect .
Fluctuations over time tend to average out , so that the long - term change is relatively slight when measured per year .
In contrast , when we look at evolutionary changes over a short time , any immediate fluctuation will tend to add to the rate of change .
So measuring change per year yields a relatively high rate .
It is quite obvious that a very high rate of change in phenotypes per generation cannot be maintained indefinitely .
For instance , a reduction of 0.01 percent per generation shrinks a trait to only 1 percent of its initial size in only 40000 generations .
Most organisms can't seamlessly shrink down to one percent of their size -- selection ultimately constrains their size .
So even very low rates of change cannot be maintained over evolutionary time scales .
From that perspective , we may view it is basically unsurprising that human skeletal features have been rapidly evolving over the last 10,000 years .
Sure , this is a higher measured rate than ever before -- even over equivalent time spans like the Neandertal - modern transition in Europe .
But it can not be sustained indefinitely , and may just be an artifact of looking at a sharp fluctuation in a narrow window of time .
I do n't think that argument applies cleanly to the last 10,000 years .
For one thing , the measured rate of skeletal change actually is surprisingly high , not only compared to longer timespans in the past , but also compared to equivalent timespans .
But more to the point , the direction of change has been consistent across populations even as they grew in size .
This is not some momentary fluctuation in our evolution , it is an exceptional transient from one state to another .
But even more important , the distinction between short - term and long - term changes in phenotype are simply not relevant to allele frequencies .
Positive selection is always relatively rapid on a geological time scale .
Some alleles can reverse themselves over long periods of time -- increasing and then later decreasing in frequency , or even holding themselves in long - term stasis .
But when we count an exceptionally large number of recent alleles , we are not looking at a normal situation .
Most fluctuations do not involve complete reversal -- it is unlikely for a fixed substitution to subsequently be erased completely from our species .
So comparing short and long - term changes to gene sequences is comparing like with like to a much greater extent than is true of phenotypes .
How can you say anything at all about the rate of adaptive mutations ?
Everybody knows that adaptive mutations ( choose one ) occur rarely if ever ... happen almost as common as deleterious ones ... depend on the environment , which was constantly changing !
Believe it or not , we actually had a reviewer tell us that positive selection " rarely if ever " happens .
Rarely if ever !
This was a geneticist !
I think it must have been a slip of the keyboard .
In any event , the intrinsic rate of new adaptive mutations per genome ( as opposed to per population ) is incredibly important in determining how fast selection should have happened in recent populations .
The beauty is that we do n't have to know what this rate is .
We do n't have to make any assumption about this rate .
In fact , we have structured our analysis so that this unknown rate is what we estimate using the data from the LDD test .
The incredible strength of our analysis is that we can assess the predictions based on this rate against other sources of data .
That is , the LDD test generates a hypothesis about the rate of recent change , and we can show that observed rate is absolutely impossible as a long - term rate of change .
Hence , evolution accelerated .
The obvious weakness is that for simplicity we assume the rate is constant , but it almost certainly changed over time .
However , we have structured the analysis to be conservative with respect to the most probable kinds of changes .
For example , what I think is most likely by far is that the intrinsic rate of new adaptive mutations per genome increased greatly during the last 20,000 years , because new environments created new selection pressures .
People lived with greater and greater mismatches to their environments , and as Fisher ( 1930 ) showed , this means that adaptive mutations should have become more and more likely .
But naturally , if adaptive mutations became more and more likely per genome , that must cause an acceleration of the rate of adaptive mutations per population .
So this category of change leads to acceleration .
This is precisely what I think happened .
Less likely is that the environmental changes made adaptive mutations less likely per genome .
But even in this case , our analysis must be conservative .
If such mutations are intrinsically less likely , but we are still seeing a very large number of them , then our data still show acceleration .
In fact , the conclusion would be that population number must have been even more important to acceleration than we thought , because on a per population basis it outweighed an intrinsic reduction in the rate of new adaptive mutations per genome .
Again , I think this is unlikely for the time period we are talking about .
It might be closer to the actual pattern over the past 100 years or so , when mortality selection really has decreased in many populations .
What about the Haldane limit ?
I thought such rapid evolution was impossible !
J. B. S. Haldane famously estimated that the substitution cost of new alleles in humans limited the rate of adaptive evolution .
In his estimate , the slow rate of human reproduction limited substitutions to one every 300 generations .
This became known as the " Haldane limit " .
Motoo Kimura used Haldane 's argument as a reason why selection could not explain the substitution rate , and he asserted that as support for his neutral theory of molecular evolution .
We do not challenge neutralism , but it is clear that Haldane 's limit is a problem , since every estimate says that humans have been evolving at many times that rate .
Maynard Smith ( 1968 , Nature ) showed that Haldane 's argument depended on the unrealistic assumption of independence among all selected loci , so that the substitution load depends critically on the fitness of the optimal genotype among all selected loci .
If selection on many loci is non-independent , then a very large number of genes may be selected with the same substitution load as a single gene under Haldane 's assumptions .
Later , Ewens ( e.g. , 1972 , Am Naturalist ) made a similar argument .
Ewens ( 2004 , Mathematical Population Genetics ) reviewed this problem , pointing out an additional weakness of Haldane 's argument : it depends solely on mortality selection , while many genes may be under fertility selection .
These considerations show that Haldane 's limit does not constrain the adaptive substitution rate in humans to 1/300 generations , and our estimated rate of 13 per generation is not excluded .
Moreover , considering the high infant and juvenile mortality evidenced in Neolithic and later populations , much of that death rate resulting directly from disease and dietary deficiencies , the number of selective deaths available to drive substitutions has clearly been high .
No time tonight to add references , I will put these in an update tomorrow .
South Korea is also seeking regular passenger services
The train journey
The flower - strewn cargo train , carrying raw materials for an industrial zone , left South Korea early in the morning .
It will run 25 km ( 16 miles ) to Bongdong in the North before returning .
The service was agreed at an October summit between leaders of the Koreas , only the second since the peninsula was divided more than five decades ago .
Cargo trains will cross the border every week day , slashing the cost of transporting goods to and from the jointly run Kaesong industrial zone , just north of the border .
Several South Korean firms have bases in Kaesong , where they have access to cheaper labour .
Until now , trucks have been moving raw materials and finished goods back and forth across the border .
Wider links
Lee Chul , president of Korea Railroad , said the economic benefits of the link were countless .
THE TWO KOREAS 1910 : Korean Peninsula colonised by Japan 1945 : Divided into US - backed South and Soviet - backed North 1950 - 1953 : Korean War , no peace deal signed 1987 : North Korea bombs a South airliner , killing 115 1990s : South Korea introduces conciliatory Sunshine Policy 2000 : Kim Jong-il and Kim Dae- jung hold first leaders ' summit 2007 : Kim Jong-il and Roh Moo-hyun hold second leaders ' summit
History of the Korean War
" Though we start with a cargo train , it will lead to a passenger train service and will soon be linked to the continental trains , " he told journalists as the train left South Korea .
Seoul is seeking wider rail links with North Korea that would allow connections to China , Russia and beyond , but Pyongyang has so far opposed this .
It is also seeking regular cross - border passenger services .
" I'm happy to drive this train to the North where both my parents were born , " said driver Shin Jang - chul .
" I hope not only cargoes but tourists as well will use this train to go back and forth . "
Rail lines between the two sides were severed during the 1950 - 53 Korean War .
No peace deal was signed , meaning that North and South Korea remain technically at war .
But in recent years Seoul has pursued a policy of economic engagement with Pyongyang and worked to ease tensions .
Roads were reconnected following the first inter-Korean summit in 2000 , and a second was held in Pyongyang in October .
There South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun and North Korean leader Kim Jong - il signed a wide - ranging accord calling for greater peace and economic partnership .
The rail service is the first concrete achievement to come out of the summit .
The Supreme Court hears arguments on Monday in a case about whether Kentucky ’s use of a “ cocktail ” of injected poisons to carry out the death penalty is unconstitutional .
We believe that the death penalty , no matter how it is administered , is unconstitutional and wrong .
If a state does execute anyone , it must do so in a way that is humane and does not impose needless suffering .
Kentucky ’s method does not meet that standard .
Popular support for capital punishment is , thankfully , declining in this country .
The growing number of exonerations of innocent people on death row has shown that the system cannot be trusted to make such an irrevocable decision .
There is considerable evidence of racial discrimination in the application of the death penalty .
After years of botched electrocutions and other horrors , it is clear that the methods of taking life are barbaric .
In Kentucky , and nearly all of the states that have capital punishment , executions are carried out by injection of a three - drug “ cocktail . ”
This is supposedly more humane than the electric chair .
The more one learns about lethal injection , the less humane it appears .
There is considerable evidence that inmates do not go peacefully or easily .
Instead they are reported to feel suffocation , paralysis and excruciating pain .
This is particularly true when poorly trained , unskilled workers are administering the drugs , which is all too often the case .
BAGHDAD , Oct. 29  Guided by American legal advisers , the Iraqi government has canceled a controversial development contract with the Russian company Lukoil for a vast oil field in Iraq ’s southern desert , freeing it up for potential international investment in the future .
In response , Russian authorities have threatened to revoke a 2004 deal under the Paris Club of creditor nations to forgive $ 13 billion in Iraqi debt , a senior Iraqi official said .
The field , West Qurna , has estimated reserves of 11 billion barrels , the equivalent of the worldwide proven oil reserves of Exxon Mobil , America ’s largest oil company .
Hussain al - Shahristani , the Iraqi oil minister , said in an interview that the field would be opened to new bidders , perhaps as early as next year .
The contract , which had been signed and later canceled by the Saddam Hussein government , had been in legal limbo since the American invasion .
But the Kremlin remained hopeful it could be salvaged until this September , when Mr. Shahristani traveled to Moscow to inform officials there that the decision to cancel it was final , he said .
Today , Mitchell Baker announced plans to step down as Mozilla Corporation ( MoCo ) CEO , a role that will be turned over to John Lilly , who has previously served as Mozilla COO .
Baker and Lilly have been deftly tag - teaming Mozilla operational responsibilities for many months and will still work closely together going forward .
Baker , who will continue to serve as Mozilla chairwoman and plans to focus on new initiatives that will serve Mozilla 's long - term interests , believes that Lilly is presently best suited for the CEO position .
" John Lilly is the right person to guide the product and organizational maturity of MoCo .
John has been doing more and more of this since he took on the COO role in August of 2006 .
John understands Mozilla , is astonishingly good at operations and has an innate facility for our products and technologies and the directions in which they should develop , " Baker wrote in a blog entry .
" Once I allowed myself to think about this I realized that John will be a better CEO for the MoCo going forward than I would be .
I 'm sure that I was the right person for this role during the first years of MoCo ; I 'm equally sure that John is the best person for this role in the future . "
Following her transition out of the CEO position , Baker intends to serve Mozilla 's vision of an open Internet by looking for ways to improve the efficacy of the standards process , make security comprehensible to the general Internet population , increase awareness of Mozilla 's collaborative model , give users more control over their own data and content , and encourage adoption of Mozilla 's revenue - based public service model .
" I have a vision of the Internet and online life and a positive user experience — and of Mozilla 's role in creating these — that is far broader than browsers , e-mail clients and even technology in general , " Baker wrote .
" I want Mozilla 's influence on the industry to go beyond the bits we ship as software .
More particularly , I want to use the impact Firefox gives us in the market to get openness , collaboration and user control embedded in other products , services and aspects of online life . "
Lilly responded in a blog entry and revealed some of his plans for the future of the Mozilla Corporation .
" [ I ] n a very few circumstances — once or twice in a lifetime if you 're lucky — the opportunity you get to make a difference is one that has a very large , even global impact .
My new role as CEO of Mozilla Corporation feels like one of those times , " Lilly wrote .
" It goes without saying that I 'm excited by the challenge of my new job .
I 've thought an awful lot about the role of MoCo ( our shorthand for the Corporation ) in supporting the Mozilla mission and manifesto , as the coordination point for our work on the platform and on Firefox . "
The Mozilla Corporation , says Lilly , should work behind the scenes to provide a solid foundation for community development efforts while remaining as unobtrusive as possible .
" I 've come to the conclusion that the most successful case for MoCo will be when the corporation itself is sort of invisible , " Lilly wrote .
" That is , when MoCo can support Mozilla 's mission , providing economic sustainability , project coordination , and a connection to real users around the world , while getting out of the way of what our community all around the world is doing . "
His top priorities are to deliver a strong Firefox 3 release , help the newly established Mozilla Mail company achieve independence , increase communication about Mozilla 's fiscal sustainability , and assist Baker with her new initiatives .
The structure and focus of Mozilla has evolved considerably in the past year , but the fundamental vision — that of user empowerment and an open Internet — remains unchanged .
The organization is narrowing its software focus to emphasize the browser while also laying a new foundation for expansive , long - term initiatives that are strategically relevant to the organization 's central goals .
We see evidence of this in Mozilla 's decision to spin off Thunderbird into the Mozilla Mail project and also the organization 's increased focus on mobile browsing .
There appears to be a lot of shuffling going on in the Mozilla structural hierarchy as the organization comes to terms with the new requirements and opportunities implied by the explosive growth in the popularity of the Firefox web browser .
This might cause some to express concerns about Mozilla 's focus , but the fact that Lilly lists a strong Firefox 3 release as his number one priority tells me that Mozilla is n't about to let its new projects distract it from doing what it does best : creating a web browser that kicks ass .
I think we can expect to see great things from Lilly and Baker in the coming months .

Some want more English to be used
But in one of the few remaining Irish - speaking areas in Ireland , there 's another debate , this time demanding that more English and less Irish be spoken in a new secondary school in Dingle .
The Kerry Gaeltacht , or Irish - speaking area , is one of the few places left where Irish can be heard in the street .
But in the capital , Dingle , or in its official Irish title , Daingean Uí Chuis , English is widely used .
Two secondary schools recently merged into a new one , Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne .
But the school 's policy of teaching all lessons through Irish has led to protests by some students who say they cannot understand what they are being taught .
Sam Spinn was one of the students who left classes to protest against the all - Irish policy .
" A lot of students can't learn through all Irish - there are some who can but a lot of them can't and it's just not acceptable that people have to go through school in which they do n't understand the classes at all , " he said .
" People just begin to hate a language if it 's forced on them so it will flourish under encouragement , but if it 's forced on people , people will just reject it and they 'll go against it . "
Fluent
But speaking in Irish is fundamental to an Irish - speaking area .
Here , a group of fluent speakers meet to bring on others keen to improve .
Some who have come from outside or abroad say they have learned Irish out of respect for the Gaeltacht tradition and its people , and want their children to learn it too .
Lone Ui Raghallaigh comes from Denmark .
Married and living in the Kerry Gaeltacht , she has learned to speak Irish .
" When we moved here we knew we were moving into a Gaeltacht and to me it is very important not to water down the beautiful language they have in this area , " she said .
" So we are very conscious of trying to do the best ourselves to learn the language and of course we took it for granted that the children would be taught through Irish .
" It 's part of living in a Gaeltacht . "
Maire Ui Shithigh and her family speak Irish at home .
She argues that if English is introduced into the school , then Irish will end up not being used .
" If you have Irish and English , then everything moves over to English because English is the global language , " she said .
Educational
" English is the language of youth and minority languages are dying out all over the world and unless we take very serious steps to prevent it , the Irish will be gone and I think we will hugely regret it . "
But parents of students without fluent Irish , say that it's an educational rather than a language issue .
Cyril Harrington , from a group calling itself the Concerned Parents for Education , moved into the area from Dublin , and feels strongly that Irish should not be imposed in the school .
" This is not about language - this is about every student 's constitutional right to a viable education , " he said .
" For the last 20 - odd years , the medium was through Irish and English .
" Suddenly pupils who 've done four years of secondary school like this are now having all - Irish imposed on them .
" There are people sitting in classrooms and they do n't know what 's being said and that is unfair and unacceptable and it cannot go on . "
But for others , replacing Irish with English would have a disastrous impact on the language in the Gaeltacht .
Native speaker and former Kerry All - Ireland gaelic football winning captain Dara O Cinneide is on the board of management of the new school .
He says extra help in Irish for those needing it - rather than abandoning it for English in the classroom - is the solution .
The school is looking for further help provided under a scheme by the Ireland 's Department of Education to give assistance to students needing help in the language .
" We are aware that there are challenges being posed to a certain group of students in the school , " Mr O Cinneide said .
" We have put extra supports in place to counteract this challenge and we are looking for even more again , so I think anybody who will have a difficulty learning their subjects through Irish will be catered for . "
He says it is accepted that some older students in the school who may not have learned Irish from a young age may need help , but said that throwing out Irish as the spoken language in the area 's secondary and replacing it with English would be devastating for the future of the language in the Kerry Gaeltacht .
He added that the children of many new immigrants coming into the area have little difficulty learning Irish , and have no issue with it .
" We just have a love of the language , we feel it 's very important for us and for the next generation and generations to come to have that language preserved as well as educating our children to the highest possible standards . "
With English the dominant world language , those fostering the Irish language in Kerry say that like other minority languages , it is threatened , even in the area where it should be strongest .
But just as north of the border , the Irish language seems to provoke plenty of debate - in English .
Rice researchers make a dark discovery A dark discovery — no , really , this stuff is dark
Professor Pulickel Ajayan , left , and Ligie Ci have created the darkest substance on Earth .
The material could be used for collecting solar energy or improving telescopes , Ajayan said .

In the iconic movie This is Spinal Tap , lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel said of his band 's black album cover , " It 's like , how much more black could this be ?
And the answer is none .
None more black . "
He was wrong .
A scientist at Rice University has created the darkest material known to man , a carpet of carbon nanotubes that reflects only 0.045 percent of all light shined upon it .
That 's four times darker than the previously darkest known substance , and more than 100 times darker than the paint on a black Corvette .
" The final numbers , when we measured how dark this material was , were more dramatic than we thought , " said Pulickel M. Ajayan , a professor of engineering at Rice University who led the team that developed the substance .
The work was published last week in the journal Nano Letters .
Pure carbon is one of nature 's darkest materials , as is clear to anyone who has seen charred organic materials such as wood .
But to further darken their material the scientists had to make the surface even rougher , to enhance the scattering of light .
They struck upon a carpet - like arrangement of nanotubes standing on their ends .
The nanotubes , so named because they are tiny , are made solely of carbon atoms .
Hollow cylinders with thin walls , the nanotubes used by Ajayan measure about one - hundredth of an inch long .
They are very narrow , however , as their length is about 300,000 times their width .
It took more than a year of careful experimentation to determine that such a small fraction of light is reflected by this carpet - like forest of nanotubes , Ajayan said .
The previous record - holder was an alloy of nickel and phosphorus pitted with tiny craters developed in 2003 by researchers at the National Physical Laboratory in London .
The material reflected about 0.16 percent of light shined upon it .
A dark spot in history
Ajayan said his team has applied to Guiness World Records .
Developing a dark material is an easier way to gain admittance to the book than , say , eating 36 cockroaches in a minute , which Ken Edwards of England did in the year 2001 .
" For me , yes , " Ajayan said .
" But I ca n't speak for every person . "
The new material has some potential applications .
As it absorbs nearly all light , Ajayan said it could be useful in the collection and storage of solar energy .
Also , as it minimizes the scatter of stray light , it could improve optical instruments such as telescopes .
But for Ajayan , the aim is purely one of scientific discovery .
" There 's a fundamental joy in such a fascinating study , " he said .

2007 : The year in review
2007 : we 'll always remember it as the year of the ... well , year of the what , exactly ?
So much happened in tech this year that we can't sum up the year with a single label .
So we asked the Ars staff to reflect on the event , product , or trend that defined 2007 , a year that saw both the announcement and introduction of the iPhone , the growth of 700MHz " spectrum fever , " and the Jammie Thomas trial .
On the next page , we present our predictions for 2008 , a year that promises to be no less exciting than its predecessor .
So without further ado , let 's jump right in .
Let the debate begin .
2007 : The Year of Jammie Thomas
Eric Bangeman , Managing Editor
Although the RIAA 's legal campaign against file - sharers has been going strong for over four years , most cases are largely settled out of sight .
The vast majority of cases were settled out of court , often with the RIAA 's target writing the record labels a four - digit check to make the copyright infringement complaint go away .
A few cases have managed to wind their way through the legal system , with defendants even scoring a couple of high - profile victories over the RIAA .
But of the nearly 30,000 cases filed so far , only one has gone to trial .
I had the chance to cover the Capitol Records v. Jammie Thomas trial in person this past fall , and , as I wrote afterwards , it turned out to be the perfect storm for the RIAA .
The defendant had only a single PC hooked up to her cable modem , had used the same online handle ( tereastarr ) for over a decade ( including on KaZaA ) , and the judge set a low barrier for an infringement finding by ruling that the mere presence of MP3s in a shared KaZaA folder constituted infringement , rather than forcing the RIAA to show that actual distribution took place .
Thomas lost the case .
As we enter a new year , the RIAA shows no sign of backing off its legal campaign , and we may very well see some more high - profile cases resolved — and maybe even another trial .
2007 : Year of Open Access
Nate Anderson , Associate Editor
In a single year , wireless open access advocacy in the US went from a murmur to a shout loud enough to wake the dead .
And by dead , I mean " telcos . "
Skype complained early in the year about the need for wireless network neutrality , and Columbia 's Tim Wu helped fuel the fire .
But it was n't until Google waded into the telco - dominated world of spectrum auctions and demanded ( and got ) open access rules from the FCC that things began to hum .
In a few short months , Verizon went from suing the FCC to proclaiming itself a huge believer in open networks .
AT&T even tried to gate - crash the open access party .
Although the real payoff will come in 2008 and beyond , 2007 is the year that open access became plausible , and it's the year that Google unveiled the true extent of its power by forcing even the federal government to take it seriously .
2007 : Year of Online Video
Jacqui Cheng , Infinite Loop Editor
No , not user - generated video .
Professionally - created video that comes from networks and movie studios .
Apple and Microsoft kicked off late 2006 by offering select video downloads , but TV and movies online exploded throughout 2007 .
It 's easier than ever to find current TV shows through officially - endorsed means , even if some of those methods are still a bit locked - down and sandboxed .
Unbox , Hulu , even that stupid Jackass 2.5 movie are examples of efforts to offer more online video options than we 've had before , and once the studios start to get wise to the pitfalls of DRM ( like the music industry has finally done ) , we 'll really start getting somewhere .
2007 : Year of the Climate
John Timmer , Nobel Intent Editor
For the past few decades , scientists have been collecting evidence that we 've been messing with the climate for over a century .
But it seemed to only take one year for the attitude in the US to shift from climate worries being viewed as a fringe controversy to one where there was widespread acceptance and concern .
That year seems to have been 2007 , where the climate was constantly in the news .
The year began with Al Gore 's Oscar win , then moved on to Al Gore 's Nobel Prize , with a constant drumbeat of IPCC reports providing the background rhythm .
The public started paying attention .
In part due to its increased acceptance of the science , 2008 looks like it will see the first legislation intended to do something about climate change passed ( and probably vetoed ) .
2007 : Year of User- generated Video
Jon " Hannibal " Stokes , Senior CPU Editor
When Google snapped up YouTube at the end of 2006 , the user - generated online video party was really just getting started .
2007 saw a number of sites and blogs , including Ars Technica , dip a toe in the online video waters , as the software and hardware tools for making and distributing video online got cheaper and more refined .
But the place where user - generated video content ( and video content that pretended to be user - generated ) had the biggest impact was undoubtedly the presidential primary contest .
From widely - viewed viral campaign ads like " I got a crush ... on Obama " and " Vote Different " ( aka " Hillary 1984 " ) to the CNN / YouTube primary debates , 2007 was the year that online video fundamentally altered the campaign media landscape like nothing since the first televised Nixon - versus - Kennedy debate of 1960 .
2007 : Year of Casual Gaming
Ben Kuchera , Gaming Editor
Casual gaming is big business , and in the near future , the difference between " hardcore " and " casual " may cease to exist .
If you waited in line for four hours to buy your Wii , if you show up every Friday to play Rock Band at the local pub , if you have mastered every board on Peggle ... are you really not a hardcore gamer ?
Studies show that more Americans game than do n't , and it's an increasingly social activity .
Gaming has been threatening to go mainstream for a long time : in 2007 it might have finally broken through .
Five MIT students under the team name BioVolt have created a $ 2 gadget that uses biomass to generate electricity .
The output of the device is n't particularly significant -- six months to charge your cell means you should n't throw away that charger just yet -- but the low cost of the components , the availability of " biomass , " and the capability for chaining multiple devices together means this is the perfect solution for isolated areas or poor communities .
It 's good news for the researchers too , who happened to win $ 5,000 in a design competition for their efforts .
Good show lads .

( Note , long after I wrote this entry : I think OCaml has some fairly fundamental problems that keep it from being a first choice for server - side development .
If I were to use it for anything , it would be as a substitute for C++ in delivering client - side executable / GUI programs , e.g. for Windows systems .
And I still think it 's a really cool language . )
I was n't really planning on writing another blog entry on OCaml , but ... gosh .
And I use the word " gosh " advisedly .
I 'm at a loss for words here .
Sure , yes , OCaml generates lightning - fast executables , with much , much better code than C++ , apparently regardless of which C++ compiler or platform you 're comparing it with .
And yeah , OCaml is pretty much the most expressive language I 've ever used , maybe more expressive even than Ruby and Lisp , and I 'm still not finished learning the more exotic features like Functors .
Yes , yes , it supports OO , imperative , functional and logic programming , seamlessly intermixed , so you can program a solution in any style appropriate to the problem at hand .
We all know that .
And it 's no big deal that there 's a perl4caml module that lets you use * any * CPAN module seamlessly in your OCaml program , and a mod_ocaml for Apache , etc. etc .
And most people probably do n't care that it has an exceptionally high - quality Emacs mode , and an interactive intepreter ( as well as a high - performance native - code compiler ) , and some great libraries ( including graphics bindings for various UI toolkits ) .
It probably does n't even matter that it has full C++ bindings for those times when you really need to make calls into code written in a slower language .
You might not even care that it comes with a rich set of libraries that rivals the Java platform APIs in comprehensiveness and usability .
Or that it 's been ported to .NET ( and soon , the JVM ) .
But come on ... you have to stop and take notice at the OCaml replay debugger , which can step backwards through time as well as forwards .
You do n't see that every day .
At first I was a bit amazed at how much support there is for real - world development in OCaml - as far as I can tell , it 's got everything you 'd find in any other mainstream language , with a relatively smaller user community .
But now I think it 's not amazing at all ; it 's a natural consequence of the fact that it 's simply a superior language .
It stands to reason that if you have a language that really does live up to the promise of making people ( say ) 10 times as productive as the other languages out there , then it will only take 1/10th the people ( or time ) to reproduce the functionality that 's been created for other languages .
And it 's been around for a decade - much longer if you consider that it was derived from ML , which started in the late 1980s .
All that hoity - toity stuff aside , though : nobody really cares about most of that when they 're actually using a language .
To learn a new language takes a real commitment , especially if it's not from the Algol imperative family ( as are C , C++ , Java and Perl ) .
What really matters is whether you can get stuff done , and whether the language feels " comfortable " when you 're using it .
I can't speak for anyone else , of course , but in my experience with it so far , I find it a real pleasure to use - and I would even if it did n't have such incredible runtime performance .
It was one of the more difficult languages to pick up , and took some serious digging and head - scratching before I started to write in it naturally .
But once you get past the syntax , and work with it for a while , I think you 'll find that it 's a really comfortable language .
There are LOTS of ways to do things ; you can program in a Lisp -y style if you like , or a Perl -y style , or just about any other style .
But when you finally get your stuff past the compiler , it usually works correctly the first time .
The only runtime bugs I 've ever had were incorrectly specified algorithms .
I 'm really starting to like having code that works the first time - more often , in fact , than in Java or other statically - typed languages I 've used a lot .

NBC : Obama fights back against ' cult - like ' charges David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday February 25 , 2008

Print This Email This Some of the news media have recently taken to describing Barack Obama 's supporters as " cult - like " or comparing them to the fans of rock stars .
Hillary Clinton has not been making these accusations herself , but she appears to reflect them when she charges that Obama is heavy on words and light on action .
Even the Telegraph in Britain has picked up on the accusations , writing that " for a growing number of Barack Obama sceptics , there is something disturbing about the adulation with which the senator and Democratic presidential frontrunner is greeted as he campaigns for the White House  unnervingly akin to the hysteria of a cult , or the fervour of a religious revival . "
Obama is now starting to fight back against the " cult " description , and NBC's Lee Cowan reports from Toledo , OH that " there 's a subtle new argument that Barack Obama 's been using ... that 's starting to get some traction . "
" He says it 's not so much what Hillary Clinton says about him by way of criticism , " Cowan explained , " but what she 's implying about his supporters that he says should get them pretty riled up . "
Obama first introduced this argument at Tuesday 's debate in Austin , where he stated , " The implication is , the people who 've been voting for me or involved in my campaign are somehow delusional . "
Now his regular stump speach includes the same argument .
" Some of these folks make fun of y'all , " he told one audience .
" They say , ' Y 'all look at these folks who are are being duped . ' "
" However they 're characterized , they are certainly energetic , " Cowan concluded , seeming uncertain just what to make of Obama 's supporters .
" And the more they are criticized for that enthusiasm , the more it just seems to galvanize their cause . "

A retroactive litmus test on leading Democratic candidates
anIf this blog post from The Atlantic Online is accurate , it confirms my deep concerns about how Hillary Clinton would approach crime and punishment issues as president .
The post is titled " Clinton , Obama , Edwards Differ On Retroactivity , " and it reports that " Clinton opposes [ retroactivity of the USSC's new crack amendments ] , and Edwards and Obama support it . "
So , assuming this is accurate , let 's review the line - up : the prominent opponents to retroactivity for the new USSC guidelines are President Bush 's Justice Department ( noted here ) , Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee ( noted here ) , and now Senator Hillary Clinton .
As I have detailed in prior posts ( some of which are linked below ) , I have long been troubled by the Clinton " brand " when it comes to criminal sentencing issues .
But , of course , most of the troublesome record on these issues involved decisions by Hillary 's husband .
Now , assuming this blog report is accurate , we have a very strong basis to believe that Hillary herself favors tough - on - crime rhetoric over sound sentencing policy .
Now who should be accused of taking a page out of the Republican play book ?
Some recent posts on crack guideline retroactivity issues :
Some recent posts on sentencing politics in the 2008 campaign :
UPDATE : I now see that this item at Politico has more on this story .
Here are some telling details :
Clinton , who said she supports a federal recommendation for shorter sentences for some people caught with crack cocaine , opposed making those shorter sentences retroactive — which could eventually result in the early release of 20,000 people convicted on drug charges .
" In principle I have problems with retroactivity , " she said .
" It 's something a lot of communities will be concerned about as well . "
In an interview after the debate , Clinton 's pollster , Mark Penn , pointed out that the Republican front - runner has already signaled that he will attack Democrats on releasing people convicted of drug crimes .
Her five rivals present on stage — Illinois Sen. Barack Obama , Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd , former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards , New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , and Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich — all said they favor making the shorter sentences retroactive .
" Rudy Giuliani is already going after the issue , " Penn said .
" He 's already starting to attack Democrats , claiming it will release 20,000 convicted drug dealers . "
So , besides suggesting that Hillary Clinton gets her crime and punishment ideas from the Giuliani campaign , this issue ought to help Democratic primary voters who care about principled sentencing reform know that not all the candidates are the same .
( I am now wondering if keep prison populations growing is part of Hillary 's universal health - care plan . )
MORE : I am pleased to see TalkLeft picking up this story , calling Clinton 's position " a huge disappointment . "
I also see MyDD has this post saying that " Hillary 's position is really astonishing . "
I hope other prominent political bloggers will keep on this important issue which provides , at least for me , a great litmus test on true principle versus ( mis- perceived ) political pragmatism .

Comments
I 'm a 2L at Western New England College School of Law in Springfield , MA .
This is no surprise from Senator Clinton -- she supports the death penalty and is deadly afraid of being painted as a softie by her opponents .
What is a little surprising is that she did n't consider ( or at least modify her position because of ) the racial justice aspect of crack retroactivity .
I do n't think a Clinton II presidency will be much better for criminal defendants than a Romney presidency , to be honest .
Posted by : Merritt | Dec 2 , 2007 9:06:53 PM
Doug ,
Giuliani's " claim " that the retroactivity proposal will result in the early release of nearly 20,000 crack inmates is not campaign propaganda .
It is exactly what the Sentencing Commission has said in its own study .
Concern about what these released prisoners will do by way of recidivism is not an " unprincipled " view of sentencing , but a rational one .
We all know that some of them will do it again .
Without having at least some idea of how many and how often , Senator Clinton 's misgivings are well grounded .
As to Merritt 's observation that the Senator favors the death penalty , so do the great majority of Americans , as well as clear majorities of Democrats , liberals and independents , according to the most recent Gallup poll .
Every President in the country 's history has favored capital punishment , and many have overseen its imposition in earlier positions as governor , or when they became President , or both .
I am not normally a defender of Senator Clinton , and I think she has much to answer for on the criminal justice front -- including her role in the scandalous Billy Dale prosecution -- but I do not believe she can be fairly attacked as a Giuliani clone for saying what the bi-partisan Sentencing Commission says .

Bill , you should know that the USSC 's decision to make the amendment retroactive will merely make 20,000 inmates ELIGIBLE for earlier release .
And if a federal prosecutor believes any particular defendant 's release has likely public safety consequences , that prosecutor can urge the sentencing judge not to grant the defendant 's motion for a reduced sentence .
In addition , if Hillary and other Senators would get moving on the Second Chance Act , the ability for released offenders to re-enter society effectively will be improved .
As I trust you know , the USSC 's research shows that only about 2,500 offenders would be eligible for immediate release if the crack amendment is retroactive AND that number amounts to less than 0.5 % of the roughly 650,000 defendants released from prison or jail every year .

You folks would be interested in the interview with Huckabee by that sleezy guy on ABC Sunday Morning who used to work for Clinton .
He was asking loaded questions to try to make the fomer Arkansas Governor look soft on meth dealers .
Huck had signed a new law in Arkansas ameliorating harsh sentencing laws .
Hucks response was very intelligent and coherent .
I changed my views on him .
I will not vote for Hillary under any circumstance .
If the election were today and it was the former Governor of Arkansas from Hope , Arkansas vs. the present wife of the former other Governor from Hope , Arkansas , I would chose the more recent former Governor .
And my mother would roll over in her grave because I voted for a Republican .
Posted by : M.P. Bastian | Dec 3 , 2007 5:03:04 AM
Clinton 's views should come as no surprise .
Her husband could have made this whole argument moot back in 1995 by simply vetoing Congress ' bill that voided the Commission 's first attempt at relief on crack sentences .
Instead he signed the bill .
Then , he made the situation worse by stating in a Rolling Stone interview that the one thing that he wished he could have done while President was to change the crack law ... forgetting , of course that he could have done something about it !
So , Hillary 's statement on this does n't come as a surprise ... they will say anything to get elected ... and I am a Democrat who voted for Bill Clinton twice !
Posted by : Kelly | Dec 3 , 2007 7:12:42 AM
Doug ,
That the Commission 's proposal would allow " only " eligibility for release is largely a hollow distinction , given the attitude of so many district judges about crack sentencing .
For a sample of that attitude , even in a conservative district like my old stomping grounds in the EDVA , take a look at the sentencing transcript in Kimbrough ( now pending opinion in the Supreme Court ) .
The governement can of course argue anything it wants .
But it will not be making the release decision .
The Commission should at least undertake a serious inquiry about the extent of recidivism the retroactivity proposal is likely to make possible .
The rate of recidivism for crack offenders is not zero .
Finding out what it is , or at least doing more research than the Commission has done to date , strikes me as just common sense .
If , for example , the Commission could show through research that there would be only minimal recidivism , that would increase public support for retroactivity .
But one way or another , what 's the harm in getting more data than we have now ?
Any plan for the early release of one segment of the federal prison population -- whatever that segment is -- can be made to look trifling when compared to the total number of releases of all prisoners in state prisons .
But it 's a comparison of apples and oranges , and 20,000 is still 20,000 .
I 'm not familiar with the Second Chance Act , and if it intends to make it more likely that crack dealers will reform their behavior and lead law - abiding lives , I 'm certainly on board with its aims .
The devil , however , is as ever in the details .
And lastly , the society we live in right now is hardly one that denies people a " second chance . "
The notion that we can improve rehabilitation with one more piece of legislation or one more government program seems to me to be wishful thinking .
By far the most important factor in whether a convict becomes rehabilitated is WHETHER HE WANTS TO BE .
I 'm nobody 's version of a psychologist , but my experience is that a person who becomes genuinely determined to live a constructive life does n't need legislation , and a person not so determined wo n't be dissuaded from bad behavior by its passage .

Bill :
As a white male , you are so quick to pass judgement ...
I think that if the majority of crack offenders where WHITE these sentencing issues would not exist ... the proof is in the pudding : crack v. powder ratio statistics ; the LSD amendment ...
Seriously Bill , is it too much to CORRECT the INjustice for BLACKS ...?!,
Correct the injustice , if the offenders reoffends put s/he back in jail and then no one can complain .
Bottom line is , the crack offenders WILL eventually get out ( after serving their sentence ) so for all that oppose the retroactive application , then what ...?
Bruce had the best to the point response : God forbid 20,000 injustices be corrected .
Oh the floodgates , the floodgates .

Bill : I sometimes get the sense that you 'd like those pesky independent judges to stop worrying about sentencing justice and just do what prosecutors want them to do .
Also , the " attitude " of judges to think the crack guidelines are excessive and unjust comes from FOUR different and thoughtful reports from the USSC saying the crack guidelines are excessive and unjust .
As your comment here reinforces , the folks that seem to suffer from " attitude " problems often are prosecutors who only trust and respect on their own tough judgments and not the views of others exercising independent thought and trying to be faitful to the law .
Yeesh .
Posted by : Doug B. | Dec 3 , 2007 10:34:18 AM
Doug ,
Judges are " independent " in the institutional sense , but judges do not spring up on the bench from nowhere .
District judges are selected in practice by senators ( although pro forma by the President ) .
By the time anyone arrives on the federal bench , he or she has a quite well developed sense of his or her leanings .
Judge Gertner , for example , was a hard - charging defense lawyer for years before being put on the bench , and her distaste for crack sentences would be there if the Sentencing Commission had never issued a single report and were on the backside of the moon .
Do you disagree ?
If you have the sense that I GENERALLY prefer Depsrtment of Justice positions , you 're right , although I try to examine each issue on its own merits .
On the other hand , I have the sense that you almost always prefer lighter sentences across the board , for drugs , white collar offenses and most everything in between .
Now of course I have n't read everything you 've written , so there might be some area in which you have supported higher sentences .
If so , please let me know .
I do have an attitude , that 's true .
The attitude is this : Adults of sound mind are responsible for their behavior .
When they try to make a quick buck buy selling dangerous and destructive drugs like crack , heedless of the damage they are doing , then the problem we are having is not with the system , the Commission , etc. , et al .
The problem is with the offender 's me - first view of the world .
And I still do n't know why we should n't try to study more thoroughly the probable extent and effects of recidivism should this retroactivity proposal be adopted .
The best antidote for people with an " attitude , " whether on my side on yours , is to find the facts .
And it 's far preferable to find them before acting rather than after , as I think and hope you 'd agree .

ForAllPeople ,
The problem in your argument is that it assumes its conclusion , namely , that crack sentences are unjust .
It might well be the case that crack guidelines sentences in some individual cases were unjust , and in such cases the guidelines allowed downward departures , asking only that the judge articulate individualized reasons supporting them .
( In the post - Booker world , of course , departures are much easier , and appellate review of them much more deferential ) .
When I was an AUSA , doing appeals for the Easten District of Virginia , I did n't care about the race of the defendant , that being irrelevant .
( Do you really want prosecutors who adjust their decisions based on race ? )
It is true that crack offenses are disproportionately committed by blacks .
But it is likewise true that methamphetamine offenses , at least in my day as an AUSA , were committed disproportionately by whites .
The penalty scheme for both crack and meth is harsh ( indeed I believe it 's identical ) .
And in all my time in the US Attorney 's Office , I never so much as heard of , much less prosecuted , anyone other than a white for LSD , which also carries stiff penalties .
The government is not responsible for the fact that different drugs seem disproportionately " popular , " if that 's the right word , with different demographic groups .
If any of the people using or dealing in these drugs -- be it blacks with crack or whites with meth -- has a problem , I have a solution to suggest to them :
You can avoid harsh sentencing , or any sentencing at all , by WALKING AWAY FROM THE DRUG CULTURE AND INTO THE WORK CULTURE , where the overwhelming majority of our people , black and white , resides .
Bill
Posted by : Bill Otis | Dec 3 , 2007 2:44:31 PM
Bill , I 'd like you to respond at some point to whether the fact that the US Sentencing Commission has repeatedly said that crack sentences are unjust has any significance .
That 's the " expert " body , and they certainly do not have a reputation for being soft - on - crime .
I 'd also like to understand why you are so trouble by a judiciary that was mostly appointed by republican presidents and has MANY more former US attorneys and DOJ officials than defense attorneys .
Judge Gertner gets a lot of attention because she is so rare in a world of over 1000 federal judges .
To use her as a basis for defining the realities of the entire federal judiciary would be like me assuming all state AGs are like Jerry Brown in California .
If you read all my posts , you 'll see that I think a lot of sentencing outcomes are too lenient ( especially for drunk drivers ) .
To give a different example , I thought the sentence that Scooter Libby got AFTER the President intervened was too low , though I did think his 30 month sentence might have been a bit too high .
As I recall , you wrote about Libby 's case .
Do you think he suffered from an " offender 's me - first view of the world " ?
Posted by : Doug B. | Dec 3 , 2007 5:53:40 PM
Doug ,
The Commission 's view of crack sentencing is properly influential -- but not controlling .
There is a case to be made the other way .
DOJ makes it , as it did in the Clinton Adminstration , so I do n't think it can be fairly characterized as blockheaded or extremist , much less " unprincpled . "
In addition to the case DOJ makes , I have added that I 'd like to know more about the probable nature and extent of recidivism should the retroactivity proposal be adopted .
For the life of me , I can't figure out what is wrong in wanting this additional information , but no one seems willing to tell me .
Until someone does , I 'm going to continue to believe that it is irresponsible for the government to forge ahead with a new policy without even asking , much less assessing , what its economic and human costs are likely to be .
The Commission is , as you say , the establishment " expert body " on questions like this ( so it should be the first one to be insisting on thorough research ) .
On the other hand , the Supreme Court is the " expert body " on questions of , for example , constitutional Equal Protection , but that has not stopped a large number of liberals from criticizing the Court in bitter terms for its decision in Bush v. Gore , not to mention a raft of decisions in just the last Term , including the partial birth abortion case and the Seattle schools race - based assignments case .
Particularly in a blog such as this , which I believe you host in part for the laudable purpose of encouraging debate ; and particularly in the academic community , criticism of " expert " opinion has traditionally and rightly been welcomed .
I do n't recall saying that I am generally troubled by the federal judiciary .
I did say that district judges get to the bench in practice via senatorial ( i.e. , political ) selection , and you do n't take issue with that .
I AM troubled with judges who render decisions based on their view that , as a policy matter ( with regard to sentencing or anything else ) , Congress got it wrong .
Judicial indiscipline is easy to come by and difficult to correct , and the " rule of law , " if it is to have any meaning at all , must mean that judges defer to Congress on matters of policy no matter how wrongheaded they believe Congress to have been .
I believe Judge Gertner gets heaping praise here not so much for her independence as for her substantive outcomes .
Those outcomes , it is only a small exaggeration to say , are in only one direction -- toward lower sentences .
If she were equally " independent " in imposing HIGHER sentences , would you still have devoted a separate entry to praise her " courage ? "
Perhaps , but I do n't think so .
I will stand to be corrected if I 'm wrong about that .
I thought that in lying to the grand jury , Libby did indeed indulge a " me-first " attitude .
It should be a " truth first " attitude -- especially for a lawyer .
It was for that reason that I publicly opposed granting Libby a pardon and leaving him stuck with his conviction , a stance which did not endear me to a raft of my friends and fellow conservatives .
I also thought that Libby deserved to be sent a message , but that a humongous quarter million dollar fine and three years ' probation was enough .
The man is a 56 year - old first offender , who had more attestations of community service than any defendant I ever saw in the 18 years I was an AUSA .
He can not be sensibly be viewed as dangerous -- quite unlike many of the crack dealers whose incarceration is now being mulled over .
In the post you 're responding to , I said this : " I do have an attitude ...
The attitude is this : Adults of sound mind are responsible for their behavior .
When they try to make a quick buck [ by ] selling dangerous and destructive drugs like crack , heedless of the damage they are doing , then the problem ... is not with the system , the Commission , etc. , et al .
The problem is with the offender 's me - first view of the world . "
And that is indeed my view .
Too many times I have seen bad actors -- thugs , strongarms and rapacious cheaters , among a legion of others -- blame everyone but themselves .
The danger they pose to society will be high , and the chances for genuine rehabilitation low , until that attitude changes .
Making sentencing more like a " no- more - excuses zone " is one way to start .

Good points all , Bill , though I wish your sympathy for Libby might also extend to the likes of less prominent folks like Myles Haynes ( who was the focal point of my recent Gertner posts ) .
If there was reason to fear that the federal guidelines were under - punishing many , I 'd hope more judges would show independence by going higher .
But the federal guidelines are very high , even though Congress has demanded in 3553 ( a ) that judges impose sentences no greater than necessary .
( As the Libby case shows and as you obviously believe , the guidelines in some cases call for long terms of prison time for non-violent first offenders that seem a lot longer than necessary . )
I praise your no -more - excuses attitude , though I wish our leaders --- on both sides of the ailse --- would provide an example for the nation .
When our Presidents make excuses for the Libbys and Riches ( and their own behavior ) it is hard not to be trouble by the sense that only the powerful get the benefits of excuses .

God , Rudy can't open his mouth without lying .
19,000 people will be " affected ; " a far smaller number will be released .
What a complete hack .
Reached his apex as a Mayor .
Oh , and glancing back , I see Bill was taken in .
Bill , a guy with a twenty year sentence will get a couple of years off .
Probably in ten or fifteen years .
What are you scared of ?
That not long enough for you ?
Your attitude would mandate a life sentence for everyone .
Whom would you spare from a life sentence ?
I mean , by your lights , they 're all terribly dangerous ...

As John Edwards said , Hillary , is just a " corporate " Democrat , or rather a Republican in " Democrat " clothes .
She was a " Goldwater " girl in highschool and while she claims to be a " Democrat " her husbands NAFTA - Free Tradism - sent those jobs over - seas and they are not comming back .
I know plenty of people who could vote for either a Republican or a Democrat but if Hillary is the best the " Democrats " can come up with ---- they will lose .

Creative Consumer : Dirty Secrets of Joining a Gym Don't get bamboozled while trying to fulfill a New Year 's resolution .
Jan. 7 , 2008  --
It 's a new year and that means many Americans will resolve to get in shape and gym memberships will soar .
It 's a great idea , but keep in mind that you join a gym to exercise your body , but if you want to quit , you may find it hard to exercise your rights .
A brand new Better Business Bureau analysis found that consumer complaints about gyms are up more than 90 percent in the last five years .
If you 're hoping for buns of steel , then you 'll probably be asked to sign an ironclad contract .
Do n't accuse gym managers of being dumb jocks .
Their contracts are long , involved and full of legalese .
If you sign one without reading it , you 're the dummy .
A contract 's a contract .
The BBB analysis found that 73 percent of customer complaints involved contract or billing disputes , including people who were upset that they were still being billed after they thought their contract was over .
One national chain holds customers to their contracts unless they are gravely ill , badly injured or move more than 50 miles from the nearest branch of the gym .
Can you imagine driving 50 miles to work out ?
I have some exercise gear in my basement and I have a hard time summoning the willpower to use it .
Many gyms push three - year , five - year or lifetime memberships .
Customers go for it , because the longer the contract , the cheaper the monthly rate .
But is it really a savings if you are dissatisfied with the gym and never go ?
As with all future services contracts in which you make a long - term commitment and pay in advance , there are risks .
Some gyms have been known to sell memberships before they 're open and then fail to open for months .
Others have gone out of business , leaving prepaid members in the lurch .
Once again , the BBB numbers are enlightening .
A hefty 15 percent of complaints concerned gyms that went out of business soon after opening , leaving customers in the lurch who had paid expensive initiation fees .
Some states now require gyms to offer people the option of a brief introductory membership — typically 90 days .
Unfortunately , when I investigated the health - club industry , none of the gym salespeople informed my undercover producer about the introductory membership option .
Plus , when we went to cancel the various memberships we 'd signed up for , some of the gyms put collection agents on us .
Do Your Homework
Learn the law in the jurisdiction where you 're thinking of joining a gym .
Specifically , find out whether gyms are required to offer a brief trial period before locking you into a long - term contract .
Check the gym 's reputation by contacting the Better Business Bureau and your county and state consumer offices .
See whether there 's a good gym in your area that offers a month - to - month membership .
Some gyms are starting to do this as a counter - marketing strategy .
Typically you just have to give 30 days ' notice and you 're free as a bird .
Ask for free guest passes and visit the gym you 're considering during the hours that you would normally work out .
Some gyms set no limits on membership , so check for overcrowding .
Find out what is and is n't included in the gym contract .
Will you have to pay extra for specialty courses like yoga and pilates ?
Is your gym membership limited to certain hours ?
Hold out .
Gym salespeople have to make quotas .
The longer you hem and haw , the more they 'll drop the price or add incentives .
Read and understand the contract before signing .
Take a copy home with you to study , if possible .
Make sure all the salesperson 's verbal promises are included in the written contract .
Sign a short - term contract first , to see whether you like the gym , even if it costs more .
Then , if you 're satisfied , you can enter into a longer agreement .
Pay monthly or quarterly so if the gym closes , you wo n't lose too much money .
Many gyms charge customers ' credit cards or checking accounts each month .
Use caution .
When your contract ends and you go to quit , you could have trouble canceling that automatic debit .
Some customers resort to cutting up their cards or closing their checking accounts just to ditch their gyms .
Where to Complain
This is a case for the Better Business Bureau and your county and state consumer protection offices .
But remember , if you sign a long - term contract , you may have no recourse .
In yesterday ’s post I said , “ A 71 - year old man like McCain is mentally slower and less flexible than a younger person , and more likely to have his job performance impacted by a major illness . ”
Many of you objected to my agism .
It appears that there were three reasons for objecting :
1 . The commenter interpreted my statement to mean every old person is mentally slower than every young person , which would be stupid .
2 . The commenter objects to agism on principle .
3. McCain is obviously healthy and energetic and smart enough for the job .
The first two categories are n’t worth a response .
I will address the third point , that McCain is an exception .
First , I will acknowledge the possibility that the smartest and most creative person in the world could be 100 years old .
That could happen if , for example , that person started as the smartest person in the world and did n’t decline much .
What is n’t likely is that the smartest person in the world started out in the middle of the pack and got smarter after the age of 70 .
I will also acknowledge that a mentally active person , such as John McCain , can reduce the normal rate of mental decline associated with age .
And with experience he might acquire more relevant knowledge while only forgetting things that are n’t much use on the job , such as his old high school locker combination .
Here ’s a link showing that older people can stave off the typical mental decline associated with age by “ training ” their brains : http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/19/AR2006121900901.html
I will also acknowledge that if you were hiring someone to work for your own company , the 71 - year old could be the most qualified candidate .
But the odds of that happening decrease as the applicant pool increases .
The presidency has an unusually large pool of applicants .
And the job at your company is unlikely to be similar in mental requirements to being President of the United States .
It ’s hard to imagine a job that would require more mental dependability than Commander in Chief .
We have one recent experience with an older president : Reagan .
And his mental functioning was clearly impaired by age .
While you might argue that Reagan ’s results as a president were good , you have to acknowledge the risk involved in having a president who is n’t thinking clearly .
John McCain ’s current mental ability does appear up to the task of being president .
But like Reagan , he ’s at an age where decline can happen quickly .
He ’s unlikely to be the same man at the end of the first term , much less a potential second term .
While it is entirely possible – even probable – he could keep his mind sharp enough to do the job , the odds are unambiguously better for a younger candidate .
President of the United States is n’t the sort of job where “ sufficient ” is good enough .
I have every reason to believe a 71 - year old would be sufficient .
The odds of being exceptional are much lower .
In other professions , how often do people over the age of 70 produce innovative or exceptional results ?
Look around your home or office and ask yourself how many of the technical innovations came from senior citizens .
How many of the best selling books on your shelf were written by senior citizens who were n’t already famous ?
How many senior citizens wrote the music you have on your iPod ?
You will be tempted to point out exceptions to the rule .
Warren Buffet is a good example .
But he plans to retire .
Alan Greenspan already did .
Evidently they think age matters .
If you think age is n’t a factor in the presidency , would you vote for a candidate who was 100 - years old and healthy ?
Response to Katha Pollitt ’s “ The Atheist 's Dilemma "
From The Nation , Dec 3 , 2007
In this issue of The Nation , Katha Pollitt posits that what people like to refer to as the “ New Atheism ” is destined for failure .
She argues that the devout will not be persuaded by atheists , particularly those like Sam Harris , who “ [ think ] religion is completely stupid . ”
She goes on further to admonish us for not appreciating the so - called moderates of any faith .
Ms. Pollitt is demonstrating her ignorance of the effectiveness of the atheist “ movement ” ( although I hesitate to use that word ) and the reason why even the moderate religious acolytes need to be called to account for their beliefs .
Ms. Pollitt is correct in some regards with respect to the most devout believers .
Those people are not likely to be persuaded by anybody , and confrontation with atheists generally serves to push them further into their delusion and reinforces their belief .
Cognitive dissonance can work either way , depending on how much one has at stake .
I do not believe that a change in tactics or attitude will affect those types of people .
Moderate believers simply compound the problem by providing respectability and cover for the extremists of their ilk .
Do I appreciate the more accepting people among the faithful ?
Sure .
Ultimately , though , they are still responsible for perpetuating and propagating their worldview .
If we could get to the point where the cafeteria Christians and Muslims are taken out of the equation , we could effectively stamp out the religious violence that occurs every day because it would be acceptable to excoriate faith - based belief systems .
We could do exactly what Sam Harris talks about in his book , The End of Faith , which describes the effectiveness of ridicule as a tool for social change .
As long as it is taboo to criticize religion , that will be impossible .
Her conclusion is that only the “ angry teenager ” would be persuaded by this type of argumentation , but I know for a fact that this is not true .
With billions of Christians and Muslims in the world , it is difficult to gauge how many individuals are impacted by any particular meme , but the only way to change society is to change the people who make up the society .
Being likely the most confrontational , and to some , offensive , group of atheists out there , we at the Rational Response Squad receive letters of hate , threats — and thanks .
Many people have told us personally that we changed their lives with our in - your - face approach .
We want to make it seem ludicrous to believe in fairy tales , and that does work for some people .
If Ms. Pollitt is looking for a one - track route to de-conversion , she ’ll likely be looking from now until the day that she dies .
Every person is different and will respond to the arguments against religion in many ways .
That does n’t change the fact that her assertion that we wo n’t change anybody ’s mind is absolutely incorrect , and with hundreds of people that I could use as examples , I can only fathom how many have been influenced by Dawkins , Harris , Hitchens , et al .
It is odd that she turns around and uses an argument very similar to Sam Harris ’ recent speech and article , “ The End of Atheism . ”
She claims that once you have denounced religion and come out as a nonbeliever , you have nullified any potential influence you could have had .
To some , it ’s true .
An atheist is put into a box , usually the stereotypical definition of evil baby - blood drinkers who are angry at god .
The way to change that is to reclaim the word “ atheist . ”
Come out to your friends , family , co-workers , and neighbors so that they will realize how ridiculous it is to perpetuate that caricature .
Atheists who kow - tow to that are just as guilty as the religious when they hide behind other , less - offensive labels .
What will the outcome of this “ Golden Age of Atheism ” be ?
Nobody knows .
There are many who , like Ms. Pollitt , would like to convince us that being the silent minority is the correct tactic .
They would like to see us shut - up and sit - down — just let everybody believe whatever they want to — it ’s a personal issue .
She wants to know if “ art can succeed where atheism cannot . ”
Where is it that “ atheism ” cannot succeed ?
Is not the author of “ The Reluctant Fundamentalist ” just as much of an atheist as I ?
He is just using a different approach .
Atheists will succeed once we stop arguing with each other and start taking the danger that religion poses to the future of humanity seriously .
Recently , Ms. Schneider and her college - age daughter were excited to find Ugg boots , Smashbox makeup in leather cases and Seven jeans at their Costco in Nashville .
“ Costco seems to go for the upper crust in taste , ” she said .
Some offerings rotate in and out of the warehouse based on the season , sales volume and other factors .
As a result , people may go to Costco more often than necessary to see what is new , said Steve Hoch , a retail professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania .
“ When they see something they want , ” he added , “ they ’ll be likely to go ahead and buy it , because next time they return , the item may be gone . ”
While most consumers become annoyed when something they expect to find at a store is out of stock , a Costco shopper is likely to think , “ I should have gotten it last time , ” Professor Hoch said .
Other retailers may also seek to entice shoppers by setting limits and creating scarcity .
For example , Target offers limited - edition designer clothing and home furnishings that are unique to its stores , and that are often stocked for a period of only 60 to 90 days .
And at BJ ’s Wholesale Club , customers may come for their everyday grocery items , “ but if they spot some jewelry or the new capri pants at a great price they will be happier , ” said Teleia Farrell , a company spokeswoman .
BJ ’s uses items like 42 - inch televisions and topaz rings to turn “ ho - hum shopping into an exciting environment , ” she said .
It is the same at Sam ’s Club , where “ members enjoy looking throughout the club for unexpected deals , ” said Susan Koehler , a spokeswoman for the company .
Temporarily stocked surprises are also a calculated part of the Costco shopping experience .
“ We try to have hundreds of items that are different each time a customer comes to the warehouse , to create a treasure - hunt atmosphere , ” said Joel Benoliel , a senior vice president .
“ We ’ll always have the same staples — the cereal , the detergent — and then we add in the ‘ wow ’ items . ”
But at the same time , there can be a comforting sameness to each cavernous location .
I 'm sure there 's an innocent explanation for this -- I just can't think of what it might be .
Federal spending on paper shredding has increased more than 600 percent since George W. Bush took office .
This chart , generated by usaspending .gov , the U.S. government 's brand spanking new database of federal expenditures , shows spending on " contracts for paper shredding services " going back to 2000 .
Click here for the full , heartbreaking breakdown .
In 2000 , the feds spent $ 452,807 to make unpleasant truths go away ; by 2006 , the " Cheney Effect " had bumped that number up to $ 2.9 million .
And by halfway through 2007 , the feds almost matched that number , with $ 2.7 million and counting .
Pretty much says it all .
Obama picks up union backing in Nevada Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday January 9 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Hillary Clinton 's campaign may have risen from the grave Tuesday night , but the race for the Democratic presidential nomination remains close as candidates prepare for the next rounds of primaries and caucuses .
Barack Obama , who was blocked from back - to - back upsets with his defeat in New Hampshire , is by no means out of the race , and Wednesday brought news that the Illinois Senator had secured the backing of two key labor unions in Nevada , which holds its caucuses Jan. 19 .
Despite his narrow 39 - to - 36 percent loss Tuesday , Obama still picked up the endorsements of the Culinary Workers and Service Employees International unions .
ABC reports that the Culinary backing is " seen as the biggest get " in Nevada .
Many of its 60,000 members work in the massive hotels and casinos along the Las Vegas strip , and they will provide key support in the caucuses , which are only expected to draw 40,000 voters .
Those unions will contribute to Obama 's organization in Nevada and elsewhere .
Campaign manager David Plouffe bragged in a strategy memo Wednesday that Obama was better organized in caucus states and continued to raise money and attract volunteers , including a half - million - dollar haul Wednesday morning alone .
In the 4th Quarter of 2007 , our campaign raised $ 23.5 million  over $ 22.5 million of which is for the primary election .
In that quarter , we added 111,000 new donors for a total of 475,000 donors in 2007 .
In the first 8 days of 2008 , we raised over $ 8 million and gained 35,000 new donors .
Since midnight last night , we have raised another $ 500,000 online .
We continue to build a grassroots movement that makes us best - positioned to compete financially in the primaries and caucuses coming up .
The SEIU ended a " tortured process that unveiled infighting within its ranks " in voting to endorse Obama over former Sen.
John Edwards , who picked up 17 percent of New Hampshire 's vote in his third - place finish , reports the Las Vegas Sun .
The union had previously dismissed Clinton from consideration .
Obama has long courted the unions , and their support could help the freshman senator score a key victory next Saturday that could help him regain some momentum lost Tuesday night .
A week later , on Jan. 26 , voters in South Carolina vote in their primary ; pre-New Hampshire polls showed Obama with a solid lead there .
Whatever happens in those two states , observers see the next and perhaps definitive showdown between Clinton and Obama coming Feb. 5 , when more than 20 states hold primaries .
U.S. ( TGW ) – A new study conducted by the National Climatic Data Center concludes that the supposed “ global cooling ” consensus among scientists in the 1970s is a myth .
Newsweek , Time , The New York Times and National Geographic all published articles speculating that the Earth could be on the path towards a new ice age .
However , Thomas Peterson of the National Climatic Data Center surveyed dozens of peer - reviewed scientific articles from 1965 to 1979 and found that only seven supported global cooling , while 44 predicted warming .
Peterson says 20 others were neutral in their assessments of climate trends .
" There was no scientific consensus in the 1970s that the Earth was headed into an imminent ice age , " the report says .
" A review of the literature suggests that , to the contrary , greenhouse warming even then dominated scientists ' thinking about the most important forces shaping Earth 's climate on human time scales . "
Even within the media there was no consensus of cooling , Peterson reports .
" Even cursory review of the news media coverage of the issue reveals that , just as there was no consensus at the time among scientists , so was there also no consensus among journalists . "

In his latest book , How to Build a Robot Army , robotics expert Daniel Wilson offers a humorous but scientifically - accurate account of how people would fight aliens , giant monsters , and more mundane enemies ( like other humans ) with robot armies .
Unafraid to tackle science fictional questions with real science , Wilson is also the author of the award - winning How to Survive a Robot Uprising .
We caught up with him over email , and asked him some burning questions about preparing Earth for alien attack , and which animals we should be engineering to be our new biotech weapons .
Plus , we got him to answer , definitively , who would win in a fight between Giant Robot and Cloverfield .
Check out our interview , below .

What kind of alien attack is Earth the least prepared for ?
I 'm going to go out on a limb and claim that Earth is desperately unprepared for any kind of alien attack .
That includes national monument shattering Independence Day - style attacks , treacherous human - cloning Invasion of the Body Snatchers - style assaults , and also lethal laser - spewing War of the Worlds - style incursions .
Remember this :
Whether the aliens are hiding in hovering saucers , blending in with the human populace , or attacking helpless humans door - to - door - there is a robot defense , whether it be spying micro-air vehicles , infectious nano - robots , or faithful unmanned ground vehicles .
And of course , the robots can also protect us from zombies , werewolves , and super - intelligent great white sharks .

In your new book , you offer a lot of helpful , concrete advice on building a robot army to defeat alien invaders .
But should n't we be forming armies of bioengineered defenders too ?
What would be your first pick for a life form we should reengineer for alien defense ?
Bugs .
Just like robots , bugs are covered in armored exoskeletons , impervious to having their legs ripped off , and I 'm pretty sure that they have n't got any feelings .
How to Build a Robot Army does n't pay much attention to genetic modification , but it puts a whole lot of thought into how to upgrade biological creatures with robotic modifications .
Here 's a fun fact to know and tell : Scientists believe that by implanting a micro-electromechanical system ( MEMS ) at the pupa stage , insects will integrate the devices seamlessly into their bodies as they grow - like a tree growing through a fence .
Hmmm ...
Let 's take a peek into my Bag of the Future .
What 's that ?
It 's full of robot scorpions !
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
While I 'm sure a title like How to Build a Robot Army is popular here on Earth , and it makes sense to market it to humans , I 'd like to know what titles you 're marketing on other planets .
Have you written books for robots and aliens about how to crush Earthlings ?
Tell us about those books , and some of the advice you give to nonhumans that we 're not getting here on Earth .
Originally , I had planned to write a book called " A Robot 's Guide to Life with Humans . "
( And I still might , so hands off ! )
The goal was to explain how the world works from a robot 's perspective , so that readers could really understand how robots think .
Then I realized that it would be more fun and just as informative if I were to write a book that taught humans how to work with robots - hand in gripper - as a fighting team .
In order to give a command to a robot , teach a robot karate , or modify a household robot for battle you have to understand the little plastic critters inside and out .

OK , and now for the question in everybody 's minds :
Who would win in a fight between Giant Robot and Cloverfield ?
Metal beats flesh .
The book covers a similar scenario , describing how to defeat Godzilla .
The secret is : Do n't send in a Giant Robot !
That would be just silly .
First , keep a legion of autonomous underwater vehicles out patrolling the oceans .
( Giant monsters almost always emerge from the seas . )
As soon as the monster appears , send thousands of flying micro-air vehicles toward it to collect information .
Unmanned aerial vehicles are too large and will likely be destroyed just like conventional aircraft , but a swarm of six - inch spying eyes are too small for Cloverfield to even notice .
Once a weakness has been identified , send in mining robots that are loaded with swarms of smaller , crab - like burrowing robots , explosives - laden suicide robots , and robots with sensing and communications equipment .
Using a mix of human telepresence and robot autonomy , this heterogenous team of robot troops can find weak spots in Cloverfield 's skin , burrow deeply toward vital organs or brain matter , and detonate in a series of controlled explosions .
Now we humans can eat the carcass for the next hundred years .
The great circle of life is complete !
Lance Corporals Michael White and Anthony Creswick bought pistols and ammunition on the Iraqi black market while on a tour of duty with the 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment , the court heard .
The weapons were then smuggled to Osnabrück in Germany , where the soldiers hoped to sell them on .
The court martial , sitting at Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire , was told that L / Cpl White and L / Cpl Creswick even produced a catalogue with photographs and details of the weapons they intended to " tout " around their unit .
It also heard that one soldier , Corporal Darren Clemie , offered them 30g of cocaine for two pistols , which L / Cpl White and L / Cpl Creswick subdivided into 1g wraps and intended to sell to other soldiers for a profit .
Nigel Jones , prosecuting , told the hearing that L / Cpl White and L / Cpl Creswick sold four pistols between May and July 2005 .
L/Cpl White has admitted charges relating to the buying and selling of weapons and ammunition and supplying cocaine .
He will be called as the main prosecution witness , the court was told .
Mr Jones said the plan collapsed when other soldiers discovered that the guns were being sold , and arrests followed .
The court was told that although L / Cpl Creswick led police to the weapons , in interviews he said he was looking after them for a friend .
Cpl Clemie denied any involvement .
L/ Cpl Creswick denies three charges of selling a prohibited weapon and supplying a controlled drug .
He admits unlawful possession of ammunition and possession of a prohibited weapon .
Cpl Clemie denies possession of a prohibited weapon , ammunition and supplying a controlled drug .
A third soldier , Sergeant James Malone , denies a single charge of possessing three hand grenades .
The hearing continues .
Twenty years ago , as a college freshman , I knew precisely what it meant to be scientifically literate .
In fact , I held an objective measure in the palm of my hand , courtesy of E.D. Hirsch .
His book , " Cultural Literacy : What Every American Needs to Know , " was a bestselling paperback , and conveniently listed thousands of names , terms , and phrases with which every educated person – he informed us – should be familiar .
After plodding through the entire list during the course of an afternoon , I smugly discovered I could easily define each item of scientific vocabulary .
Fuzziness about literary examples such as " Aeschylus " caused me no discomfort , but inability to rigorously describe " aerobic respiration " in the biochemical sense ( not the superficial , then - popular Jane Fonda sense ) would have induced severe nerdish embarrassment .
The wrong kind of scientific literacy
Today I teach science and its history at an honors college and am naturally far less confident about how to measure scientific literacy .
The students who enter our program possess not only the expected high SAT scores , but also perfect or near - perfect scores on a battery of Advanced Placement exams , particularly in the basic sciences .
A noticeable portion of those students also believe in the literal truth of certain ancient accounts of Earth 's history that , to put it bluntly , directly contradict mountains of well - established data from geology , climatology , and biology .
Without rehashing the ongoing culture wars surrounding this topic ( and certainly without berating my own students ) , this serves as a useful place to begin tackling the notion of " scientific literacy . "
We frequently hear the refrain that if America simply raised the level of science courses , taught our children more subjects , and / or gave them more hands - on lab work , it could ensure the production of a citizenry capable of understanding an increasingly complex world .
They would then be prepared to make the difficult choices of the 21st century .
However , my incoming students ' technical mastery already exceeds what even the most rosy - eyed optimist could realistically dream for America ( or the globe ) as a whole .
In other words , even if a citizenry were to achieve an impressive degree of scientific literacy – construed as raw conceptual competence – it would still be entirely possible for those same citizens to routinely subordinate scientific evidence to their own deeply ingrained cultural suppositions .
Evidence blindness
More important , the phenomenon of " evidence blindness " is hardly restricted to inexperienced students , or even to ideological segments of the general population .
To varying degrees , it can be found across the spectrum , including some very striking examples in the realm of professional science itself .
As noted last year in Seed magazine , leading disciplinary practitioners who feel threatened by unorthodox new findings will sometimes band together to suppress such information , with the explicit intention of blocking its appearance in scientific journals .
While these luminaries undoubtedly convince themselves they are merely upholding the integrity of their fields , the truth is that they ( in quintessentially human fashion ) are often more interested in preserving cherished beliefs than in encouraging potentially disruptive discoveries .
Over the past few decades , growing evidence from cognitive science has revealed significant limits on the ability of individuals to criticize their own viewpoints .
Even the most analytically gifted and experienced among us are susceptible to bias and self - deception to an extent that we ( fittingly enough ) generally fail to appreciate .
As psychologist Daniel Gilbert puts it in his book " Stumbling on Happiness , " " Each of us is trapped in a place , a time , and a circumstance , and our attempts to use our minds to transcend those boundaries are , more often than not , ineffective . "
The reason science does manage to be astonishingly effective is not because large groups are automatically wiser or less prone to self - deception than individuals .
History adequately demonstrates that , if anything , the opposite is more nearly the case .
Science works because its core dynamics – not its methods or techniques per se – are rooted in pitting intellects against one another .
Science eventually yields impressive answers because it compels smart people to incessantly try to disprove the ideas generated by other smart people .
The goal of science is to find those ideas that can withstand the long and hard barrage of evidence - based argument .
That lesson must be experienced anew by the members of each generation , irrespective of their careers .
Mastery of scientific concepts and theories is a necessary starting point , but it serves only as a prerequisite to joining the never - ending dialogue .
Students must learn firsthand how to both imaginatively create new hypotheses and dispassionately critique them .
Many commentators have rightly implored us to make certain that young people encounter the " thrill " of discovery .
While this is undeniably desirable , it is arguably even more crucial that they experience the agony ( if only on a modest scale ) of having a pet hypothesis demolished by facts .
Several current presidential candidates have insisted that they oppose the modern scientific account of Earth 's natural history as a matter of principle .
In the present cultural climate , altering one 's beliefs in response to anything ( facts included ) is considered a sign of weakness .
Students must be convinced that changing one 's mind in light of the evidence is not weakness :
Changing one 's mind is the essence of intellectual growth .
By encouraging students into evidence - based debates with one another , this mode of interaction , like any other , can become habitual .
After being consistently challenged by their peers , most students eventually see that attempts to free themselves from facts are a hollow , and fundamentally precarious , form of " freedom . "
Value in criticizing ideas
In an era in which we tremble at offending the sensibilities of our neighbors , students must comprehend that it is not only possible but absolutely vital that we criticize one another 's ideas about reality firmly yet civilly .
They must do this despite clear cases of prominent scientists falling into petty , acerbic ( and therefore counterproductive ) exchanges .
The responsibility for fostering scientific literacy of this sort – that is , literacy construed as an ongoing commitment to evidence over preconception – falls upon all of us in our discussions both formal and informal , both public and private .
When scientific celebrities fail to set a good example for students , it is especially incumbent upon the rest of us to set them back on the proverbial right track , rather than to reflexively hasten their derailment .
We do our children no favors by going easy on them – or , more to the point – allowing them to go easy on each other .
Nature has a way of being far tougher .
If we can create environments in which they can safely have small epiphanies in the light of evidence , they will be motivated to share those lessons .
They will then be scientifically literate in the sense that scientific discourse will continue to endure and flourish .
And that is the sense that ultimately matters .

Where 's the ant ?
This tropical ant of the species Cephalotes atratus is infected with a parasitic roundworm that makes its bulbous rear end , called a gaster , look like a juicy red berry .
Researchers believe the parasites transform the gasters to trick foraging birds into eating the ants .
Birds poop out parasite eggs , allowing the worms to spread to new ant colonies .
" These ants , in nature , go out and collect bird feces , " explained study leader Steve Yanoviak , an insect ecologist at the University of Arkansas in Little Rock .
The finding is the first known example of fruit mimicry caused by a parasite , he added .
The researchers suspect the nematodes grow up inside the ants , then cause the hard outer layer of the gasters to thin .
When combined with the yellowish coloring of worm eggs , this makes the body segments appear amber .
" When you combine those two effects in the sunlight , you get a nice , bright red ant rear end , " Yanoviak said .
Infected ants tend to hold their infested gasters in an elevated position over the rest of their bodies , making them " really conspicuous , " he added .
The ants also become sluggish , and the gaster itself weakens , making it easily plucked off by birds , the researchers noted .
" [ The ants ] often feed out on leaf surfaces collecting pollen , collecting bird droppings , so they are pretty highly exposed , " Yanoviak said .
Tricked Birds ?
Yanoviak and his colleagues hypothesize that birds are tricked into thinking infected ants are ripe berries and eating them .
Birds do n't normally feast on Cephalotes atratus ants , which are thickly armored and full of bad - tasting chemicals .
The eggs pass unharmed through the birds ' digestive systems .
Ants then eat the bird feces , giving rise to a new generation of parasites in a new population of ants .
However , the researchers have not yet observed a bird actually eat one of the ants .
To test the hypothesis in the lab , Yanoviak fed an infected ant to a chicken .
The parasite eggs came out in the chicken feces unscathed , he noted .
He also examined pieces of bird droppings collected from ants marching back to their colonies and found a parasite similar to the one that turns the ant gasters red .
" No matter how we look at it , somehow that parasite has to infect new colonies , or else it would die with its host colony .
So there has to be a mechanism for transport to a new colony , " Yanoviak said .
" And the association of this ant species in particular with bird droppings makes the message even stronger for implicating the bird as the vector . "
Janice Moore is a biologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins and an expert on the ecology and evolution of parasitic worms .
She said the researchers have done just about everything they could to show the infected ants might be fruit mimics and how the parasite could spread among ant colonies .
" That 's pretty cool , " she said .
Humans notice the fruit mimic ants readily because they are readily visible , she added , but other examples of parasite - induced change probably abound .
" As humans , we are highly visual and we notice visual modifications , " she wrote in a follow - up email .
" We are less conscious of , say , olfactory or auditory alterations .
30 - Year Summit County Republican Boss Alex Arshinkoff Latest in Series of Ohio Election Officials to Face Reprimand , Criminal Charges
' Ran Local GOP Machine Out of Election Board Office , ' Says Democrat SoS Brunner ; ' Abused Power , Position , Employees , ' Says Republican State Senator Vying for Party Chair ...
Brad Friedman Byon 2/20/2008 , 8:04 pm PT
Breaking late tonight on the Cleveland Plain - Dealer 's blog comes news that the Summit County , Ohio , Republican Party Chair , Alex Arshinkoff , is being removed from his position on the county Elections Board by Democratic Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner .
According to the report , Boss Arshinkoff has been running the party machine out of the county election office , which even Republican State Senator Kevin Coughlin --- who is currently the first to vie for Arshinkoff 's job as party chairman during his 30 - year reign --- says has led to his having " abused his power ... abused his position [ and his having ] abused employees at the board to strengthen his grip on the local party apparatus . "
Arshinkoff becomes the latest in a series of Board of Elections officials who served under former Sec. of State J. Kenneth Blackwell to face either criminal sentences or disciplinary action since Brunner has taken office .
Writes Michael O'Malley and Laura Johnston at the P - D tonight ...
Arshinkoff , who was up for reappointment this year , was nominated by the county 's GOP , but Democratic Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , who by law approves board nominations , rejected it .
" It would be inappropriate to have him serve longer , " Brunner said .
Brunner said Arshinkoff , an old - style political boss , was running his GOP machine out of elections board offices , threatening and intimidating board workers who balked at his orders .
In a letter to Arshinkoff , she wrote : " Credible claims indicate that you have berated staff and created a hostile work environment in which board employees have endured coercion if not outright threats . "
...
Republican state Sen. Kevin Coughlin , who is leading the first challenge to Arshinkoff 's 30 years as the county 's Republican party chairman , commended Brunner 's move .
" I think that it validates what we 've been saying , that Alex Arshinkoff is not a leader that Republicans can be proud of , " said Coughlin , of Cuyahoga Falls .
" He has abused his power .
He has abused his position .
He has abused employees at the board to strengthen his grip on the local party apparatus . "
It 's not the first time Brunner has exercised her power to remove county Election Officials since taking office in 2007 .
Shortly after taking over the job from the controversial and corrupt former Secretary of State Blackwell , Brunner fired the entire Cuyahoga County ( Cleveland ) Election Board , headed by state GOP Boss Bob Bennett .
In March of 2007 , two Cuyahoga Election Officials were sentenced to 18 months in prison for having rigged the 2004 Presidential recount in the county .
The decision was remanded for retrial on a technicality , and the two woman were later given suspended sentences after pleading no contest before the second trial could begin .
Last month Brunner 's office announced an investigation of improprieties by the Franklin County ( Columbus ) Board of Elections , as led by Republican Matt Damschroder , who was previously docked for 30 days pay , during the Blackwell era , for having accepted a $ 10,000 " donation " from a lobbyist representing the Diebold voting machine company and then passing it on to Republican officials .
Also last month , Damschroder 's deputy , Michael Hackett , plead guilty to personally profiting from a contract for county voting machine equipment .
Hackett , who had resigned in wake of the charges , was sentenced to 180 days in jail , but was given a suspended sentence by the judge .
Former SoS Blackwell had become infamous for claiming corruption could not possibly take place on Buckeye State election boards due to the fact that each of them is supposedly represented by two Democrats and two Republicans each .
However , Ohio Election Integrity advocates and whistleblowers have argued that many of the Democratic appointees may have been little more than DINO 's ( Democrats in name only ) , since some had apparently never voted in a Democratic Primary election until just prior to being appointed to the boards by Blackwell .
Brunner has come under fire herself from Republicans , Democrats , and Election Integrity experts alike for recommendations made in the wake of her recent landmark EVEREST report on electronic voting systems .
The report , created by a private security lab along with computer scientists and security experts from four different academic institutions , found --- yet again --- that every e-voting system in use in Ohio was highly vulnerable to " critical security failures , " easy manipulation , and frequent error .
The BRAD BLOG featured an exclusive interview with Brunner , the first such in - depth conversation after the release of the report 's findings last December , in which we asked her about many of those concerns .
Last month Brunner announced that all voters in Ohio would be entitled to vote on paper ballots , if they wished , in the upcoming Presidential Primary elections in the state .
The decision brought a court challenge from Republican Election officials , though one of those challenges was recently dismissed by a circuit court judge .
The state 's 2008 Presidential Primary --- which could well determine the Democratic nominee for President --- is scheduled for March 4th .
This could get ugly .
Again .

The bird flu virus affecting poultry is the H5N1 strain
So far , the H5N1 strain has mainly infected birds and poultry workers , but experts fear the virus could mutate to pass easily from human to human .
However , Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that to enter human respiratory cells the virus must first pick a very specific type of lock .
The study appears in the journal Nature Biotechnology .
The researchers say their discovery may help scientists better monitor changes in H5N1 - and find better ways to fight it .
Flu viruses attack by binding sugar chains , called glycans , that line the airways and lungs .
Latching on
The chemical linkages between the sugar molecules in these chains differ between humans and birds .
Until now it has been assumed that bird flu viruses would be adapt to humans simply by acquiring mutations that enable them to attach to the human types .
But Dr Ram Sasisekharan and colleagues found this step depends on the shape assumed by the flexible sugar chains rather than the type of linkage .
Bird flu viruses currently require cone - shaped glycans to infect birds , so the umbrella shape found in humans has protected most of us from avian flu .
This suggests that for the H5N1 bird flu virus to become pandemic it must adapt so that it can latch onto the umbrella - shaped glycans of the human upper respiratory tract .
It is likely that other factors , like the reduced temperate of the human upper airway , also are involved
Professor Ian Jones of Reading University
Dr Jeremy Berg of the National Institutes of Health which funded the work said : " Sasisekharan 's team has changed our view of flu viruses and how they must adapt to infect us .
" The work may also improve our ability to monitor the evolution of the H5N1 virus and thwart potential outbreaks . "
Professor Ian Jones , professor of virology at the University of Reading , said : " This new work shows that there are sublevels of sugar that the virus prefers to use to get into cells and the authors suggest this is a significant factor in why H5N1 has not yet spread to humans .
" It provides a finer level of analysis than has been done so far but it is likely that other factors , like the reduced temperate of the human upper airway , also are involved . "
OK , let 's see what happens now ...
The U.S. Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into the destruction of CIA interrogation videotapes , and Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey said Wednesday that he appointed an outside prosecutor to oversee the case .
The CIA acknowledged last month that it destroyed videos of officers using tough interrogation methods while questioning two al - Qaida suspects .
The acknowledgment sparked a congressional inquiry and a preliminary investigation by Justice .
" The Department 's National Security Division has recommended , and I have concluded , that there is a basis for initiating a criminal investigation of this matter , and I have taken steps to begin that investigation , " Mukasey said in a statement released Wednesday .
Mukasey named John Durham , a federal prosecutor , to oversee the case .
Durham has a reputation as one of the most relentless U.S. prosecutors ... read on
And we know how much Republicans like " outside prosecutors . "
Or is that special prosecutors ?
I mean this in the Patrick Fitzgerald kinda way .
We 'll be talking about this a whole lot more as time goes on ...
UPDATED : CNN's Jeffrey Toobin just said that this case is going to take a fairly long time to complete and there will be tons of subpoenas being thrown around
Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton wrote an op -ed for the NY Times : " Stonewalled by the C.I.A . "
MORE than five years ago , Congress and President Bush created the 9/11 commission .
The goal was to provide the American people with the fullest possible account of the “ facts and circumstances relating to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 ” — and to offer recommendations to prevent future attacks .
Soon after its creation , the president ’s chief of staff directed all executive branch agencies to cooperate with the commission .
The commission ’s mandate was sweeping and it explicitly included the intelligence agencies .
But the recent revelations that the C.I.A. destroyed videotaped interrogations of Qaeda operatives leads us to conclude that the agency failed to respond to our lawful requests for information about the 9/11 plot .
Those who knew about those videotapes — and did not tell us about them — obstructed our investigation ... read on
It only took them a year longer than it should have , but Microsoft has finally relented and approved the use of Windows Vista Basic and Premium Edition in virtualized environments , for both " consumers " and business users .
Among other things , the change means that Mac and Linux users can now run Windows Vista in a VM without having to pay for the more expensive Business or Ultimate editions .
This is a boon to anyone who needs virtualized environments for testing and development .
" For consumers , Windows Vista Home Basic and Windows Vista Home Premium are now licensed for use in a virtual machine environment , " the company said in a statement .
An updated end - user license agreement will be posted later at this location .
The move is n't a total surprise , even if it is months late .
The company came very close to repealing its ban last summer , only to inexplicably pull the plug at the last minute .
On the record , Microsoft said that the ban stemmed from their view that virtualization " is not yet mature enough from a security perspective for broad consumer adoption . "
To be frank , we never bought this excuse , because you could get the " maturity " needed to virtualize Vista for the $ 60 + premium that Business costs over and against Home Premium .
That debate is history now .
The announcement kicks off Microsoft's Virtualization Deployment Summit , which begins in earnest tomorrow .
The company is also expected to tout several other developments for business virtualization over the two - day summit , including the acquisition of Calista Technologies and an expanded partnership with Citrix .
Microsoft is beating the virtualization drum hard , gearing up for what will likely be a protracted war with the perceived industry leader , VMWare .
Microsoft 's message is going to be ease - of - use and cost .
Bob Muglia , senior vice president of the Server and Tools Business at Microsoft , said in a statement that Microsoft estimates that " less than 5 percent of companies are utilizing virtualization technology because it is simply too cost - prohibitive and complex . "
Microsoft argues that it has the most " economical " approach to virtualization from desktop to datacenter , and lowering the cost barrier on the client certainly helps .
Still , while great news for users who want to virtualize Vista legally , and on the cheap , it 's still an open question when businesses will begin migrating to Vista in force , and if any of that migration will feature significant virtualization on the client end .
Cupertino , please start your copiers , please ?!
Anytime I write about Microsoft and virtualization , someone e-mails me to remind me that Apple does n't allow the virtualization of its client OS , which would seem to make Microsoft a " thought leader " according to some of you .
Others wonder if / when Cupertino would ever allow it .
It 's true that Apple does n't allow client virtualization , and I think I speak for just about everyone when I say that no one believes it 's likely to happen soon .
Apple does n't even allow its customers the legal right to run its client OS on non-Apple computers , so virtualization is out of the question .
Apple , unlike Microsoft , is in the PC - selling business , and unlike Microsoft , Apple uses a set of technological access controls to prevent its OS from running on unauthorized hardware .
Why ?
Apple does n't want you , me , and every other reader of this site to do what they know we'd do : run out and build our own " Macs . "
If you want OS X , Apple wants you to buy a Mac , period .
With the company 's notorious focus on control and design , we do n't see this changing any time soon .

Everyone tuned into the US democratic primary will be aware that the Clinton camp has gone bibliography crazy in the past day or two , accusing Obama of borrowing without credit a few lines of a speech given this weekend from Massachussetts governer Deval Patrick .
Clinton ’s strategists hope to bring Obama ’s cultish suporters back to reality , since a man with no original words is certainly not a man worth listening to for very long .
Patrick fired back that his friend , Obama , was free to use his ideas and rhetoric if he liked .
Possibly more remarkable than the Clinton - camp response is that of Republican strategist , Holly Robichaud .
“ It certainly goes in the face of his squeaky - clean image , ” she wrote in a weekly blog for the Herald .
“ It is clear he used the same words – there is no question about it .
It will hurt him , but maybe not enough for him to lose ground . ”
His squeeky clean image ?
How many of us have written a paper at one point during our careers with perhaps an improperly labelled or cited source ?
As a result of Plagiarism - Gate , I ’d like to be the first to recognize the source for Obama ’s most memorable line to date : Yes We Can .
Bob the Builder , a children ’s television character created by Keith Chapman , was the source of this popular line of vernacular .
He sings a song which is sourced below for all to review .
I mention this because I want to make sure we ’re all being as up front as possible about where our ideas come from before those drips over at Clinton and Republican headquarters decide to take a bite .
And also because it ’s gonna take a hell of a lot longer than a phonecall to Patrick for Chapman to come up with an animated response allowing Obama access to Yes We Can , with all the clay figures and the stop motion and all that .

Hillary Clinton Trying to Steal Nomination ?
James Joyner · · 21 comments
Hillary Clinton has issued a call to retroactively seat the delegates from Michigan and Florida that were ousted for holding their primaries earlier than allowed .
She does so in the language of party unity :
“ I believe our nominee will need the enthusiastic support of Democrats in these states to win the general election , and so I will ask my Democratic convention delegates to support seating the delegations from Florida and Michigan .
I know not all of my delegates will do so and I fully respect that decision .
But I hope to be President of all 50 states and U.S. territories , and that we have all 50 states represented and counted at the Democratic convention .
Of course , this is complicated somewhat by the fact that she ran unopposed in Michigan — because her opponents followed the rules and took their names off the ballot and she did not — and is expected to win Florida easily .
Robert Prather observed in the previous post , “ I suspect that this is only the beginning of the Clintons ’ shenanigans . ”
Quite right .
And this view is n’t just coming from the Clinton Derangement Syndrome infected Right Wing Conspiracy engaging in the Politics of Personal Destruction because they Hate Strong Women .
From the Obama campaign :
“ No one is more disappointed that Florida Democrats will have no role in selecting delegates for the nomination of the party ’s standard bearer than Senator Obama .
When Senator Clinton was campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire , she made it clear that states like Michigan and Florida that would n’t produce any delegates , ‘ do n’t count for anything . ’
Now that Senator Clinton ’s worried about losing the first Southern primary , she ’s using Florida for her own political gain by trying to assign meaning to a contest that awards zero delegates and where no campaigning has occurred .
Senator Clinton ’s own campaign has repeatedly said that this is a ‘ contest for delegates ’ , and Florida is a contest that offers zero .
Whether it is Barack Obama ’s record , her position on Social Security , or even the meaning of the Florida Primary , it seems like Hillary Clinton will do or say anything to win an election .
When he is the nominee , Barack Obama will campaign vigorously in Florida and Michigan to put them in the Democratic column in 2008 . ”
Many prominent left - of - center bloggers concur .
Josh Marshall declares , “ The Clinton camp really needs to be shut down on this new gambit of theirs to muscle the party and the other candidates into seating the Michigan and Florida delegate slates ” and argues that you “ do n’t change the rules in midstream to favor one candidate or another . ”
( An argument I seem to recall having heard before some seven - odd years ago . )
As Joe Gandelman points out , Clinton made that argument herself months ago .
Matt Yglesias dubs this “ Calvinball ” and argues , “ There was a time and a place to stand up for the Michigan and Florida primaries , but she did n’t do it . ”
Tim Dickinson proclaims it , “ like changing the rules in the middle of a basketball game to count the pre-game layup drills in the final score . ”
Ezra Klein warns ,
“ This is the sort of decision that has the potential to tear the party apart . ”
She ’s doing so right before Florida , to intensify her good press in the state , where Obama is also on the ballot .
And since this is a complicated , internal - party matter that sounds weird to those not versed in it ( of course Michigan and Florida should count ! ) , she ’s adding a public challenge that , if the other Democrats deny , will make them seem anti-Michigan and Florida .
But if this pushes her over the edge , the Obama camp , and their supporters , really will feel that she stole her victory .
They did n’t contest those states because they were n’t going to count , not because they were so committed to the DNC ’s procedural arguments that they were willing to sacrifice dozens of delegates to support it .
It ’s as hard as hardball gets , and the end could be unimaginably acrimonious .
Imagine if African - American voters feel the rules were changed to prevent Obama ’s victory , if young voters feel the delegate counts were shifted to block their candidate .
Marc Ambinder argues that this proclamation , coming just before Tuesday ’s vote in Florida , essentially violates her pledge not to campaign in Florida .
( Marshall , correctly , makes the same point about her leaving her name on the ballot in Michigan . )
Ron Chusid believes this a continuation of Clinton ’s “ dirty politics . ”
Robert Farley proclaims it “ pretty appalling ” and a “ nasty little power grab . ”
Marcy
Wheeler calls it “ bullshit . ”
Not all of the Netroots feel this way .
Big Tent Liberal observes that , as a technical matter , the party did n’t require the candidates to take their names off the ballots in Michigan and that they could n’t do so in Florida without dropping out of the race entirely .
Further , the rules of the game allow the convention delegates to reinstate these delegates .
This is true , so far as it goes .
But there ’s a difference between the spirit of the law and its letter .
Both of Clinton ’s serious opponents honored a pledge to take their name off the Michigan ballot in order to comply with their agreement not to “ campaign or participate ” in primaries held before the allowed dates .
It ’s also true , as many commenters have argued , that we always knew the Florida and Michigan delegates would eventually be seated .
But there ’s a stark difference between doing it as a gesture of party unity after a nomination is wrapped up versus doing it in the heat of the race as a campaign stunt .
The unmitigated gall at attempting to simultaneously change to rules to her advantage and yet claim to be doing it for the good of the party is so amazingly Clintonian that one has to be at least a bit impressed .
For Democrats who believe that they keep losing national elections to Republicans because they ’re just not willing to play rough enough , this has to inspire hope .
One has to wonder at the desperation of this move .
Ezra is right at the possible damage this could do to the party .
Yet , Clinton had to be the favorite to win the nomination , anyway , even without resorting to such tactics , since the Super Delegates are going to go her way , overwhelmingly , unless Obama runs away with the race from here on out .
Maybe she knows something we do n’t .
The Japanese electronics retailer Edion is deeply ashamed it sold its customers HD DVD gear .
So ashamed they that they 're allowing buyers to swap in Toshiba HD DVD boxes for Blu-ray players .
A little more investigation reveals that the trade must occur during March , and consumers only need pay the price difference .
If a US retailer of the world would make such a move , they'd have me as a customer for life .
But , I doubt any of the big stores here have the vision to put long term customer retention over its short term profits .
I 'm also sure that the margins on the more costly Blu-ray players are helping to float the difference .

AT&T customers will no longer have to pay a flat fee to exit their mobile contracts early , nor will they be required to extend their contracts when changing calling plans mid-contract .
AT&T made the announcement this morning , billing the changes as part of the company 's " more consumer - friendly policies . "
The calling plan change will take effect in November , with the early - termination fee change taking place in early 2008 .
Instead of paying the flat , $ 175 fee to exit a mobile contract early , AT&T customers will be able to pay a prorated fee depending on the amount of time left in the contract .
AT&T declined to offer more details on the fee changes , but said that more details would be available next year when the policy is put in place .
It will affect new and renewing wireless customers who sign service agreements with the company .
" AT&T leads the wireless industry in the flexibility , friendliness and fairness of its practices , and the new policies we have announced today are the most recent examples of that leadership , " said Paul Roth , president of Sales and Marketing for the company 's wireless unit .
" Customers have told us they do not like one - size - fits - all approaches .
They are right , and that is why we have made these important changes . "
AT&T is making the changes in the wake of what appears to be an overall industry reform on consumer policies .
Verizon also announced earlier this month that it would no longer force customers to extend their contracts when changing service plans , which went into effect on October 7 .
Both companies may also be trying to stay ahead of stay ahead of the Cell Phone Empowerment Act , which was introduced to the Senate last month .
The bill mandates prorated early termination fees , the elimination of extra fees that are not required by state and local governments , and require companies to allow customers 30 days to cancel their contracts every time their contracts are extended .
Unsurprisingly , the cellular industry is opposing the bill , arguing that the changes would be harmful to consumers and that the proposed legislation is based on incomplete data .
AT&T and Verizon 's recent policy changes indicate that they are trying to forestall Congressional action by making some much - needed changes of their own .
そうそう人月はなくならない。世界の何処だってヒトを売るときは人月だ。同じヒトを買うならユーザー企業が直接雇用した方が方が安いし組織の壁がなく合理的だ。米国で日本よりパッケージの活用が進むなど合理的な情報システムが構築されやすいのは、一時的なコンサルティングやプロフェッショナルサービスはともかく、システムの企画とか調整はユーザー企業の従業員が行っていることが大きい。きっちり業務プロセスから見直すことができるし、ちゃんとコストを下げるインセンティブが働いているのだ。
日本でそういった企業が少ないのは、ジョブローテーションの中で情シス部門のスペシャリストを育て、しかるべき処遇を用意することが難しく、減点法の人事評価ではリスクを取って新しい技術を導入するより、付き合いの長い業者に丸投げして失敗を避け、或いは失敗しても責任を押し付けた方が得だからだ。
つまりユーザー企業の発注能力が低いとか、重層的な下請け構造とか、日本の情報サービス産業がおかしいと指摘されることの多くは雇用慣行への適応の結果であって、ユーザー企業やSIerの主体的な経営判断ではない。パッケージやSaaSの活用を更に進めるには、ユーザー企業とSIer双方のマインドセットやインセンティブが変わらなければならないが、いまの業界構造の背景にある解雇規制を取っ払っていかなければ、SOAとかSaaSも、昔の戦略情報システムとかオブジェクト指向のようにバズワードとして消費されて終わるのではないか。*1
同じソフトをつくる仕事だからといって、受託開発からパッケージへと業態転換していくことは小野さんが指摘しているように非常に難しい。仮にそれができたとしても、これまでバラバラにやってたことが実装の共通化が進んで車輪の再発明が減る訳で、同じことをやる分には業界として必要な人手がかなり減ることになる。ミクロ的には個別の成功例はあるのだろうけど、マクロ的に業界でみると優勝劣敗がはっきりしてくる。少子化とか優秀なエンジニアが足りないという嘆きを聞くと、それはそれでアリって考え方もあるが。人材を浪費してて何足りないとかいってるの？みたいな。
あえて明るい未来を考えると、特にIT化で出遅れている中小企業についてIT投資の価格弾力性が高いと仮定すれば、低コスト化で総需要が拡大して市場規模が拡がるという議論はできなくもない。だからSaaSベンダは中小企業を狙っているし、弥生のMBO価格が700億円くらいまで釣り上がった訳だ。まあ中小企業の財布の紐を緩めるのって大変だし、売り方も導入もサポートも、がらっと考え方を変える必要があるだろうけどね。
けっきょく仕様をつくって実装してテストでバグを潰して云々というソフト屋としての基礎体力で成長市場に参入するって美しい絵だけれども、不特定多数への売り方とか価格設定とか、マーケティング的な別のスキルも要求される訳で、そこって意外と理解されていないか、そこまでは理解したとしたって実践は非常に難しい。それと優先順位。業態が変わると何が大切かが変わってくるのに、その会社の遺伝子みたいなのって一朝一夕には変わらないんだよ。
ありがちな議論として、例えばFNHとか大手SIerとかがリスクを取って大きな投資をして個別SIつくりこみ人月商法を脱却してSaaSへ行くべきだとか論ずる向きもあるけれど、それってやっぱり難しいんじゃないかな。どうしてIBMやDECはMicrosoftとかGoogleとかSalesforceになれなかったんだろうね、とか考えてみると分かる。特にDECはAlta VistaでGoogleより先に検索エンジンをやっていた訳だ。Alta Vistaの失敗要因は色々あるけれども、本質的にはDECはハードウェア企業であり続け、Alta Vistaは巨大 なAlpha Serverのショールームという位置づけだったから、Googleのようにコモディティ・サーバーを並べてコストを下げつつシステム規模を拡大するという経営判断はできなかっただろう。
このところ役所が音頭を取ってFNHにSaaSをやらせようとしているが、DECの轍を踏んでご自慢の冷蔵庫みたいなハイエンドサーバーを使おうとするんじゃないかな。本気でSaaSをやるんだったらコストパフォーマンスの高いコモディティ・ハードウェアの集積でスケーラビリティを高められるようミドルウェアのアーキテクチャから見直す必要があるが、それって手間だしハードウェア事業への投資を自己否定することになる訳で、典型的なイノベーターのジレンマって奴だ。DECは途中で気づいてAlta Vista事業をカーブアウトさせたが時すでに遅しだった。そういう意味でパソコン事業やデバイス事業を売ってコンサル事業を買ってサービスサイエンスとか花火を上げてヒト売りをきっちりブランディングしているIBMは現実的なところで機敏に動いたなぁと感心する。じゃあ小さな日本市場でミニIBMモデルが3つも成り立つかというと疑わしい訳で、あまり発想を日本に限定せずグローバル市場での立ち位置をカッチリ考え直す必要がある。
という訳で新しいことをやるには柵の小さいベンチャーをつくりやすくすべきだし、大企業は非中核事業をとっとと処分してコアコンピタンスをどうマネタイズするかにフォーカスすべき、みたいな方向に議論に流れがちだが、これって堂々巡りだったりする。ベンチャーがなかなか成長できないのも、大企業がなかなか業態転換できないのも、けっきょく冒頭で触れた雇用慣行に原因があるし、今の煮詰まった状況だって大手企業の賢い社員たちが環境に適応した最適解なんだから、腐りかかったバズワードをつまみ食いしたくらいで別の均衡に移行できるなんて考えるのは甘過ぎる。
たぶん二枚腰で時局に立ち向かう必要があって、超長期的には様々な現象と根本原因を腑分けして問題を根から断つのと並行して、今ある様々な制約の中で発想を転換していく必要がある。例えばヒトよりモノ、モノよりコトを売ったほうがスケールする。任天堂のDSとかWiiなんか、ゲーム機を売ってゲームで稼ぐというビジネスモデルは触っていないけれども、Wiiというモノを差別化するのではなく、頭を鍛える、家族の団欒、体を動かす、健康を保つといったコトを売ろうとしているようにみえる。ヒトを売るビジネスは当分続くから、売るなら付加価値をどう高めていくか、人月単価を上げて稼働率を下げ、教育に時間をかけられるようにするとか、新しい取り組みができる工夫が必要だ。
役所もバズワードに踊らされて彌縫策に終始することなく、人材の流動化や自由な技術革新の推進に必要な人材育成やキャリアパスの再構築、雇用法制の見直し、著作権法のフェアユース規定の創設など、国家百年の計といえる骨太な課題に取り組んでいただきたい。ちょっとした税制の手直しでお茶を濁したって何も変わらないのだから。何でもかんでも米国に追随すべきではなく、米国と同じことをやったって勝てないという厳しい認識の中で、日本の強みとか立ち位置を改めて見つめ直し、戦略的に取り組んでいく必要があるのだろう。
って結論らしい結論を書かずにお茶を濁すのも格好悪いのだが、社会構造に起因する派生的な事象を論い、「銀の弾丸」として海の向こうじゃ手垢のついたバズワードを売り込む不毛な議論が多すぎるので「銀の弾丸」となる技術なんてどこにもないぜ、ということだけでも明確にしておきたい。個人的には雇用の流動化が鍵という気もするが、これって雇用法制だけでなく文化とか職業倫理とか企業経営に根ざした話なので、政策的にどこまで手当てできるものなのか正直なところ分からない。ただ、日米のIT産業を比較して、表面的に日本の業界の悪弊にみえてしまう問題の多くは、何らかの形で雇用の流動性と密接に結びついた部分均衡解である場合が多いから、そういった想像力を働かせて目先の議論から一歩引いて物事を捉え直すと、本質からズレたソリューションに惑わされなくなるんじゃないかな。
必ずしも米国並みに雇用を流動化せよと主張する気もなくて、そういった日本の特性を逆手にとって強みに転換する方法だって考え抜けば見つかるかも知れないし。かなり難しいけど。

Here - have a feed
Anyone who knows me well knows that I am a pretty patient person .
I rarely lose my temper and my tolerance level is set quite high from years of educating newcomers to the world of search engine marketing .
Newbies to this industry tend to ask very basic questions and people often ask me if I get frustrated seeing the same questions over and over .
The answer is no .
Every question is a good question , if the answer educates and informs .
If people are asking for advice and are open to feedback , I believe that ’s a very positive thing and I honestly do n’t mind helping people if they are willing to learn .
But what really presses my buttons is ignorance from people who should know better .
Take today for example .
I began receiving emails at the rate of 1 every hour or so from a person I did n’t recognize , at a domain I did n’t recognize , to an email address that I hardly use .
The titles for these emails were always the same : “ A comment has been posted on [ site name ] ” .
The content read :
“ A comment was posted about one of your articles on [ site URL ] .
Article : The Top 10 Dumbest Web Site Decisions
Article URL : [ URL of my article on their site ] Rating : 3 Comment : ”
Turns out that the site is an article directory and the owner republishes various articles from across the Internet .
He had found some of my recent articles on SiteProNews and decided to republish them all in his directory .
So far , so good .
SPN allows webmasters to republish their articles provided the author by - line and resource box are left intact , which they were .
BUT
I could n’t understand why I was being sent multiple emails whenever somebody rated an article or left a comment .
This email exchange I had with him today reveals all :
Dear Joe *
It ’s one thing to republish one of my articles from SiteProNews .
It ’s
quite another to automatically sign me up to receive multiple emails
whenever somebody rates my article or leaves a comment .
I did NOT
sign up to receive these and they are unsolicited so please take me off
your mailing list immediately .
thanks
Kalena
Dear Kalena
You have my sincere apologies for the inconvenience .
However , just for
the record , you are not on my mailing list .
The system automatically
sends you an e-mail whenever someone rates one of your articles .
Be
that as it may , I will make sure that it never happens again .
All the best ,
Joe
Dear Joe
But my point is that I do n’t recall providing my email address in the
first place and I do n’t know how you got it .
I did n’t submit the
article to you either - it has only been circulated via SiteProNews .
Kalena
Kalena
Getting your e-mail address was just a matter of me using some basic
common sense .
I just assumed that it was your first name at your
domain.com .
Many webmasters set up their e-mail accounts that way .
I
happen to use my first and last name .
Also , no you did not submit the article to me .
I got it from Site Pro
News .
The content was not altered in any way , and your copyright info
is included at the end of the article .
If this is a problem for you , I have no problem removing your bio and
all your articles from my website .
I ’m not looking for any trouble .
I ’m only trying to provide my readers
with the best marketing and SEO information possible .
Just say the
word , and I ’ll delete everything as it pertains to you .
Joe
Joe
You are completely missing the point .
Your actions ( as described in your first paragraph below ) have actually broken the law .
I suggest you read http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/canspam.shtm.
I ’ve got no interest in receiving 10 emails a day that I did n’t sign up for .
Make no mistake - that ’s a mailing list , no matter how you try to justify it .
Yes , this is a big problem for me and YES I would like you to remove my bio and articles from your site immediately .
Kalena
I ’m sorry but there is ZERO EXCUSE for someone to sign me up to receive system emails from a web site I ’ve never heard of and give me no way to opt - out , whether they are publishing my content or not .
It ’s even against the law !
Most webmasters know this and I ’m sure he did too .
The fact that he tried to justify it by explaining how easy it was to guess my email address just made my blood boil .
Not to mention his threatening tone about removing my content like he was doing me some type of big favor in the first place .
He probably assumed I ’d think “ Geez , I ’d better keep my mouth shut or I might lose those valuable links from his highly - trafficked site . ”
Well he was wrong .
A short time later , I read Jennifer ’s latest article Be Nice - You Never Know Who That Email is From and I laughed to think that perhaps I ’d missed an opportunity to make a friend in Joe .
Then I had a coffee , got fired up again and realized that I handled the situation exactly right .
Maybe some people will think I overreacted here , but believe me , when you already have to wade through hundreds of emails on a daily basis , you do n’t want to see another 10 unsolicited ones .
If Joe ’s approach had been more professional , perhaps things could have been different .
But he isolated me from the very first contact and lost my trust immediately .
His loss !
* Not his real name
Feb . 5 , 2008  --
The Republican party 's Super Tuesday survey of 21 states could be more a time for soul searching than celebrating for the scrappy , insurgent presidential campaign of Texas Rep. Ron Paul .
Paul defied expectations to make his mark during the campaign with remarkable online fundraising totals and omnipresent supporters .
The question now remains : will the brushfire burn out ?
Paul has insisted repeatedly that he will not mount an independent campaign , remaining in the Republican race until the money ran out , pointing to Super Tuesday as a bellwether .
A Political Omen ?
The blimp supporters inflated in his honor — and floated around the South for over a month — is back on the ground in North Carolina after contributions dried up .
There is also no celebration planned for tonight , just a small dinner for staff in the Washington , D.C. Until yesterday , there was nothing on Paul 's calendar for this most important primary voting day .
He now plans on making an appearance with other Republicans in West Virginia .
The next thing on Paul 's calendar after the Super Tuesday contests is scheduled for Sunday : a rally in his hometown of Lake Jackson , Texas , where Paul is running for reelection to the House of Representatives concurrently with his White House bid .
The campaign manager for Paul 's congressional campaign recently sent a fundraising letter to the Texas congressman 's presidential campaign mailing list .
" Let the Establishment know that the movement will continue , whether in Congress or in the White House , " wrote Mark Elam , in the message to supporters .
A Local Challenge Amid a National Race
Paul 's spokesman , Jesse Benton , said his boss is not too concerned about the Republican challenge for his congressional seat , but he 's not taking any chances either .
And Benton admitted there will be some reevaluating done on Paul 's presidential bid after Super Tuesday .
He described Paul 's quest for the White House as " not entirely quixotic " but called it " a complicated formula " for Paul as to when and how he will exit the race if he becomes sure he cannot do more with his campaign , all the while insisting Paul has no plans to end his campaign .
Small State , Big Splash Strategy
Further proof that Ron Paul 's campaign is different ( if any more were needed ) :
While the others across the candidate pool spent every day this year in and out of the 24 total Super Tuesday states , Ron Paul did not start his retail trips into Super Tuesday states until Jan. 31 .
He had fewer than half the campaign events in all states that Sen. Hillary Clinton had in California .
Having raised more than $ 5 million this quarter , Paul 's campaign is not necessarily over , Benton said .
" The fundraising is there and the support is there to stay in , " he said .
Paul 's Haul
Footprints in the Sand
Paul dominated the foreign policy portions of several GOP forums , notably the ABC News / Facebook - sponsored debate before the New Hampshire primary , and effectively made his anti-military involvement plea to bring the troops home at a debate sponsored by CNN in Los Angeles .
Paul 's popularity among military members in fundraising should give pause to the other Republican candidates , all supporters of the Iraq war .
With the economy nearing a possible recession , even Paul 's economic ideas — his constant warnings about inflation , his complaints about the Fed 's manipulation of the credit markets and the Treasury Department 's manipulation of the dollar — have gotten a second look , even if his solutions to those problems , like doing away with the IRS and returning to the gold standard , seem eternally relegated to the fringe .
Even if plenty of news is out already assuming HD DVD is dead , other sources are pointing us to facts that show the battle is n’t over yet .
After all , you can now get HD DVD players with 7 movies for $ 126 whereas Blu-ray ’s alternatives are , at best , nearly three times as expensive with players starting in the $ 300′s .
Most all coverage , positive or negative , is relying on data from the NPD Group .
Interesting , then , that the NPD Group had to issue a statement addressing how its numbers were being used :
“ As you may have seen , there are attempts being made to portray NPD ’s weekly sales tracking figures for next generation DVD as a trend .
We want to remind you and make clear that it is not accurate to make long term assumptions based on one week of sales — a cautionary point that NPD has made as well .
The facts are that during the week that is being singled out , both Blu-ray disc players and software were being given away for free with the purchase of 1080 p TVs .
It is also important to note that the instant rebate promotions that had previously netted Toshiba ’s players ’
MSRPs to $ 199 and $ 249 had actually ended on Jan. 5th — causing an increase in HD DVD ’s MSRP back to $ 299 and $ 399 during that same week .
Since Toshiba ’s retail price move on Jan. 13th to $ 149 / $ 199 — Toshiba is seeing very positive sales trends at retail .
This reinforces the fact that price is a significant driver of sales .
Toshiba ’s HD DVD players represent a significant value to the consumer and the marketing campaign that just began is proving effective . ”
Also check out the following comment by Paul Ellis on this article :
“ [ Current Amazon pricing ] is what is going to make things really interesting .
With players down to $ 125 ( not just online either ) , that is going to drive a lot of demand for the players .
When I was in Sam ’s club , they had one HD - DVD player and one Blu-ray player ( excluding the PS3 which does n’t even have or accept a remote control ) .
The HD - DVD player was $ 128 , the Blu-ray player was $ 374 .
Keep in mind that HD - DVD still has Warner until May , and most regular people ( i.e. not us … ) ca n’t name which studios put out discs in what format .
If HD - DVD can really push the adoption , some studios may have to switch back to at least being format neutral .
With good name brand HDMI upscaling DVD players selling for ~ $ 99 , I think we ’re going to see a lot of people spend $ 25 - $ 30 more to get HD - DVD capabilities .
Nevermind the fact that for $ 126 on Amazon.com you get the HD - DVD player PLUS SEVEN movies , that is just a really good deal . ”
For 12 years ,
Ann Kinder has sported a two - inch square tattoo on the inside of her left ankle .
Because she regularly wears pants , many of her co-workers are hardly aware of the vibrant design , a peace dove styled in blue , white , green , and orange .
" I have colleagues with tattoos that are more visible , " says Ms. Kinder , a communications associate for a nonprofit education agency in Naperville , Ill .
But no one can miss the nose ring Kinder added two months ago .
" That 's something I decided to be a little bolder about , " she says , noting that several other women in her office have pierced noses .
Body art , once the province of bikers , longshoremen , marines , and punks , is going more mainstream , showing up in white - collar workplaces .
As more young employees – both women and men – opt for ink and piercings , they face decisions about how much decorated skin to bare or not to bare .
In the process , they are also quietly forcing their employers to accept them .
More than one - third of Americans between the ages of 18 and 25 have tattoos , and 40 percent of those between 26 and 40 , according to a Pew Research study .
For those over age 40 , the number drops to 10 percent .
In all , an estimated 30 million to 40 million people have tattoos .
As a further sign of growing popularity , reality shows on television , such as " Miami Ink " and " LA Ink , " promote body art .
Last week 7 - Eleven even launched an energy drink called Inked , targeted to a rapidly growing niche market – young , tattooed Americans .
Fields such as entertainment and technology often permit relaxed dress policies .
" I have clients who work all over the United States and are allowed to expose their tattoos , " says Jamie Yasko - Mangum , a corporate - training consultant for Successful Style & Image in Orlando , Fla .
Other businesses remain conservative .
" There are many professions where tattoos are not allowed to be exposed , " Ms. Yasko - Mangum
says .
These can include law offices , banks , restaurants , pharmaceutical firms , and insurance companies .
In such places , women with butterflies and flowers decorating a shoulder or men with snakes and flame - breathing dragons encircling a forearm must rely on long sleeves to cover their art .
That 's the approach David Kimelberg , general counsel for a venture capital group in Newton , Mass . , takes to keep his tattoos a secret .
" They do tend to be distracting , " he says .
" They 're unique and colorful .
Your attention goes to that if they 're exposed . "
Despite the secrecy , Mr. Kimelberg , who is also a photographer , found a network of heavily tattooed white - collar professionals .
They form the subject of his book , " Inked Inc . "
Sixty percent of those he photographed are women .
After the book 's publication in May , Kimelberg had to reveal himself to his company .
To his relief , reaction was " quite positive , " he says .
" We pitch to start - up companies with pretty young management teams .
[ Tattoos ] create a connection on a personal level .
You 're not seen as this conservative , stodgy group .
They see you as more youthful .
They can connect with that . "
But many other employers and clients fail to make that connection .
Despite the growing popularity of body art , some companies are clamping down .
" At first it was like , ' Oh , OK , ' " says Brooks Savage , CEO of Executive Staffing Group in Raleigh , N.C. " But it has been taken a little too far .
People are starting to tighten policies .
I 'm taking a stronger and stronger stand on it .
I 've had managers speak to employees . "
Some of his criticism is directed to young women whose shirts expose lower - back tattoos when they bend over or reach up .
Susan Potter Norton , an attorney with Allen Norton & Blue in Miami , also finds employers less willing to accept body art .
" I 've had a number of private - sector employers ask if they can require employees to cover up tattoos or decline to hire them , " she says .
The answer in Florida is yes .
Marty Kotis , president of Kotis Properties , a real estate development firm in Greensboro , N.C. , does not have a strict policy against body art .
For employees who do not interact with the public , where a good first impression is important , he takes a laissez - faire approach .
His test is : " If it negatively impacts our business , it 's not a good thing . "
He interviewed one job applicant who wore a large nose ring .
" I found it kind of distracting talking to her , " Mr. Kotis says .
" If a prospective client is sitting there and instead of hearing the pitch about our company is thinking , ' That must have hurt , ' or ' Why would she have that ? ' , that would be a concern . "
Before Kinder had her nose pierced , she checked with the human resources director , who did not object .
Kinder finds that the small ring has had " no negative effect " on her work environment .
But a major fitness club where she holds a second job does not allow nose rings .
She covers it with a band - aid while she works there .
Michelle Clark , creative director for a public - relations firm in Atlanta , keeps her tattoos concealed at work .
" In the summer , I ca n't go sleeveless , " she says .
When she attends business meetings , she hides an infinity symbol on her wrist with a big bracelet .
She also wears just one pair of earrings to work , despite having seven holes in one ear and three in the other .
" I prefer people to remember me for my work and not to be distracted by my tattoos or piercings , " Ms. Clark says .
" A friend insists it is her right to show off everything under the sun .
She has a lot less respect in our business . "
Even so , attitudes are changing , says John Putzier , author of " Weirdos in the Workplace : The New Normal . "
He describes the process as " more of an evolution than a revolution , " adding , " Eventually , what 's avant - garde today is more common tomorrow . "
He defends the right of managers " to regulate , dictate , and prohibit . "
Mr. Putzier expects managers to evolve .
" As baby boomers retire , Gen X and Gen Y will be doing the hiring , " he says .
" The standard of decorum for appearance will change and is changing . "
A shortage of skilled workers will also encourage companies to look beyond externals .
One heavily tattooed professional , Todd Dewett , is an associate professor of management at Wright State University in Dayton , Ohio .
Although the stigma is softening , he says , most people still " stereotype anyone with a lot of ink . "
He adds , " The belief that tattoos will slow you down professionally in some fashion is not irrational . "
Mr. Dewett is the author of a forthcoming book , " Leadership Redefined . "
Yasko - Magnum , the corporate - training consultant , advises those considering a tattoo to reflect on whether their profession will accept it .
" When you are in an office , do not expose your tattoos , because you can lose your credibility .
I hear people say , ' That 's my personal expression . '
But when you 're working for a company , you have to conform . "
She adds that she has seen clients , now in their 30s and 40s , who wish they had never gotten tattoos .
That regret sends some professionals to dermatologists for laser tattoo removal .
In the long run , greater workplace acceptance will depend on whether tattooing is simply a trend or a lasting part of American culture , says Bob Kustka , a human resources consultant in Norwell , Mass .
For now , Clark takes a sanguine approach .
" You have to take into consideration that not everybody likes what you like , " she says .
" You have to have some respect for what makes them comfortable and uncomfortable if you expect them to work with you . "
Teen Desecrates " Sacred " Virgin Mary Window Defect Posted by Pile ( 11793 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
Angry , bored and unable to sleep , Kyle Maskell grabbed his Marksman slingshot and headed out of his foster home to destroy something that might bring him a degree of infamy that rivaled his rage , police said .
He soon looked up into the image of the Virgin Mary , the iridescent figure that had formed on the side of a glass building on U.S. 19 eight years earlier , leased by a religious group , Shepherds of Christ , exploiting throngs of believers , drawing them to Clearwater , Florida .
Maskell reached into the pouch of his slingshot and launched three or four ball bearings , striking the image 's top three panes , police said .
People who showed up hours later found the virgin beheaded .
That 's the story Clearwater police say Maskell , an 18 - year - old Clearwater High School sophomore , told them Monday morning before they arrested him on a charge of felony criminal mischief .
He was being held at the Pinellas County Jail Monday night in lieu of $ 10,000 bail .
Police said the teen cried for three hours while recounting his deed .
The guilt had eaten at him for more than two months .
" He was sorry .
It was n't anything he intended to do , " said Officer Christian Zarra , one of two officers who interviewed Maskell .
" It 's just pretty much that life caught up to him .
He was very apologetic . "
Reactions from those visiting the image Monday were mixed .
Some stressed forgiveness , others punishment and responsibility .
" We 've been praying for whoever did it since the day it happened , " said Rosie Reed , site leader for Shepherds of Christ Ministries , which owns the building .
" We pray for the whole world under Mary 's image .
I 'm going to continue praying for everyone involved . "
But Jose Pombo II , who was there to light a candle Monday , had punishment in mind .
" If he 's 18 , he 's an adult .
For this kid not to know , at the age of 18 , what this represents is inexcusable , " Pombo said .
" I think he should serve a very long time .
It 's desecrating a holy place .
That 's like going to Lourdes in France and desecrating it . "
The vandalism charge is a third - degree felony , which carries a possible sentence of up to five years in prison , but Clearwater police said it seems unlikely Maskell will receive prison time if convicted of vandalizing the virgin image .
" I can not imagine they would send him to prison for this , " Shelor said .
The Shepherds of Christ , meanwhile , will continue to keep vigil at the site .
They have replaced the broken panes with panels of clear glass .
Though the bottom of the Mary figure remains intact , the number of visitors has declined .
Still , they plan to stay put .

" It 's desecrating a holy place . " funny i would reward that instead of punish it ...
i dont see what everyone is up in arms about , its obvious that god wanted the virgin violated , if not i am sure he would have stopped the balls from hitting her in the face .

Looked more like Darth Vader than the virgin mary anyway .

I cannot believe these comments posted .
I cannot understand the human capacity for evil .
Why the non believers persist in viciously attacking the believers .
Why do non believers feel so threatened , ask yourself .

Does one American in a thousand know that the Federal government is buying 23 VIP helicopters , each one of which will cost more than the extravagantly expensive F - 22 fighter aircraft ?
A half - billion dollar helicopter  a half billion dollars each !
 to ferry political hacks to their campaign events ?
If the reader was unaware of that fact , we welcome him to Washington .
The helicopter in question , the VH - 71 , is the government ’s planned replacement for its current allegedly deficient presidential helicopter fleet .
( One might well ask why even an elected monarch like the U.S. president needs twenty - three helicopters .
At most , he might require one helicopter , a backup or two , a couple of training machines , and a pair to act as operational decoys .
Rational math cannot count beyond 6 or 7 , but the president ’s vast retinue of hangers - on , coat holders , and post - pubescent appointees [ the U.S. attorney scandal revealed what a sorry lot of inferior religious seminary graduates they typically are ] is always raptured , so to speak , by the experience of getting VIP treatment several cuts above that experienced by the common herd of U.S. taxpayers on a Carnival cruise .
Thus we are stuck with 23 flying palaces to transport the courtiers of the American emperor . )
The requirement ( " requirement " is a government euphemism for " this is a really neat idea that will help my post - government career with a contractor " ) and go - ahead decision for the VH - 71 were established in 2003 , coincidentally the year the United States invaded Iraq along with its coalition of the willing .
Oddly enough , the procurement authorities decided that a modification of the European EH - 101 helicopter would suit the requirement just fine .
By pure coincidence , this decision would benefit the British firm Westland and the Italian company Augusta .
If any glory accrued to Tony Blair and Silvio Berlusconi , that surely would have been fortuitous .
The idea that the White House paid off these worthies for assisting the administration in the invasion of Iraq has not been proved by transcripts of phone conversations or secret memoranda of understanding that have come to light ; we will leave to the reader the onus of the obvious interpretation of events .
Naturally , Congress got involved , because anything involving aerospace contracts means a rich harvest of PAC checks .
Forthwith , the cry rang out from Capitol Hill that domestic content was needed .
Riding to the rescue was Lockheed Martin , an aerospace megacorporation with no known experience in helicopters since the abortive Cheyenne in the 1960s .
They selflessly volunteered to be prime contractor .
Bell , an outfit that ought to know something about rotorcraft , came in as a junior partner to Lock - Mart .
Together with Augusta and Westland , the consortium marched bravely into the future of politically - guaranteed profits .
Of course , an off - the - shelf EH - 101 , reputedly a reasonably usable rotorcraft , was unsuitable either for the imperial pretentions of the presidency , or the needs of domestic porkbarrelling .
Thus arose the metamorphosis of the EH - 101 into the star - spangled US - 101 , the public - relations prototype that would ultimately become the military type designation VH - 71 .
This helicopter fit for a walking divinity ( and / or his retinue ) required nearly 2,000 requirements changes .
Given the usual incompetence of the government procurement system , the cost increased apace with the change orders .
The Pentagon ’s Selected Acquisition Report ( its most recent edition ) from September 2007 lists the total program cost of VH - 71 at $ 6.5 billion [ pdf ] .
But the latest cost increases and schedule slips suggest that the total program cost may rise to $ 11 billion : nearly $ 500 million per aircraft .
The cost overruns have become so egregious that the program has been frozen pending examination of alternatives .
One may safely assume that , consonant with virtually every U.S. aerospace program ever heard of , the VH - 71 will not be cancelled , but " restructured , " or perhaps stretched out .
Anything but cancelled .
No other " platform , " as the military argot would have it , will quite fill the bill .
No doubt there are many necessarily expensive add - ons to the original EH - 101 required to keep our elected Ozymandias out of harm as he soars above the rabble .
But an unawed American might ask : are n’t there better , cheaper alternatives ?
Let us stipulate that the shooting down of a U.S. president would be a bad thing .
One might ask whether a distinctively appearing , distinctively marked leviathan flying about would create more risk than a standard , common helicopter that could be mistaken for any other rotorcraft in the military or civilian inventory .
The UH - 60 Blackhawk is as common a sight above metropolitan Washington as a Lexus on the Capitol Beltway : it is inconspicuous .
The UH - 60 is also in the current presidential fleet .
But the UH - 60 , or any other helicopter , would inevitably have an Achilles heel if presidential security were the paramount criterion .
Unfortunately for the taxpayer , presidential vanity has long since trumped the need for pure physical survival at least cost .
Hence presidential chariots must be gaudily decorated in the imperial livery of Marine One , making them unnecessarily conspicuous .
Hence the perceived need to equip the new presidential fleet with every conceivable spoofer , jammer , and communications link that sole source IT contractors can push on the VH - 71 program manager .
The army and navy have announced their intention to buy a large quantity of Blackhawks over the next 5 years .
The price would come to around $ 14 million each .
Fourteen million as opposed to half a billion .
Would n’t a UH - 60  as we have said , a rotorcraft already in the current presidential fleet  be far more cost effective than a VH - 71 , as well as safer , particularly if it were painted in inconspicuous colors mimicking a standard military paint scheme ?
One could put every conceivable bell and whistle on a Special Operations UH - 60 , as well as an Aga Khan - level interior , and there is no way it could remotely approach the unit cost of the VH - 71 boondoggle .
The alert reader might object that the Blackhawk is smaller and more cramped than the VH - 71 .
But what is the typical mission of the presidential helicopter fleet ?
Generally , it hauls our anointed thunder god from the White House grounds to Andrews Air Force Base , or to his Berghof in the nearby Catoctin Mountains of Maryland , or , in extremis , to Site R on the Maryland - Pennsylvania border : none of them journeys of much more than half an hour .
If the trip is longer , generally the helicopter portion is just the first , brief leg to the Lucullan comfort of Air Force One.
Surely a Man of the People , as even George W. Bush affects to be ( bred to the bone oligarch though he is ) , could tolerate a cabin no more confining than the interior space of a Bugatti Veyron .
( Priced at a mere € 1.1 million per automobile ( or " platform " ) , the Bugatti is a veritable bargain by U.S. government contracting standards . )
There is more .
The Blackhawk is a thoroughly tested and reliable standard aircraft produced by the thousand , like an airborne Honda Civic .
The VH - 71 , by contrast , will be a kluged - together modification of which only 23 copies will be built .
Given the inevitable vagaries of engineering and testing , guess which helicopter is more likely to experience catastrophic mechanical failure while in flight ?
The VH - 71 is an example of the Potlatch syndrome , the tendency of overweening rulers to be extravagant for the sake of being extravagant .
Potlatch was the practice of certain Indian tribes to demonstrate the wealth and power of their chief by piling up food , trade goods , and the like , and destroying them in a fire .
Such a society , it goes without saying , is doomed .
In less wantonly spectacular ways , many ancient states essentially practiced the same custom .
The American anthropologist Joseph Tainter wrote an intriguing work titled The Collapse of Complex Societies , wherein he posited that as a society matures and becomes more complex , its rulers ( and beneficiaries ) tend to evolve ritual behavior that does not benefit the survival of the society as a whole .
On the contrary , they become so dedicated to defending an ever more ostentatious and extravagant status quo that their behavior actually contributes to the collapse of the society over which they reign .
The Mayan big men exhausted so much of their subjects ’ resources on ceremonial pyramids celebrating the greatness of the big men that the society could not sustain the expense .
Pyramids , after all , cannot provide habitation , or defense .
Peasants toiling on a Latifundia at the borders of the late Roman Empire , should they have been overrun by the " barbarians , " actually found the tribute exacted by the wild barbarian tribes lower than that mulcted by their erstwhile Roman imperial masters .
The sustainment costs of the empire , its sybaritic court , and its hideously expensive military , were simply too high by that point .
When enough peasants caught on , the Roman Empire was doomed , not by military invasion , but by the fact that its subjects no longer believed the whole imperial contraption benefited them .
When will the subjects of the American monarch catch on that projects like the VH - 71 are simply expressions of a superfluous and ruinously expensive ruling class ’s contempt for them ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Astronomers and amateur stargazers have used an unusual technique to find a solar system that closely resembles our own and say it may be a new and more productive way to scour the universe for planets -- and life .
This artist 's rendering of a distant solar system shows two newly discovered planets -- one resembling Jupiter ( middle ) and one resembling Saturn ( middle right ) .
Both planets orbit a star that is about half the size of our sun .
The light from a more distant star ( upper right ) made the discovery possible , as it brightened and dimmed through a phenomenon called gravitational microlensing .
Ohio State University astronomers led an international collaboration that published the discovery in the February 15 issue of the journal Science .

They said technique , called microlensing , shows promise for finding many more stars , perhaps with Earthlike planets orbiting them .
“ We found a solar system that looks like a scaled - down analog of our solar system , ” Scott Gaudi of Ohio State University , who led the study , told reporters .
The new solar system , described in Friday ’s issue of the journal Science , has two planets of similar size and orbit to Jupiter and Saturn .
It is the first time microlensing has been used to find two planets orbiting a single star .
The star is smaller , dimmer and fainter than our sun and the two planets are less massive than Jupiter and Saturn , but orbit at distances similar to the distances that Jupiter and Saturn orbit our own sun .
“ So it looks like a scale model of our solar system , ” Gaudi said .
The planets were detected orbiting a star , called OGLE - 2006 - BLG - 109L , 5,000 light - years away from Earth .
A light - year is the distance light travels in a year , or about 6 trillion miles .
The team of astronomers from 11 countries used a technique called microlensing to spot the planets .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
“ Microlensing works by using the gravity of the star and the planet to bend and focus light rays from a star behind it , ” Gaudi said .
“ If you are looking at one star and another passes in the foreground ( gravity from the front star ) will focus and bend light rays .
That causes the background star to be magnified , ” he added .
LITTLE BUMPS
Any planets orbiting the star cause “ a little bump ” in this magnification effect , Gaudi said .
In this case , the light from the more distant star was magnified 500 times .
Most of the other 250 or so extrasolar planets that have been seen have been detected using radio velocity -- tiny shifts in radiation , including light , that are caused by the Doppler effect .
Most planets detected this way are super - large , super gassy and orbit very close to their suns .
“ Microlensing is more sensitive to these cold , distant planets than the radiovelocity method , ” Gaudi said .
The discovery suggests these planets are common , the researchers said .
“ Is there an Earth there in this system ?
For all we know there could be rocky planets in there but we could n’t find them , ” Gaudi said .
“ This could be a true solar system analog . ”
The 80 - odd members of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment worked frantically night after night during the 11 - day period from late March through early April 2006 when the two stars were close enough to one another , as viewed from Earth , to cause the microlensing effect .
“ We tried to get 24/7 coverage of the event , ” said Andrew Gould , professor of astronomy at Ohio State University .
“ It gets to be dawn in one place and we have to get somebody observing in another place . ”
They included professionals but also two amateurs -- one using a public telescope in Auckland , New Zealand , and Jenny McCormick , whose backyard telescope is listed as Farm Cove Observatory in Auckland , New Zealand , in the report .
“ I work from home in our home - built observatory , ” McCormick told reporters .
“ It is quite useful .
It is very easy to get on collecting data , cooking dinner and ironing clothes . ”
How Many Calories in a Pound
To Travel is to Live
Calories in a Pound - Let 's do Slimming Math !
3,500 calories to create one pound of body weight
It takes .
This applies whether they are food calories coming in , or energy calories going out .
If you eat 3,500 calories more than your body needs , you will put on about 1 pound .
If you expend 3,500 calories more than you eat , you will lose about 1 pound of weight .
So to lose 1 pound of body weight per week , you need to eat 500 calories less per day .
Less than you burn that is !
That might sound a lot , but over a week , it adds up to just 500 calories a day - and that can easily be done by making a few little changes to your diet , being a bit more active , or best of all , doing both .
For example , cutting 500 calories in a day is as simple as swapping a bowl of creamy chicken soup for vegetable soup , topping your jacket potato with cottage cheese rather than Cheddar cheese and doing 50 minutes of housework .
An achievable goal is to dump an average of 1,000 calories per day and you should see a weight loss of around 2 pounds per week .
Losing 2 pounds a week is awesome !
Understanding the ' maths ' is crucial to slimming but it's also essential to set realistic goals .
You need to know exactly how much you want to lose - and you want to be realistic about how long it will take .
If you lose 2 pounds a week it will take you 5 weeks to lose 10 pounds .
That is a sensible rate of weight loss .
And at that rate you stand a good chance of keeping the weight off .
So if your list of resolutions includes goal such wearing a size - 8 dress in the spring when you have 80 pounds to shift , it 's time to cross them out and get real !
To be successful at weight loss you need more than just to calculate your calories , you also need to exercise and you need discipline .
Discipline is the single hardest part about weight control that 's why I start everyone off with the 12 free videos I 've made to help people understand themselves better so that they can get good self control .
These videos are called Magic Hats and you can get yours from this linkcalories in pound .

Moore wants Michigan vote re-do to fix ' Soviet - style election ' Nick Juliano
Published : Friday February 22 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Filmmaker Michael Moore says he and his fellow Michigan voters should have their voices heard as Democrats pick their presidential nominee , but he does not want results of the state 's previous " Soviet - style election " to count .
Michigan and Florida each were stripped of their delegates after they broke Democratic National Committee rules in scheduling their primaries too early .
Hillary Clinton easily " won " each delegate - free state in which candidates agreed not to campaign , and she is now pushing for those states to have their delegates re-seated at the Democrats ' convention this summer .
Moore , who previously lamented the disenfranchisement of his states voters , said he wanted the Democratic party to " fix " the situation , ideally by holding another primary or caucus .
Barack Obama and John Edwards , unlike Clinton , removed their names from Michigan ballots before the state 's Jan. 15 vote .
" There was no election there , " Moore told reporters on a conference call Friday .
" That was a Soviet - style election with one candidate on the ballot . "
The documentary filmmaker , whose most recent project Sicko is up for a Best Documentary Oscar this Sunday , said he hopes his film catalyzes focus on fixing America 's broken healthcare system just like Al Gore 's film An Inconvenient Truth expanded environmental activism .
Moore has not endorsed either Democratic presidential candidate , and he accused Obama and Clinton of getting side - tracked with small - bore debates rather than focusing on what he thinks should be the primary goal : securing universal health coverage for all Americans .
" They 're having silly debates about who 's going to mandate how many people .
We 're not cars , " he said , comparing the candidates ' proposals to laws requiring drivers to hold auto insurance .
" This needs to be treated the same as our Social Security system . "
Also on the call were several patients profiled in Moore 's film who said their problems battling insurance companies to secure needed care have not abated since Sicko was released this summer .
" It 's about the men and women who ran into danger and now are having to trade food ... for medication that we need , " said Reggie Cervantes , a 9/11 New York rescue worker profiled in Moore 's film .
Cervantes and other first responders will appear on Capitol Hill next Tuesday to protest cuts in funding for 9/11 workers ' healthcare .
Moore said healthcare activists should be more focused about electing members of Congress who would support HR 676 a universal healthcare bill .
He said either Obama or Clinton would be more likely that Republican John McCain to sign the bill if Congress could generate the support to pass it .
" We have the money to do it , " Moore said of establishing a national healthcare plan .
" That certainly has been proven with $ 12 billion a month spent on this war . "
Social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook have become a regular part of many people 's daily Internet usage .
Malware authors , who are always on the lookout for new and undefended avenues of attack , have noticed this and increased their attacks on social networking sites accordingly , since many of these sites are vulnerable to these attacks .
According to the latest Symantec Internet Security Threat Report ( PDF ) , a total of 1,501 vulnerabilities — 61 percent of all security weaknesses studied — were found in web - based applications from January 1 to June 30 of this year .
This is , however , a drop from 66 percent in the July to December 2006 period , which may indicate that social networking sites are improving — albeit slowly — their security procedures .
Prior to this decrease , Symantec had reported a rise in the proportion of Web application vulnerabilities , starting in the first half of 2004 and ending in the first half of 2006 .
This period roughly corresponds to the surge in popularity of social networking sites and " Web 2.0 " in general .
The exuberance over these then - new technologies left security considerations little more than an afterthought , not only for web site designers but for their users as well .
Security attacks such as the WMF exploit on MySpace brought the issue to the public attention , and so did third - party security audits such as the Month of MySpace bugs .
Social networking sites are attractive to hackers not only because of potential security holes in the applications themselves , but the fact that the very nature of the site works as a way to spread attacks to more people .
" In such a scenario , the attacker may use the legitimacy of the Web site to attract victims of subsequent attacks , " the Symantec report said .
" Sites with large user bases , such as MySpace , have already been abused in this manner . "
Because the site is known and trusted , users are more likely to fall victim to unsolicited e-mails or invites and be tempted to download unknown attachments .
Once compromised by a trojan , attackers gain access to personal information about the victim , including passwords to other sites , and can easily find other victims to attack via the user 's own friend lists .
The malware problem in general continues to grow .
According to the latest report from security firm PandaLabs , there has been more malware detected in the most recent quarter than was found in all of 2000 - 2004 , putting a strain on traditional key signature methods of malware identification .
The number of virus - laden e-mails and phishing attacks are trending slightly downwards according to the latest data from MessageLabs , but this is more a function of increased targeting of attacks to specific people rather than a decrease in the number of attacks in general — the bad guys have had a busy harvest season collecting e-mail addresses and are trying to reap what they sowed as quickly as possible .
COVID - 19 : Virus Infection or electromagnetic overload ?

8 Ways to Find IT Talent for an Undesirable Location
Last month I did some work for a company that has manufacturing plants in a number of rural locations .
The IT managers who work in those locations complained about how difficult it is to hire IT people , partly because of the locations and partly because of the image of manufacturing being a dirty industry .
Here are some ideas that may help .
Idea 1 : Rethink the type of person you hire
There ’s a general rule for hiring customer service people that you look for someone who can relate well to the public , and then you train the person in the area of expertise for which they ’ll do customer support .
This is because it ’s much harder to do the reverse : hire someone with the expertise and then teach them to relate to the public .
Consider a similar approach when you ’re hiring for an isolated or rural area .
Find the kind of person who will want to live in that area and who is motivated to stay .
Look for certain aptitudes which make the person trainable in the area of expertise you need , and then invest in training the person to suit your needs .
When you define your candidate requirements this way , you might even discover that the ideal candidate is already in the area or even working in your company .
Idea 2 : Think in terms of a career path – not just a job
Few people want to do the same thing every day for the rest of their lives .
Most want to continue to learn and grow , and in many cases to attain positions of increasing responsibility .
When you look at your people needs , think of how a person will grow and advance in each position .
Try to define a progression of jobs , starting with an entry - level position and advancing to high - level , higher - paid positions .
The entire progression may not reside in the IT organization – maybe you start the progression with part - time participation from a factory worker , or maybe the higher - end of the progression leads to supervisory positions in non-IT departments .
But once the progression is defined – maybe with variations due to the interests of the individuals in the positions – you can sell the progression to prospective job candidates instead of just selling the job .
This approach makes it much easier to hire people .
They ’ll feel comfortable that they ’re not moving into a dead - end job , and they ’re likely to stay with your company for many years .
Idea 3 : Rotate people through an undesirable location as part of their career path
Look at the bigger picture .
If you really can’t find someone to work permanently in an undesirable location , then make a temporary assignment at the location be part of a career path – maybe for a year or two .
There ’s probably some great experience to be obtained by working there temporarily .
And who knows ?
Some of them may decide they want to stay .
Idea 4 : Start an intern program to attract candidates while they ’re still in school
Team up with local schools – colleges , vocational technical school , or even high schools – to attract candidates early .
The schools are happy to help advertise intern positions and in most cases they ’ll even help you select the most appropriate candidates .
It ’s a win - win for both you and the candidate : they get a way to help pay for their education , and you get a part - time or seasonal person who you can groom for a future full - time position .
Idea 5 : Make your company a better place to work
Of course no one wants to stay in a company that treats its employees poorly , has terrible working conditions , and in general shows that it does n’t value its employees .
If this sounds like your company then you ’ve got an up - hill battle to fight ( and frankly I wonder why you ’re still working there yourself ) .
Employee surveys in all industries have shown that salary is not at the top of most people ’s list of the most important things about their job .
Instead , the most important thing is usually a feeling that the employees are contributing to something bigger , and that the employees are respected and valued for being themselves .
Make sure that you and your organization are making your company a place where employees will want to work .
Idea 6 : Use part - time or shared resource
Do n’t assume that every one of your needs has to be fulfilled by a full - time person in your IT department .
If you have a part - time need then see if there ’s someone in a non-IT job who might be able to do the work .
Or maybe you could go in with someone else in your company who has a part - time need , and find a person who can work a full - time job made up of part - time work for each of you .
If part - time resource with the right skills and aptitudes is n’t available inside your company then look outside .
Are there other non-competitive businesses in your area that might have a similar part - time need ?
If so , then see if you can find someone who is willing to do part - time work for each of the businesses .
You could think of this as outsourcing , but on a lower budget .
Idea 7 : Outsource
Full - blown outsourcing is also a possibility .
Find well - defined tasks that do n’t have to be done locally ; payroll and web site maintenance are two examples .
Outsource these tasks to companies or individuals who work outside the area , and deal with them primarily by telephone and email .
Or if your company has IT people in other locations , then consider outsourcing some of the work to people in those other locations .
Idea 8 : Use standard products and technologies
I ’ve seen companies that build proprietary systems around older or seldom - used technology ( like the PICK operating system or dBase ) and then wonder why they ca n’t attract people to work on them .
You ’re much better off using standard off - the - shelf software whenever possible and then building any proprietary software using currently popular products .
There will be more people available who know the technology , you ’ll find it much easier to obtain training for new people , and outsourcing will be much easier if you decide to go in that direction .
Similarly , it ’s important to use good software design principles when building your software .
For example , a layered approach which separates presentation , business logic and database will make it much easier to modify or adapt software for future needs , and it will be easier for multiple people ( even in different locations ) to work on the software without stepping on each others ’ toes .
Conclusion
Companies in rural or undesirable locations have a slightly different kind of problem from those of us who live in metropolitan areas , but that does n’t mean that IT needs must go unfulfilled .
There are plenty of people in rural areas and quite a few people in urban areas who would love to move to a location with a different lifestyle and possibly a better quality of life .
The secret to recruiting for an undesirable area is to figure out what type of person would enjoy living there , and then try to find such a person who has the aptitude to do the job with some training .
But that ’s not all : you have to make the job attractive as a good career move so that people will want to stay .
Even with this approach , you have to be realistic about what needs to be done locally and what can be done elsewhere instead .
The Internet and long - distance computing have made it possible to do IT work remotely that until recently would require an onsite presence .
The best approach to providing IT support for an undesirable location is a combination of tactics : reduce the job to the essentials , use standard technology , and find good people who actually enjoy working there .
After all , what ’s undesirable to you may be extremely attractive to someone else .
Conclusion
Getting a competitive quote for Car insurance can be a lengthy process at the best of times , and adding driving convictions into the mix just raises the insurance premiums , thus extending an already lengthy procedure .
This is why , as someone with driving convictions looking for Car insurance , you should seriously consider taking out a Convicted Driving insurance policy .
For some convicted drivers , and those who do n’t want to pay thousands of pounds for cover , it could be the only way of getting back on the road .
Once you decide that you do want to get a Convicted Driver insurance policy , then your next step to take is to find a reputable , specialist insurance company that offers insurance premiums that suit your budget .
Updated :
The UK ID card project suffered another serious blow today with news that two potential suppliers have pulled out of the procurement process .
Accenture and BAE Systems have both decided not to chase contracts for the controversial scheme .
A short list of possible suppliers is due to be published in the next few months but several firms have expressed discontent with continued government indecision .
This blog post might just explain Accenture and BAE 's early withdrawal .
Accenture , one of the government 's central IT suppliers , told the FT it was pulling out for a mixture of " political and commercial reasons " .
A BAE spokesman told El Reg : " We have withdrawn but it 's for commercial reasons - at this stage our assessment is that our bid would n't deliver everything the project requires .
We will continue to monitor the project with interest . "
Leaked documents yesterday revealed that ID cards are unlikely to be issued to British citizens until 2012 - two years later than originally planned .
The project is also suffering from the government 's seeming inability to go more than two days without losing a large amount of private data .
The Home Office claims six companies are still keen - Fujitsu Services , CSC , EDS , IBM , Steria and Thales on bidding .
A final list of five suppliers will be released by May .
Documents leaked yesterday reveal the Home Office will target teenagers for early take - up of the cards .
Anyone wanting to open a bank account , apply for student funding or buy alcohol or cigarettes will be forced to buy an ID card .
An Accenture spokeswoman told us : " The Home Office / IPS is in the process of pulling together a list of companies that will then be eligible to bid for future work packages , which together will deliver the National Identity Scheme .
On this occasion , we have decided not to seek to be selected for this ‘ framework ’ .
However , we remain committed to our work in UK government .
We are working in 6 major government departments delivering a number of successful and key programmes , including DWP CIS – a key building block for NIS – as well as NHS PACS and the eBorders programme at the Home Office . "
There 's more from the FT here . ®
Senator : US provides haven to war criminals from abroad RAW STORY
Published : Thursday November 15 , 2007

This " More than 1,000 people from 85 countries who are accused of such crimes as rape , killings , torture and genocide are living in the United States , according to Department of Homeland Security figures , " McClatchy 's Renee Schoof begins in an article today .
" America has become a haven for the world 's war criminals because it lacks the laws needed to prosecute them , Sen. Richard Durbin , D - Ill. , said Wednesday .
There 's been only one U.S. indictment of someone suspected of a serious human - rights abuse .
Durbin said torture was the only serious human - rights violation that was a crime under American law when committed outside the United States by a non-American national . "
" Romagoza told Durbin that he was given electric shocks until he lost consciousness , then kicked and burned with cigarettes until he came to .
He also told of being sodomized , nearly asphyxiated in a hood containing calcium oxide  which can cause severe shortness of breath when inhaled  and subjected to waterboarding , including being hung by his feet with his head immersed in water until he nearly drowned .
" Romagoza and two other torture victims brought a civil suit in U.S. federal court in West Palm Beach , Fla. , against two Salvadoran generals who moved to Florida in 1989 : Jose Guillermo Garcia , who was the minister of defense , and Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova , who was the director general of the Salvadoran National Guard . "
Durbin 's full speech follows .
The full McClatchy story is here .
Opening Statement of Senator Dick Durbin Chairman , Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law Hearing on  No Safe Haven : Accountability for Human Rights Violators in the United States  November 14 , 2007 Welcome to  No Safe Haven : Accountability for Human Rights Violators in the United States ,  the fifth hearing of the Judiciary Committees recently - created Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law .
Unfortunately , our ranking member , Senator Coburn , is not able to be here today .
But I know he feels as strongly as I do about the issue we will discuss today , and about the mission of this subcommittee .
After a few opening remarks , we will turn to our witnesses .
First , an update on the activities of this subcommittee .
This is the first time in Senate history that there has been a subcommittee focused on human rights .
This year , we held the first Congressional hearings on the law of genocide and child soldiers .
We also have held hearings on human trafficking and the impact of the so - called material support bar on the victims of serious human rights abuses .
I have been joined by Senator Coburn in proposing legislation to hold accountable perpetrators who have committed genocide , human trafficking and the use or recruitment of child soldiers .
The Genocide Accountability
Act passed the Senate unanimously and , after being reported last week by the House Judiciary Committee , is awaiting action on the House floor .
The Trafficking in Persons Accountability Act and the Child Soldiers Accountability Act have both been reported unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee .
I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact these proposals into law as soon as possible .
Today , another first .
This is the first - ever Congressional hearing on the enforcement of human rights laws in the United States .
Accountability for Human Rights Abusers in the United States
The end of the last century was marked by horrific human rights abuses in places such as Bosnia and Rwanda .
The early years of this century have seen ongoing atrocities being committed in , among other places , Darfur and Burma .
While a growing number of perpetrators of human rights abuses have been held accountable in international , hybrid and state tribunals , a much larger number of perpetrators have escaped accountability for their crimes .
Some of these human rights violators have fled to the United States .
In the Subcommittees last hearing , we discussed how our immigration laws prevent some victims of human rights abuses from finding refuge in the United States .
It is a tragic irony that , at the same time as we turn away these deserving refugees , war criminals have found sanctuary in our midst .
How we as a country treat suspected perpetrators of serious human rights abuses in the United States sends an important message to the world about our commitment to human rights and the rule of law .
As the late Simon Wiesenthal , the worlds leading Nazi hunter , often said , the appropriate response to human rights violations is justice , not vengeance .
Now I would like to show a brief graphic video we created for this hearing to provide some context for our discussion .
[ SHOW VIDEO ]
Our country has a long and proud tradition of providing refuge to victims of persecution .
These victims hope to leave behind the terrible abuses they have suffered in their countries of origin and begin a new life in the United States .
They should not have to come across those who tortured them , as Edgegayehu Taye did at the hotel in Atlanta , Georgia where she worked as a waitress .
One day , she walked out of an elevator and saw Kelbessa Negewo , the man who had supervised her torture in Ethiopia , who was working as a bellhop at the same hotel .
These victims should not have to fear retaliation or the threat of retaliation for speaking out against those who persecuted them , as one of our witnesses today , Dr. Juan Romagoza Arce , and many like him , have experienced .
I want to commend the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security for their efforts to hold accountable human rights violators who have found safe haven in our country .
But more must be done .
During todays hearing , we will explore what the U.S. government is doing and what more it could do to identify , investigate and prosecute suspected perpetrators of serious human rights abuses or deport them to be held accountable in an adequate forum .
We will also explore what the U.S. government is doing to prevent such perpetrators from entering the United States in the first place .
To my knowledge , there has only been one indictment in the United States of a suspected perpetrator for committing a serious human rights abuse .
This is unacceptable .
We must ask ourselves why .
Why do so many suspected human rights abusers find a safe haven in the United States ?
Is the government doing enough with its existing authority ?
Are new laws granting the government greater authority and jurisdiction necessary ?
Torture is the only serious human rights violation that is a crime under U.S. law if committed outside the United States by a non-U.S. national .
Thats why Senator Coburn and I have introduced legislation that would give the government authority to prosecute individuals found in the United States who have participated in genocide , human trafficking and the use or recruitment of child soldiers anywhere in the world .
I hope that this hearing will shed light on whether additional loopholes in the law hinder effective human rights enforcement .
The United States has a proud tradition of leadership in the promotion of human rights and the world watches our steps in this field closely .
By holding perpetrators of serious human rights abusers found in the United States accountable , we will demonstrate our commitment to upholding the human rights principles we have long advocated and discourage human rights violators from fleeing to the United States .
I found a Federal Reserve article that analyzed the change in Average Hourly Earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers .
After adjusting for inflation using the Personal consumption expenditures ( PCE ) {instead of the Consumer Price Index - Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers ( CPI - W ) } and including an estimate for worker 's benefits , the author concluded that workers ' hourly earnings ( wages plus benefits ) actually increased by 16 % over 30 years ( 1975 - 2005 ) rather than decreased .
Here , I graphed the full history , 1964 - 2006 , but used the approach laid out in the article to show the effect of inflation and benefits .
BTW , if you earned $ 16.76 an hour in 2006 that gave you an annual income of $ 33,520 ( assuming you worked full - time ) .

Addendum :
This was passed on to me from a reader who found it on Marginal Revolution
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ridiculed President Bush yesterday for saying in his State of the Union speech Monday night that the United States is winning the war in Iraq .
The California Democrat also expressed doubts that political reconciliation in the war - torn country had been advanced by laws to share oil wealth among the country ’s sectarian groups and to allow members of deposed dictator Saddam Hussein ’s Ba’ath Party to return to government jobs .
“ The president ’s comments last night in his speech were yet again another example of the lack of reality that he brings to this discussion , ” Mrs. Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill .
“ For a president of the United States to come before the Congress nearly five years after this war [ began ] and deem it a success is just hard to understand . ”
In the speech , Mr. Bush said , “ Our enemies in Iraq have been hit hard .
They are not yet defeated , and we can still expect tough fighting ahead . ”
The president said U.S. troops would build on the gains made last year and transition this year to the next phase of the strategy .
He said troops would return home — “ return on success ” — as the Iraqi military assumes a greater role .
The speaker said she saluted U.S. troops and acknowledged that the surge strategy implemented last year dramatically reduced violence in Iraq .
But she said the surge did not provide “ a zone of calm and security ” for the Iraqi government to forge political reconciliation .
“ And again , I ’ll say what [ General David H. Petraeus ] said .
The biggest obstacle to reconciliation in Iraq is not the Sunni insurgents .
It ’s not the Iranian militants .
It ’s not the al Qaeda terrorists .
It is the government of Iraq , ” she said .
“ Our troops have made an enormous sacrifice .
They deserve better than the actions taken by the Iraqi government . ”
Asked whether laws enacted to share oil and normalize the Ba’ath Party showed progress from the Iraqi government , Mrs. Pelosi replied , “ No . No , no , no . ”
The Democrat - led Congress last year repeatedly attempted and failed to force a U.S. pullout from Iraq , including attaching war spending to troop - withdrawal timetables , but always stopping short of cutting off the money .
The Democrats twice backed down from standoffs with the White House over war spending and conceded to Mr. Bush ’s demands for funds with no strings attached rather than face criticism for not supporting troops in the field .

I fell in love with Emacs because of Planner and Remember .
I got hooked .
By that , I mean that I discovered the joys of modifying the behavior of other people ’s code through hooks .
Well - written Emacs code has plenty of entry points so that you can change things without rewriting everything , and both Planner and Remember were well - written .
The flexibility that John Wiegley had built into Planner and Remember ( in his spare time ! ) convinced me that I absolutely needed to learn Emacs Lisp .
I e-mailed John , singing high praises about Planner and volunteering to help track down any bug reports so that I could learn in the process of helping others .
What did he do ?
He made me the maintainer for Planner , the go - to person , the buck - stops - here person .
Was I terrified ?
My first time being in charge of an open source project , a language that I had just begun to learn , and schoolwork to do on top of all of that …
Of course I was scared .
I found a way to make working on Planner part of my final - year project ( might as well get academic credit for hacking on it ! ) , made the Emacs Lisp Intro and the Emacs Lisp manuals my weekend , bedtime , and mealtime reading .
Back then , Planner.el was one file , which made it a little less intimidating .
At first , I found it hard to think of a way to improve Planner , which was already a great way to track my tasks .
Remember was also a good way to jot down short notes that were automatically added to my Planner day page .
Both Planner and Remember had some support for picking up hyperlinks to whatever I was looking at when I created the task or note .
What was missing ?
Timestamps so that I could tell when I wrote a note ; more link support so that I could automatically link to a file or a mail message or a contact record ; private , perhaps even encrypted segments ; copying a note to another page ; publishing a blog as RSS …
For the next few years , I worked with incredible people who had thought
long and hard about how they managed their tasks and their notes , and
who taught me how they did things through their feature requests and
their code .
I became more comfortable in Emacs Lisp than in any other computer language I knew ( eventually maintaining Remember as well ) , I had formed a thriving community of about 200 people around the world who also contributed ideas and code , and I was hooked .
Because I could change so much about Emacs , I had so much fun
coming up with creative applications .
When a friend and I
were studying Japanese , she wanted to know if I could set up Emacs with
flashcards and example sentences so that we could learn words in
context .
I knew that Jim Breen had a huge database of example Japanese
sentences with their English translations and that this was freely
available on the Net . I downloaded the database and –one crazy idea
fueled by another in that natural sugar high that can happen when two
geeks start brainstorming –I made our learning fun by
extracting all the cat - and kitten - related sentences .
This is how I
learned about such wonderfully onomatopeic words as “ fuwafuwashita ” ,
which means “ fluffy ” .
We both adored cute little kitties , and reading
example sentences about these furballs would make our studies
delightful .
Now , where could we put these sentences so that we ’d run
into them often ?
Aha !
Remember !
Every time we wrote a blog post or
needed a scratch pad to store some information , we would be rewarded by a
short sentence in Japanese about cute little kittens , and we could look
up the meaning and pronunciation with custom keyboard shortcuts .
And
hey , it worked for me –I found myself writing because I wanted to see
what sentence would come up , and I found myself learning because I’d
run into all these cool words .
For variety , I switched to sentences
about computers and other topics that I wanted to be able to discuss .
Try getting your blog editor or note manager to reward you each time you share a story or write down a tidbit of information .
There is incredible power in customizing your note - taking system to just the way you think , and when you combine that with the delight of a surprise , you have something that is difficult to do with any other system–paper - based or electronic , text - based or graphical , commercial or free .
I turned the projects over to other maintainers when I started with graduate school , but as you can see , I still love working with Emacs .
My mind does this little somersault of joy when I pull off a particularly nifty tweak or when I run across a beautiful piece of code .
And yes , one of the reasons why I ’m writing this book about Emacs is because I ’d love to have an opportunity to explore all the nooks and crevices of this piece of software–well , not all , because by the time the book hits press , people will have added even more .
In this chapter on notetaking , I hope to be able to show you the mechanics of note - taking in Emacs–but more than that , I hope to show the sheer joy of having a system that you can play with , of not just filing notes in a database but M-x remember - ing in a system that will make you smile or laugh , of shaping and reshaping things until they fit you like clay fits your hand .
Come and have fun .

A new crisis is emerging , a global food catastrophe that will reach further and be more crippling than anything the world has ever seen .
The credit crunch and the reverberations of soaring oil prices around the world will pale in comparison to what is about to transpire , Donald Coxe , global portfolio strategist at BMO Financial Group said at the Empire Club ’s 14th annual investment outlook in Toronto on Thursday .
“ It ’s not a matter of if , but when , ” he warned investors .
“ It ’s going to hit this year hard . ”
Mr. Coxe said the sharp rise in raw food prices in the past year will intensify in the next few years amid increased demand for meat and dairy products from the growing middle classes of countries such as China and India as well as heavy demand from the biofuels industry .
“ The greatest challenge to the world is not US $ 100 oil ; it ’s getting enough food so that the new middle class can eat the way our middle class does , and that means we ’ve got to expand food output dramatically , ” he said .
The impact of tighter food supply is already evident in raw food prices , which have risen 22 % in the past year .
Mr. Coxe said in an interview that this surge would begin to show in the prices of consumer foods in the next six months .
Consumers already paid 6.5 % more for food in the past year .
Wheat prices alone have risen 92 % in the past year , and yesterday closed at US $ 9.45 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade .
At the centre of the imminent food catastrophe is corn — the main staple of the ethanol industry .
The price of corn has risen about 44 % over the past 15 months , closing at US $ 4.66 a bushel on the CBOT yesterday — its best finish since June 1996 .
This not only impacts the price of food products made using grains , but also the price of meat , with feed prices for livestock also increasing .
“ You ’re going to have real problems in countries that are food short , because we ’re already getting embargoes on food exports from countries , who were trying desperately to sell their stuff before , but now they ’re embargoing exports , ” he said , citing Russia and India as examples .
“ Those who have food are going to have a big edge . ”
With 54 % of the world ’s corn supply grown in America ’s mid-west , the U.S. is one of those countries with an edge .
But Mr. Coxe warned U.S. corn exports were in danger of seizing up in about three years if the country continues to subsidize ethanol production .
Biofuels are expected to eat up about a third of America ’s grain harvest in 2007 .
The amount of U.S. grain currently stored for following seasons was the lowest on record , relative to consumption , he said .
“ You should be there for it fully - hedged by having access to those stocks that benefit from rising food prices . ”
He said there are about two dozen stocks in the world that are going to redefine the world ’s food supplies , and “ those stocks will have a precious value as we move forward . ”
Mr. Coxe said crop yields around the world need to increase to something close to what is achieved in the state of Illinois , which produces over 200 corn bushes an acre compared with an average 30 bushes an acre in the rest of the world .
“ That will be done with more fertilizer , with genetically modified seeds , and with advanced machinery and technology , ” he said .
" Actually , " the lead on Chris G's team said defensively , " this is a quite elegant solution for displaying data in a JSP .
This way , we do n't have to use the real object and can save memory . "

Security through obscurity is something we 've all probably complained about .
We 've covered security by insanity and security by oblivity .
And today , joining their ranks , we have security by letterhead .
John O'Rourke wrote in to tell us that as a part of his job , he often has to help clients transfer domain names .
He 's had to jump through all kinds of crazy hoops to transfer domain names in the past ; including just about everything except literally jumping through hoops .
After faxing in a transfer request and receiving a rejection fax an hour later , he knew he was in for a fight .
John called the number on the rejection letter to sort things out .
John :
Yes , I 'm calling to find out why request number 48931258 to transfer somedomain.com was rejected .
ISP : Oh , it was rejected because the request was n't submitted on company letterhead .
John : Oh ... sure ... but ... uh , just so we 're on the same page , can you define exactly what you mean by ' company letterhead ? '
ISP : Well , you know , it has the company 's logo , maybe a phone number and web site address ... that sort of thing .
I mean , your fax looks like it could 've been typed by anyone !
John :
So you know what my company letterhead looks like ?
ISP : Ye ... no .
Not specifically .
But , like , we 'd know it if we saw it .
John :
And what if we do n't have letterhead ?
What if we 're a startup ?
What if we 're redesigning our logo ?
ISP : Well , you 'd have to speak to customer -
John ( clicking and typing ) : I could probably just pick out a semi- professional - looking MS Word template and paste my request in that and resubmit it , right ?
ISP : Look , our policy -
John :
Oh , it 's ok , I just sent the request back in on letterhead .
The transfer was approved .
John smiled , having successfully circumvented the ISP 's security armed with sophisticated hacking tools like MS Word templates and a crappy LaserJet printer .
When I asked Marc Espie ( espie@ ) for a summary of the work he did at p2k7 for my writeup , he said " make -j , but it deserves an article of its own . "
So , here it is .
Marc sent the email below to misc@ which summarizes how he got started working on make ( 1 ) , how that changed from maintenance to major improvement mode and how he was able to make `make - j ' usable .
From the email :
Marc 's full email is below .
This was really shortly mentioned on undeadly , because it probably deserves a separate announcement and article .
First , I want to really thank robert@ again for the organization , and putting up with rude OpenBSD french developers as he has ... plus the people who donated enough to make these kind of events possible .
Also , my laptop died 3 weeks before the hackathon , and I got a new one , thanks to project money .
It 's not really the most expensive laptop you 've ever seen , but it has a dual - core ...
Now for some background .
I 've been maintaining OpenBSD 's make for a long time ( over 8 years , I think ) .
It started as simple bug - fixes , then speed - ups , then more radical clean - ups .
About one year ago , I had a kind of epiphany ( yeah , I 'm a fan of Angel ) : I realized that this code is really atrocious , and instead of fixing bugs , I started replacing big chunks of it .
Not to disparage the guy who wrote pmake in the first place , as he had very different constraints and goals , but it is painfully obvious this is a half - finished research project , and not an industry - standard POSIX make .
So , I started cutting stuff that no - one uses , and options that simply do n't work , to try to make sense of the beast .
And I changed algorithms .
Most specifically , I streamlined the suffix handling , and I killed all the remote job handling .
To make sense of make , you 've got to realize there are basically two beasts folded into one : make in `compat ' mode uses its own engine to figure out which targets to compute first , and its own job runner .
The engine is rather simple , since it does n't have to queue things up , and can just run commands .
The parallel engine is a bit more complex , since it tries to explore more of the tree to start up several jobs at once .
It also has an interesting idea : it tries to create shell scripts that agregate commands to minimize the number of processes created .
Unfortunately , THIS is a bad idea , in modern times , since POSIX mandates separate commands must be run by separate jobs .
As a result , things that work with standard sequential make no longer run with parallel make .
A few months ago , I started designing a way to overcome those issues .
Mostly , I wanted to get rid of the shell script creation in the parallel make case .
I realized I could have a ` tail - call optimization ' : if I fork ( ) a job to compute a target , and then fork / exec each command separately , I would not need to fork ( ) the last command , thus optimizing the really common case that uses one command per target .
Enter p2k7 , with a tall goal : try to make make -j usable .
This was an ideal setting : I had a week mostly empty of other contingencies , and a few people motivated to give me feedback .
So I started merging the engines , and killing old make code ( all the stuff that was building shell scripts ) .
Pretty soon , I ran into debug issues : the output was really mangled , and unusable .
make -j uses pipes to separate the outputs from various jobs , and tries to print stuff line by line .
I realized it was keeping a lot of fds open !
whereas it should close about half of them ( this explained why cnst@ had run into the allocation bug that fast ... make was gobbling file descriptors like candy ) , and I also realized I could make things better by using non-blocking fds and applying a greedy approach : try to get as many complete lines / buffers from one fd before getting to the rest .
The result was immensely satisfying : instead of having chunks of intermixed outputs , suddenly , very long linking lines were appearing as one single line ( since make 's internal buffers are much smaller than a full pipe kernel buffer , this means that , in most case , all the job output was already there ) .
The devil lies in the details , as usual .
On tuesday , my src/ build was stopping in make clean , in the middle of gnu / binutils .
And my error messages were worth shit : make was basically telling : `oh , btw , there was an error in one job .
Here , figure out what 's going on ' .
So I revamped the error messages on wednesday morning , and started polishing other stuff , like duplicating pipes so that stdout and stderr do not get mixed up .
I finally figured out what was going on : turns out make clean was running stuff like :
distclean : -rm somefile
After that , I ran into quite a few more issues in src .
Let 's say that it 's not yet ready for parallel build .
Together with miod@ ( who was playing with make remotely ) , we fixed a few of them ... let 's just say that what remains is the hard ones ... it will probably take a while to fix them .
robert@ has also been fairly helpful .
It 's stunning to see a quad - amd64 compile its whole kernel in 10 seconds ...
( I also think I gave miod a lot of things to pull his hairs ... make -j is quite a nice stress - tester for the SMP systems he 's playing with , and he 's seen his share of panics in pipes with the new code ... )
I had some pleasant surprises in xenocara and ports .
xenocara is actually mostly ready for make -j .
The fixes should happen soon .
And more ports than I expected are actually happy with make -j .
In some cases , this is quite a speed improvement , and I can truely run at twice the speed .
In other cases , this is not worth anything .
For instance , KDE3 wo n't compile faster .
And yes , that 's one of the reasons why they 're abandoning automake for KDE4 , recursive makes + enable - final do n't benefit from parallel - core compiles .
So now , I 'm back in Paris ( which was quite an adventure , thanks to the Air France airline strike ) , and a week later , and a big chunk of make -j work has been committed .
There are still minor fixes floating around , there 's still at least one biggie to fix , so no , all your makefiles are not safe yet ( and art@ made me realize I also need a way to control the global number of jobs in parallel make if I do n't want to turn make into a fork ( ) bomb ) .
[ okay , I know you will want to play with make -j , if you have a dual - core or quad - proc .
It 's such a fun toy ... do n't be too disappointed when things still do n't build , and be very , very careful with things that * appear * to build correctly , but still crash . ]
But there 's hope .
It is quite likely * a lot* of stuff will compile with make -j in OpenBSD 4.3 .
Again , thank you for your donations that made my new laptop and p2k7 possible .
It really * does * make a difference ( like , 3 or 4 months of extra delay if I did n't have all the extra incentive to make this work ) .
Desktop Linux on the rise , Linux Foundation reports Nov. 21 , 2007
Analysis --
What do Linux users want from their desktop ?
The Linux Foundation 's survey has the answers .
Spread the word :
digg this story
While the LF 's third annual desktop Linux survey does n't officially end until November 30th , the number of daily respondents have shrunk to a trickle and the Foundation is working on analyzing the results .
This is an early look at the raw data .
For starters , almost 20,000 self - selected users filled out this year 's survey compared to fewer than 10,000 in 2006 's survey .
The survey , which drew primarily from European users ( 51.5 percent ) followed by North Americans ( 35.8 percent ) , found that the vast majority of Linux desktops ( 68.4 percent ) are deployed in SOHOs ( small office / home office ) and small business settings having one to a hundred PCs running Linux .
Medium - sized businesses with user bases of 101 to 500 ( 9.7 percent ) and 1,001 to 5,000 ( 6.2 percent ) Linux desktops came next .
In those businesses and organizations that have deployed Linux desktops , 39.5 percent are running Linux on more than half of their machines .
Even in Linux - oriented groups , Windows remains the single most popular desktop system , with 59.6 percent running on half or more of their desktops .
Still , this survey helps support the recent Forrester study , which found that Linux is becoming a credible threat to Windows on the desktop .
Indeed , another recent desktop operating system survey , by KACE , a systems management appliance company , found that more Windows users are considering migrating to Mac OS and / or Linux ( 44 percent ) than to Vista ( 13 percent ) .
Another interesting result from the LF survey is that in most company and organizations , the Linux desktop is more commonly used than Linux servers .
From almost the beginning of Linux 's business acceptance it has always been assumed that Linux was , is , and would continue to be more of a force on servers than on desktops .
That appears to be changing .
A related surprise is that Linux desktops are no longer primarily used by developers or engineers .
The survey found that 64 percent of Linux desktops are being used as client desktops .
That is to say they 're being used as replacements for ordinary Windows desktops rather than for high - end workstations .
Many companies and groups ( 51.4 percent ) are , of course , also using Linux as a developer 's desktop .
These Linux desktop deployments are , for the most part ( 62.2 percent ) , real office deployments .
Only a minority are deploying Linux in pilot tests .
Only 16.3 percent say they will not be using Linux on their desktops .
Since this is an open survey for users who are interested in the Linux desktop , I suspect that this particular result indicates Windows users trying to twist the survey 's results .
As a survey of Linux desktop users , which deliberately tried to attract such users , the survey 's bias is clearly toward the Linux desktop .
Thus , the number of users who claim not to be using Linux should be taken with a grain of salt .
This conclusion is also supported by another survey question : " Do you have enough confidence in Linux today to use it for mission - critical applications ? "
There , the answer was 74.3 percent absolutely had that much trust in Linux , with 18.3 percent saying that they probably trusted Linux enough for mission critical use .
Preferred distributions
So what desktop Linux are people using in their organizations ?
The answer , which comes as no great surprise to anyone who 's been following desktop Linux lately , is the Ubuntu family of Linuxes , at 54.1 percent .
This was followed by the Red Hat family -- RHEL ( Red Hat Enterprise Linux / Fedora / CentOS ) -- with 50.2 percent .
The Novell SUSE group -- SLED ( SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop ) and openSUSE -- came in third , with 35.2 percent
Yes , that does add up to more than 100 percent .
It would seem that groups using Linux in the office have not standardized on a particular distribution , or even a distribution family .
With that in mind , it should come as no surprise that Linux desktop proponents see issues such as support and end - user training to present " an obstacle for some users " interfering with desktop Linux adoption .
For personal use , Ubuntu once more easily led the pack , at 55.4 percent .
Here , though , the community Linuxes , such as Debian ( 22.2 percent ) , Gentoo ( 10.2 percent ) , Knoppix ( 7.1 percent ) , and PCLinuxOS ( 5.4 percent ) become significant players .
It was also interesting to see that the commercially supported , community Linux distributions -- Novell 's openSUSE ( 19.5 percent ) and Red Hat 's Fedora ( 16.7 percent ) -- are , like Ubuntu , important distributions both in the office and at home .
Applications
Given a choice of applications to run on their Linux desktops , most users would prefer to run a native Linux application rather than a Windows application .
In particular -- Adobe take note -- Linux users continue to really want Linux versions of Adobe 's Photoshop and Dreamweaver .
These were numbers one and three on the Linux users '
Windows application migration wish list .
Autodesk 's AutoCAD was number two .
If Linux users can't run a particular application on Linux , and there 's no native program that gives them similar functionality , they 're almost perfectly divided between three different methods to get them their required program .
These are using WINE , or a software built on WINE , such as Crossover Linux , to run the Windows application in Linux ; virtualization ; and switching to a browser - based application , such as Google Docs .
Device support
Device support , as always , remains a major concern among desktop Linux users .
Printers , this time , took first place for the most trouble over the ever - popular WiFi network adaptors .
It 's not that printers are n't supported well in Linux -- they are .
It 's that users want all the bells and whistles that come on modern printers and all - in - one devices .
These concerns are well known to Linux developers and are being addressed by Greg Kroah - Hartman and his group of device developers .
For printers , at a recent meeting of the Open Printing Group in Tokyo , developers and printer vendors got together to work in common purpose on improving general Linux and printer compatibility .
In addition , the group is working on giving both the KDE and GNOME desktops a common printer dialog to make it easier for both users and vendors to access a printer 's full capabilities regardless of the underlying distribution .
Finally the survey , perhaps reflecting that it was filled out mostly by users who have already taken the Linux plunge , found that pre-installed Linux desktops -- such as Dell 's Ubuntu lines -- are n't all that attractive .
57 percent said that pre-installed Linux met their needs , while only 43 percent were willing to buy pre-installed Linux systems .
However you read the survey 's specific results , one thing comes through loud and clear .
The Linux desktop is being deployed in businesses today , and its numbers are increasing rapidly .
Personally , I still consider 2005 , which marked the release of SLED 9.3 , to be the " Year of the Linux Desktop . "
The LF survey , and the others I mentioned earlier , all show that the Linux Desktop tipping point has already happened and we 're still living through its resolution .

Honor killings :
When the ancient and the modern collide
Throughout the United States , Canada , and Europe , young Muslim women are being targeted for violence .
Lest it be thought hate crimes are to blame , it is , in fact , their own relatives who are the perpetrators .
So - called honor killings , whereby a Muslim male family member , typically the father , murders his daughter in order to defend the family 's honor , is a growing problem .
While statistics are notoriously hard to come by due to the private nature of such crimes and the fact that very few are reported , the United Nations Population Fund approximates that as many as 5,000 women are murdered in this manner each year worldwide .
Undoubtedly that 's a low estimate , as reports from Turkey , Jordan , Pakistan and the Palestinian territories , among other locales , are filtering in at an alarming rate .
Add to the list Germany , Sweden , other parts of Europe , the United Kingdom , Canada , and the United States , and it 's clear that young Muslim women in the West are becoming increasingly vulnerable .
While fathers are commonly responsible for honor killings , they often act in concert with their daughters ' brothers , uncles , and even female relatives .
For infringements upon a Muslim daughter 's " honor " constitute the greatest humiliation possible to the religious and tribal tradition from which many such immigrant families emerged .
Acts that demand " punishment " include refusing to wear a hijab ( or headscarf ) , having non-Muslim boyfriends or male friends of any origin , being sexually active , rejecting arranged marriages , aggressively seeking employment and education , and , more than anything else , attempting to assimilate into Western culture .
Trying to balance a tightrope between the demands of competing and in some cases incompatible cultures , young Muslim women in the West are caught between two worlds .
And all too often they pay the ultimate price .
Indeed , two such cases have rocked the United States and Canada in recent months , bringing the specter of honor killings much closer to home .
On New Year 's Day , residents of Lewisville , Texas were shocked to hear about the brutal murder of teenage sisters Sarah and Amina Said .
The two were found shot to death in a taxi after having made a last phone call to a police dispatcher asking for help .
The police immediately issued an arrest warrant for the girls ' father , Egyptian - born cab driver Yaser Abdel Said , who remains at large to this day .
A Muslim married to a Christian woman , the elder Said had a history of physical and sexual abuse toward his daughters .
This past Christmas , his wife , Patricia , finally fled the state with the girls and set up residence in Tulsa , Okla . , under an assumed name .
Said 's violent and domineering behavior was apparently motivated by his concern that , as the Dallas Morning News describes it , " Western culture was corrupting the chastity of his daughters . "
Honor students and athletes at Lewisville High School , Sarah and Amina were the quintessential American teenagers .
Amina had been awarded a $ 20,000 college scholarship and Sarah planned to study medicine .
Photos of the two young women demonstrate a vibrancy and attractiveness that undoubtedly induced fear in their controlling father .
The emergence of non-Muslim boyfriends was the final straw .
Although the girls ' mother denied that Said was motivated by religion or culture and their brother , Islam , claimed it was not an honor killing , all evidence points to the contrary .
While , reportedly , the family was not terribly observant , Said , as described by the Dallas Morning News , " often espoused his version of traditional Middle Eastern values , " including marrying his then 15 - year - old wife when he was 30 , threatening to take one of his daughters " back to Egypt and have her killed , " where , as he put it , " it 's OK to do that ... if you dishonor your family , " trying to break up one of his daughters and her non-Muslim boyfriend , and threatening to kill both his daughters on multiple occasions over disputes surrounding their social lives .
Summing it all up , the sisters ' great - aunt Gail Gartrell stated unequivocally , " This was an honor killing . "
The slayings of Sarah and Amina Said came on the heels of another apparent honor killing , that of 16 - year - old Aqsa Parvez in Mississauga , Ontario , last December .
Aqsa was a vivacious and popular young woman whose attempts at a normal , Western teenage social life angered her Pakistani father , Muhammad Parvez .
Aqsa , who was opposed to wearing a hijab and sometimes changed her outfit once she got to school , often clashed with her father and had left the family home a week before the attack out of fear .
But she eventually returned , only to be met with strangulation at the hands of her own father .
She died later in the hospital and the elder Parvez , who initially called the police , was charged with her murder .
Aqsa 's 26 - year - old brother , Waqas , was charged with obstructing police .
Like the Said sisters , Aqsa had long suffered abuse at the hands of her father , reports of which were never adequately pursued by Canadian authorities .
But Aqsa 's friends saw trouble brewing and , according to the National Post , noted that " she had been threatened by her strictly religious family before . "
According to one of them , Ebonie Mitchell , Aqsa held conflicting opinions with her family on wearing a hijab .
As she put it , Aqsa " just wanted to dress like we do .
Last year , she wore like the Islamic stuff and everything , the hijab , and this year she 's all western .
She just wanted to look like everyone else . "
As another friend , Krista Garbhet , noted , " She just wanted to be herself ; honestly , she just wanted to show her beauty . "
However , as Aqsa was to discover , the latter desire can have dangerous consequences for young Muslim women in the West .
In the wake of Parvez 's murder , one would hope for moral clarity from the Canadian Muslim community .
But with a few exceptions , the usual suspects issued the usual apologetics .
Following Parvez 's funeral , an anti-violence vigil was held at the Mississauga Civic Centre and organized by the Canadian Council on American - Islamic Relations .
Unfortunately , CAIR - CAN , like its American counterpart , is part of the problem , not the solution .
Working to further acceptance of Sharia ( or Islamic ) law in the United States and Canada and trying to silence — either through accusations of " Islamophobia , " libel lawsuits or boycotts — voices of criticism and reform , CAIR 's agenda would seem to be working against the advancement of Muslim women 's rights .
Accordingly , representatives of other allegedly mainstream Muslim groups , instead of taking the opportunity to address the scourge of honor killings , downplayed the religious and cultural angle .
Shahina Siddiqui , president of the Islamic Social Services Association , claimed that " The strangulation death of Ms. Parvez was the result of domestic violence , a problem that cuts across Canadian society and is blind to color or creed , " while Sheikh Alaa El - Sayyed , imam of the Islamic Society of North America in Mississauga , came to the following conclusion : " The bottom line is , it 's a domestic violence issue . "
In contrast , Canadian Muslim reformer Irshad Manji , in addressing Aqsa Parvez 's murder , put it like so :
Moderate Muslims have warned that we should n't leap to conclusions .
Who knows what other dynamics infected her family , spout hijab - hooded mouthpieces on Canadian TV .
Not once have I heard these upstanding Muslims say that whatever the ' family dynamics , ' killing is not a solution .
Ever .
How 's that for basic morality ?
Similarly , Tarek Fatah , founder of the Canadian Muslim Congress , labeled Parvez 's murder " a blight on Islam . "
" In my mind , " he added , " this was an honor killing . "
Until this kind of self - reflection and self - criticism become the norm in the Muslim community , much - needed reform will remain elusive .
This includes addressing the root causes of honor killings and sanctioned violence against Muslim women .
Although the Koran does not authorize honor killings , Quran 4:34 instructs men to beat disobedient wives and send them to sleep in separate beds .
Then there are tribal leaders such as Jordanian Tarrad Fayiz , who tells followers that " A woman is like an olive tree .
When its branch catches woodworm , it has to be chopped off so that society stays clean and pure . "
Op -eds such as the one in the Yemen Times earlier this month recommending violence against women and clerics delivering sermons and speeches doing the same further muddy the waters .
Also at question are the vagaries of the Arab honor / shameculture , in which men's " shame " ( or that of the family or tribe ) at the prospect of women 's sullied " honor " ( or chastity ) must be avoided at all costs .
Honor killings are not , as the apologists would have us believe , simple acts of domestic violence akin to those that take place in all communities .
They are specific to Muslim religion and culture and must be addressed as such if ever honest debate about the matter is to ensue .
Regrettably , silence is the more typical reaction to these crimes .
Fearful of giving offense or being branded with the ubiquitous " Islamophobia " label , law enforcement , journalists , social workers , government officials and , most of all , Western feminists are allowing a grave threat to women 's rights go unaddressed .
The misguided purveyors of multiculturalism — an ideology that holds that all cultures or religions are equivalent and none ( save for the dominant , or Western , culture ) worthy of condemnation — have rendered the West incapable of addressing evils where Third World cultures are to blame .
But the truth is Western culture offers the greatest boon to women 's rights and must therefore be vigorously defended , even if that means stepping into the realm of the politically incorrect .
Feminist groups such as the National Organization for Women , which put out an occasional press release decrying honor killings , need to make combating this practice as high a priority as defending choice and railing against " glass ceilings . "
Instead , it is a precious few who are telling it like it is when it comes to the oppression of women in Muslim culture .
Ironically , many of them are on the right side of the political spectrum or , like author , blogger and activist Phyllis Chesler , have been cast out of the leftist - dominated feminist movement for speaking the uncomfortable truth .
As I have noted previously , the challenges posed by the Muslim world are the next frontier for women 's rights and all those interested in advancing such goals will have to rise to the occasion .
It is up to every one of us to speak out where , not only women's , but human rights are in question .
Young women 's lives are at stake .
Says Movement ' Has Been Destroying The Voting System On Every Conceivable Front '
Adds That Even A ' Cursory Study ' Of The 2004 Election ' Makes It Abundantly Clear That The Election Was Stolen '

Election integrity expert and author of Fooled Again , Mark Crispin Miller , made some remarkable comments while speaking to the LA Election Protection Task Force last night .
Robert Carillo Cohen , producer of Hacking Democracy , was also a featured speaker at the event .
After covering some preliminary matters , Miller retold the story of his post 2004 election encounter with John Kerry when the Democratic candidate admitted that he believed the presidential election was stolen .
This should n't surprise anyone since , as Miller states :
And believe me , a cursory study of the evidence makes it abundantly clear that the election was stolen and it was n't even that close .
Which ultimately leads Miller to conclude that Kerry is in denial :
Because if you really do accept what happened , you realize that it is a catastrophe , it 's an emergency .
And it 's something that a guy like John Kerry or Al Gore is simply not built to deal with , right ?
Because if you come to terms with what went down , you realize that it is an attack on American democracy .
Business as usual can't simply continue .
We gotta do something .
We gotta hit the barricades .
But resistance to the idea that American democracy is under attack goes far beyond Kerry and Gore .
Miller believes the way to break through this resistance is to :
keep publicizing , to keep spreading the word , to keep making clear that it is not just this little thing here or that little thing there , we 're talking about a fringe movement that has taken over the Republican party that has been dismantling democracy , that has been destroying the voting system on every conceivable front , not just the machines .
They are even messing with the census .
They are preventing another census from being taken because if you have census data you can track this stuff more easily .
Finally , Miller concludes by going over a 12 - step approach to reforming our elections .

I boarded the bus and sat down next to my friend , Rod , and was in the midst of telling him about Daisy 's morning liason when we both heard a loud , desperate yelping that turned our attention toward the window .
I do n't know what you all know about dog sex , but they get turned around , butt to butt , as the male 's unit swells up .
It can be difficult to seperate them until the " moment " passes .
Well , apparently something had spooked Daisy and she came sprinting down the street in our direction .
The poor runt was attached , butt to butt , with his hind legs now about six inches off the ground while his front paws and chin were slapping off the sidewalk every ten feet or so .
He was essentially being bashed against the pavement by a freaked out bitch that had a firm grip on his penis ( deja vu , anyone ? ) .
A couple minutes later the runt trotted back past , by himself , with a little spring in his step .
Kinky little bastard .
Rod and I thought it was the funniest thing we 'd seen in our entire lives .
So , that 's why I try not to have sex with big women .
And when I do , I 'm very careful not to spook her ...
Remember when I said I would never beat a certain release ?
Well I was wrong .
Behold , over 1000 prototypes for various Sega consoles .
Quick numbers : 155 Sega 32 x prototypes , 300 Game Gear prototypes , 464 Mega Drive prototypes , 94 Pico prototypes , 6 Gamecube prototypes -- 1024 prototype overall ( what a nice round number ! ) , making this the biggest prototype release in history ( and probably ever to come ) .
Just multiply this by $ 100 ( which is the average price of these things , and many of them are MUCH more valuable ) and you 'll see how lucky you are to get them free of charge .
There is lots of stuff here -- Sonic , Ristar , Tempo , and many other high - profile , hard - to - find game prototypes which many of us played years back and miss .
Many with different features , levels , hidden data .
Two of these games are unreleased , namely Baby Boom ( crazy Mega Drive game ) and David Robinson Basketball for Game Gear .
Many of the games have various builds in various stages of completion - from early alphas ( there 's even a plain engine build of Taz 2 I believe , with no content at all ) to late betas and finals .
Yes , finals -- I included a number ( around 30 , I believe ) of finals in the release because I 've got very accurate build dates for most of the protos , and that is a great thing to know :)
I 've worked on getting this lot built and packed for the past seven days -- it was a hefty task .
Many of these came in weird formats , many were passworded / encrypted , and it was a lot of manual work .
Most of the protos come from one lot , snagged from Sega of America Q&A archives , from around 1994 - 1995 .
It was very hard to get it , and it was n't cheap either .
The disc protos ( Gamecube , Dreamcast , Saturn ) come from an earlier lot that I saved up until now .
We have an irc channel up for the discussion of these protos .
Server is irc.drx.pl , channel is # sonicprotos ( update : the channel has since changed to # protos ) .
Additionally , I feel I have to recommend a few links to forums that will likely dissect these prototypes to little pieces .
For Sonic prototypes , I recommend Sonic Retro .
For all the non-Sonic protos , hop to X - Cult and Lost Levels .
I 'm not gonna lie -- these things cost me an arm and a leg .
If you want to help me , you can donate ( read this or just e-mail me at [ email protected ] ) .
Also , if you have any information about any prototypes , please do n't hesitate to contact me as well =)
It will help get more prototypes in the future , and will make you warm that you did a good thing .
This release is not all I have .
I will be releasing more over the next hours , days and weeks - Dreamcast Sonic protos , Ecco protos , more Sega CD protos , so stay tuned !
Also , if you ever dreamt of getting a prototype of any kind and you have the funds -- contact me , I have the ability to make things happen , so who knows ;)
There is so much more I wanted to write here , but I did n't manage to do it on time .
I did n't have time to do many things I wanted to do - update the site , for one .
So many things are outdated .
Let me thank everybody who helped me with this release ( sorry if I forgot anyone ! ) - man_traic ( big kudos to this guy ) , Aurochs , Nemesis , Execbyte , Biggestsonicfan , rika_chou , Puto , Sazpaimon , Tweaker , Mad Echidna , QJimbo , Kat , Dot50 Cal , Darcagn , Mustapha , LocalH , Scarred Sun , Jonna Lybrand , Heran Bago , Nineko , Xkeeper , Keiji , Epicenter , Witeoutking , Tweeterman , Irvin Trigueros , Richard Foltz , Sonic AD , Robin Whitehead , Andrew Neilson , Matthew Gundel , Grant Short , GerbilSoft , #sonicprotos , and everybody else !
Special thanks to Kazia , who had to endure me working late on these !
And here are the links .
I will try to give HTTP linkage , but for now , have these torrents ( they are probably the best way to distribute these , as this server will probably go down as the protos get dugg ) :
Mega Drive , 32x , Pico , Game Gear , Saturn , Mega CD , Master System
Gamecube
See you next release ! :)
I ’m convinced that most people think about software companies in an upside - down way .
The common belief is that when you ’re building a software company , the goal is to find a neat idea that solves some problem which has n’t been solved before , implement it , and make a fortune .
We ’ll call this the build - a- better - mousetrap belief .
But the real goal for software companies should be converting capital into software that works .
If you understand this , it ’s easier to make the right strategic decisions .
The trouble with build - a- better - mousetrap is that there ’s not a lot of evidence that it works .
First of all , many of the most successful software companies ( Microsoft and Oracle , for example ) do n’t really “ innovate ” in the sense that they are not really solving problems that have n’t been solved before .
In any market , it is exceedingly rare that you get to keep your invention to yourself .
Everybody has competition .
Wall Street Weenies and lawyers starting high tech companies tend to think they can protect themselves from this with patent protection .
Ha !
I can hardly think of a single case of a company successfully protecting themselves from competitors because of a patent .
( Stac is the only case I can think of , and where the heck are they ? )
The next problem with build - a- better - mousetrap is that we ’ve reached a state with Internet software where there is too much money around chasing the same lame ideas .
Call it the idrive - xdrive - swapdrive - freedrive phenomenon : suddenly thirty - seven companies pop up offering exactly the same service for free .
There are a zillion examples of this .
Petshops - on - the - net .
Urban -video - rental - delivery .
Cosmetics websites .
When this happens , the business challenge switches from being a technical challenge that needs good programmers to being a marketing challenge that requires , somehow , the ability to break through the pack and establish a brand name , something that is vanishingly improbable .
Not only that , but VC money is impatient .
That means that investments which take a really long time to develop wo n’t get funded , which is why anything really interesting or hard to copy wo n’t even get funded .
One reason that there are over thirty companies whose entire goal is providing free hard drive space on the Internet is that writing the code for such a service is so easy .
There ’s a different way to think of software development .
Imagine that the goal of your software company is not to solve some specific problem , but to be able to convert money to code through programmers .
That ’s a little bit strange , but bear with me .
A software company has to think of recruiting the right people as its number one problem .
If you are successful , this can solve any other problem .
Hire smart people , and they will produce good stuff that you can sell and make money off .
Then everything else follows .
Microsoft has the ability to crush its competitors because it has the ability to deploy so many programmers .
When Microsoft released Internet Explorer 3.0 , fast on the heels of IE 2.0 , it was shocking just how good a job they had done .
Not only did they replicate every feature in Netscape ’s browser , but they added some more features too , and did it all with an architecture that was robust and strategic .
While it is true that Microsoft used its operating system to help push its browser , it is also true that they just would n’t have gotten away with this if their browser was n’t great .
( Case in point : even though Windows out of the box can play MP3 files , everyone I know uses WinAmp , not the Windows Media Player , to listen to them .
Even though MSN is on the desktop , everybody uses AOL .
Back when the browser integrated with Windows was crap , Netscape had 80 % market share .
So please stop fretting about the power of bundling . )
Microsoft has a great recruiting strategy .
They hire inexperienced , smart people right out of college … people that have n’t learned from dysfunctional corporate cultures elsewhere .
These kids get to Seattle , not really knowing anybody , work their asses off , and absorb the Microsoft way of doing things like a sponge .
By the time they are ready to get disgruntled , their stock options start to kick in and their effective salary for staying around goes up into the stratosphere , where it is unlikely that anybody else will be able to lure them away .
A five year Microsoft veteran could be making $ 500 K a year including stock options — care to match that ?
The bottom line is that Microsoft is a better engine for converting cash into programmer productivity than anyone else .
This is far from a peripheral factor .
Most startups seem to think that hiring good programmers is about as important as , say , getting the right PR firm .
They “ know ” it ’s important , but not how important .
They ’re not really going to do what it takes to get and keep the best programmers .
Which is why they are likely to get creamed .
As soon as Netscape stopped producing code ( their 5.0 browser is now something like 2 years behind schedule ) , their market share went away .
WordPerfect ’s programmers believed that the best way to do things was Assembler and refused to code in C .
Wrong idea , guys , it takes about 10 times as many programmers to do that , and now WordPerfect is a footnote .
It ’s amazing how many companies – Lotus , Netscape , WordPerfect – have bitten the dust because they lost the ability to convert capital into code .
If you want to be the number one restaurant in town , you have to worry about how to get the best chefs and the best ingredients .
You are a factory that converts raw ingredients and chefs to a dining experience .
If you are a movie studio , you have to worry about getting the best actors , directors , and writers .
You are a factory that converts talent into entertainment .
So if you are a software company , you have to get the best chefs and directors : you are company that converts talent into code .
The right talent knows how to make the right code which will make you successful .
OK , so let ’s assume - for - the - purpose - of - discussion that you agree with me , here .
What implications does this have ?
In coming articles , I ’ll talk about putting this philosophy into practice : how to interview and choose the best people , how to create the right work environment that attracts people once you ’ve picked them , and how you should basically subordinate all other problems to focusing on keeping the factory humming .
The hits just keep on coming : U.S. Attorney scandal reaches Mississippi
As the U.S. Attorney scandal has unfolded over the course of the year , there ’s been no shortage of questions about prosecutors who brought dubious charges against Democrats , looked the other way on wrongdoing by Republicans , or both .
Thanks to Bush ’s White House and Justice Department , the notion of equal - justice under the law has n’t been this shaky in generations .
Worse , the examples highlighting the Bush gang ’s politicization of law enforcement never seem to end .
Today , the NYT ’s Adam Cohen offers the latest , this time from Mississippi .
In 2003 , Mississippi Gov. Ronnie Musgrove ( D ) was seeking a second term , taking on Republican lobbyist Haley Barbour .
Republicans wanted some way to discredit Musgrove ’s allies , while limiting campaign contributions from Democratic supporters .
So , they prosecuted Paul Minor , a trial attorney who has contributed generously to Democrats over the years .
Mr. Minor ’s political activity may have cost him dearly .
He is serving an 11 - year sentence , convicted of a crime that does not look much like a crime at all .
The case is one of several new ones coming to light that suggest that the department ’s use of criminal prosecutions to help Republicans win elections may go farther than anyone realizes . [ … ]
Mr. Minor , whose firm made more than $ 70 million in fees in his state ’s tobacco settlement , suspects it was his role in the 2000 Mississippi Supreme Court elections that put a target on his back .
The United States Chamber of Commerce spent heavily to secure a Republican , pro-business majority , while Mr. Minor contributed heavily to the other side .
The chamber was especially eager to unseat Justice Oliver Diaz Jr. , a former trial lawyer .
He was re-elected after a hard - fought , high - spending campaign .
Then the prosecutions came from the politicized Bush Justice Department .
It follows a familiar pattern — using federal prosecution power to help Republicans win elections .
In this case , it gets worse .
Mississippi ’s loose campaign finance laws allow lawyers and companies to contribute heavily to the judges they appear before .
That is terrible for justice , since the courts are teeming with perfectly legal conflicts of interest .
It also creates an ideal climate for partisan selective prosecution .
Since everyone is making contributions and nurturing friendships that look questionable , a prosecutor can haul any lawyer and judge he does n’t like before a grand jury and charge corruption .
The Justice Department indicted Justice Diaz and Mr. Minor on an array of unconvincing bribery and fraud charges .
Justice Diaz was acquitted of all of them .
The federal prosecutors then brought tax evasion charges against him .
Justice Diaz was acquitted again and still sits on the Mississippi Supreme Court .
Mr. Minor was not as lucky .
He beat many of the charges in the first trial , but the jury failed to reach a verdict on others .
Federal prosecutors went after him again , and this time Mr. Minor was convicted on vague allegations of trying to get “ an unfair advantage ” from judges — the very thing Mississippi ’s lax campaign finance laws are set up to allow .
The scheme paid off .
Trial lawyers who did n’t want to be investigated for making legal contributions backed off , the Democratic Party in Mississippi suddenly did n’t have resources to compete , and GOP efforts to tie Gov. Musgrove to Minor and Diaz became a key campaign issue that helped Barbour take office .
Best of all , there were trial lawyers contributing to Mississippi Republicans , engaged in the exact same dynamic , all of which was ignored by prosecutors .
It ’s possible that we ’ll never know the full extent of the Bush administration ’s corruption of the justice system , but it ’s little wonder Republicans on the Hill do n’t want Congress to find out .
The One Laptop Per Child Project ( OLPC ) plans to launch OLPC America in 2008 to distribute the low - cost laptop computers originally aimed at developing nations to needy students in the United States .
The group , which was formed in the U.S. by teachers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , came under criticism shortly after forming because its original mission did not include the U.S .
Originally , the aim of OLPC was to develop a $ 100 laptop for kids in poor nations to ensure they do n't miss out on the benefits of computing , and to make sure developing countries do n't fall further and further behind modern nations due to their inability to buy computers , a conundrum commonly referred to as the digital divide .
OLPC America already has a director and a chairman , and will likely be based in Washington D.C. , said Nicholas Negroponte , chairman of OLPC , in an interview .
" The whole thing is merging right now .
It will be state - centric .
We 're trying to do it through the 50 state governments , " he said .
The decision to launch OLPC America came about due to three considerations .
" For one thing , we are doing something patriotic , if you will , after all we are and there are poor children in America .
The second thing we 're doing is building a critical mass .
The numbers are going to go up , people will make more software , it will steer a larger development community , " Negroponte said .
The third reason is educational , so that children in the U.S. communicate with kids in developing nations and expand their horizons .
The reason OLPC had not included the U.S. in its low - cost laptop program was because of the huge difference in need , Negroponte said .
In the U.S. , people spend US $ 10,000 per year per child in primary education , but in Bangladesh , a developing country , they spend $ 20 .
It 's a huge difference , and many people in the U.S. can afford more expensive laptop PCs for their kids anyway , he noted .
But although the U.S. was not the focus of OLPC in the beginning , it has always been in the plans .
" To have the United Sates be the only country that 's not in the OLPC agenda would be kind of ridiculous , " Negroponte said .

In retrospect , it figures that a serial “ ninja burglar ” would turn up on Staten Island , a borough whose biggest cultural export , the Wu - Tang Clan , long ago nicknamed the place Shaolin , in honor of kung - fu movies .
This particular bandit , who is now thought to have robbed eighteen homes on the island in the past seven months , acquired his honorific in September , when he encountered a Dongan Hills resident named Phil Chiolo while raiding Chiolo ’s home .
He was dressed all in black , with a black face mask , Chiolo said , and he carried nun-chucks , which he used to club Chiolo in the chest , head , and shins before Chiolo was able to retaliate by stabbing at him with a steak knife .
Chiolo , who suffered a welt near his collarbone , said the other day that he is fine , but Staten Island has since gone ninja mad , with the burglar enjoying a kind of romantic outlaw notoriety .
Other victims have likened him to a gazelle or a cat ( “ very athletic , very quiet , and very fast ” ) , capable of scaling walls and leaping noiselessly out windows .
( No one has heard him speak . )
The “ word on the street , ” according to a Staten Island Advance editorial , was that ninja costumes were going to be an especially popular Halloween choice around the borough this year , and several weeks ago a local home - security company incorporated an image of a rappelling ninja in its print ads .
The Post ’s police blotter , last month , included a small item about a man who , after allegedly attempting to flood his landlord ’s apartment , exclaimed to the cops , “ I know who the ninja is . ”
If he knew , apparently he did n’t tell , because recently the ninja burglar struck again — twice in one night , escaping with a hundred and thirty thousand dollars ’ worth of loot .
“ Now he ’s the famous ninja who ’s disturbing our peace , ” Dr. Mohammad Khalid , a dentist from Pakistan who lives in Todt Hill , said last week , while standing under some trees near the scene of the latest break - ins .
“ He looks like a really professional robber that does not leave any marks or anything . ”
The N.Y.P.D. has assigned a task force to the ninja caper , and its officers , according to the Advance , have resorted to asking strangers point blank , “ Are you the ninja burglar ? ” Dr. Khalid , who serves as the president of the Iron Hills Civic Association , could be called the primary civilian combatant .
For the past two months , he has employed a supplementary private security detail for the organization ’s membership , which includes six hundred homes , and it seemed no accident , he thought , that this latest spree occurred just a block outside the prescribed range of his surveillance crew .
It was Wednesday , which , as some amateur profilers have noted , is the ninja burglar ’s favorite night , but no one would have mistaken Khalid for a ninja as he stood gazing at neighboring windows in the dark .
Khalid is rotund and deliberate .
He wore a suit and tie , and was on his way to meet with another civic association to discuss expanding the surveillance range .
“ Yesterday at my own home , which is about half a mile from here , my garage was open , because somebody came to fix my computer printer , ” he said .
“ He opened the garage and went down to the basement to get some cables .
Five police guys came in and they grabbed him : ‘ What are you doing here ? ’
He said , ‘ I ’m fixing the doctor ’s computer . ’ ” Khalid smiled .
He believes the ninja ’s days are numbered .
On Thursday , as Police Commissioner Ray Kelly prepared to address a gathering of concerned Staten Islanders on the East Shore , a group of ninjas in training at the Island Martial Arts Academy demonstrated considerably greater courtesy than their renegade cousin .
Instead of breaking and entering , they bowed before a doorway and spoke Korean salutations .
None of them appeared to have stab wounds , although many were quite proficient with nun-chucks , given their age ( five to nine , which distinguishes them from the academy ’s peewee ninjas , who are three to five ) .
Some held pieces of plywood with their names written on them .
It was board - breaking week .
The academy ’s master , Pete Paramithis , was careful to point out that all his nun-chucks are made of foam , and he expressed concern that the ninja burglar was giving karate a bad name .
Representatives of the N.Y.P.D. had already dropped by , looking for leads .
Paramithis had a theory that the burglar , if he had any training at all , might be the product of an older , more punitive approach to martial - arts instruction , involving pushups , as opposed to the positive reinforcement that he favors .
“ Negative training creates little monsters , ” Paramithis said .
“ It ’s just like ‘ The Karate Kid . ’
You ’ve got the good guy , and the guy who ’s , like , ‘ Kill , kill ! ’ ” Paramithis teaches concepts like “ bully awareness ” and “ stranger danger . ”

In response to Wil Shipley 's recent post about the lack of an iPhone SDK , a reader left this comment :
I often enjoy reading these entries , but you always come across as a little bit of an a ** hole .
Full of yourself , overly critical and a bit mean .
Dismissing and dissing , out of pure ignorance and spite , the work of the people who made Javascript – people who have done more for the world , and written a better language , than you have or likely ever will – is truly a huge a ** hole move .
Although I 'm a staunch proponent of comments for most blogs , it 's comments like this – what Anand Iyer calls nerd rage – that cause me to question my stance .
I do n't think it 's necessarily wise to dignify these kind of comments with a response , but a few comments later , Wil Shipley responded with exactly what I was thinking :
Miss Manners once said the rudest thing to do is point out someone else 's rudeness in public .
By extension , what do you suppose the biggest a** hole move is ?
Bonus points for invoking Miss Manners ; her Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior has been a staple of my bookshelf for years .
Think what you will about stodgy old Judith Martin , but she has a razor wit and an enduring , keen eye for human behavior .
I learned a lot about life by reading her guide in my early twenties ; it 's a rich comedy of errors in book form that I earnestly recommend to everyone .
I understand the G.I.F.T. is an unfortunate side - effect of anonymity and the faceless interaction mode of the internet .
But I think we can do better .
As Miss Manners said :
You can deny all you want that there is etiquette , and a lot of people do in everyday life .
But if you behave in a way that offends the people you 're trying to deal with , they will stop dealing with you .
There are plenty of people who say , ' We do n't care about etiquette , but we can't stand the way so - and - so behaves , and we do n't want him around ! '
Etiquette does n't have the great sanctions that the law has .
But the main sanction we do have is in not dealing with these people and isolating them because their behavior is unbearable .
I do n't object to criticism .
Criticism is what comments are for .
What I object to is criticism that resorts to least - common - denominator attacks .
The use of angry invective negates any criticism you were trying to make .
Insulting someone might make you feel temporarily vindicated , or give you a brief , cathartic moment of release , but you are n't convincing anyone of anything .
People will read your angry words and see them – and you – for what you are .
It 's a completely self - defeating exercise .
The minute you call someone an a ** hole , they 're no longer listening to you .
For an example of effective criticism of the strongest kind , I can think of no better piece than Martin Luther King 's Letter From Birmingham Jail .
I re-read it every year , and each time I 'm floored by the passion behind this incredible persuasive essay – and the deep anger and frustration it presents in such rational terms .
While confined here in the Birmingham city jail , I came across your recent statement calling my present activities " unwise and untimely . "
Seldom do I pause to answer criticism of my work and ideas .
If I sought to answer all the criticisms that cross my desk , my secretaries would have little time for anything other than such correspondence in the course of the day , and I would have no time for constructive work .
But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth , I want to try to answer your statements in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms .
This legendary essay demonstrates the fine art of disagreement : the ability to respect the people you disagree with , and to earn their respect in turn .
The only way to do that is to be civil , reasonable , and rational .
" Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio was prevented from participating n the Democratic presidential debate Tuesday night after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that MSNBC was not required to include him ; ... MSNBC had no immediate comment .
It is likely to be described as a First Amendment victory by the news organization , as its lawyers had argued that it had a right , as a privately owned network , to determine who to invite . "
Brian Stelter , New York Times , January 16 , 2008 .
---------
Somewhere , one hopes , there is a graduate student in political science looking for a dissertation topic .
The strategic exclusion of Dennis Kucinich from as much public view as a " privately - owned media " could possibly engineer has been breathtaking , and a full analysis , including ramifications regarding corporate ownership of networks , is in order .
One certainly would not expect an honest evaluation from a network would one ?
What is left but academic analysis ?
Two things stand out .
One is the argument employed by General Electric 's lawyers , as noted in the above quote from the Times ( Aside : GE owns NBC , and any attorney for NBC will argue the interests of the owner , naturally ) .
The " airways " are ours ( so we 're told ) , and We the People let such as GE and Disney use those airways only to the extent that they will serve the public interest ( so we 're told ) .
When corporate " persons " - " private citizens " in the above NBC / GE legal position - can literally throw a candidate out on his ear , they have created a powerful argument against their continued control of the public 's airways .
This is not as complex as GE 's lawyers would make it but simply a gross misuse of what belongs to the people .
Why are n't our legislators looking after our interests here ?
Dennis Kucinich , like no other candidate , threatened the death grip that the corporate sector has on American political dialogue through its concentrated ownership of media .
ABC ( Disney ) and NBC ( GE ) were literally forced to prove him correct .
They needed to neutralize this man who was intent on spotlighting corporate control during a debate watched by millions .
For months , already , their attention had been on his height ( He would have towered over James Madison and Napoleon ) , and on his wife 's looks and pierced tongue .
NBC's Jay Leno called him an " elf " .
Nonsense .
The Democratic Party 's silence to the indefensible treatment of Kucinich by corporate owned networks was " non-support " amounting to intra-party assassination and yet another indicator of the Democratic Party 's solid dedication to corporate interests .
As ominous , though , was the silence of Kucinich 's own Party in response to this treatment .
And why be surprised ?
It was , after all , the Republican and Democratic parties that , in collaboration , took control of the presidential debates only to dumb them down to the sideshows we now have and to make impossible any visibility by " alternate " parties or of any values not corporate friendly .
At their website http://www.debates.org/, they state their mission to ensure that debates " provide the best possible information to viewers and listeners " .

Our friend Peter Hosey recently mentioned a problem that frequently makes debugging crash reports harder than usual .
The problem is that stack traces do n't always display every stack frame in the call chain , which can make it difficult or impossible to determine the flow of control that led to the crash .
Let 's look at a demonstration of the problem , its causes , and its solutions .
Update : I probably should have mentioned this before - optimizations make debugging hard .
Debug builds should not use any optimizations at all , unless you enjoy headaches .
With no optimizations in place , your debug builds will not suffer from missing stack frames .
This post is intended to help developers who have received crash reports from users testing release builds , where optimizations have been made .
Note : I 'll be using only the x86 assembly in this post .
If anyone is interested , let me know and I 'll post the ppc equivalents in a followup post .
A sample app :
Here 's what that looks like when compiled with no optimizations ( - O0 ) : Standard stuff - main calls func1 , func1 calls func2 .
Each function 's prolog pushes the base pointer onto the stack , saves the previous stack pointer as the new base pointer , and updates the stack pointer as needed for that function .
And each function 's epilog uses the ' leave ' instruction to copy the base pointer back to the stack pointer , and pop the the old base pointer back into %ebp before returning control to the calling function .
Because these functions perform this standard housekeeping , gdb can provide us with an accurate backtrace if we ask for it :
So far , so good .
Now let 's crank up the optimization level to - O2 : Now we have a problem .
Each function still has the usual prolog , but the epilogs have changed .
There are no ' leave ' instructions , and there 's only one ' ret ' instruction , in func2 .
gdb is now unable to give us an accurate backtrace :
The stack frames from main and func1 are no longer visible in the backtrace ( _start calls main in every application , though gdb may sometimes exclude it from the backtrace ) .
There are two differences that we should note : •
The mechanism by which one function transfers control to another function has changed .
Under - O2 optimization , ' calll ' has been replaced with ' jmpl ' , which is sometimes referred to as a tail call optimization •
Each function now pops the stack into %ebp before transferring control to the called function .
These differences have these results : •
The return address is not updated across function calls , because ' calll ' is not used ( %eip is not pushed onto the stack ) . • %ebp retains its original value across function calls , because the caller pops % ebp ( after it pushes %ebp in its prolog ) before transferring control to the called function .
Because of these changes , gdb is unable to give us an accurate backtrace .
The specific flag that causes this code generation is - foptimize - sibling - calls , which is included in - O2 and higher .
Depending on our needs , there are two ways to disable this optimization . •
The sledgehammer : - fno-optimize - sibling - calls will prevent gcc from generating the problem code across the entire executable . •
The scalpel : Inserting an extra line of code in a function will prevent gcc from generating the problem code on a per-function basis :
The asm directive tells gcc to insert whatever text we specify into the intermediate assembly file before it gets passed to the assembler .
Luckily , gcc does not parse our string (s ) , so it has no idea what logic , if any , that we 're adding .
Since it appears to gcc that there is additional logic after the function call , the tail call optimization is no longer possible .
Update :
The volatile keyword only prevents the compiler from moving the asm block relative to other asm blocks , not relative to other lines of C code .
The above use of ' result ' after the asm block is the more important detail of this code snippet .
The volatile keyword is not in fact needed , and this hack is a bit more fragile than I originally thought .
There is one other optimization that can result in missing stack frames : - fomit - frame - pointer .
gcc 's man page does n't seem to explain which optimization levels can include this flag , but it 's easy to disable it entirely with - fno - omit - frame - pointer .
Another issue with - fomit - frame - pointer is that it only results in missing stack frames on some architectures .
I 'll leave it to the reader to explore that one .

Germany 's women 's soccer team powered their way to a thrilling 2 - 0 victory over Brazil with Birgit Prinz 's goal in the 52nd minute and Simone Laudehr 's header in the 86th bringing the team its second consecutive Women 's World Cup title .
Germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .
31,000 fans in Shanghai's Hongkou Football Stadium watched the fast - paced FIFA Women 's World Cup final .
Brazilian star striker Marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper Nadine Angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
Brazil 's Marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick
" After the penalty save , I felt it was meant to be , " Germany coach Silvia Neid said .
" We worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
It was important to work against Marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
Missed chances
The nimble - footed Brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the German defense .
Marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by Angerer .
Seconds later , the physically stronger Germans went on the attack when Kerstin Garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
In the eight minute , Germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper Angerer failed to gather a free kick by Brazil 's Daniela .
The ball bounced out to Formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
Daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
Heroic saves by German goalie
The Germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
But it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when Captain Birgit Prinz was fed a pass by Sandra Smisek .
The veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .

But it was Angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by Martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute Rosana .
Despite dominating ball possession , Brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid German defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
A stunning header by Simone Laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient German side .
" Germany deserved to win "
" This was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1 - 0 down and Marta missed a critical penalty , " said Brazil coach Jorge Barcellos .
" But Germany took their chances and scored .
I 'm very sad about this result but my players tried their best . "
The 21 - year - old Marta said she was crushed after the defeat but that the team had to look ahead .
" It 's difficult to express my feelings .
The Germans deserved to win , " she said .
" But we have to keep our chin up and prepare for the Olympics in Beijing . "

Questions linger about how much of an advantage the Patriots may have had if they intercepted defensive signals .
Under Belichick , the Patriots have often run a no-huddle offense , which forces opponents to quickly call a defensive play .
N.F.L. rules allow quarterbacks to hear instructions from coaches  through a headset and into a speaker in the quarterback ’s helmet  until there are 15 seconds left on a play clock .
When the defensive play call is deciphered , the Patriots could call a play to counteract .
The Patriots lost the 2000 opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , when videotape of signals was used in preparation , according to the former Patriots player , who was among several former players interviewed by the N.F.L but said he did not want to speak publicly because the investigation is continuing .
The Patriots appear to have continued the practice of taping opposing signals for seven years .
Last September , Goodell fined Belichick $ 500,000 , fined the Patriots $ 250,000 and took away one of team ’s first - round draft choices in 2008 .
After the sanctions were announced , the Patriots submitted six tapes , from games in 2006 and 2007 , and some notes that dated to 2002 , Goodell said .
The tapes and notes were destroyed days after being handed to the league , because Goodell considered the matter closed .
But questions remain about how wide and deep the Patriots ’ taping habits extended .
Senator Arlen Specter , a Pennsylvania Republican who met with Goodell last week , is among those still questioning why the league was so quick to sanction the Patriots and destroy the evidence .

Goodell met with the competition committee Thursday to discuss his handling of the spying case .
Committee members seemed satisfied and eager to turn the page .
“ We were all satisfied , every one of us , ” said John Mara , the Giants ’ president .
“ All of us have our different opinions about the Patriots , but we were all satisfied that this thing was investigated properly and that they came to the proper conclusion . ”
Bill Polian , the president of the Indianapolis Colts , said : “ It ’s behind us .
It ’s time to move forward . ”
Ben S. Bernanke will take over from the legendary Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve on Wednesday at a particularly dicey time for the nation ’s apparently robust economy .
As a result , Bernanke will face a difficult choice walking into his new job : whether the Fed should continue -- or suspend -- its recent campaign of raising interest rates .
Unemployment is below 5 % , as President Bush is likely to remind the nation in his State of the Union address tonight .
Inflation is moderate .
Workers are becoming more productive .
But potential trouble is bubbling beneath this calm surface .
After remarkably consistent growth for three years , the economy slowed at the end of 2005 .
The housing market , which has fueled growth , is showing signs of cooling .
Oil prices are high .
Americans are spending more than they earn , a trend that ca n’t last forever .
Advertisement
And the United States is deeply dependent on foreign lending -- particularly from China -- to finance its outsized trade and budget deficits .
The Fed , whose job is to keep prices stable without suppressing economic growth , has already done the easy work .
For the last 20 months , Greenspan ’s Fed has tapped on the monetary brakes at every opportunity , gradually raising short - term interest rates .
In June 2004 , the rate controlled by the Fed stood at a recession - fighting low of 1 % .
In 13 equal steps , the Fed has raised it to 4.25 % to fight inflation and prevent the economy from overheating .
The Fed has signaled the public to expect another rate hike at today ’s meeting , which will be Greenspan ’s last .
That will nudge its benchmark rate to 4.5 % , the low end of the range at which analysts have estimated the Fed would stop .
Advertisement
From then on , the Fed -- it will be Bernanke ’s Fed -- will have to decide when enough is enough .
If it continues to raise interest rates , consumer debt repayments could become more difficult and the housing market could feel the pinch .
But if the Fed ends the rate - hike campaign , it will increase the risk of inflation , which is probably more of an immediate threat now than it was a year - and - a - half ago .
“ Broadly speaking , the economy is in a pretty good place , ” said Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moody ’s Economy.com in West Chester , Pa .
“ But it ’s no longer obvious what the next step should be .
Now it gets a lot more complicated . ”
Whatever the Bernanke Fed does , the new chairman will not do it single handedly .
Interest - rate decisions are made by the Federal Open Market Committee , which consists of Bernanke and the six other Federal Reserve Board governors , plus five of the 12 regional Fed bank presidents .
Advertisement
Greenspan , by virtue of his stature as well as his persuasive skills , generally carried the other committee members with him .
During the 13 consecutive meetings at which the committee raised rates by one quarter of a point since June 2004 , only one dissenting vote was cast -- by a member who , immediately after Hurricane Katrina , felt the Fed did not have enough information about the hurricane ’s economic impact to vote intelligently .
But now , “ the guy who ’s kept them on a leash is going to disappear , ” said Lawrence Lindsey , an economist who was a Fed board member from 1991 to 1997 -- and who voted against Greenspan ’s majority four times in 43 opportunities .
He predicted stormier times ahead at the closed Open Market Committee meetings .
Bernanke ’s first meeting , however , will be eight weeks into his tenure , time enough for him to begin to build consensus , said Kevin A. Hassett , director of economic studies at the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative Washington research organization .
“ There is going to be a lot of uncertainty in the first couple of months , but Bernanke will quickly establish himself , ” Hassett said .

Bernanke ’s first rate - hike decision will be influenced by Greenspan ’s last official pronouncement -- the statement that the Open Market Committee issues today to explain its expected move to raise the federal funds rate by another quarter point , to 4.5 % .
The federal funds rate is the interest on overnight loans between banks .
David Kelly , managing director of Putnam Investments in Boston , said Bernanke would find it politically difficult , without help from Greenspan , to preside over the end of 14 consecutive rate increases choreographed by the maestro of monetary policy .
Greenspan can -- and Kelly said he should -- construct a statement at today ’s meeting explaining the rate increase in such a way that leaves his successor maximum flexibility to act as he sees fit .
“ This will be potentially the most important Federal Reserve Board meeting of the decade , ” Kelly said .
“ On Alan Greenspan ’s last day on the job , he ’s going to have a chance to leave the car parked in neutral . ”
“ As an economist , I ’m more worried about the economy slowing down than I am about inflation , ” Kelly said .
“ The biggest mistake the Fed usually makes is believing it needs to run the economy .
It just needs to get monetary policy into neutral and let the economy run itself . ”

Economists generally see the Fed ’s goal to be a “ neutral ” federal funds rate -- one that is two percentage points higher than inflation .
With inflation now running 2 % to 2.5 % , depending on how it is measured , a neutral federal funds rate should be in the range of 4 % to 4.5 % .
It ’s already there , although there is room for one more increase today .
Many analysts , however , find it unlikely that Bernanke will let up on the monetary brakes immediately , even if that means lifting interest rates above the neutral zone .
Echoing the views of many others , Jan Hatzius , chief U.S. economist for Goldman Sachs , says Bernanke will want to prove his anti-inflation credentials by engineering at least one more rate increase .
Looking beyond Bernanke ’s first Fed meeting , Zandi warned of the dangers that set in when an economic expansion gets long in the tooth , as this one is .
In those situations , he said , policymakers can no longer encourage economic growth with little risk of inflation .
Advertisement
“ Now we ’re at the point in the business cycle when the economy could slip a gear , ” Zandi said .
“ I think [ Bernanke ] should plan on it . ”
Fed chairmen have sometimes undergone trial by fire early in their tenure .
In the case of Greenspan , who became Fed chairman in 1987 at about the same stage of the business cycle as now , an October stock market crash sent the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling nearly 23 % in a single day .
Thanks in large measure to the Fed loosening its grip on the money supply , the economy weathered that storm without a recession .
Zandi said there was no shortage of flash points now .
To him , the potential for a cooling of the red - hot housing market is the “ major fault line in the economy . ”
Home equity loans and no - down - payment mortgages have provided millions of Americans with spending money -- but less equity in their homes .
A downturn in home values could leave them owing more on their homes than they are worth .
Advertisement
Already , existing home sales fell 5.7 % in December , and housing starts tumbled to their lowest level since last March .
And an increase in short - term rates , if they translated into higher long - term mortgage rates , could contribute to a housing reversal .
Another “ fault line ” is U.S. reliance on foreign money , particularly China ’s , to finance its trade and budget deficits .
If foreign governments decided they had invested enough , the need to attract other investors would drive U.S. interest rates up independent of any Fed action , to the detriment of economic growth .
Energy prices represent a third threat , and one that could be aggravated by higher interest rates .
Philip Verleger , a senior fellow with the Institute for International Economics , can imagine the world oil price , now in the range of $ 60 to $ 70 a barrel , surpassing $ 100 by year ’s end .
Whatever Bernanke does , he inevitably will be compared with Greenspan , who , despite scattered critics , is probably the most highly regarded top official in Washington .

“ Bernanke is replacing a legend , ” said Stephen Buser , professor emeritus of finance at Ohio State University .
He noted that Earle Bruce , who replaced the legendary Woody Hayes as head coach of the Ohio State University football team , was fired even though his teams won as many games as Hayes ’ .
“ Even if Dr. Bernanke made the same decisions as Alan Greenspan , ” Buser said , “ they might not have the same result . ”

Wind Boom Creates Rural Jobs in Texas
February 24th , 2008 by Carol Gulyas
They say everything is bigger in Texas and that certainly applies to the giant windmills that have replaced oil derricks in the rural area of Sweetwater , in Nolan County .
According to the New York Times , the towers stand 20 stories high and the turbine blades are as long as a football field , and farmers can earn $ 500 per month for each turbine they allow built on their land .
Texas is now the largest producer of wind power in the United States , with $ 700 million in investment injected into wind projects in January alone , enough to power 100,000 homes .
But even bigger news to those who would like to see some attention paid to America ’s rural economic health , is the impact that these wind farms are having on the rural economy .
Property values have doubled , teens are staying in the area after graduation to work in the growing number of wind power jobs , and the downtown area is in a state of renewal .
“ Since the wind boom began a few years ago , the total value of property here in Nolan County has doubled , and the county judge , Tim Fambrough , estimated it would increase an additional 25 percent this year .
County property taxes are going down , home values are going up and the county has extra funds to remodel the courthouse and improve road maintenance …
Wind companies are remodeling abandoned buildings , and new stores , hotels and restaurants have opened around this old railroad town . ”
– Clifford Kraus , New York Times
But this rural revival is in danger of an early death unless Congress extends the federal renewable energy tax credits that have helped fuel wind energy growth .
The American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) estimates that over 116,000 U.S. jobs and nearly $ 19 billion in U.S. investment could be lost in just one year if the tax credits are not renewed by Congress .
These jobs are in the areas hardest hit in today ’s economy : construction and manufacturing .
Concerned citizens should contact their elected representatives to encourage them to act to extend the federal renewable energy tax credits .

Administration officials are describing their draft proposal in terms of a traditional status - of - forces agreement , an accord that has historically been negotiated by the executive branch and signed by the executive branch without a Senate vote .
“ I think it ’s pretty clear that such an agreement would not talk about force levels , ” Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Thursday .
“ We have no interest in permanent bases .
I think the way to think about the framework agreement is an approach to normalizing the relationship between the United States and Iraq . ”
While the United States currently has military agreements with more than 80 countries around the world , including Japan , Germany , South Korea and a number of Iraq ’s neighbors , none of those countries are at war .
And none has a population outraged over civilian deaths at the hands of armed American security contractors who are not answerable to Iraqi law .
Democratic critics have complained that the initial announcement about the administration ’s intention to negotiate an agreement , made Nov. 26 , included an American pledge to support Iraq “ in defending its democratic system against internal and external threats . ”
Representative Bill Delahunt , Democrat of Massachusetts , said that what the administration was negotiating amounted to a treaty and should be subjected to Congressional oversight and ultimately ratification .
“ Where have we ever had an agreement to defend a foreign country from external attack and internal attack that was not a treaty ? ” he said Wednesday at a hearing of a foreign affairs subcommittee held to review the matter .
“ This could very well implicate our military forces in a full - blown civil war in Iraq .
If a commitment of this magnitude does not rise to the level of a treaty , then it is difficult to imagine what could . ”
Senator Jim Webb , Democrat of Virginia , who raised concerns in a letter to the White House in December , said the negotiations were an unprecedented step toward making an agreement on status of forces without the overarching security guarantees like those provided in the NATO treaty .
He added that the Democratic majority would seek to block any agreements with the Iraqis , unless the administration was clear about its ultimate intentions in Iraq .
Things are amp'ing up on the Google Android front .
Hardware prototypes and videos of phones sporting early Android software are showing up on the net and at trade shows .
( Slides of Android devices from this month 's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona . )
Here 's a video demo from Android 's introduction in November 07 .
Google 's put a lot of thought into how Android applications integrate with one another .
It also has very nice animation , touch interface , and most importantly , a web browser that renders web pages much like Apple 's iPhone browser .
But those are just the surface features .
I know the iPhone is all the rage but Android is an open source , multi-hardware , cross - platform mobile operating system platform .
Rather than adding developer support as an after thought , Android has been brought out to the development community first .
While the iPhone is in market , Android is making big strides with the hardware and software development community .
Google 's created a $ 10 M bounty for the " best applications " written by non-Google developers .
The Android SDK just got an update last Wednesday with the ability to do layout animations , geocoding , and media player codecs for various formats .
Some developers were disappointed that the telephony package was n't yet updated but that will come soon .
More information about the Android SDK is available at http://code.google.com/android.
It 's probable that Android 's SDK will be more mature than Apple 's yet to be seen iPhone SDK but then again , the iPhone is in market working with Apple 's own apps .
It 's yet to be seen how much of the iPhone SDK is a bolt on , an internal software redesign or simply exposing much of what was already there .
I know I 've blogged previously about the future versions of Windows Mobile operating system taking on the Apple iPhone , but the most likely case is that Google 's Androids puts the smackdown on both the iPhone and Windows Mobile .
More than just open source Linux running on a phone , Android is a rich , open environment for creating next generation phone and mobile applications .
I know I risk more rath from the Apple fanboys but my personal bias is that Google 's open approach and cross - hardware support will help it win out in the end .
Turkish Front Groups
One of AQ Khan 's American suppliers was a company with strong Turkish roots called Giza Technologies in New Jersey .
Giza's ' exposure ' was ' officially ' the result of an anonoymous email tip in 2003 , however , as we know from Sibel 's case , the FBI was aware of Giza 's role in the AQ Khan network at least two years earlier .
According to a documentary about the nuclear black market element of Sibel 's case , Kill The Messenger , Giza 's CEO Zeki Bilmen " was on the FBI wiretaps translated by Sibel Edmonds " who left the FBI in early 2002 .
Given what we learnt in The Times , that phone call was probably between Bilmen and either the American Turkish Council or the Turkish Embassy - both targets of FBI counter - intelligence operations .
Inexplicably , Zeki Bilmen was never charged with his involvement , and Giza continues operating to this day .
In 2005 , Sibel said :
And ( Giza 's ) business – well , business is good .
They have many shipments going out , coming in , all day long .
To places like Dubai , Spain , South Africa , Turkey .
They have branches in all these places .
Yep , they 're sailing along very smoothly .
When asked how this is possible , Sibel replied :
" It 's beyond logical explanation .
Maybe it was decided in high places that no one would touch him . "
In fact , the identity of the company was even hidden in the indictment of one Humayun Khan , a procurer for the network who was close to Pakistan 's ISI .
In the indictment , Giza is simply referred to as ' a broker in Secaucus , New Jersey , ' whereas every other company is clearly identified .
Investigative journalist Joe Trento might have an explanation for why Giza continues to operate , and why the US government wants to hide Giza 's involvement .
He says that
" The CIA even started using some of the Khan network ’s front companies for its own purposes . "
As I documented here , it is very possible that Giza one of those companies .
In Kill The Messenger , an anonymous " U.S intelligence officer " who is " very familiar with Turkish espionage activities " - including Giza and the American Turkish Council - says :
" There are people within the State Department and also in the U.S Congress that were facilitating the Israelis and the Turks in obtaining proprietary information or restricted technology .
That ’s why there is a gag order against Sibel Edmonds ! "
That technology , he notes , can be :
" Nuclear or non nuclear .
For example , computer hardware , maybe software . "
Some people have wondered recently whether maybe Sibel inadvertently stumbled on a sting operation - but that is clearly not the case .
The State Dept and Congress are certainly not the people who would be running a sting operation .
Further , when Sibel first reported her case to Congress , the first step taken was to make sure that this was not a covert operation , and that there were n't any double agents involved .
Only after Senators Leahy and Grassley were assured this was n't the case did they proceeded to hold unclassified hearings ( which were retroactively classified . )
This should n't come as a surprise .
Sibel has previously said that from her experience is concerned :
" The Department of State is easily the most corrupted of the major government agencies . "
In fact , the same thing has been true for decades .
As far back as 1986 , the CIA was running diligent operations against the Khan network ; then , as now , it was people at the State Dept who were ruining all the operations .
As Seymour Hersh documented in 1993 , a high - level top secret inter-governmental group was formed in 1986 " in an effort to stop illegal American exports to Pakistan and other non-nuclear nations . "
This group ran undercover operations to arrest those buying nuclear - related materials for Pakistan 's program .
Richard Barlow , " the government ’s leading expert on illegal Pakistani procurement , " with the full knowledge and support of his superiors at the CIA and elsewhere , was able to engineer the arrest of some of Khan 's suppliers - but only after they 'd learnt not to tell the State Dept what their plans were .
Here 's Hersh :
" The State Department ’s Near East Bureau was not told of the planned operation , for fear that the officers there would tip off the Pakistanis , as they had done in the past ...
" We still have cases on Pakistan and we still do n’t tell State about it , " a senior Customs Service official told me recently , in anger .
" The State Department constituted a security problem for us . "
The Guardian effectively debunked with the same ' sting ' claims recently :
" Intelligence officials on both sides of the Atlantic have said they waited until 2003 to strike against the Khan network in order to gather evidence on all its activities and all its customers .
" But what did they achieve ? " Armstrong asked .
" Where are all the people connected to the Khan network ?
There were at least 50 people in this thing , and there are only a handful of people under house arrest .
Did they need three extra years to do that ? " "
Not only have very few guilty people suffered any consequences , the US government has even " hampered " the criminal prosecutions of some of the suppliers .
A segment on Democracy Now in 2006 notes :
Over the past year Swiss officials have requested at least four times that the Bush administration share documents and evidence related to Khan ’s nuclear black market .
But the United States has never responded .
Swiss officials maintain it needs U.S. assistance in order to convict three Swiss men accused of helping AQ Khan set up a secret Malaysian factory to make components for gas centrifuges .
Last week U.S. weapons expert David Albright testified before Congress and said , " I find this lack of cooperation frankly embarrassing to the United States and to those of us who believe that the United States should take the lead in bringing members of the Khan network to justice for arming our enemies with nuclear weapons . "
Albright has floated one theory as to why the Bush administration wo n’t help the Swiss investigators .
He says the three Swiss men accused of being part of AQ Khan ’s underground network may have been working for the CIA and being paid by the U.S. government .
Albright is echoing the same point made by Joe Trento - and if these firms were n't helping with a sting operation , then what on earth was the CIA using them for ?
The problem is that as soon as these firms are given immunity for their activities , then they immediately become a likely vehicle for all types of nefarious activities - whether it be funding illegal black - ops , or trafficking narcotics , or both .
Other American Suppliers
Giza is not the only American supplier to Khan 's network .
Sibel has previously told me that there are others firms .
This was confirmed in 2004 by IAEA head Mohamed ElBaradei .
The involvement of these firms apparently " sheds new light on the activities of the network , known up to now for primarily supplying technology to North Korea , Libya and Iran . "
None of these firms have apparently been exposed , let alone faced any criminal charges .
Giza 's Bilmen claims that he is an innocent victim , though Sibel told me that Bilmen " has social & business ties " with another supplier to Khan 's network , Turkish businessman Selim Alguadis .
Other Turkish Suppliers
Giza is not the only Turkish company involved in supplying the AQ Khan network .
Firstly , Turkey served as one of the transhipment hubs for components that were sourced in the US and elsewhere .
Further , some of the nuclear components for Khan were actually manufactured in Turkey .
In Sibel 's fantastic Highjacking of a Nation series , which outlines the contours of her case , she writes :
Turkey played a major role in Pakistan and Libya ’s illicit activities in obtaining nuclear technologies .
In June 2004 , Stephen Fidler , a reporter for Financial Times reported that in 2003 , Turkish centrifuge motors and converters destined for Libya 's nuclear weapons program turned up in Tripoli aboard a ship ( BBC China ) that had sailed from Dubai .
One of those detained individuals in this incident , a ‘ respected and successful ’ Turkish Businessman , Selim Alguadis , was cited in a public report from the Malaysian inspector - general of police into the Malaysian end of a Pakistani - led clandestine network that supplied Libya , Iran and North Korea with nuclear weapons technologies , designs and expertise .
According to the report , " he supplied these materials to Libya . "
Mr. Alguadis also confessed that he had on several occasions met A Q Khan , the disgraced Pakistani scientist who has admitted transmitting nuclear expertise to the three countries .
Selim Alguadis remains a successful businessman in Turkey with companies in several other countries .
He was released immediately after being turned over to Turkish authorities .
His partner , another well - known and internationally recognized wealthy businessman , Gunes Cire , also actively participated in transferring nuclear technology and parts to Iran , Pakistan and North Korea .
Although under investigation by several international communities , Alguadis and his partners continued to roam free in Turkey and conduct their illegitimate operations via their ‘ legit international business ’ front companies .
Gunes
Cire has since died , however his company , ETI Elektroteknik , continues to operate freely , with Cire 's son now at the helm .
Selim Alguadis is apparently ' under investigation ' but neither he nor his company , EKA , appear to be in any trouble three years later .
It 's an odd pattern .
There 's strong evidence of Turkish complicity in the nuclear proliferation network , yet guilty people are allowed to walk free , and Western governments go to great lengths to cover up the facts .
States ( cough ) Secrets
There are significant parallels between Sibel 's case and the recent case of British Customs official Atif Amin .
The UK government , desperate to cover its complicity in allowing the AQ Khan network to continue proliferating , is trying to shut Amin down using the Official Secrets Act , the British equivalent of the State Secrets Privilege gag that has been used to shut down Sibel 's case .
Informed observers widely recognize that for the Bush administration , the State Secrets Privilege is simply a ' get out of jail free ' card to shield themselves when they commit egregious crimes .
The same is true in the UK .
An editorial , ' , Secrets and lies , ' in the Guardian last Friday noted :
" National security is being invoked not to protect us but to shield politicians from embarrassment
[...]
There are genuine threats to national security and to our public and personal safety .
It is a dangerous abuse if a government hoists the flag of national security and deploys the Official Secrets
Act when all it is really trying to do is protect itself from embarrassment . "
In the US , we 've recently seen the State Secrets card played to cover up illegal spying , torture , and any number of other crimes - including complicity in the spread of nuclear weapons to our purported enemies .
Enough is enough .

Hey , look at that Douchebag McFucktard taunting a tiger at the San Francisco
On Thursday , December 6 , Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney gave a speech entitled " Faith in America " .
Its purpose , per the mainstream media , was to try to quell concerns about his Mormonism .
As it turned out , he seemed to do his best to pander to the radical religious " right " .
He promised that he would not allow his church , or any other church , to influence his decisions as president .
However , he also said the following , which I find quite disturbing :
" Freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom . "
What ?
Freedom requires religion ?
Since when ?
I consider myself an agnostic , and I do not subscribe to any religion .
So is Romney telling me that I cannot , or should not , have freedom ?
And what about the First Amendment , in which our founding fathers declared that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion ?
Apparently they did not believe that you needed religion in order to have freedom .
I wish the mainstream media would call him on this .
But I shall not hold my breath .

We 've been waiting ... and waiting ... but STEAL THIS FILM II has finally been released , and it 's available for free .
The League of Noble Peers announce that film is intended to ' bring new people into the leagues of those now prepared to think ' after intellectual property ' , think creatively about the future of distribution , production and creativity ' .
TorrentFreak was invited to a ‘ preview ’ screening a couple of months ago , and we think they might achieve their goal !
Steal
This Film 1 already was a huge success with nearly 3 million downloads , and we think this will be no different for part 2 .
The film , again produced by The League of Noble Peers , features some people from the BitTorrent community such as Erik from mininova and Peter ( aka Brokep ) from The Pirate Bay .
Dan Glickman from the MPAA also makes a short appearance stating that they will never be able to stop piracy , but I guess we already knew that .
Jamie King of the League Of Noble Peers was answering chat requests today , so we caught up with him to ask a couple of questions :
TF : You must be excited about releasing the film finally .
What ’s been the delay ?
JK : To be honest , the film simply took a lot longer than we ’d imagined to make — it ’s a big step forward from STF I for us .
And then we got sidetracked with The Oil Of The 21st Century , a conference some of us were involved in organising in Berlin this year .
It was great and we got to preview the film there for some friends , but we ’re sorry to everyone who was waiting .
We ’re sure no one has been that upset !
TF : Are you working with anyone to promote the film this time ?
JK : Of course we ’ll be working with The Pirate Bay again to do a bit of promotion , as we ’ve really discussed the project a lot with those guys .
We ’ve also got to know the people at Mininova who ’ll be seeding the torrent and promoting it a bit .
I was also really pleased to hear that BitTorrent themselves will be featuring the film since we met them during a screening of STF II in Amsterdam .
We ’re really up for working with anyone who ’d like to feature STEAL THIS FILM so get in touch !
TF : Is there a streaming version anywhere ?
JK : We discussed this a lot .
There will be a streaming version ( and of course we ca n’t and would n’t want to prevent anyone transcoding it and uploading it whereever they like ) but right now , it ’s about BitTorrent .
With The Pirate Bay and Mininova seeding it , there should n’t be any problem with the download speeds .
TF : Are you asking for donations ?
JK : Yes , but not for this film :D
We have a new project in development — based around our ‘ Oil Of The 21st Century ’ idea — and we ’re headed out to Asia in the new year to start investigating .
We ’re asking anyone who wants to help us with this project to donate $ 5 or more ( or whatever they can afford really ) to [ email protected ]
Oh !
And we ’re giving away a secret giftpack to anyone who donates $ 15 or more .
TF : Any final words ?
JK : Only that we ’re really pleased to be releasing STF II after more than a year and we ’re looking forward to all the argument we hope it will generate .
And we ’d like to say a massive thanks to everyone who supported us so far .
You rock .
