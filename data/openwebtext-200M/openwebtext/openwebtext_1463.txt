I mentioned a few days ago that what Republican senators are focused on in the Senate is using every procedural angle they can to keep the ‘ Cornhusker Kickback ’ and all the other most unpopular parts of the Senate bill in the bill .
In other words , they ’re going to make themselves the defenders of everything they ’ve been hammering for months .
And something similar is going to happen in the House .
The ‘ fix ’ bill includes getting rid of the ‘ Cornhusker Kickback ’ and all the other ‘ special deal ’ stuff in the original senate bill .
And every House Republican is about to vote against it .
Detroit , Michigan ( CNN ) --
Forty - four Detroit schools and one administrative building will close in June under a $ 1 billion plan unveiled Wednesday by the city school district 's emergency financial manager .
The district has been beset with falling enrollment as well as aging buildings , emergency financial manager Robert Bobb said Wednesday .
The plan will allow the district to cut operating costs by about $ 31 million in 2010 and ensure lower maintenance costs in the future , he said .
The plan , which complements an academic plan recently unveiled by Bobb , will " create a leaner , smarter DPS , " he said .
" We believe that this plan provides certainty where , in the minds of some , there may be uncertainty . "
The Detroit Free Press reported Wednesday that an additional 13 facilities will be closed by 2012 .
District spokeswoman Jennifer Mrozowski told CNN on Wednesday that more schools may be scheduled for closure in the future but could not confirm a number .
" We 're calling this DPS 2.0 , " she said .
" We 're looking to create a smaller but more efficient district " with an eye toward growth .
The district has 50,000 excess seats , Bobb said , and kindergarten enrollment has declined from 16,046 in 1994 to 6,039 in 2009 .
Such decreases are expected to continue , Bobb said .
The Free Press reported that district enrollment will fall from 84,000 this year to 56,000 students in the 2014 - 15 school year .
Community members will be able to provide feedback on the plan at a series of town hall meetings , Bobb said .
A final decision will be made in mid- to late April .
If voters approve a bond measure sometime in the future , he said , " this plan offers a potential investment of over $ 1 billion in city neighborhoods . "
According to the Free Press , other schools will be built under a two - part construction plan .
The first phase calls for the remodeling and renovation of 22 schools , using $ 500.5 million under a bond measure that voters approved in November .
The second recommends another $ 500 million in renovations and new schools , but would require voters ' approval of an additional bond measure .
The plan will coincide with $ 41 million in security upgrades at all schools , Bobb said .
It was formulated after officials considered factors including enrollment vs. capacity , academic performance , and the conditions of neighborhoods and facilities , among others .
The proposal also calls for the construction of new campuses , aimed at educating everyone from preschoolers to college students , the Free Press reported .
The previously released academic plan calls for a 98 percent high school graduation rate and a 100 percent college acceptance rate by 2015 .
" We 're still going to grow the district , " Bobb said , but will do it " realistically . "
The plan also aims to protect schools along city boundaries as officials believe the district would further lose students to suburban districts if those schools were to close , he said .
The district closed an additional 29 schools last year , Mrozowski said .
It ended the 2008 - 2009 school year with a deficit of $ 219 million , which is projected to increase to $ 316.6 million by the end of the year , according to Bobb .
" I do anticipate that the cumulative deficit will be further decreased as I implement further cost savings during the rest of this year , " he said .
A spending and hiring freeze has been implemented , he said .
Last week , the Kansas City , Missouri , Board of Education voted to approve a plan to close 29 educational facilities , including 26 schools .
Do you like to see the content of Clojure source files in Quick Look ?
I do .
Unfortunately this is not as straightforward as it should be .
Having XCode on my machine did n’t help either .
It took me a while to get this working .
Maybe this will safe you some time . :-)
Here we go ..
Quick Look does n’t know about clj files .
Which is ok because it can’t possibly know every programming language out there .
The quick look default behaviour for unknown files is to simply show some not so interesting file information :
I found a plugin called QLColorCode ( version 2.0.2 ) which adds Quick Look support for a large number of programming languages including syntax highlighting .
The plugin has some installation notes and how to handle the XCode issue .
Nevertheless it takes a couple of manual steps to get it running for clj source files .
First a few words about the way Quick Look works .
Quick Look uses something called UTI ( Uniform Type Identifiers Reference ) to identify the type of a file and to select the proper plugin for displaying it .
It is possible to check what Quick Look knows about a clojure files by running qlmanage .
The -d 1 prints debug information and the -p option takes the file .
Here is the output :
$ qlmanage -d 1 -p src/clj/clojure/core.clj
Testing Quick
Look preview with files :
src/clj/clojure/core.clj
[ DEBUG ]
Registering for public.image
[ DEBUG ]
Preview test for src/clj / clojure / core.clj -- /Users/hauner/Development/clojure.git/.
Content type UTI : dyn.ah62d4rv4ge80g5dn
[ DEBUG ] Previewing / Users / hauner / Development/clojure.git/src/clj/clojure/core.clj .
Content type UTI : dyn.ah62d4rv4ge80g5dn .
Generator used : None
The Content Type UTI ( Lines 5 & 6 ) is only “ garbage ” .
Which means that Quick Look has no idea how to handle clj files .
Back to the installation .
Disabling XCodes “ source - code ” plugin
The QLColorCode plugin will register itself for the “ public.source - code ” UTI .
With XCode installed the “ public.source - code ” UTI is already registered to a plugin provided by XCode ( XCode issue ) as can be seen by running qlmanage again .
$ qlmanage -m | grep source - code
public.source-code -> / Developer / Applications / Xcode.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/SourceCode.qlgenerator ( 1613 )
To get rid of it , I used the Disable XCode QL Plugin.app from QLColorCodeScripts - 1.0 .
It will rename the XCode to SourceCode.qlgenerator .
disabled which is enough to remove it .
Simply renaming it will work too .
Running qlmanage again , it is gone .
$ qlmanage -m | grep source - code
Before installing the QLColorCode plugin is has to be tweaked a littel bit which I will describe next .
Adjusting the plugin
MacOSX does n’t offer any convinient way to register new or change file types ( in this case the clojure files ) .
To register it with MacOSX I added an xml to qlcolorcode ’s Info. plist file , which is in QLColorCode-2.0.2/QLColorCode.qlgenerator/Contents/Info.plist .
I simply copied and adjusted the scala entry .
< dict > < key >
UTTypeConformsTo</key > < array > < string>public.source-code</string > </ array > < key >UTTypeDescription</key > < string > Clojure Source Code</ string > < key >
UTTypeIdentifier</key > < string>org.clojure.clojure-source</string >
< key >
UTTypeTagSpecification</key > < dict > < key>public.filename-extension</key > < array > < string > clj</string > </ array > </dict > </ dict >
There is another small tweak required to make the plugin use syntax highlighting .
The plugin contains highlighting rules for Clojure but expects . clojure as filename extension instead of .clj .
To fix it I simply copied clojure .lang to clj.lang in the plugin folder QLColorCode-2.0.2/QLColorCode.qlgenerator/Contents/Resources/highlight/share/highlight/.
Nearly done , only one step left :-)
Installing the QLColorCode plugin
After tweaking the plugin I copied the plugin to ~/ Library / QuickLook ( / Library / QuickLook would be fine too ) .
Installation is described in the plugins ReadMe. txt along with some instructions for customizing font , font size and other options .
I had to run
$ qlmanage -r
qlmanage : resetting quicklookd
[ / sourcecode ]
before Quick Look recognized the new plugin and qlmanage -m reported QLColorCode
as plugin for “ source - code ” .
$ qlmanage -m | grep source - code
public.source-code -> / Users/hauner/Library /QuickLook/QLColorCode.qlgenerator ( 2.0.1 )
And then finally the reward … :-)
Amid the media furor over the attempted Christmas Day attacks and a renewed political focus on enhancing airport security , attention is turning to a technological advancement that will have civil rights activists — or , for that matter , anyone with a secret –seriously worried : Mind - reading machines .
“ As far - fetched as that sounds , systems that aim to get inside an evildoer ’s head are among the proposals floated by security experts thinking beyond the X - ray machines and metal detectors used on millions of passengers and bags each year , ” AP ’s Michael Tarm reports .
ADVERTISEMENT
Tarm focuses on an Israeli company called WeCU Technologies ( as in “ we see you ” ) , which is building a system that would turn airport waiting areas into arenas for Pavlovian behavioral tests :
The system … projects images onto airport screens , such as symbols associated with a certain terrorist group or some other image only a would - be terrorist would recognize , company CEO Ehud Givon said .
The logic is that people can’t help reacting , even if only subtly , to familiar images that suddenly appear in unfamiliar places .
If you strolled through an airport and saw a picture of your mother , Givon explained , you could n’t help but respond .
The reaction could be a darting of the eyes , an increased heartbeat , a nervous twitch or faster breathing , he said .
The WeCU system would use humans to do some of the observing but would rely mostly on hidden cameras or sensors that can detect a slight rise in body temperature and heart rate .
Homeland Security officials have long been keen on Israeli counter - terror technologies , given the country ’s extensive experience with terrorism and its reputation for having some of the most effective security systems in the world .
According to numerous news reports , WeCU has received two grants , from the US Transportation Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security , for their research .
Raw Story was unable to determine how much money WeCU received from the US government , but regulatory filings show the company spent at least $ 60,000 on lobbying in Washington in 2006 and 2007 .
WeCU has already developed a prototype model of the mind - reading technology , which , according to an article in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz , has already been demonstrated to government security officials in the US , Germany and Israel .
It was evidently from that demonstration that US agencies decided to fund the project .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It sounds like science fiction , ” WeCU CEO Ehud Givon told the Jerusalem Post .
“ But I can assure you that the technology is very real .
We have accuracy rates that are higher than 95 percent . ”
Supporters of mind - reading technology argue that it would reduce waiting lines at security checkpoints and reduce the hassle for travelers .
But the risks to personal privacy inherent in mind - reading technologies are self - evident .
AP reports :
Some critics have expressed horror at the approach , calling it Orwellian and akin to “ brain fingerprinting . ”
For civil libertarians , attempting to read a person ’s thoughts comes uncomfortably close to the future world depicted in the movie “ Minority Report , ” where a policeman played by Tom Cruise targets people for “ pre-crimes , ” or merely thinking about breaking the law .
ADVERTISEMENT
WeCU ’s technology is by no means the only mind - reading security system in development today .
Another Israeli company , Suspect Detection Systems , has developed a technology that reads a person ’s “ hostile intent ” by measuring bodily responses , through the person ’s hand , while being asked questions .
That system was field - tested at the Knoxville , Tennessee , airport last summer .
Between 2005 and 2006 , SDS received $ 460,000 in grants from the TSA and the science directorate of Homeland Security .

The company appears to have ramped up its public relations in the wake of the Christmas Day bombing attempt .
“ A simple five minute automated interrogation during the Visa application process , or at the airport security checkpoint , would have most assuredly exposed the evil intention of Christmas terrorist Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab before he ever boarded , ” SDS CEO Shabtai Shoval said in a press release .
But while these methods are still in development , other behavior - detection technologies , that have less to do directly with reading minds , are on the cusp of being ready for deployment .
The Department of Homeland Security has given the green light to FAST , or Future Attribute Screening Technology , which uses a combination of biometric scanners to measure a person ’s pulse , breathing , pupil dilation and other signals that can determine “ hostile intent . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
While FAST is n’t quite as intrusive as the WeCU system , it appears to be much closer to implementation , with field testing of the $ 20 - million technology set to begin in 2011 .
Everyone has their favorite genre of video game .
To some , it ’s First Person Shooters where you ’re give the ability to eviscerate a slew of enemies head on with an arsenal of unbelievable yet highly entertaining weapons .
Or , maybe you ’re an Adventure guy who prefers controlling a mega - breasted heroine through caverns and tombs blasting away at grave robbers .
Or , and this is what ’s important to this particular story , maybe you ’re a Sports gamer .
Specifically : Hockey .
Why Hockey ?
Well , it might not necessarily be the simplest of Sports video games , that distinction generally falls to baseball .
But it is n’t exactly difficult , either .
As long as you can pass , you can typically ( especially in today ’s Next - Gen console games ) knock a few One - Timers in to win .
But these games were n’t always that straight forward .
Well , they were definitely ‘ simpler ’ , especially in terms of graphics and basic playability , but they were n’t difficult inasmuch as you were more or less controlling different colored ‘ L ’s lobbing a square randomly .
You ’ll see what I mean , unless you remember fondly , as I do .
In either case , let ’s take a tour of the NHL through the years in Video Game form .
Oh and a final note here .
Toward the crescendo of the list you might find I left off a few incarnations of the games .
I did this basically because there were no vast or overly important changes made from the previous outing .
I apologize if the particular game I omitted was your favorite , I ’m sure I ’ll hear about it .
Oh , and low and behold I have !
Who ’d have guessed .
Anyway , I promised I ’d mention a few I left off due to their not having changed too much between releases , and those ones would have been much of the 2 K series between 3 and 9 .
Also , tho I did mention the Blitz series , there was a few Blitz Pro games I did n’t include .
I sure hope this makes many of you relax a little .
1979 Hockey !/ Soccer !
Magnavox Odyssey 2
This is the one system and game I do n’t recall at all .
I was 5 and it ’s possible my dad bought this system , but since it was relatively pricey , I kinda doubt it .
At any rate , this marked the first in video game hockey .
1980 NHL Hockey Intellivision
This one I remember fondly .
My grandpa was awarded an Intellivision system through Upjohn where he was a head salesman .
The point is , it came with a slew of games including this silly mess .
But as silly as it was , for 1980 it was the coolest thing I ’d ever seen .
1981 Ice Hockey Atari 2600
The very first video game system I personally owned .
Christmas present .
We had only four games when we first acquired it , and since we were such big hockey fans , this game was one of them .
Not too shabby a transition in my opinion .
But they had a long way to go .
1986 Great Ice Hockey Sega Master System
The Sega first hit stores not surprisingly , just seven months after the NES .
I was much more of a Nintendo guy , but my buddy ( far too well off for his own good ) was given one of every system that hit the market , including this beauty .
The hockey was a ton of fun and looked pretty darn good .
1987 Hat Trick Atari 7800
This was the last system I owned before the slew of Nintendos that would occupy my time for years .
It was easily Atari ’s finest achievement and definitely its penultimate gasp in the video game world .
Fun hockey with ‘ eh ’ grahics , but it was definitely better than the previous incarnations through Atari .
Barely .
1988 Blades of Steel NES
This is officially the first hockey game that not only looked like the real NHL , but also played better than any attempt before it .
If you were a hockey fan with a Nintendo , Blades of Steel was a must have .
Hours spent on this game ; all of life ’s other responsibilities succumbed to the power of B.O.S .
This was the game all future hockey games would have to strive to be .
1988 Ice Hockey NES
This game relied heavily on the look of Nintendo ’s up and coming mascot , Mario .
In fact , it easily could have been called “ Mario and Luigi : Hockey ” .
But it was fun , faithful , and pretty exciting all the same .
1990 Slap Shot Sega Master System
The game play itself was very similar to NES ’ Blades of Steel , not to mention the way it looked .
But what Slap
Shot lacked in voice overs ( “ With the pass ! ” ) it made up for in dynamic vignettes between periods .
1991 Wayne Gretzky Hockey NES
This was the first fully endorsed NHL product , and the Great One lent his name .
The playability was a little jerky since it did , in my opinion , take a step backward making the view overhead instead of on ice .
It was fun , and seeing the little adverts scrolling under the big screen during halftimes and scored goals was a nice touch .
1991 Mario Lemieux Hockey Sega
No surprise that once one famous hockey player gets in on the marketing , another ca n’t be too far behind .
Welcome Mario Lemieux .
Sega loved too try to One Up Nintendo , and with this hockey game they really did .
The graphics were better , the play smoother , and it just felt more realistic .
1991 TV Sports Hockey TurboGrafX 16
Ah the TurbografX 16 … such a flash in the pan for home consoles , though it did pave the way for future Next Gen ’s to come .
As for the hockey game , there were mild hit - expelled grunts , a slight bit more realism , and , well , pretty damn inconsistent playability .
But it was still a step in the right direction .
1991 NHL / EA Hockey Megadrive
You might be a bit more familiar with the American version of the Megadrive ’s name : Sega Genesis .
This was Sega ’s fourth generation home console and really gave Nintendo a run for its money and was Sega ’s answer to the waning TurbografX 16 .
The game ?
Awesome looking ice , individually moving crowd , rather detailed players , and offensive hits !
Now we ’re talking !
1992 NHLPA Hockey ’93 SNES , Sega Gen .
The first hockey game made for Nintendo ’s newest 16 - bit system , the amazing Super Nintendo !
Arguably Nintendo ’s finest creation …
Anyway , the game was , for the most part , nearly identical to the previous entry with a few noticeable improvements like more accurate shots .
1992 Hit The Ice SNES , TurboGrafX 16 , Sega Genesis , Nintendo Game Boy
The game marks the first hand - held hockey game that was n’t just one of those little pre-animated Cracker Jack things .
You could , and I did , get this for the Nintendo Game Boy and man was that worth it .
Not necessarily a giant leap forward in terms of game play , but the angry , 3 - a - side hockey players were pretty cool .
Not to mention the litter the crowd was allowed to chuck on the ice .
1993 NHL Stanley Cup SNES
Another amazing leap toward imitating the reality of the NHL , this game allowed the player to use all 26 teams at the time , including the two newest , Florida Panthers and Anaheim Mighty Ducks , to duke it out for the Cup .
The only real stipulation was the players did n’t have names ( thanks to the lack of endorsement from the NHLPA ) , but numbers that corresponded to their actual person .
Though fun , the constant rotating ice was a tad nauseating .
1993 Pro Sports Hockey NES , SNES
Strangely , this game was nearly the opposite of the last :
It had player ’s names , but the teams were just the cities .
For some odd reason they made this one for the rapidly fading NES as well .
Okay , I kid , that system is forever in everyone ’s hearts .
Anyway , it looked not too different from Blades of Steel , really , just from a different perspective .
Odd .
1993 Brett Hull Hockey Sega Gen. , SNES
I have to say , for the third incarnation into player - endorsed hockey games , Brett Hull ’s is the best so far .
With the inclusion of Al Michaels as the announcer and play - by - play commentator , they really were on to something here .
Sure he only called numbers and used basic ice locations in his color commentating , it was still the forerunner to what we have now .
1993 NHL Hockey ’ 94 SNES , Sega Gen. , Sega CD , DOS
Vertical game play , full NHL and NHLPA endorsement , impressive realism … it ’s all there .
This is the third in the NHL series and quite possibly the Gold Standard even by today ’s amazingly realistic games .
Many people even choose this over the newer ones thanks in part to its fun and enjoyment .
1994 ESPN National Hockey Night SNES , Sega Gen .
One of the tougher entries in the genre , not to mention the nostalgic feel of the old days when ESPN aired hockey .
This one tends to make people long for the penultimate days of the Nordiques and the Whale …
1994 NHL ’95 SNES , Sega Gen. , Game Boy , Game Gear
Big improvements here .
For the first time , a complete season could be played , and players could be created , traded , signed , and released .
Fortunately ( or less so , depending on how you look at it ) the AI goalie was often unable to block across - the - crease shots , yet a player - controlled goalie could deflect nearly everything .
This version is widely considered the best NHL game of all time .
1995 NHL 2 On 2 Open Ice Challenge Playstation , Arcade , PC
This very different entry into the NHL video game genre is , at its most basic , NBA JAM for the ice .
Your puck ignites when you start to ‘ heat up ’ , you can literally knock the goalie and the net against the boards with a super slap shot … it ’s a ball !
There are only two players per side , not counting the goalie , and it ’s a pretty fun little check fest .
This also technically marks the first NHL game for the PSX .
1995 NHL 96 SNES , Sega Gen. , PC
A step up from NHL 95 , there were very few changes other than graphical improvements .
However , there was the reintroduction of fighting !
You could suffer both major and double minor penalties .
That ’s cool .
Still , though , it felt a little like players were ‘ bouncing ’ off each other .
1995 NHL FaceOff PSX
Quite the graphical improvement here .
The uniforms are definitely more vibrant , the play feels a touch more ‘ human ’ , and there were quite a few more options and , thankfully , the fighting still remains .
1996 NHL All - Star Hockey Sega Saturn
Oh joy , the Sega Saturn .
A relatively short life of six years here in America , it still managed to spawn a pretty decent NHL game .
It looked excellent for a fourteen year - old game both graphically and playability wise .
The announcers and color commentators were cool , and it all just felt real .
1996 NHL PowerPlay ’ 96 Sega Saturn , PSX , PC
Now we ’re talking .
This was a huge step forward in terms of realism on the ice .
The players a quite a bit more fluidity and less ‘ bounciness ’ , you really felt like you were in the game , and there was a far grittier feel to it , too .
Definitely one of the very best entries in the list .
1996 NHL 97 SNES , PSX , Sega Genesis and Saturn , PC
As another year passed , so did the time of less dynamic graphics .
This time around , at least for the two more powerful systems : the PSX and the Saturn , complete 3D and motion captured polygonal player images were used .
And , for the first time in an EA hockey game many new international teams were added to the playability .
1996 NHL FaceOff 97 PSX
Not a whole lot in terms of major leaps forward .
Having this particular game on the PSX definitely made for a more pretty hockey game over all and it certainly did inch closer to that more realistic feel that we know today .
This game looks a bit like NHL 07 for the PSP .
1996 Wayne Gretzky ’s 3D Hockey Nintendo 64
Depending on how you felt about the N - 64 ’s standard of making everything that would have otherwise been sprites into full - on polygons was directly proportional to your love / hate relationship with this game .
For me , it was pretty damn sweet .
But I know folks who absolutely abhorred it and the N - 64 as well .
Blasphemers !
This was the Golden Eye system , haters !
Anyway , Gretzky continued on his path to endorsing fun hockey games .
1997 NHL 98 PSX , SNES , Sega Gen. and Saturn , PC
This time , besides slightly improved graphic sprites ( still 2D renderings - for the final time - for Genesis and SNES ) , we ’re given full National Teams .
Yet , though this was an Olympic year , the rights to Nagano Hockey were not acquired .
Definitely a fun game .
1997 NHL FaceOff 98 Sony PSX
Here we have quite the jump in realism from the players .
They felt , and moved more like actual humans .
The shot differentiation actually had different looks that did n’t all blend together , and the puck was n’t this huge manhole cover .
Definitely improvements in the right direction .
1997 NHL PowerPlay 98 PSX , PC
Every new edition sees improvements in one way or another .
Here the players have a bit more dimension to them giving them a more personal presence .
1998 NHL 99 PSX , N - 64 , PC
Graphically , of course , it had made some very nice upgrades .
However , and I do remember this fondly as I did and still do own this game and a PSX ( somewhere … ) , it seemed slower and a bit more touchy .
That aside , it was tons of fun to play and even score some cheap shots just as with most of the NHL games .
1999 NHL Championship 2000 PSX , PC
Improvement wise , definitely the announcers , music , and commentating .
It ’s nice to know that the basic soundtrack of the game took a turn for the better .
As for the graphics and playability ?
Seemed maybe a bit less cluttered , but all in all , no great shakes .
1999 NHL 2000 PSX , Game Boy Color , PC
This time around we get the genius Bill Clement in the commentating booth , so that ’s something .
There was a tournament round - robin style of play added as well as the newly minted Atlanta Thrashers .
Beyond that , pretty much the same .
NHL 01 did n’t change much , either .
Oh , and GameBoy Color !
2000 NHL Rock the Rink !
PSX
This was … hockey - ish .
Teams of three - on - three face off on made - up squads and have a specific time limit with the puck in order to score .
Yeah , I never played it but , according to the video , it looks pretty cool .
2001 NHL 2002 PS2 , XBOX , GameBoy Advance , PC
Little bit of trivia here … well , aside from the fact that this is the first hockey game for the next gen consoles of the PS2 and the XBOX .
Anyway , Bill Clement was replaced by the far funnier Don Taylor and , this is interesting , the original image in the opening ( the World Trade Center ) was replaced by the Statue of Liberty after the September 11th incident .
The game itself was fun .
Faster .
2001 NHL Hitz 20 - 02 PS2 , XBOX , Nintendo Gamecube
Now THIS is a hockey game !
Well aside from the fact that there ’re really no rules - especially those found in the real world NHL - and it felt like an arcade game , this was fantastic and very different .
You could clock your opponent , trip , shove , you name it .
And much like its NBA JAM - style of play , you ’d set the net aflame wen you launched a killer slap shot .
Lots of fun .
2002 NHL 2K2 Sega Dreamcast
Believe it or not , this was the last game ever made for the Sega Dreamcast .
Look either you loved this system or you hated it .
Apparently enough folks decried it that Sega made no system after this and sold its rights to everyone else .
Anyway , this game had amazing graphics - as did the whole for the Dreamcast - but they did tend to make the players look slightly ‘ plastic ’ .
The play was very fluid with far better ice reflections and a warn surface after a period , too !
2003 NHL Rivals 2004 XBOX
It appears that a crescendo of realism has finally been reached for the last generation consoles before the XBOX 360 , Wii , and PS3 would arrive in homes .
The game looks great , plays amazingly , and offers up all the goodies we ’ve come to expect in an NHL game .
2004 NHL 2005 PS2 , XBOX , Gamecube , PC
Finally , we ’ve come to the super special ‘ Open Ice Control ’ where you are able to move your player around without the puck !
Huzzah !
Also , for the first time , a World Cup mode where you can play God and build a player from the bottom up !
You could also use international jerseys and colors as well as recently defunct and changed team logos !
Sick !
Now , here ’s where I decided not to include video of the next two ’06 and ’07 as there was little in the way of additional improvements other than graphically and better dekes .
2006 NHL 07 Sony PlayStation Portable
I am including this game for several reasons .
First off , it is one of only three hockey games available for the PSP which in and of itself is a crime .
Fortunately , it is far better than the other two Gretzky - sponsored offerings and plays exactly like a console version .
Graphically it is amazing with full player animations , audience individuality , and a ton of options allowing you to play a game just about any way you want .
For the PSP , an amazingly powerful handheld , I feel it ’s time to drop another NHL game maybe for ’ 11 … anyone ?
2008 -10 NHL 08 , 09 , 10 PS2 - 3 , XBOX 360 , Nintendo Wii , PC
I ’ve included the past three incarnations into this last entry since , visually , they ’ve improved as well as one could expect for the advancements of the newest next - gen consoles .
Play - wise , new stick movements and controls have been added where the right hand thumb stick controls the shots , or , if you refer , you can adjust it to ’ 94 style and play with just the buttons .
The uniforms look far nicer and some versions even offer various styles .
Eventually I can see the home user controlling a real human … it ’ll take over the world !
Editors Note : Listen to Stew and the boys discuss this article on our podcast , The Gunaxin Show .
All told , the new measures are expected to cost about $ 50 billion .
The White House was careful to stress that the money will come from funds already set aside for housing programs in the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
There will be “ no additional commitment of taxpayer dollars , ” Michael S. Barr , an assistant secretary of the Treasury , said at the White House briefing .

Here is what the $ 50 billion is supposed to buy :
The simplest component of the plan involves assistance to unemployed homeowners .
Mortgage companies will now be encouraged to reduce payments for at least three months and possibly six months while the homeowner pursues a new job .
To be eligible , borrowers must submit proof they are receiving unemployment insurance .
The new payments will be 31 percent or less of their monthly income .
The missing money will be tacked onto the loan ’s principal .
A second and more complicated program is a requirement that mortgage servicers consider writing off a portion of a borrower ’s loan to get it down to a more manageable level .
Borrowers in the government modification plan who owe more than 115 percent of the value of their home and are paying more than 31 percent of their monthly income toward the mortgage are eligible .
The write - downs are to take three years , with the borrowers in essence being rewarded for making their payments on time .
The third major new program strays the farthest from the government ’s previous approach .
Borrowers who owe more on their homes than they are worth will get a chance to cut their debt — providing the investor or bank who owns the loan agrees .
Lege : - Uforutsigbart hvilken behandling pasienten får
KAOS : Du har ingen garanti for at den behandlingen du får er vurdert opp mot den seneste forskningen på området .
I hvert fall ikke dersom legen som behandler deg stoler fullt og helt på fagprosedyrene som er lagt inn i datasystemet .

50.000 behandlingsrutiner skaper kaos i Sykehus - Norge
( VG Nett ) Et barn som får i seg foreldrenes epilepsimedisiner , risikerer å bli møtt av en lege som ikke har tilgang til oppdatert informasjon fra Giftinformasjonen .

Hva er en fagprosedyre ?
En kortfattet liste som beskriver gjeldende faglige praksis for en enhet , avdeling , eller for hele Helseforetaket ( HF ) Prosedyrene kan finnes i form av sjekklister , oppgavelister og skjemaer .
Prosedyren skal være egnet for raske oppslag i legens hverdag .
En felles faglig praksis for vanlige tilstander og situasjoner er ment å bidra til at pasientene er sikret likeverdig behandling uansett hvilket sykehus de kommer til .
Eksempler på prosedyrer :
Bruk av hostemaskin
Behandling av lyskebrokk .
Forebygging av selvmord i sykehus .
Innleggelse av ulike typer kanyler .
Diagnostikk av ADHD
Behandling av akutt nyresvikt
I gjennomsnitt har hvert HF 2384 prosedyrer .
Årsaken til at variasjonen er så stor er at helsepersonell ikke deler prosedyrene over det åpne internettet , men fortsetter å jobbe slik de gjorde den gang alt måtte gjøres på papir .
Det stilles ikke krav om at foretak skal samordne arbeidet sitt .
Prosedyrene ligger I dag innesperret bak brannmurer .

Et hav av forskjellige behandlingsrutiner , mangel på kvalitetssikring , og tungvinte søkemotorer kan føre til store problemer for deg som sykehuspasient .
Det går fram av en ny , oppsiktsvekkende rapport der 27 av 30 norske helseforetak har svart på spørsmål om sine fagprosedyrer og datasystemer .
- Et enkelt søk på internett ville gitt legen riktige opplysninger fra Giftinformasjonen , men ved mange sykehus er nettilgangen så dårlig at legene ikke har tid til å utføre slike enkle søk når det haster , forklarer Øystein Eiring , spesialist i psykiatri og helsefaglig rådgiver , som leder undersøkelsen .

En fagprosedyre forteller leger og sykepleiere hva som skal skje når en person blir lagt inn på sykehuset .
Prosedyren kan inneholde regler for behandling av alt fra enkle sårskader til kompliserte operasjoner .
Behandling av akutt nyresvikt , innleggelse av ulike typer kanyler og diagnostikk av ADHD er eksempler på fagprosedyrer .

Mangler kvalitetssikring
Eksempelet med barnet som svelger foreldrenes tabletter er et tenkt tilfelle .
Feil som følge av at fagprosedyrer er vanskelige å finne , eller samhandlingen mellom sykehusene er for dårlig , kan ramme alle typer behandlinger .
Helse Sør - Øst :-
Har ikke vært flinke nok
Slik rutinene er ved flere norske sykehus kan en fagprosedyre være basert på alt fra grundig gjennomgang av litteratur til en kjapp gjennomgang av en lege på kveldsvakt , avslører undersøkelsen .
LEDER UNDERSØKELSEN : Øystein Eiring , helserådgiver og spesialist i Psykiatri Foto : Privat
Kvalitetssikringen er svært mangelfull .
I landets helseforetak finnes det nesten 50.000 fagprosedyrer .
- Dette innebærer at det er svært uforutsigbart hvilken behandling og diagnostikk pasienten får .
Det vil avhenge av sykehuset og noen ganger av den enkelte behandler , advarer Eiring .
Mørketall
Han tror 50.000 prosedyrer er en underrapportering , og at det i virkeligheten finnes langt flere .
Flere av dem er trolig udatert for lengst .
- Ingen har god oversikt over hva andre har gjort .
Arbeidet har vært uten styring .
Vi har jobbet i mange år på papir .
Systemene har ikke vært brukervennlige .
I noen foretak har de vært så vanskelig at folk har gitt opp , og laget nye prosedyrer , sier psykiateren .

Dobbeltarbeid
Sykehusene er lovpålagt å sikre pasienter riktig behandling , men prosedyrene sykehusene følger , er vidt forskjellige .
I tillegg til et tusentalls forskjellige prosedyrer er det bare halvparten av foretakene som sier at de har måter å kvalitetssjekke disse jevnlig på , avslører undersøkelsen , som er et samarbeid mellom Nasjonalt kunnskapssenter for helsetjenesten og Sykehuset Innlandet .
KAN KOSTE LIV : I verste fall kan pasienter dø som følge av trege datasystemer eller behandlingsrutiner som mangler oppdateringer .

- Produksjonen av fagprosedyrer er ukoordinert og preget av et kolossalt dobbeltarbeid .
De utarbeides på en måte som gjør at man ikke kan være sikker på kvaliteten .
De blir heller ikke delt med befolkningen , fastleger og primærhelsetjenesten ellers , sier Eiring .
Regjeringen har pålagt helsefortakene å gjøre prosedyrene tilgjengelige på internett , men bare to sykehus svarer ja på spørsmålet om prosedyre er tilgjengelig på internett og ikke intranett .
Dermed er det nærmest umulig for å sjekke hvilke prosedyrer sykehuset bruker , med mindre pasienten spør .
- Hvordan kan pasientene være sikre på at behandlingen de får på sykehuset er bra nok ?
- Jeg ville bedt om å se hvilken felles prosedyre foretaket benytter .
Det er også lurt å spørre om hvilken måte prosedyren er laget på , og om er den er basert på en skikkelig gjennomgang av litteraturen , eller er skrevet av en lege på kveldsvakt , sier Eiring .

- Ser forbedringspotensial
Etter at undersøkelsen ble gjort i juni og juli i fjor har Sykehuset Innlandet begynt å legge sine fagprosedyrer på internett .
Sykehuset leder også et nasjonalt prosjekt for å gjøre systemene mer brukervennlige .
VG Nett har også tidligere skrevet om mangelen på datarutiner ved norske sykehus .
Ifølge viseadministrerende direktør Hans - Iver Børresen ved Sykehuset Innlandet er dataproblemet todelt .
- Vi ser et forbedringspotensial både på innholdssiden i form av bedre rutiner for kvalitetssikring av innholdet , og på tilgjenglighet for brukerne av systemet .
Vi jobber med å presentere fagprosedyrer på en bedre måte .
Det skjer gjennom å forbedre eksisterende program og ved å utvikle nye verktøy for presentasjon av fagkunnskap , sier Børresen .
Nasjonale retningslinjer
President i Legeforeningen , Torunn Janbu , sier fagmiljøene jobber med å få på plass flere nasjonale retningslinjer .
- Når det gjelder de rent praktiske prosedyrene kan det være variasjoner , men de faglige retningslinjene skal være slik at man som pasient opplever mest mulig lik behandling , selv om det kan være forskjeller fra et lite sykehus til et stort sykehus og så videre , sier Janbu til VG Nett .
USA : Forskere slakter datasystemene på sykehus
Det totale antall fagprosedyrer som er avdekket i undersøkelsen er ifølge Eiring i underkant av 46.000 , men man antar at det reelle tallet ligger et stykke over 50.000 , siden ikke alle landets helseforetak har svart .

After controlling for other variables , scientists concluded that the change resulted largely from the increase in carbon dioxide , a major factor in climate change .
Image Forests along the Eastern Seaboard are responding to increasing carbon dioxide levels .

Trees are now known to play a vital role in countering global warming because they absorb and store carbon dioxide , the leading heat - trapping gas .
Geoffrey G. Parker , a co-author of the paper and an ecologist with the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater , Md. , said his research indicated that the local forests were adapting to the rise in carbon dioxide by absorbing more .
“ My guess is that they are already sopping up some of the extra carbon , ” he said .
But Dr. Parker said it was unclear whether the trend could be sustained .
“ We do n’t think this can persist for too long because other limiting factors will come into play , like water availability and soil nutrients , ” he said .
Since 1987 , Dr. Parker has been studying 55 stands of trees along the bay ’s western edge .
Recent censuses have shown that compared with the earlier years , the trees are packing on weight at an additional two tons per acre annually .
The scientists track the speed of growth through tree diameter .

link Mehndi Inspired Spice Cookies By Heather Baird Monday , February 15 , 2010 Monday , February 15 , 2010 Mehndi Inspired Spice Cookies Recipe ByPublished :
In mid 2009 , my oldest and very dear friend told me she was having " one of those years " .
You know the kind .
Your car starts making a noise , you find out you will be having surgery , the person installing the insulation in your attic falls through the ceiling and into your bedroom ... that kind of a year .
Unfortunately , it seems the same turbulence has spilled over into 2010 .
She 's certainly aware that matters could be worse , but still , it just seems she 's due for some better luck .
I figure she 's at least due some delicious cookies !
I wanted to make something fun and personal , yet artful and representative of good fortune .
Ann is a talented artist with an extensive background in print making .
Early in our friendship , we both were intrigued by the beauty of Mehndi design .
We even had a Mehndi / henna decorating party of our own .
The idea came to me that I should do a Mehndi inspired cookie for her .
With our busy lives , we may not have the time to practice this intricate art form , but we can reminisce about it over some delicious spiced roll - out cookies .
I found this recipe at Epicurious.com and it is so delicious , not to mention the perfect canvas for this project .
I was intrigued by the use of ground mustard in the dough .
I did n't know what to expect flavor wise , but found that you really can't taste it at all .
It enhances the other spices in the dough , which are too numerous to mention here .
( see recipe ) After making your dough , you 'll divide it into two balls and roll out each between sheets of parchment .
It will need to chill thoroughly , and I would suggest overnight .
I made my own hand template .
I did n't have a hand cookie cutter , ( although they are available ) so I traced my own hand on a piece of heavy watercolor paper and cut it out .
It worked great !
I 'd say cardboard or poster board would work well also .
After rolling the dough a little thinner , lay the template on the dough and cut around it with a sharp knife .
Set the template aside .
Transfer hand (s ) to parchment lined cookie sheet .
With the back of your knife make lines between the fingers , being careful not to cut all the way through .
After baking the cookies , you 're ready for embellishment !
I used a fine - tipped artist 's brush and a little brown / black gel food coloring .
You could also use the Wilton 's Food Writer in black or brown .
If you feel intimidated about painting the seemingly intricate patterns , I 'd suggest starting small , in the middle of the " palm " and work your way out .
Most Mehndi designs are very organic , and easy enough to free - hand , or you can just leave the design to your imagination .
If you need additional help with design , there are multiple resources online if you search for " Mehndi " .
Here are some examples from a template that came with a kit I had years ago .
I can't believe I still have it !
Some designs have specific meanings , but I did n't decorate my cookies upon that premise .
I did use the lotus design , because I found it visually pleasing .
The meaning has something do to with rising from the bottom of the pond , from the mud and muck .
That may be appropriate , yes ?
Even if Mehndi hands are not in your cookie - making future , I 'd suggest giving this unusual but very delicious spicy cookie a try - in whatever shape pleases you most !
Love , ( and good fortune ! ) P.S. I have no formal education in official Mehndi practices , I only know that it 's really pretty .*** These featured on FOODWHIRL , also on Craftzine !
The Malawi authorities have told gay activists who put up posters and distribute leaflets on the streets anonymously to " come out in the open " .
Government official Kingsley Namakhwa said it was against the law to mount such campaigns anonymously .
But he also pointed out that homosexuality was illegal , and anyone promoting it would be prosecuted .
Rights groups have recently criticised Malawi for prosecuting two men who got engaged to each other .
Tiwonge Chimbalanga and Steven Monjeza , believed to be the first gay couple in Malawi to start the marriage process , have pleaded not guilty to charges of public indecency .
Their trial is due to start soon .
" As far as the Malawi government is concerned we only have two gays in Malawi - Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga , " said Mr Namakhwa .
" If there are others , let them come out in the open . "
The BBC's Raphael Tenthani , in the main city Blantyre , says the police have intensified the hunt for a man who they believe is behind a gay - rights campaign .
It follows the conviction of a 21 - year - old man for pasting gay - rights posters on poles along the streets .
Peter Sawali had put up posters saying " gay rights are human rights " and was convicted of conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace .
Police say Sawali had been given the posters by another man - whom they are now trying to track down .
Sawali was sentenced to community service for his crime - our correspondent says his punishment is to clean the premises of Blantyre Magistrates Court for 60 days .
Toyota Motor Corp. said Monday that its preliminary investigation into a runaway Prius incident a week ago resulted in findings “ inconsistent ” with the driver ’s account .
The automaker said at a San Diego news conference that two days of testing failed to reproduce driver James Sikes ’ reportedly stuck accelerator , leading to a nearly 30 - minute ride on Interstate 8 before he could get the car stopped .
FOR THE RECORD :
Toyota incident :
An article in Business on Tuesday described efforts by Toyota Motor Corp. to replicate an incident in which a driver said his Prius accelerated uncontrollably .
The subheadline , “ Toyota says it could n’t make the car involved in last week ’s incident malfunction again , ” erred in using “ again . ”
As the article pointed out , it has not been conclusively determined whether the vehicle had malfunctioned . —
An examination of Sikes ’ car shows that it would have stopped if the driver had stepped aggressively on the brake , said Bob Waltz , the auto company ’s vice president of product quality and service support .
Sikes ’ statements that he hit the brakes hard “ is not consistent ” with the investigation , Waltz said .
But The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , which has also been examining Sikes ’ 2008 Prius , said that testing might not be able to reproduce the incident .
“ We would caution people that our work continues and that we may never know exactly what happened with this car , ” the agency said in a statement .
“ It is rare to recreate these unintended acceleration incidents except in floor mat entrapment cases . ”
The agency also said its testing has not found a cause of the incident .
Sikes has not given interviews since he appeared at two news conferences following the incident .
His attorney , John Gomez , did not respond to requests for comment Monday .
Over the weekend , Gomez said his client was sticking to his story and that a “ ghost - in - the - machine ” type of software failure , if to blame for the incident , would be difficult to reproduce in testing .
Gomez also said Sikes was not planning to sue Toyota .
Toyota executives steered clear of saying that Sikes was not being truth - ful .
“ We have no comment on Mr. Sikes ’ story , ” said Toyota spokesman Mike Michels .
Toyota said Sikes ’ accelerator pedal worked normally in testing , with no interference caused by the floor mat problems that led to 2004 - 09 Priuses being recalled by the automaker in November .
The front brakes on Sikes ’ car were badly worn , with metal rubbing against metal , but Toyota said that even in that condition the car could be stopped .
The company also said that it found no diagnostic trouble codes that should have registered in the Prius ’ power management computer after such an incident , and that the car ’s rear brakes showed normal wear .
Toyota said the push - button power switch on the Prius was working normally and shut off the car during testing .
Rep. Darrell Issa of Vista , the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that has been investigating Toyota , warned Monday against forming premature conclusions based on the testing .
“ Vilifying or making rushed judgments wo n’t ultimately improve the situation and does n’t change the fact that for the better part of a decade , both industry and regulators neglected their responsibilities to put the safety of America ’s drivers first , ” Issa said in a statement .
The congressman sent a member of his staff to observe NHTSA ’s inspection of Sikes ’ Prius last week .
“ There are dozens of reports of unintended acceleration still outstanding , ” Issa said .
“ If there is an unknown or unreported mechanical and electrical issue , the subsequent investigations into other cases might produce a pattern that can explain what went wrong and why . ”

Anyone who wants to have a serious discussion dinner - table type about climate change with someone who doubts anthropogenic climate change should watch these videos .
They are as thorough as YouTube videos can get for a general audience .
These videos will arm you with weapons of knowledge you need top debunk specious claims and have an intelligent discussion rather than political low - information - content argument match ( I understand I write this with some irony on DailyKos , but I hope DK strives to be a reality - based community ) .
Each video is about seven to ten minutes in length .
Video 1 : The basics
This video explains the basic science and the current scientific theory of climate change in simple to understand language .
Must see if you are fuzzy on the details .
Video 2 : The ( lessening ) scientific debate about anthropogenic climate change
This video deals with the scientific objections to anthropogenic climate change , from scientists ( keyword anthropogenic , as no real scientists doubt the climate is changing ) .
It 's quite objective in its analysis of the competing theories / models .
Video 3 : The myth of 1970s global cooling
Now we get into the meat of things .
This is the first " debunking " video , and it debunks various claims by people like George Will and others that keep repeating the lie that scientists thought in the 1970s the Earth was cooling / entering an ice age .
Video 4 : Urban myths on climate change
This video deals with Al Gore and Martin Durkin ( maker of the counter - documentary to the Inconvenient Truth ) .
Video 5 : The myth of natural variations
Must see .
This video debunks many of the claims by various climate change skeptics that climate change is " natural " .
It goes into more detail about the factors effecting climate , like solar output , and how it was played a part in the past climate of the Earth .
Video 6 : Climategate # 1
Video 7 : Climategate # 2
These videos are also a must see if you need to see a good debunking of climategate .
Video 6 details with the so - called conspiracy and right - wing hysteria over these emails , while video 7 deals with the science content / process and " suppressing opposing viewpoints " .
Video 8 and 8a : The Earth is cooling ( now ) debunked
This video debunks the stuff James Inhoufe , among others ( e.g. FOX news ) have been recently been repeating that the Earth is now cooling ( in the last 15 years or so ) .

I 'd like to conclude this by diary by with simple two words : fucking finally .
This happens to be one of those rare instances where the benefit of hindsight does not make me regret something said flippantly on a panel .
I deeply believe that in order to truly change the world we cannot simply " throw analytics at the problem . "
To that end , the medical and health industries are perhaps the most primed to be disrupted by data and analytics .
To be successful , however , a deep respect for both the methodological and clinical contexts of the data are required .
It is incredibly exciting to be at an organization that is both working within the current framework of health care and data to create new insight for people , but also pushing the envelope with respect to individuals ' relationships with their own health .
The challenges are technical , sociological , and political ; but the potential for innovation that exists in this space comes along very rarely .
I feel lucky to have an opportunity to move into the health data space now .
Sensor data
The past decade of development in " big data " has -- in large part -- been built on top of the need to understand web logs files .
Somewhere between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 people began to realize that there was a tremendous amount of underutilized value in these logs files .
This spawned an entire big data ecosystem , and a whole new set of hardware and software tools to support it .
Arguably , data science as a discipline and profession was also an offspring of this movement .
We have built technology and algorithms to understand the Web , and we have done a great job .
Innovation in this space , however , is now focused on further abstracting away the technical detail in order to deliver analysis further up the business ladder .
That is to say , we have by and large solved the web logs files big data problem , and are now trying to make it easier for everyone to participate .
But , we have only just begun to even conceive of the scope for the sensor network big data problem .
I believe the next decade of exciting work for data scientists and engineers will be in creating an ecosystem around sensor data .
By liberating the in - bound bytes from the Web , we have at once an entire new class of questions that can be asked , and a new class of hardware and software problems that must be solved .
This is particularly relevant to those considering starting a career , or making a pivot , into the data industry .
Strength of team
In my time at IA Ventures I have learned an enormous amount about the dynamics of technology startups , and what can contribute to their success .
While this will not surprise those with startup experience , it bears repeating that the strength of startup 's team is at least as important as the strength of its technology .
At Project Florida , the team that has been pulled together -- and continues to be assembled -- is one of the strongest I have ever seen .
For those considering other opportunities , I would strongly recommend considering the people you will be working with just as much as problem you will be working on .
Of course , I would be remiss to conclude without giving a plug to make the Project Florida team even stronger .
I will be looking to add folks to the data team immediately , and we are looking to grow the whole organization .
If interested , please feel free to reach out to me directly about opportunities on the data team , or ping WeAre@projectfla.com for information about opportunities throughout the organization .
Here 's to the next adventure !
Drastic action has been meted on four top Pakistan players
Pakistan duo Mohammad Yousuf and Younus Khan have been banned indefinitely from representing their country .
The Pakistan Cricket Board 's inquiry into the tour of Australia found the pair had been involved in " infighting which ... brought down the whole team " .
Rana Naved - ul - Hasan and Shoaib Malik each face one - year bans and big fines .
Shahid Afridi , Kamran Akmal and Umar Akmal also face heavy fines while their conduct will be strictly monitored during a six - month probationary period .
Recent captains Yousuf and Younus , the two most experienced batsmen in the sides , face the most serious sanctions .
When one was captain he threw the other man out , when the other was captain he threw the other out when he would have been selected
PCB chairman Ijaz Butt
At 35 and 32 respectively they may now have played their last international cricket - though the PCB later stated their bans were not intended for life .
" As and when the PCB deems appropriate , these players will be considered for selection for the national team , " it said .
PCB chairman Ijaz Butt told BBC World Service : " When one was captain he threw the other man out , when the other was captain he threw the other out when he would have been selected .
There are many other instances that have happened . "
The PCB has implemented the recommendations of an inquiry committee formed to evaluate Pakistan 's dismal performance against Australia during the winter , when they lost all nine internationals .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Pakistan must now try to defend their ICC World Twenty20 crown in the Caribbean next month with severely depleted resources , particularly among the batsmen , before facing what could be a chastening tour of England .
But the PCB was unrepentant , saying in a statement : " This will go a long way to arrest the continuing decline of Pakistan cricket and improve the state of cricket in Pakistan . "
The inquiry , which also covered the Afridi " ball - biting " incident in Perth , detailed its sanctions against the seven players in an e-mail issued from its Lahore offices .
606 : DEBATE
It 's a great shame that we will never see Younus and Yousuf playing Test cricket again if the PCB are to be believed
Liam
It said it had passed judgement " after careful and detailed analysis of the events , the personal accounts of the team management and players and examination of record , videos and statistics " .
The unanimous recommendations of the committee were as follows : • Mohammad Yousuf and Younus Khan - keeping in view their infighting which resulted in bringing down the whole team , their attitude has a trickledown effect which is a bad influence for the whole team should not be part of national team in any format .
•
For the shameful act of Shahid Afridi , which has brought the game and country into disrepute , he be fined Rs3 m ( £ 23,800 ) .
A warning be issued to him by the chairman of the PCB and he be put on probation for six months , during which his conduct be strictly monitored .
• Kamran Akmal be fined Rs3 m ( £ 23,800 ) .
A warning be issued to him by the chairman of the PCB and he be put on probation for six months , during which his conduct be strictly monitored .
• Umar Akmal be fined Rs2 m ( £ 15,900 ) .
A warning be issued to him by the chairman of the PCB and he be put on probation for six months , during which his conduct be strictly monitored .
• Rana Naved - ul - Hasan and Shoaib Malik be fined Rs2 m ( £ 15,900 ) .
They should not be part of a national team in any format for a period of one year .
A DAMAGING BLOW
The four banned players are extremely important members of Pakistan 's side Yousuf has 24 Test centuries to his name and , at 35 , is one of the most feared batsmen in international cricket Younus , a 32 - year - old right - hander , has a Test batting average in excess of 50 Rana Naved is a fast bowler of 32 with a fine record in ODIs and Twenty20 internationals Malik is the team 's principal all - rounder , combining stylish batting with economical off - spin .
He is 28 One PCB official later clarified the terms of the bans .
Taffazul Rizvi , the board 's legal advisor , told Cricinfo : " They will not be part of any Pakistan team in any format from here on ...
They can play domestic cricket or county cricket here and abroad . "
Younus stepped down from the captaincy twice last year , with reports of player unrest about his style of leadership liberally strewn across the media .
Yousuf , the third - highest run scorer in Pakistan Test history , led a winless tour to Australia before falling out publicly with Twenty20 skipper Malik .
The PCB has not expanded upon the cases of indiscipline that have led to the bans on Malik , 28 , and Rana Naved , 32 .
However , the cases of the Akmal brothers and Shahid Afridi are more clear - cut .
The Akmals were fined for their behaviour after the Sydney Test .
Wicketkeeper Kamran , 28 , insisted publicly he would be selected in the run-up to the third Test after being dropped from the side .
Younger brother Umar , 19 , was alleged to have feigned an injury to skip the Test in protest , though he did eventually play .
Afridi , 30 , was punished for the bizarre incident in the Perth one - day international , when as a stand - in captain of the side , he bit the ball in a novel approach to the banned art of ball - tampering .
He has served a two - match ICC ban for the indiscretion .
I want to know what I did wrong .
I will be consulting with my people before deciding a future line of action
Rana Naved Attention will inevitably switch to how the players will respond , with legal action likely to be around the corner .
The early indications were that one of them , fast bowler Rana Naved , would appeal .
" I want to know what I did wrong , " he said .
" I will be consulting with my people before deciding a future line of action . "
Rashid Latif , another former captain , expected those most harshly treated to win their cases .
" You can't hand out such severe punishments to players of the calibre of Yousuf and Younus Khan , " Latif said .
Inzamam - ul - Haq , yet another former captain and no stranger to controversy himself , was also scathing of the decision .
" Why was action not taken earlier against these players ? " he asked .
" Why did the board keep quiet for so long when the team was on tour ? "
The decisions mean Pakistan will be bringing a hugely inexperienced side to England for their three - month summer tour , which features two Tests against Australia , four against Andrew Strauss 's men and a string of one - day and Twenty20 internationals .
But the England and Wales Cricket Board ( ECB ) say they do not believe the absence of star names will have a negative effect on attendances .
ECB spokesman Andrew Walpole told BBC Sport : " We will continue to monitor the situation but we remain confident that the Pakistan team will continue to generate huge support this summer . "

Eric Felisbret stood by a chain - link fence , watching three men spraying graffiti on a backyard wall in Upper Manhattan .
One man smiled and invited him over .
“ You can go around the corner and when you see a sign for a seamstress , go in the alley , ” the man said .
“ Or you can jump the fence , like we did . ”
Mr. Felisbret , 46 , chose the long way .
Not that he is unused to fence - jumping .
In the 1970s , that was one of his skills as a budding graffiti writer who stole into subway yards .
Using the nom de graf DEAL , he was part of the Crazy Inside Artists , a legendary crew from East New York , Brooklyn .
This time , though , instead of wielding a spray can , he pulled out a camera and took a quick snapshot of the artwork , done with the landlord ’s permission .
“ It ’s really retro , ” he said .
“ Look inside the 3D letters , how he added all those spots . ”
He would know , and not just because the artist was his brother , Luke .
Over some 30 years , the two men have amassed a photographic archive of New York City graffiti that is among the most comprehensive collections anywhere .
Since 1998 much of it , along with interviews of artists , has been showcased on their Web site , www.at149st.com.
The reality is that most game reviewers get paid like crap if at all and they end up selling their review copies to local pawn shops to buy bread .

It ’s the start of what what will be a very rainy Monday ( and Tuesday , and Wednesday … ) here , but it ’s all good because it ’s a holiday week .
Happy Passover to those of you who celebrate , and an early Happy Easter to those who will be celebrating the upcoming Good Friday and Easter Sunday !
I thought I ’d start off the week with these wonderfully original letterpress dice prints from Stukenborg , which kind of blow my mind .
Each pattern is built by laying dice , one by one , on the bed of the letterpress and rolling ink directly onto the face of the dice for each impression :
And here are some of the final prints .
It ’s amazing how many different patterns can be made with the dice :

Software development is no longer bound by time zones or national borders .
Projects of all kinds — academic , commercial , and open source — may have their GUI designers in Boston , their database team in Bangalore , and their testers in Budapest and Buenos Aires .
Working effectively in such teams is challenging : it requires strong communication skills , and makes proper use of coordination tools such as version control and ticketing systems more important than ever .
But it is also an opportunity for students to build ties with peers across the country and around the world , and for instructors to breathe new life into old courses .
Since September 2008 , undergraduates from several universities in Canada and the US have been taking part in joint capstone projects in order to learn first - hand what distributed development is like .
Each team has students from two or three schools , and uses a mix of agile and open source processes under the supervision of a faculty or industry lead .
This FAQ describes the program ’s current incarnation ; if you have other questions , please contact Greg Wilson .
What are the learning objectives of this program ?
For students to gain hands - on experience with real - world development practices in a realistic environment while simultaneously learning and applying some core concepts of computer science .
Is this part of an official university or government program ?
Not yet — we are still in the pilot phase ( which is a professor ’s way of saying , “ We ’re still learning how to do this . ” ) .
Who is sponsoring this ?
Our sponsors page describes and thanks the companies and organizations that have helped to make this program possible .
What projects are available ?
Our project list for Winter 2010 is available on the Projects page .
Who can enrol ?
Undergraduates who are in their final four terms of study , have a strong ‘ B ’ or ‘ A ’ average , and are able to enrol in an appropriate course at their home institution .
( Typically , this course is called a capstone , a senior project , or a directed studies course . )
To ensure balance , we limit the number of students per school ; please contact your local faculty for details .
What schools are taking part ?
The following schools are confirmed for the Winter 2010 term :
See the Fall 2009 page for a list of schools that took part in that term .
Can I still take part if my school is not in this list ?
Sure , if you can persuade a faculty member at your school — please have them contact Greg Wilson for more information .
Can I take part more than once ?
Sure , if you can persuade a faculty member at your school .
If you do come back , you can either stay with the same project or move to a new one .
Who chooses what projects students work on ?
The students themselves , on a first - come , first - served basis .
We try to make sure that each team has roughly six students drawn from at least three universities .
We also try to have at least two students from any university on any one project so that everyone will have a local partner .
How are tasks within a project allocated ?
This varies from team to team .
In general , though , there ’s enough work for everyone to spend most of their time working on something they find interesting .
What skills do students need ?
The programming skills required vary widely from project to project : students are more likely to succeed in a Java - based project if they already speak Java , and more likely to do well on a cellphone project if they have some previous experience with handheld devices or wireless networks .
Students should also be familiar with , or willing to learn , version control , bug tracking , and other coordination tools .
Keep in mind , though , that being able to set their own goals , manage their own time , and communicate with others is at least as important as knowing any particular programming language or operating system .
What do students find challenging about these projects ?
Cooperation , communication , and commitment .
For many students , this is the first time they have had to set their own goals and deadlines , and some struggle with that freedom during the first few weeks .
What are the benefits to the students ?
Experience working in a distributed team on a meaningful project ; peer contacts ( social / professional networking ) ; something cool to demo in interviews for jobs and graduate school .
Do potential employers and graduate supervisors actually look at these projects ?
Yes .
When do projects start and finish ?
Projects start at the beginning of term ( September or January ) , and run to its end ( December or April ) .
Because different schools calendars ’ do n’t line up , some students may start or finish earlier or later than others .
We do not currently accommodate students whose schools use a quarter system , and have no plans to run this program during the summer .
How much effort is expected from students ?
The same as any other course , i.e. , about 8 - 10 hours / week .
Can I do this course at the same time as a co-op job or other industry placement ?
Only if your school ’s policy permits it , and even then , only if you can commit 8 - 10 hours / week .
How are projects managed ?
The organizers take care of week - by - week project management , though other faculty are very welcome to get involved as well .
How are projects graded ?
Grades are awarded jointly by the local faculty organizer in consultation with the project lead .
Grading schemes are tailored to individual teams and projects , and take into account the requirements of the courses in which students are officially registered .
( For example , a student who is registered in a senior course on Software Architecture may spend more time on design and documentation than on coding . )
In many projects , students themselves propose grading schemes once they are familiar with the project .
There is usually not a midterm or final exam , but some schools require students to do an end - of - term presentation and / or create a screencast to show what they have accomplished .
What development process do teams use ?
Standard software development processes are not well - suited to students ’ realities : unlike professionals in industry , students usually have to work on several projects at once , and are almost always new to the technologies they ’re using and the problem domain they ’re working in .
Based on past experience , the best fit is a mix of open source practices and Scrum :
Every project keeps its work in a version control repository , uses tickets to track work items , etc .
Teams are strongly encouraged to do code reviews .
Each team has an hour - long online meeting each week to review progress , set goals , answer questions , and resolve outstanding issues .
Work is usually done in two - week iterations .
At the end of each iteration , each team member sets their goals for the next one , so that students have a chance to develop planning and estimation skills .
Each team is required to produce a five - minute screencast demo of their work at the end of the term .
What kind of work do students do ?
All the things that real software projects need , including design , construction , testing , packaging , and documentation .
Do teams get to meet each other and their project leads ?
Yes — there is a three - day code sprint in Toronto near the start of term at which teams meet in person to discuss the strategies for the term , attend team - building social events , and write lots of code .
How do team members communicate ?
Via the usual online tools , such as blogs , chat , mailing lists , and Skype .
Team members may agree on something else new and trendy , such as FriendFeed , Twitter , or Google Wave .
What level of work is expected ?
( Almost ) all of these projects are producting software for real - world use , so standards are high .
Remember , “ 95 % correct ” may be an ‘ A ’ academically , but if 5 % of an application is buggy , users are n’t going to be happy .
Do the projects vary from term to term ?
Yes , although we try to keep projects rolling for several terms to reduce startup overheads .
Do students get help from students who have worked on the same project in previous terms ?
Yes , where possible .
Unlike most university courses , we strongly encourage students to communicate with each other and their predecessors .
How do code reviews work ?
Students post finished work ( including tests ) to their team ’s code review site .
Another team member then reads it through and gives the author on what needs to be fixed before it can be committed .
Once the author has made all the fixes suggested , and the reviewer gives the ok , the code is put into the version control repository for others to use .
How can I find out more ?
Please contact Greg Wilson or the organizer at your university for more details .

CHARLOTTE , N.C. --
The Carolina Panthers cut Jake Delhomme late Thursday , just over a year after they gave him a lucrative contract extension only to watch him have his worst season as a pro .
Delhomme's agent , Rick Smith , confirmed the move and said Delhomme would wait until Friday to talk to reporters .
It signals the Panthers intend to go with Matt Moore or someone new at quarterback for the first time since Delhomme burst onto the scene in 2003 and led Carolina to the Super Bowl .
General manager Marty Hurney did n't respond to numerous messages seeking comment .
The Panthers also released veteran defensive tackle Damione Lewis on Thursday in a move that saves $ 5 million in payroll and further depletes the defensive line and sheds even more payroll after the decision not to place the franchise tag on defensive end Julius Peppers .
Cutting Delhomme , however , is a major about - face for the organization .
Despite committing six turnovers in a playoff loss to Arizona to end the 2008 season , Hurney and coach John Fox were so committed to Delhomme they gave him a new deal in which he 's still owed more than $ 12.5 million in guaranteed money .
Delhomme had no legitimate competition in training camp , but then had a miserable 2009 season .
After throwing a career - high 18 interceptions , Delhomme was sidelined with a broken finger .
Moore came on and had eight touchdown passes and only two interceptions as Carolina won four of its final five games .
The Panthers on Wednesday gave him the highest restricted free - agent tender of $ 3.043 million for one season .
Now the 35 - year - old Delhomme is out of work , ending his career in Carolina with a 58 - 40 record as a starter that included a trip to the Super Bowl and an appearance in the NFC championship game after the 2005 season .
Delhomme holds almost every team passing record , but cutting him in a season without a salary cap will save some of the hit his contract will have in future years should the cap return .
Finances also played a decision for Lewis , who was let go a week after the Panthers sided against giving Peppers more than $ 20 million with the franchise tag .
" My cap number was a little high , about $ 5 million .
Anything can happen in that situation , " Lewis said .
" With all of this stuff going with the CBA , I tried to be realistic .
But I thought it was possible . "
The 32 - year - old Lewis had 41 tackles and a half sack in 16 starts last season as he played with numerous other tackles in Carolina 's banged - up line .
Lewis had 48 tackles and 3 ½ sacks in 2008 , the first year he replaced Kris Jenkins as a starter .
Lewis was signed to a contract extension before the 2008 season , but the deal was restructured last offseason to clear salary - cap space .
There was a clause that called for the contract to revert to its old terms if a large bonus was n't paid this spring .
Lewis would have been due $ 4 million this season and a $ 1 million roster bonus .
" Coach Fox said it was more of an economic deal .
He said it was n't about the way I played , " Lewis said .
" I feel like I had a good season .
The only thing I did n't do was that my sack numbers were down . "
The move leaves Carolina with no starters from the line that ended last season .
Peppers , Tyler Brayton and Hollis Thomas are unrestricted free agents .
It points to Carolina turning to young players despite there being no salary cap next season in the final year of the collective bargaining agreement .
The Panthers offered tenders to restricted free agents Louis Leonard and Tank Tyler on Wednesday , and signed fellow defensive tackle Ed Johnson last month .
They also have high hopes for defensive ends Everette Brown and Charles Johnson .
The Panthers will also likely need to sign or draft a quarterback to pair with Moore .
The Panthers will also likely need to sign or draft a quarterback to go with Moore .
But while Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick said on an Atlanta radio station this week that he'd like to play for the Panthers , the team never considered him before last season .
Owner Jerry Richardson has shied away from acquiring players with a history of off - field trouble .

Disaster Relief by the Numbers
The earthquake in Haiti may be one of the world ’s most tragic disasters , but the rapid response and financial munificence across the globe has shown us the best of humanity .
Still , looking closely at the numbers reveals some unexpected trends .
For example , while the United States has been the world ’s most generous donor with over $ 466 million in aid , it only ranks eighth when broken down per capita .
In reality , the Scandinavian countries , as well as Canada , have been the most generous in their giving .
We ’ve also gathered data on corporate giving , and to understand just how generous each company is , we ’ve ranked them based on what percentage of their annual revenue they are donating — most of which are less than 0.002 % .
As for celebrities , Leonardo DiCaprio gave the most of his net worth , $ 1 million ( or 2.3 % ) , while Tiger Woods , probably looking to save some face , donated the most of any celebrity with $ 3 million .

Mexico City , Mexico ( CNN ) --
Five gay and lesbian couples were married in Mexico City on Thursday , the first such ceremonies since a law went into effect this month legalizing same - sex marriage in the Mexican capital .
Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard was on hand to witness four of the five couples signing their marriage certificates at the end of a 20 - minute ceremony , Mexico 's official news agency reported .
A fifth couple , flying in from another state to take advantage of the new measure , arrived late and was married after the others .
Civil registry judges in Mexico City attended special training sessions in February in advance of the new law .
" Today is a historic day , " Civil Registry Judge Hegel Cortes said at Thursday 's ceremony , according to the Notimex news agency .
" It solidifies the evolution of one of the most important rights . "
Although same - sex ceremonies are only legally performed in Mexico City , the marriages themselves are recognized anywhere in the country .
The couples were married amid applause , laughter and kisses at the old city hall building , Notimex reported .
Local authorities gave each couple an arrangement of flowers .
The Mexican measure also allows same - sex couples to adopt children and comes amid the beginning of wider acceptance for same - sex unions in Latin America .
Never mind three strikes and you 're out .
How about three strikes and I 'm not even thinking about checking in to your hotel ?
Granted , even the most security - conscious of companies can be victimized by hackers , but when you 've had to cop to a third data breach in less than a year you 'll have to forgive prospective customers for looking elsewhere for shelter .
Or paying in cash .
From IDG
News Service story on our site detailing the most recent episode :
Hackers were able to steal data required for credit card fraud , the company said , including " guest names and card numbers , expiration dates and other data from the card 's magnetic stripe . "
Wyndham did not say how many ( of its ) hotels were hacked or how many customers were affected .
The company did not return messages seeking comment Friday .
This is the third data breach reported by Wyndham in the past year .
The Wyndham Hotels chain includes such familiar names as Ramada , Days Inn , Super8 , Howard Johnson and Tavelodge .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
Here 's a snippet of the boilerplate - filled mea culpa posted to the Wyndham site :
In addition to ensuring that the hack was immediately terminated and disabled , we promptly retained a qualified investigator to assess the problem and ensure that we had isolated it , and then to help us implement the proper changes to strengthen and improve the security of our connections with each of our WHR branded properties .
Further , the impacted properties are being separately investigated by a qualified PCI investigative firm to assess and improve the security at each hotel property in the system .
Good ideas all , but they would have been even better ideas had they occurred and been implemented effectively after the breach Wyndham acknowledged last August .
And they'd have been a model of corporate responsibility had they blossomed after the first of the three breaches , which was revealed to the public six months earlier .
Do I judge Wyndham too harshly ?
I asked Kelly Todd , a project manager for DataLossDB , which tracks and compiles information about data breaches .
Todd 's reply :
" Personally , I 'd try my best to avoid using any business that suffered multiple breaches in a relatively short time frame .
For instance , if you swipe your credit card through an ATM that gets a skimmer attached to it three times in a year , it might be time to switch ATMs .
I do n't see why trusting a hotel chain -- or any business for that matter -- with credit card information should be different . "
So here 's the question I 've sent to a pair of Wyndham public relations executives : " Given that this was the third such incident involving Wyndham in the past year alone , why would n't a prudent business traveler or vacationer be well advised to avoid Wyndham hotels rather than risk being a victim of the next such incident ? "
I 'll let you know what they have to say .
( Update , Friday , March 5 : Here is Wyndham 's reply :
" While no data security policy can guarantee that unauthorized data access will not happen in the future , we continuously upgrade , evaluate and monitor our systems to protect customers .
The ( latest ) computer security incident occurred while Wyndham was in the process of completely upgrading the information security specifications for all the Wyndham - branded hotels .
In addition to ensuring that the hack was quickly isolated and contained , we revalidated our information security infrastructure and ensured that we maintain industry standard protections for customer data . " )

Before listening to the explanation for this project , I could n't figure out what was going on , but once I realized that the 64 flashing squares on the Arduino - powered display would let me play Mario , it was time to get supplies .
Designed by a student from Carnegie Mellon University , this has got to be one of the simplest versions of Super Mario Bros I 've ever seen — heck , it 's simpler than the game I played on my TI - 89 — but it 's absolutely awesome looking and comes complete with the theme music .

Oracle ( ORCL ) said this morning that it has received unconditional regulatory approval from the European Commission for its acquisition of Sun ( JAVA ) .
Below , the all - hands memo Sun CEO Jon Schwartz sent to employees following the announcement .
Pay particular attention to the first letter of the first 7 paragraphs …
Believe it or not , it ’s been more than nine months since Oracle first announced their intent to acquire Sun in April , 2009 .
And the ‘ interim ’ period has been tough on everyone–on our employees , and our partners and customers .
Thankfully , that interim period is coming to an end , with regulatory approval from the European Union issued today , and only a few hurdles remaining –before Oracle formally expands beyond software to become the world ’s most important systems company .
Even though we ’re not quite across the finish line , I wanted to leave you with a few final thoughts .
All in all , it ’s been an honor and privilege to work together .
In my more than twenty years in the industry , the last thirteen at Sun , I ’ve had a chance to work with and around an enormous diversity of companies , from every sector you can imagine .
I can say with conviction that Sun ’s people have always stood apart as the brightest , most passionate , and most inspiring .
I ’ve never had a bad day in my thirteen years for one very basic reason –I ’ve always been surrounded by the best and brightest individuals I ’ve ever come across .
That ’s been an honor and privilege , for which I ’m enormously thankful .
Technology from Sun , alongside our employees and partners , have changed the world .
We ’ve opened markets , elections and economies .
We ’ve helped build the world ’s most important and valuable businesses .
We ’ve played a key role in discovering new drugs , in bringing education and healthcare to those in need , and supplying the world with an incredible spectrum of entertainment , from smartphones to social networking .
I doubt any company has had such a significant influence over the way we see or experience the world .
I once told Scott McNealy he was the Henry Ford of the technology industry , making remarkable innovations accessible to anyone , and creating an immense number of jobs around the globe for those that made use of them .
I ca n’t begin to tell you how proud I am of my association with that cause and the people behind it , and the value we created for ourselves and those that exploited our innovations .
I also know we ’ve had more than our share of very tough challenges .
Amidst the toughest market and customer situations imaginable , I ’m proud we ’ve always acted with integrity , with a sense for what ’s right , and not simply what ’s expedient .
Over the years , I ’ve heard time and again , from those inside and outside the company , “ I like and I trust Sun . ”
Building that good will is something to which you ’ve all contributed .
And you have every right to be very proud of it .
Make no mistake , it ’s been an enormous asset .
So , to the sales and SE teams across the world who continually give their all to bring the numbers home –thank you for the trust you ’ve built with customers , and the results you ’ve delivered .
I hope you ’re prepared to have the wind at your back , you deserve it .
To the service professionals who every day build , maintain and run the world ’s most important data centers –thank you for your excellence and discipline , 7×24 .
To the professionals who run the functions and processes that are the company ’s spinal column –thank you , we ’d be paralyzed without you .
And lastly – to the engineers and marketers who ’ve fostered a perpetual belief that innovation creates its own opportunity – thank you .
You ’re right .
Innovation does create its own opportunity .
Like Oracle , we ’re an engineering company in our heart and soul , our potential together is limitless .
Now many of you know that I came to Sun when a company I helped to found was acquired in 1996 .
I ’ve also led , and been a part of many , many acquisitions at Sun , both large and small .
From those experiences , I ’ve learned one very clear lesson –the single most important driver of a successful acquisition are the people involved–and how committed they are to the new owner ’s mission .
And the most effective mechanism I ’ve seen for driving that commitment begins with a simple , but emotionally difficult step .
Upon change in control , every employee needs to emotionally resign from Sun .
Go home , light a candle , and let go of the expectations and assumptions that defined Sun as a workplace .
Honor and remember them , but let them go .
For those that ultimately wo n’t become a part of Oracle , this will be the first step in a new adventure .
Sun has a tremendous reputation across the planet , well beyond Silicon Valley .
It ’s a great brand to have on your resume .
We ’re known as self - starters , capable of ethically managing through complexity and change , for delivering when called upon , and for inventing and building the future .
With the world economy stabilizing , I ’m very confident you ’ll land on your feet .
You ’re a talented , tenacious group , and there ’s always opportunity for great people .
For those that have roles at Oracle , may you start with a clean slate , ready to take on the myriad opportunities ahead .
With the same passion and tenacity for Oracle ’s success that you ’ve had for Sun’s , and a renewed sense of energy around executing on a far broader mission .
There is no doubt in my mind you , and Oracle , will be remarkably successful , beyond the market ’s wildest expectations .
But it ’s important you come to work thinking , “ Sun is a brand , Oracle ’s my company . ”
Do n’t look for ways to preserve or dwell in “ how we used to do things . ”
Look for ways to help customers , grow the market , and improve Oracle ’s performance .
Sun is a brand , Oracle is your company .
And to that end , with nine months of getting to know them , I ’ve found Oracle to be truly remarkable , led by remarkable people .
From Larry on down , they understand the enormity of the opportunity before them , and they ’re more than prepared to execute on it – across the board .
I ’ve seen their commitment and focus , now they need yours .
I ’m confident you ’ll give it the 10,000 % effort it deserves–and we ’ll all see the end result .
So thank you , again , for the privilege and honor of working together .
The internet ’s made the world a far smaller place–so I ’m sure we ’ll be bumping into one another .
Go Oracle !

An injunction against particle physics is a real possibility ( Image : Sean Gallup / Getty )
COURTS and legal scholars love quoting legal maxims in Latin .
One of the most famous is fiat justitia ruat caelum .
The phrase is a resolute affirmation of the rule of law .
It means “ Let justice be done though the heavens fall ” .
It was intended as hyperbole .
But , ironically , courts may now have to confront these words on literal terms .
In various countries , plaintiffs have sought court orders to halt the operation of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN near Geneva , Switzerland , with the most extraordinary of allegations : …
I recount this story not because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were the main cause of the recent financial crisis — they were only one element — but because it shows the kind of problem we ’ll encounter on a larger scale as we reform oversight of the financial system .
Image Credit ... David G. Klein
We should certainly aim for better financial regulation , especially for institutions with government - insured deposits .
More transparency and more accurate assessment of risks are admirable goals .
Higher capital requirements would be a step in the right direction .
There has been much talk about restricting the use of financial derivatives .
Unfortunately , writing good rules is not easy .
Derivatives , like fire , can lead to disaster if not handled with care , but they can also be used to good effect .
Whatever we do , let ’s not be overoptimistic about how successful improved oversight will be .
The financial system is diverse and vastly complicated .
Government regulators will always be outnumbered and underpaid compared with those whose interest it is to circumvent the regulations .
Legislators will often be distracted by other priorities .
To believe that the government will ever become a reliable watchdog would be a tragic mistake .
So where does this leave us ?
We should plan for future financial crises , to occur at some unknown date for some unknown reason , and arm ourselves with better tools to clean up the mess .
Much focus in Washington has been on expanding the government ’s authority to step in when a financial institution is near bankruptcy , and to fix the problem before the institution creates a systemic risk .
That makes some sense , but creates risks of its own .
If federal authorities are responsible for troubled institutions , creditors may view those institutions as safer than they really are .
When problems arise , regulators may find it hard to avoid using taxpayer money .
The entire financial system might well become , in essence , a group of government - sponsored enterprises .
The U.S. military must use measured and precise strikes , not overwhelming force , in the wars it is likely to face in the future , the nation ’s top uniformed officer said Wednesday in outlining a revised approach to American security .
The view outlined by Adm. Michael G. Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , differs both from the doctrine of overwhelming force advanced by Colin L. Powell , a onetime Joint Chiefs chairman , and the “ shock and awe ” approach of former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld .
FOR THE RECORD :
New warfare :
An article in the March 4 Section A about the U.S. military ’s new approach to warfare incorrectly stated that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff serves as the president ’s chief military advisor under the Constitution .
The position of chairman and its role was created by U.S. law , not the Constitution . —
“ There is no single , defining American way of war , ” Mullen argued .
“ It changes over time , and it should change over time , adapting appropriately to the most relevant threats to our national security . ”
Mullen ’s views , presented in a speech at Kansas State University , mirror the latest U.S. - led offensive in Afghanistan , a showcase effort in which troops in Marja are trying not only to seize control of territory but to obtain influence over the local population in a bid to break the hold of insurgents .
His comments are significant because the Joint Chiefs chairman under the Constitution serves as the president ’s chief military advisor .
Mullen held out Marja as a model of the kind of warfare he was describing .
There , the military announced in advance plans to retake the city and emphasized careful use of force .
“ We did not prep the battlefield with carpet bombing or missile strikes , ” he said .
“ We simply walked in , on time .
Because , frankly , the battlefield is n’t necessarily a field anymore .
It ’s in the minds of the people . ”
The ideas outlined by Mullen are not universally accepted within the military .
For instance , to minimize the risk of civilian casualties , Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , the top commander in Afghanistan , placed restrictions on the use of bombs and other air power .
Some officers and analysts think that those self - imposed restrictions have allowed the Taliban to escape the most effective and potent U.S. weapons , potentially endangering American and allied troops .
In addition , the Marja offensive showed that even deliberate , measured force can produce civilian casualties .
In another shift in thinking , Mullen said in his speech that policymakers now and in the future should consider the U.S. military not as a last - resort solution in a crisis , but as part of early American responses to conflicts and disasters .
“ Military forces are some of the most flexible and adaptable tools available to policymakers , ” Mullen said .
“ Before a shot is even fired , we can bolster a diplomatic argument , support a friend or deter an enemy . ”
Mullen emphasized that military power must be used alongside other government tools .
Similarly , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , speaking at the same venue in 2007 , called for increased spending on the State Department .
“ U.S. foreign policy is still too dominated by the military , ” Mullen said , “ too dependent upon the generals and admirals who lead our major overseas commands and not enough on the State Department . ”
Overall , the speech represents a refinement of military doctrine , reflecting the wrenching policy and strategy review last year over Afghanistan as well as the debates in 2006 concerning strategy in Iraq .
Policy and strategy , Mullen said , must “ constantly struggle with one another . ”
Rather than setting a strategy and stepping aside , political leaders must remain involved .
The day the U.S. stops adjusting is the day the country loses , he said .

Israeli tanks advanced briefly into the Gaza Strip following clashes in which two Israeli soldiers and two Palestinian militants died .
Witnesses in Gaza said tanks and bulldozers moved towards the southern town of Khan Younis before withdrawing .
They also said there had been firing from the Israeli navy along the Gaza coastline .
It is the first time Israeli soldiers have died in Gaza since Israel 's 22 - day offensive there more than a year ago .
Israel says the fighting started when its troops crossed into Gaza after spotting militants planting explosives along the border .
Reports from inside Gaza say the militants then tried to capture an Israeli soldier .
Retaliation
The BBC's Jon Donnison , in the West Bank city of Ramallah , says many inside Gaza will now expect retaliation from Israel to be stepped up following the deaths of the soldiers .
The army said an officer and a conscript died when gunmen fired on a military patrol inside the Gaza Strip .
Two soldiers were injured and two Palestinian fighters killed in the clash , it said .
The two soldiers killed were named by Israel 's Haaretz newspaper as Eliraz Peretz , 31 , and 21 - year - old Ilan Sebiatkovsky .
Army spokeswoman Avital Leibovich described their deaths as " tragic " and " painful " .
" I think it 's true to say that this is one of the fiercest days we have had since operation Cast Lead happened , " she said , referring to the Israeli offensive .
A ceasefire between Israel and Islamist militant group Hamas , which governs Gaza , has largely held since the Israeli offensive .
However , hundreds of rockets have been fired into southern Israel by militants in Gaza .
Hamas 's armed wing - the al - Qassam Brigades - said in a statement sent to the BBC that it had killed the two soldiers .
Speaking to Reuters news agency , Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida is quoted as saying : " This was our work , but was carried out for defence . "
Militants have been holding another Israeli soldier , Gilad Shalit , for more than three years .

IS the party about to fade for R- rated movie trailers ?
Over the last two years , movie marketers have flooded the Web with R - rated video ads known as “ red band ” trailers .
While most trailers are approved for broad audiences , the red - band variety typically features profanity , nudity or other material deemed inappropriate for children .
A new one for “ Get Him to the Greek , ” a forthcoming comedy from Universal Pictures , depicts actors romping with a sex toy and an explicit sequence involving the smuggling of drugs in a body cavity .
You are supposed to be 17 or older to watch an R - rated trailer , and most theaters refuse to run them .
But the Web has proved extremely hospitable to them despite a difficult - to - enforce industry rule that restricts their release to sites that use age - verification tests .
From 2000 to 2006 , studios released a total of about 30 of these trailers , according to industry estimates .
Last year , the studios released 76 .
Movie marketers love red - band trailers because their titillating content is catnip for young consumers — the precise audience they try hardest to reach .
Web sites like MySpace have welcomed them because they drive traffic and leave an aura of cool .
And studios are trying to persuade more mainstream sites , like Apple ’s iTunes , to lift a ban on red band trailers .
Actor Corey Haim died this morning of an apparent overdose -- possibly accidental -- according to LAPD .
He was 38 .
Police tell us they were called to St. Joseph 's hospital in Burbank , CA shortly before 4 AM PT to investigate .
Haim shot to fame in the 80s -- when he co-starred in a number of films , including " The Lost Boys " with Corey Feldman .
Haim reportedly suffered a drug - induced stroke in 2001 and was rushed to UCLA Medical Center .
Haim also reportedly was in and out of rehab 15 times , but cleaned up in 2004 after moving to Toronto .
Michał ( the lead K3b developer ) is busy preparing K3 b 2.0 for release .
However we have some rough plans how to proceed after that release .
I ’d like to share them with you .
Keep in mind that Michał is currently pretty much the only developer ( I ’m just a translator who occasionally lends a hand on janitorial work if within my capabilities ) , so in the end it depends on the amount of time and work he can put into K3 b whether it even happens like this .
Support of KDE Plasma ’s global progress bar and removal of K3 b ’s own progress OSD .
This is not a crucial feature for 2.0 and according to Michał actually requires a higher amount of work one might think .

Support for writing Flash Drive images .
With CD drive - less netbooks on the rise and the announcement of KDE ’s Plasma Netbook Reference Platform , K3 b 2.1 may support USB Flash Drives as target medium .
So instead of cryptic dd if =Plasma - Netbook - Reference.i686-0.1.0-*.raw of=/dev/sdX commands , hopefully 2.1 will do the same with two mouse clicks . 🙂

Three of the most used Linux distributions ( Fedora , Kubuntu , and Mandriva ) have a fixed 6 - months release cycle with releases every spring and fall .
To reduce the amount of incoming bug reports for “ old ” K3b versions , we hope to release new versions in time before those distributions ’ feature freeze .
Maybe ( only maybe ) releases will happen more often than that , but do n’t expect a brand new K3b version three weeks after a Fedora / Kubuntu / Mandriva release .
And maybe ( again : only maybe ) K3 b 2.1 will be released along with KDE SC 4.5 , because of the already mentioned Netbook Reference Platform that should have its first stable release with SC 4.5 .
That ’s it for now from K3b .
And now I ’d like to advertise one of my favorite bands : Van Canto 🙂

Picture a gamer , someone who spends countless hours immersed in one of those online role - playing alternate realities .
And what do you see ?
Is it a physically fit female closer to 40 than 14 ?
If not , you may need to rethink your assumptions about geekdom .
Because a study in the Journal of Communication shows that when it comes to dominating the virtual world , women are actually more hardcore than men .
Scientists conducted a survey of some 7,000 players who were logged on to a game called EverQuest II .
And they discovered some interesting things .
First off , the average age of the gamers surveyed was 31 .
And that playing time tended to increase with age .
Which is also where the sex differences come in .
The female gamers actually logged more time online : an average of 29 hours a week , versus 25 for the males , with the top players putting in 57 hours a week on the girl ’s side , and 51 for the guys .
What ’s more , it looks like women are more likely to lie about how much they really play .
The researchers found that the gals tended to lowball how long they spend glued to the screen .
So , never ask a women her age .
Or how much time she spends defeating the dark elves to rebuild the world of Norrath .

Michigan Rep. Vern Ehlers retires
Michigan Rep. Vern Ehlers is retiring .
AP photo
Michigan Rep. Vern Ehlers announced his retirement this morning , the 17th Republican to decide against seeking re-election to the next Congress .
" I do n't want to stay in office so long that people will say you should have left five years ago , " Ehlers said .
Extenuating circumstances likely played a role in Ehlers ' decision .
His wife , Johanna , suffered a heart attack last week and , on Tuesday , conservative state Rep. Justin Amash announced plans to primary the 76 - year - old Ehlers .
Ehlers ' 3rd district , which is centered in Grand Rapids , was extremely competitive in 2008 as Sen.
John McCain ( Ariz . ) won it by just over 2,000 votes .
The seat went strongly for George W. Bush in 2004 ( 59 percent ) and 2000 ( 60 percent ) , however .
" Voters in the Grand Rapids area have long supported Republican candidates who stand for limited government and pro-growth economic policies , and we are confident that they will continue to do so in November , " said National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Pete Sessions ( Texas ) .
The best known potential Republican candidate is Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land , who , according to informed Wolverine State Republicans , has long eyed Ehlers seat .
Lynn Land is currently running for lieutenant governor on a ticket led by Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard .
It was not immediately clear whether Democrats would seek to contest the district in the fall or who their candidate might be .
( Here 's a list of potential candidates for the seat from the Grand Rapids Press newspapers .
Whether or not Ehlers seat is targeted by the two national parties in the fall , it provides a short - term talking point for House Democrats who have been working to beat back talk of an avalanche -- that terms seems especially appropriate today in Washington -- of retirements on their side in the wake of Sen.
Scott Brown 's ( R - Mass . ) special election victory last month .
Since that time , one Democrat -- Arkansas Rep. Marion Berry -- has stepped aside while Ehlers and Rep. Steve Buyer ( Ind. ) have decided to take a pass on re-election bids .
As we always say , however , all retirement are not created equal so do n't read too much into the fact that Republicans have five more open seats to defend than Democrats .
The Democratic retirements are still , generally , in more problematic districts and more of them are likely to draw the attention -- and campaign cash -- of the two national parties .
Still , open seat races -- no matter the demographics of a district -- are proven to be more electorally volatile than when an incumbent seeks re-election .
So , the higher the number of retirements rise for Republicans , the more places they will need to keep an eye on and play defense in a cycle where they are expected to be offense in most places across the country .
Reeves lifts most of statewide COVID - 19 mask mandate
The Republican made several announcements about changes to coronavirus regulations in the state .
On March 3 the European Space Agency 's Mars Express orbiter passed within 67 kilometers of the Martian moon Phobos , the closest a spacecraft has ever skimmed the larger of Mars 's two diminutive oddball satellites .
Only 27 kilometers long at its lengthiest dimension , Phobos is a misshapen lump that may be a captured asteroid .
Mars Express is engaged in a series of 12 Phobos flybys that began in February and will end March 26 .
The photograph above comes from a March 7 pass , when the spacecraft came within about 100 kilometers of Phobos ; the closer approach of March 3 took Mars Express past the moon 's nightside to gather data , albeit limiting its value as a photo opportunity .
The Russian Phobos–Grunt lander , scheduled to lift off in 2011 , is designed to return soil samples that should help uncover Phobos 's origin .
The proposed landing area for Phobos Grunt is on the rightmost visible edge of the moon in this photograph , about one third of the way up from the bottom .
Caprica saw another dip in the ratings on Friday , but Syfy is standing by it .
Plus the network is considering a second Battlestar Galactica spin - off show .
Syfy's also jumping on the superhero bandwagon , with two super - powered shows in the pipeline .

Caprica 's ratings had actually seen a decent uptick for two episodes in a row ( the " New Cap City " one , and the " Tauron wants to buy the sports team " one . )
But with last Friday 's episode , the show surrendered most of those gains , grazing up against the one - million - viewers mark once again .
Syfy's Executive VP of Development , Mark Stern , continues to be " bullish " about the show , and points to robust DVR viewer numbers — people , in other words , who have some place to be on a Friday night or are watching Smallville , but who watch the show later .
But the most intriguing thing in the latest interview with Stern , at Hollywood Reporter , might have been Stern 's mention of a second BSG spin - off .
Says Stern :
We 're looking for other ways to spin off ‘ Battlestar ' beyond ‘ Caprica . '
That world is so rich .
We 're sitting down with ( executive producer ) Ron Moore and his team .
It would not necessarily be a traditional series .

Also , now that superheroes are hitting network TV with The Cape and No Ordinary Family , Syfy is looking to get into the super - powered game too .
Syfy is hoping one of its two superhero pilots becomes a series .

There 's a 90 - minute pilot called Three Inches , made by Fox Television Studios , from Twin Peaks writer Harley Peyton and producer Bob Cooper .
It 's about a guy who discovers he has telekinesis — but he can only move objects a total of three inches with his mind .
He finds a bunch of others with similiarly unimpressive powers , and they form a superteam .
Because .
Says Stern , " ‘ Three Inches ' is a fun , smart , offbeat spin on the superhero genre
It 's a very postmodern approach , with a really wonderful , tongue - in - cheek script . "
The other superhero show , Alphas , is also about a super - team , but less is known .
Syfy 's upfront presentation to advertisers is scheduled for today , so we may know more about its upcoming programs soon .
Alistair Darling has pledged to cut the budget deficit by half UK government borrowing could be less than forecast this financial year after better - than - expected figures for February and revised January data .
The UK government borrowed £ 12.4bn in February , less than economists had expected , official figures have shown .
The figure for January was also revised sharply downwards , to £ 43 m from £ 4.3 bn .
Borrowing in the current financial year has now reached £ 131.9bn , but analysts say the full - year total may be less than the government 's £ 178bn forecast .
Until recently , most analysts thought the government 's borrowing forecast was too optimistic .
The Office for National Statistics said that the overall effect of the latest revisions to historical data for the year had cut overall borrowing for 2009 / 10 by £ 2.9bn .
Despite the revisions and February 's better - than - expected figure , government borrowing is still running at record highs for the year , partly due to reduced tax receipts because of slow economic growth .
' Timely boost '
The borrowing figure for February was not as bad as some had feared , partly because of the rise in VAT at the beginning of this year .
The government is also paying out slightly less in benefits , because unemployment is falling .
" February 's public finances figures have provided [ Chancellor ]
Alistair Darling with a very timely boost ahead of next Wednesday 's Budget , " said Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics .
ANALYSIS Nils Blythe , BBC business correspondent
These figures give a mixed picture .
At first glance , they show a record level of borrowing for the month of February and are a painful reminder of how rapidly the UK government 's debt is rising .
But look a little more closely and there are some slightly more encouraging signs .
Tax receipts are up by £ 1.5 bn on February last year .
And with one month left in the tax year , the cumulative borrowing total has reached £ 132bn .
That is a colossal sum .
But even allowing for a hefty borrowing requirement in March , it seems that the total will come in well under the forecast for the tax year which the Treasury made in December .
None of this is likely to have Alistair Darling rewriting next week 's Budget .
He still has to convince the financial markets that Labour is serious about cutting the deficit .
But if borrowing this year is a little lower than projected , it does give the Chancellor a little more room to manoeuvre .
" The figures leave a total deficit for the first 11 months of the year of £ 132bn , suggesting that Mr Darling may now hit or even undershoot his full - year forecast . "
Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight agreed : " Mr Darling could significantly undershoot the £ 178bn public sector borrowing requirement that he forecast for 2009 / 2010 in last December 's pre-Budget report . "
Accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that the budget deficit for the financial year would be £ 173bn , £ 5 bn less than the government forecast .
Although the UK 's overall level of debt is similar to other major economies , it has increased its borrowing during the downturn at a much faster rate than its competitors .
Chancellor Alistair Darling has pledged to halve the budget deficit in percentage terms over the next four years , but argues that making cuts now could harm the UK 's recovery from recession .
On Wednesday , the European Union published a report saying that the government 's plans to cut the deficit are not ambitious enough .
EU rules say government deficits must be below 3 % of GDP , but the UK 's deficit is expected to hit 12.6 % of GDP this year .
The Conservatives also argue that cuts need to be made more quickly .
Burgeoning debt levels have also led to concerns in recent months that the UK could lose its AAA credit rating - reserved for the very safest borrowers .
However , earlier this week , Moody 's agency said the UK 's top rating was secure .

Amazon.com told many of its Colorado online business affiliates Monday that it would sever its business relationship with them , a move that could slice into the revenues of thousands of Web retailers .
The company blamed state lawmakers for enacting a law requiring it to notify those who purchase Amazon merchandise through a local website that they owe state sales taxes .
Lawmakers in turn criticized Amazon ’s move as a hostage - taking gambit to force reversal of the measure .
The affiliates , ranging from online booksellers to individual bloggers who advertise Amazon on their websites to receive a commission in return , were both angry and confused by the move .
And some say they were not notified .
“ We had to find out from others , and we will lose 10 percent of our ( revenues ) , ” said Judith Briles , chief executive officer of Mile High Press , a book publisher in Aurora .
“ Amazon is going to get horrendous publicity for this .
But there are two bad guys : Amazon and the lawmakers who moved this legislation through so fast . ”
Jeannine Crooks of Parker runs a number of online sites that refer customers to bigger retailers .
She only recently became affiliated with Amazon , but said she will have to find other online stores that carry the products she offers .
That may not be easy if other online merchants follow Amazon ’s lead .
“ It ’s putting our entire industry at risk , ” she said .
Impact of the new law
At issue is a recent law enacted by legislators mandating Amazon and other retailers notify their online shoppers they must pay a 2.9 percent sales tax on purchases .
Designed to offset a massive budget shortfall , it is expected to generate $ 5 million .
Amazon.com , Overstock.com and other online retailers that sell across state borders do not regularly collect sales taxes , though businesses with physical stores in Colorado must .
They have fought attempts in other states to enforce collections of taxes on their products .
After Amazon criticized earlier versions of the Colorado bill , it was modified by law makers to ensure that affiliates did not bear any regulation burden .
On Monday , Amazon sent e-mail messages to some affiliates saying lawmakers “ clearly intended to increase the compliance burden to a point where online retailers will be induced to voluntarily collect Colorado sales tax — a course we wo n’t take . ”
The company , which did not respond to an interview request from The Denver Post , also urged affiliates to call the legislature to urge reversal of the new law .
“ It ’s flat - out blackmail ”
State Sen. Greg Brophy , R - Wray , said he was swamped with e-mails from affiliates Monday and plans to try to reverse the tax measure .
At least 3,000 affiliates could be hurt , he said , though the economic impact of Amazon ’s move could take weeks to determine .
“ I think a full - blown repeal or something else can be done , ” Brophy said .
“ We still have 65 days left in session — we can move an emergency bill through . ”
But that will require the blessing of Democratic leaders who unleashed a slew of their own press releases saying Amazon is using dirty tactics .
“ It ’s blackmail , it ’s flat - out blackmail , ” said Jack Pommer , D - Boulder , author of the original bill .
“ It shows the lengths to which they ’ll go to keep the advantage they have over other local businesses . ”
Public finance experts say Amazon ’s argument that the new law is burdensome makes little sense .
“ Take Target — it has brick - and - mortar stores but also a website , ” said Alec Harris , policy analyst for the Colorado Fiscal Policy Institute .
“ If I go to Target.com , it calculates what I owe .
It ’s not hard . ”
Gov. Bill Ritter issued a statement saying Amazon is “ simply trying to avoid compliance with Colorado law . ”

The interview that did appear is at
Scientists hash out the uncertainties of climate sensitivity .
I was on travel , which is why she did not use it .
As she explained in an e-mail on February 10 2010 ,
“ I ended up having a few more questions than you were able to get into before you left .
I ended up speaking by phone to Gavin Schmidt with NASA Goddard , as well as with Dr. Schwartz , who was able to clarify what he was trying to get at in the paper a little better than I understood it when I sent the questions to you . ”

Best Regards

I ’ve read over the paper by Dr. Schwartz .
The questions I have for you are below .
Please let me know if anything needs clarification , or if there ’s anything that you ’d like to talk with me about by phone .
1 ) It seems from reading the paper that Dr. Schwartz is arguing that the IPCC best estimate on the maximum GHG concentration in the atmosphere is not actually a good estimate –because it ’s based on assumptions about climate
sensitivity and aerosol forcing that seem to be incorrect or , at least , that we do n’t know enough about yet .
Am I understanding this correctly ?
And , if so , do you agree with the conclusions of this paper ?
I agree with the authors that forcing by anthropogenic aerosols .
is incompletely understood .
However , aerosols are only part of the climate forcings that we do not adequately understand .
As we concluded in our paper
Pielke Sr. , R. , K. Beven , G. Brasseur , J. Calvert , M. Chahine , R. Dickerson , D. Entekhabi , E. Foufoula - Georgiou , H. Gupta , V. Gupta , W. Krajewski , E. Philip Krider , W. K.M. Lau , J. McDonnell , W. Rossow , J. Schaake , J. Smith , S. Sorooshian , and E. Wood , 2009 : Climate change :
The need to consider human forcings besides greenhouse gases .
Eos , Vol. 90 , No. 45 , 10 November 2009 , 413 .

https://pielkeclimatesci.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/r-354.pdf [ all of the authors are Fellows of the American Geophysical Union ]
“ In addition to greenhouse gas emissions , other first - order human climate forcings are important to understanding the future behavior of Earth ’s climate .
These forcings are spatially heterogeneous and include the effect of aerosols on clouds and associated precipitation [ e.g. , Rosenfeld et al. , 2008 ] , the influence of aerosol deposition ( e.g. , black carbon ( soot ) [ Flanner et al. 2007 ] and reactive nitrogen [ Galloway et al. , 2004 ] ) , and the role of changes in land use / land cover [ e.g. , Takata et al. , 2009 ] .
Among their effects is their role in altering atmospheric and ocean circulation features away from what they would bein the natural climate system [ NRC , 2005 ] .
As with CO the climate are estimated to be on multidecadal time scales and longer . ”
The use of the global mean surface temperature ( GMST ) , as the authors focus on in the paper , is also an inadequate metric to assess the sensitivity of the climate system to human and natural climate forcings and feedbacks that affect climate events such as drought , floods , etc .
In the National Research Council report
National Research Council , 2005 : Radiative forcing of climate change : Expanding the concept and addressing uncertainties .
Committee on Radiative Forcing Effects on Climate Change , Climate Research Committee , Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate , Division on Earth and Life Studies , The National Academies Press , Washington , D.C. , 208 pp .
http://www.nap.edu/openbook/0309095069/html/
we concluded [ where the global mean TOA ( top of the atmosphere ) radiative forcing is directly related to the GMST used the Schwartz et al paper ] that
“ ….. the traditional global mean TOA radiative forcing concept has some important limitations , which have come increasingly to light over the past decade .
The concept is inadequate for some forcing agents , such as absorbing aerosols and land - use changes , that may have regional climate impacts much greater than would be predicted from TOA radiative forcing .
Also , it diagnoses only one measure of climate change — global mean surface temperature response — while offering little information on regional climate change or precipitation .
These limitations can be addressed by expanding the radiative forcing concept and through the introduction of additional forcing metrics .
In particular , the concept needs to be extended to account for ( 1 ) the vertical structure of radiative forcing , ( 2 ) regional variability in radiative forcing , and ( 3 ) nonradiative forcing .
A new metric to account for the vertical structure of radiative forcing is recommended below . ”
Thus , while the Schwartz et al paper is an important new research paper that presents evidence of current limitations in understanding and skillfully predicting the global average warming , it is just a step in addressing a much broader range of uncertainties in the climate system .
2 ) I was under the impression that current climate models matched up pretty well with observed historical changes in climate .
This seems to say that that is not the case .
Is that true ?
The current climate models only have had some success with simulating the change of the global average surface temperature ( the GMST ) during the past century .
They have not been able to skillfully predict any of the major long ( or short ) term extreme climate events that have occurred such as the 1930s dust bowl years in the central United States .
Even for the GMST , they can only achieve realistic long term trends by imposing estimates of aerosol radiative forcings where they know the answer already .
However , even then , as the Schwartz et al paper shows , our understanding of this aerosol forcing is still not completely understood .
They even quote Jim Hansen to support this lack of understanding ; i.e .
“ Hansen ( 2008 ) has argued that “ estimates of climate sensitivity based on the last 100 years of climate change are practically worthless , because we do not know the net climate forcing . ”
3 ) I think most people understand what GHG are in everyday terms , but I want to get a better handle on aerosols .
What ’s a real - world example of something that would create the aerosols Dr. Schwartz ’s paper is talking about ?
The aerosols are created by industrial and vehicular emssions , biomass burning ( e.g. forest and grassland fires ) , and dust from arid and semi-arid landscapes .
4 ) How do aerosols work to limit temperature increases ?
Aerosols can work in both directions .
Sulphates , for example , can reflect sunlight back into space that otherwise would warm the climate system .
Soot ( black carbon ) can add to the warming of the atmosphere as it absorbs solar radiation that otherwise would be lost through reflection of sunlight back out into space .
The aerosols actually have a range of complex effects which are summarized in the NRC ( 2005 ; pages 34 - 44 ) report I listed above .
They can even significantly alter cloud and precipitation processes directly .
Table 2 - 2 on page 40 [ http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11175&page=40] has a summary some of the aerosol effects .
5 ) I ’m unfamiliar with “ thermal disequalibrium ” , can you explain what that means ?
In reading the paper , it appears they refer to the time lag between when a radiative imbalance is applied and the GMST increases enough to remove this imbalance .
6 ) Is it , at this stage , unreasonable to make statements like , “ xxx ppm means and xx increase in global temperature ” ?
Why or why not ?
This oversimplifies the complex response of the climate system to the diversity of human and natural climate forcings .
If it were as simple as “ xxx ppm means and xx increase in global temperature ” we could explain the observed seasonal , annual and decadal averaged temperatures this way .
However , as even the Schwartz et al paper with its focus on just one aspect of aerosol forcings show , the climate is more complicated than that .
7 ) Thermal lag is a possible factor in the temperature discrepancy .
As I understand it , this has to do with the fact that the actual temperature increases and decreases caused by accumluating or mitigating GHG concentrations in the atmosphere do n’t happen in synch …. and , in fact , the temperature changes can happen years after the GHG changes .
Can you explain for me a little about why this is ?
The GMST responses to the radiative imbalance .
There is a time lag if the system has inertia ( due to its mass ) such that the temperature takes a period of time to increase enough in order to remove this imbalance .
This why , for example , it takes time for a pot of water to boil after we turn the burner on ; there is a thermal lag .
In the climate system , in order to diagnose the radiative imbalance and the thermal lag , all of the natural and human climate forcings must be accurately measured .
The Schwartz et al paper shows that our knowledge of even the aerosol part is still significantly incomplete .
8 ) The paper talks about the possibility that natural variation in temperature may have increased since the beginning of the industrial era and , if so , that the natural variability would then account for more of the temperature discrepancy .
Is there any way to know whether natural variation has increased ?
This is a topic of considerable debate .
There has been recent research that indicates a greater solar climate forcing than previously understood .
The alterations in the atmospheric circulation patterns over year and longer time periods also appears to result in larger natural variability in the GMST than previously thought .
However , it is a challenge to ferret out the human from the natural forcings as the response of the climate system , such as the GMST , is the net result of this range of forcings and resultant climate feedbacks .
9 ) If Dr. Schwartz is correct , and if climate sensitivity is n’t as strong as is currently assumed , what does that mean ?
Do we have more time to counteract climate change ?
Do we just not know how much time we have ?
In our EOS article we wrote
“ The evidence predominantly suggests that humans are significantly altering the global environment , and thus climate , in a variety of diverse ways beyond the effects of human emissions of greenhouse gases , including CO2 .
Unfortunately , the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) assessment did not sufficiently acknowledge the importance of these other human climate forcings in altering regional and global climate and their effects on predictability at the regional scale .
It also placed too much emphasis on average global forcing from a limited set of human climate forcings .
Further , it devised a mitigation strategy based on global model predictions .
Although aerosols were considered as a global average forcing , their local effects were neglected ( e.g. , biomass burning , dust from land use / land cover management and change , soot from inefficient combustion ) .
Because global climate models do not accurately simulate ( or even include ) several of these other first - order human climate forcings , policy makers must be made aware of the inability of the current generation of models to accurately forecast regional climate risks to resources on multidecadal time scales .
For example , how the water cycle responds to the diversity of climate forcings at the regional level will be important information to policy makers seeking to mitigate risks to water resources .
We recommend that the next assessment phase of the IPCC ( and other such assessments ) broaden its perspective to include all of the human climate forcings .
It should also adopt a complementary and precautionary resource - based assessment of the vulnerability of critical resources ( those affecting water , food , energy , and human and ecosystem health ) to environmental variability and change of all types .
This should include , but not be limited to , the effects due to all of the natural and human caused climate variations and changes . ”
10 ) What parts of climate science do we have a good certainty level on ?
Does the situation boil down to , “ We know anthropogenic climate change is happening , but we have no idea of the rate of change ? ”
We concluded in our EOS article that
“ Although the natural causes of climate variations and changes are undoubtedly important , the human influences are significant and involve a diverse range of first - order climate forcings , including , but not limited to , the human input of
carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) .
Most , if not all , of these human influences on regional and global climate will continue to be of concern during the coming decades . ”
and made the recommendation that
“ If communities are to become more resilient to the entire spectrum of possible environmental and social variability and change [ Vörösmarty et al. , 2000 ] , scientists must properly assess the vulnerabilities and risks associated with the choices made by modern society and anticipate the demands for resources several decades into the future .
Moreover , since the climate , as a complex nonlinear system , is subject to abrupt changes and driven by competing positive and negative feedbacks with largely unknown thresholds [ Rial et al. , 2004 ] , scientists ’ ability to make skillful multidecadal climate predictions becomes much more complicated , if not impractical . ”
11 ) Should people trust climate predictions / scenarios at this point ?
Are people ascribing too much confidence to those predictions ?
Yes ; there is too much reliance on these predictions .
We recommend an approach based on the assessment of vulnerabilities to our key resources of water , food , energy , human health and ecosystem function as we wrote in our EOS article .
12 ) What will it take to better understand the impact of aerosols ?
How much money and effort is currently directed at this part of climate science ?
There is quite a bit of funding on aerosol research .
Where we need more funds and effort is in identifying the vulnerabilities to the key resources and then to seek solutions to reduce the threats to them .
13 ) Does the fact that aerosols may be limiting temperature increases due to GHG mean that we need to find a way to cut GHG emissions while simultaneously not reducing aerosol emissions ?
We need a much broader assessment of the role of humans in the climate system .
We are finding out , as the Schwartz et al paper illustrates , that as we learn more about the climate system , we are finding that it is more complex and difficult to skillfully predict than was assumed in the past .
The great thing about old magazines is that once published , they ca n’t be adjusted .
Jo Nova has a great summary of some recent work from occasional WUWT contributor Frank Lansner who runs the blog “ Hide the Decline ” and what he found in an old National Geographic , which bears repeating here .

Jo Nova writes :
Human emissions of carbon dioxide began a sharp rise from 1945 .
But , temperatures , it seems , may have plummeted over half the globe during the next few decades .
Just how large or how insignificant was that decline ?
Frank Lansner has found an historical graph of northern hemisphere temperatures from the mid 70’s , and it shows a serious decline in temperatures from 1940 to 1975 .
It ’s a decline so large that it wipes out the gains made in the first half of the century , and brings temperatures right back to what they were circa 1910 .
The graph was not peer reviewed , but presumably it was based on the best information available at the time .
In any case , if all the global records are not available to check , it ’s impossible to know how accurate or not this graph is .
The decline apparently recorded was a whopping 0.5°C .
But , three decades later , by the time Brohan and the CRU graphed temperatures in 2006 from the same old time period , the data had been adjusted ( surprise ) , so that what was a fall of 0.5 °C had become just a drop of 0.15 °C .
Seventy percent of the cooling was gone .
Maybe they had good reasons for making these adjustments .
But , as usual , the adjustments were in favor of the Big Scare Campaign , and the reasons and the original data are not easy to find .
Above : Matthews 1976 , National Geographic , Temperatures 1880 - 1976
Now compare the 1935 - 1975 decline for the same area – the entire Northern hemisphere – presented by CRU / Brohan 2006 :
Source : http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climatechange/science/monitoring/CR_data/Monthly/HadCRUGNS_3plots.gif
And when the old and the new are overlaid …hey where ’s the decline ?
Above :
The blue line is the adjusted CRU average from 2006 , overlaid on the 1976 Nat Geo graph .
If temperature sets across the northern hemisphere were really showing that 1940 was as hot as 2000 , that makes it hard to argue that the global warming that occurred from 1975 to 2000 was almost solely due to carbon , since it was n’t unusual ( at least not for half the globe ) , and did n’t correlate at all with our carbon emissions , the vast majority of which occurred after 1945 .
The US records show that the 1930 ’s were as hot as the 1990’s .
And the divergence problem in tree rings is well known .
Many tree rings showed a decline after 1960 that did n’t “ concur ” with the surface records .
Perhaps these tree rings agree with the surface records as recorded at the time , rather than as adjusted post hoc ?
Perhaps the decline in the tree rings that Phil Jones worked to hide was not so much a divergence from reality , but instead was slightly more real than the surface - UHI - cherry - picked - and - poorly - sited records ?
Esper – Tree ring widths declined from 1940 - 1975 .
Records after 1960 are sometimes ignored because they do n’t fit the “ temperature record ” .
( All timeseries were normalized over the 1881 – 1940 period .
RCS , regional curve standardization ; TRW , tree - ring width . )

Steven McIntyre discusses the Esper data here .
Frank Lansner also discusses the data from Scandinavia , which originally showed that temperatures were roughly level from mid-century to the end of the century , but that the large decline from 1940 to 1975 was …adjusted out of existence .
( My post on that here ) .
Scandinavian Temperatures : 25 data series combined from The Nordklim database ( left ) , compared to the IPCC ’s temperature graph for the area .
Frank points out that while the older graph is not peer reviewed , the modern data sets are also not peer reviewed , so even if the papers they are published in are peer reviewed , it ’s meaningless to claim this is significant when the underlying data can be adjusted years after its collection without documentation or review .
The CRU has an FAQ on their datasets , and it includes this comment on the accuracy of the hemispheric records :
In the hemispheric files averages are now given to a precision of three decimal places to enable seasonal values to be calculated to ± 0.01 °C .
The extra precision implies no greater accuracy than two decimal places .
Do I read that correctly ?
After an adjustment that may be in the order of 0.34 °C , the accuracy is ±0.01°C ?
At the time when there was a Global Ice Age Scare , this graph appeared in Newsweek .
Newsweek : Global Temperatures 1880 - 1970 ( NCAR ) Newsweek : Global Temperatures 1880 - 1970 ( NCAR )
Either 70 % of the decline has been hidden in the years since then , or the climate scientists at the time were exaggerating the decline in order to support the Ice Age Scare ( surely not ! ) .

Not all weddings can be as fabulous as the union between Michael Cole Smith and Jamil Smith Cole .
But Melanie and Anthony Vaughan , a British couple married last year , at least tried .
That is until their male wedding photographer showed as a woman and ruined everything !
How dare she .
Nevermind that Kate Summers , born Dave Stonestreet , is transgender .
And she just happened to be diagnosed by doctors as such in the year between when the Vaughans booked her services and their wedding day .
So upset were the new groom and bride their photographer tried stealing their thunder , or something , that six months after exchanging vows , they ran their mouth to the gossip - happy tabloids .
Says Melanie Vaughan : “ He said would I mind if he came dressed as a woman , but women can dress in a whole load of different ways .
“ I thought he would come in a trouser suit .
I had no idea how bad it would be .
I did n’t appreciate the flowing skirt and hair in a bobble .
I said to my hairdresser ‘ what ’s it dressed like ? ’
I could n’t look .
I do understand what he ’s going through .
He must have issues , but he only let me know the day before and his pictures were rubbish .
It was both the way he looked , how he turned up and how bad his pictures were that made the whole thing a nightmare . ”
Well , the bad pictures , we can understand complaining over .
But Summers , who says there ’s nothing wrong with the photos , retorts : “ You would n’t dream of complaining that your wedding had been ruined because someone was gay or disabled .
This diagnosis of being biologically female having lived 50 years as a male is not an easy thing to go through .
I told them what I had been through and thought they would be fine with it .
She did n’t give me any indication that was a problem .
The first time she has raised the issue is months later in a national newspaper .
You would think if she was n’t happy she would make a formal complaint or take it to the small claims court .
It was the first time I had done anything work - wise dressed as a woman and was the last wedding I was ever going to do , so I really wanted it to go well .
As a female I ’m probably more aware of how important a day it is for a bride . ”
Something tells us the Vaughans might disagree .
But , congratulations !
While the three children of Elisabeth Witte mourned the loss and honored the memory of their slain mother Friday , their father - the man who murdered her in a downtown parking structure - told a judge that he hoped to live long enough for his children to tell him that they are sorry .
Gerhard Witte fantasized out loud what that moment might be like :
" Dad , " he imagined them saying .
" We are sorry this thing happened . "
Witte , who represented himself during his three - day trial , was convicted Wednesday of first - degree intentional homicide .
He was sentenced Friday to life in prison with no chance of early release .
Witte was so self - absorbed during his sentencing hearing that Scott Anderson , an advisory attorney appointed by the court , twice interrupted Witte in frustration , telling him : " Stop talking about yourself ! " and " Do n't you think you ought to apologize ? "
" I cannot apologize for an act I had no control of , " Witte said .
Witte , 72 , is a physician who , during an acrimonious divorce from Elisabeth Witte in 2005 , bragged to police that he would not need a gun to kill her because , as a medical doctor , he knew " precisely where to cut . "
May 2008 attack
He attacked his former wife on May 25 , 2008 , after Elisabeth Witte , having just finished performing with the Milwaukee Symphony Chorus , was walking to her car .
He stabbed her in the abdomen and then slit the 65 - year - old woman 's throat .
On Friday , Witte repeated what he had said during his trial : that he is a man of such high moral caliber , of such intellect and reason , of such deep love for family and tradition , that he could not have ruined his life by killing his wife unless he was out of his head .
" There is no explanation for crazy , " he said .
Witte certainly looked the part .
His stringy gray hair hung below his shoulders , his stringy gray beard hung to his chest .
Having refused to wear street clothes , his skinny white arms and sandaled feet poked out from beneath the blue , pleated smock that he , as a suicide risk , is required to wear in jail .
The theatrical nature of Witte 's presence and of his condition did not escape him .
He more than once compared his life to a Greek tragedy in which the hero endures forces beyond his control and which inevitably undo him .
" This is a soul so burdened that it crushed , " he said .
Insanity claim rejected
The jury that convicted Witte explicitly rejected his insanity claim .
During Friday 's hearing , Assistant District Attorney Kevin Shomin told Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Daniel Konkol that Witte was motived by nothing more than rage over his divorce , his former wife 's financial settlement and her refusal , after years of being stalked , to take him back .
" The day Mrs. Witte filed for divorce in 2005 was the day she signed her death warrant , " Shomin said .
Karin Witte , 31 , spoke in behalf of herself and her two adult brothers .
She offered no sentencing recommendation for Witte , whom she called " this man no longer our father . "
She spoke of the family 's gratitude to the community for its support after her mother 's death , for the dedication of the police and district attorney 's office and for Scott Anderson 's hard work .
She focused her remarks on her mother 's memory , mourning that Elisabeth Witte could not be there to help her and her brothers through such a difficult time .
" We needed her longer , " Karin Witte said .
Witte noted that his daughter 's eloquent remarks were further proof of his parenting skills .
Tomorrow , at 8.30 pm , thousands of people across the UK and maybe a billion across the world will take part in Earth Hour .
It 'll look impressive , no doubt .
The big switch - off will make the news .
But so what ?
We know that just one hour , even on this global scale , wo n't in itself save energy or reduce emissions in any significant way .
This is a giant photo opportunity – eye - catching and symbolic , yes – but how can it really make a difference ?
More importantly , why would a science - based organisation like WWF believe this is worth the effort ?
I think there are many reasons , but there are three worth focusing on .
Firstly , climate change is a threat truly global in its nature .
It demands global attention , commitment and action .
In December last year , as the climate talks in Copenhagen came to a stuttering finish , many in the UK felt disappointed and disillusioned .
But talking to my colleagues working in areas of the world already feeling the effects of climate change , emotions ran much higher .
Anger and disbelief best describes what nations like the Maldives , Bangladesh and Tanzania felt on seeing the failure of world leaders to take collective responsibility .
They are seeing the effects of climate change now .
It is , for countries in their position , no theory for debate or distant possibility .
As I write , more than 125 countries have confirmed their participation in Earth Hour , almost 40 more than in 2009 , including 56 national capitals and eight of the 10 most populated metropolises on the planet .
" Earth Hour " has appeared more than 30 m times online in the past 24 hours and is currently one of the top 10 trending topics on Twitter .
While the UK and the US ( two major global emitters ) may have seen an increase in sceptical noise on climate change in recent months , I feel confident that globally , this is no waning movement .
Secondly , politicians here in the UK need a mandate to act .
Unlike elsewhere in the world , our main political parties all understand the threat of climate change and say that they are committed , albeit with different policies and approaches , to dealing with the problem .
However , Copenhagen largely failed and leaders need us , the voters , to keep up a demand for action .
This close to a general election , there 's no better time to make a big , bold , collective statement that as a public , we expect leadership from our next government , whatever its hue .
Schools , cathedrals , large companies , small businesses , pubs , clubs , councils all add up to a pretty comprehensive slice of our population and just this week , under pressure from Earth Hour participants , supporters and many committed MPs , the Palace of Westminster and 10 Downing Street joined the Senedd in Cardiff and the Scottish parliament in Holyrood and signed up to switch off .
In the US , 31 state governors are supporting Earth Hour .
The people who matter do notice .
Lastly , Earth Hour is for me a brilliant analogy for how we can get to a solution .
Climate change will demand big , global ambition from world leaders – the " landmarks " of our political landscape .
Just as lights go off at Christ the Redeemer , the Empire State Building and the Forbidden City , we need Presidents Lula da Silva , Obama and Hu Jintao and many others to work together in order to get a binding commitment to reduce emissions .
A low - carbon future will demand small changes from all of us at home , like the families taking part in Earth Hour , perhaps eating their dinner by candlelight .
Better insulation , more efficient heating , using public transport and the products we choose to consume can all have impact on the energy we use and reduce our personal impact on our environment .
Earth
Hour is not about a world without light , power and the great human achievements that keep us warm and safe .
It is absolutely a celebration of their positive role ; we want a bright future in which the lights stay on , drawing on forms of energy and innovative technologies that have a lesser impact on people and nature around the world .
As the 10:10 campaign has shown alongside Earth Hour , collective action can have an impact .
We know that a single hour , once a year is not enough .
But also we know that there is no greater , global call to action available at the flick of a switch .
We firmly believe Earth hour is worth it .

Joe Arpaio is the self proclaimed " toughest sheriff in America " , not afraid of criminals , politicians , protestors or anyone who gets in his way .
But a different side of the sheriff is revealed as he answers questions under oath in a nearly seven - hour deposition .
Arpaio and his deputies are the targets of a federal civil rights lawsuit which makes allegations of racial profiling during the highly publicized illegal immigration sweeps by the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office in 2007 .
Arpaio publicly took the lead role in the controversial sweeps , and vehemently derided any public officials �including other law enforcement agencies �who raised objections to the sweeps .
Last year the Arizona Department of Public Safety pulled more than a million dollars in crime suppression funds from Arpaio 's office because of concerns that he was using the money mainly to round up illegal immigrants instead of taking known criminals off the street .
Then - Governor Janet Napolitano supported DPS in yanking the funding .
Arpaio defied the state 's decision , angrily saying , " They wanted to cut my head off .
They wanted to take away my money .
It 's not going to work . "
And he taunted Napolitano by demanding , " I just want my money back .
In fact I want her to double it . "
Deposition videotapes obtained exclusively by 12 News show an Arpaio who is soft - spoken , humble and at times has difficulty remembering statements made by himself or his public relations staff .
At one point , plaintiffs attorney David Bodney asked Arpaio about one of the numerous news releases his office sends out .
BODNEY : You said that MCSO was targeting profile vehicles and quickly becoming a full - fledged anti-immigration agency .
Do you remember issuing a press release on that subject ?
ARPAIO : I do n't remember .
A few moments later : BODNEY : And the line between the headline reads , and I quote , hundreds of deputies / volunteer posse targeting profile vehicles , close quote .
Do you see that ?
ARPAIO : Uh - hum yes .
BODNEY : What does it mean to target profile vehicles ?
ARPAIO : Once again , I did n't write the press release .
The deposition also asked the sheriff about his provocative statements on immigration , including the subtitle of his own book , Joe 's Law : BODNEY :
Do you still view illegal immigration as a threat to our country as " Joe 's Law " says on its cover ?
ARPAIO : I do n't think I put that title up there .
BODNEY : That was your co-author 's title ?
ARPAIO : or the publisher .
You know how that works .
BODNEY : Uh -huh .
but I think you testified that illegal immigration is in your view a threat to America .
ARPAIO : No I think when you say " threat " it 's not like a terrorist threat .
Bodney asked Arpaio about a typically blunt comment attributed to the sheriff in GQ Magazine .
BODNEY : Second paragraph , and I am looking at a statement that says " You know what it is ?
It 's this civil rights , all that crap . "
Close quote .
Do you remember making that statement to the reporter this year ?
ARPAIO : I do n't remember I have so many reporters to talk to .
BODNEY : But is that your view of this racial profiling allegation , that it is just civil rights crap ?
ARPAIO : Well I am not going to get into all the facts why I feel that way , but I do realize it 's political , and I - I have full confidence in my staff , how they conduct themselves in this illegal immigration .
The attorney , David Bodney , also does legal work for 12 News and in recent years has represented 12 news in numerous public records negotiations with MCSO .
In this case , Bodney is not working for 12 News , but for the plaintiffs in the civil rights case .

Just how popular can Conan O'Brien 's Twitter account become ?
After announcing his three month long comedy tour with a single " tweet , " his Team Coco site was flooded with too much traffic .
Conan 's next tweet directed loyal fans to purchase tickets through Ticketmaster ... which then almost led to the break down of the largest ticket brokerage site .
Not to mention his following of a random fan has led to offers of free wine and a dress for her upcoming wedding .
So , what should Conan do with his tweets of gold ?
Well , Bloomberg TV suggests that he could take on sponsors for his Twitter account .
After all , if Kim Kardashian can make $ 10,000 per tweet , just imagine how much Conan can bank .
Lithuania 's controversial law that bans the “ promotion ” of being gay takes effect Monday .
In December , lawmakers capitulated to international pressure and agreed to remove some of the measure 's most odious language .
But the changes failed to mollify opponents , who say the amended law remains anti-gay because it outlaws the promotion of “ any concept of the family other than that set down in the constitution , ” which defines marriage as a heterosexual union .
“ From now on , any of our public events could fall under that clause and be banned , ” Vladimir Simonko , head of the Lithuanian Gay League , told the AFP .
Human rights group Amnesty International called on the government to ditch the controversial law .
“ This law will violate the freedom of expression and will directly discriminate against people on account of their sexual orientation or gender identity , ” said John Dalhuisen , expert on discrimination at Amnesty International , in a statement .
“ It will stigmatize gay and lesbian people and expose advocates for their rights to the risk of censorship and financial penalties . ”
“ This law is an anachronism in the European Union , ” he added .
In its original version – approved by the Lithuanian parliament , the Seimas , in July – the bill would have barred the “ public dissemination ” of information favorable to being gay .
Proponents argued that the law was necessary because positive images of gay people would physically and mentally harm children .
President Dalia Grybauskaite expressed opposition to the original bill in July : “ I 'm very much upset that such kind of laws in Lithuania are possible , ” she told reporters at a news conference in Stockholm .
The law 's broad language banned any discussion of being gay except in a negative context , effectively legislating homophobia .
“ The Lithuanian authorities must not implement the law which discriminates against gay and lesbian people and restricts their freedom of expression , ” Dalhuisen added .
Geoffrey Boulton has tricked the hapless Muir Russell again .
Only a few days ago , Muir Russell assured us :
The Team will operate as openly and transparently as possible .
Russell said that the Team members were “ selected ” on the basis that they had “ no prejudicial interest in climate change and climate science ”
Do any of the Review team members have a predetermined view on climate change and climate science ?
No .
Members of the research team come from a variety of scientific backgrounds .
They were selected on the basis they have no prejudicial interest in climate change and climate science and for the contribution they can make to the issues the Review is looking at .
According to the BBC here , Muir Russell repeated this in a statement last week :
Sir Muir issued a statement last week claiming that the inquiry members , who are investigating leaked e-mails from the University of East Anglia , did not have a “ predetermined view on climate change and climate science ” .
The Inquiry gave specific assurance that Boulton did not have specific expertise in the “ climate change field itself ” :
Professor Geoffrey Boulton has expertise in fields related to climate change and is therefore aware of the scientific approach , through not in the climate change field itself .
In today ’s bombshell ( h/t Bishop Hill ) , Boulton said , in effect , that he had tricked poor Muir Russell .
While Russell may have intended to “ select ” Team members on “ the basis they have no prejudicial interest in climate change and climate science ” , Boulton had a different idea .
Throwing down a gauntlet against Muir Russell , Boulton said that , regardless of what Russell thinks , Boulton ’s opinion is that the “ committee needs someone like me who is close to the field of climate change ” .
Boulton told The Times :
“ I may be rapped over the knuckles by Sir Muir for saying this , but I think that statement needs to be clarified .
I think the committee needs someone like me who is close to the field of climate change and it would be quite amazing if that person did n’t have a view on one side or the other . ”
Previously , Boulton had sandbagged Russell in respect to his past connections to the University of East Anglia – still unreported at the Inquiry website – see here .
The Inquiry had stated :
None have any links to the Climatic Research Unit , or the United Nations ’ Independent Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
More information about each of the review team members can be found in the Biographies section .
Although Boulton ’s Inquiry biography does not mention it , Boulton was employed at the University of East Anglia for 18 years , 10 years overlapping with Phil Jones .
When confronted , Boulton said that he had had “ no professional contact with the University of East Anglia or the Climatic Research Unit ” .
But as recently as Oct 29 , 2009 , the Royal Society of Edinburgh ( Boulton is the General Secretary ) presented a program entitled “ The impact of climate change on Scotland ” , with presenters including Boulton himself , John Mitchell of the Met Office ( and FOI fame ) and an invited presenter from the University of East Anglia , Andrew Dlugolecki , described here as being a Visiting Fellow at the Climatic Research Unit itself ; a similar title is ascribed to Dlugolecki in an apparently current bio here .
Dlugolecki is a participant in a Royal Society of Edinburgh Inquiry “ Facing up to climate change ” see here .
This pdf is dated Jan 26 , 2010 and Dlugolecki ’s affiliation with the troubled UEA Climatic Research Unit was not mentioned by the Royal Society of Edinburgh .
The Boston Bruins ' first round pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft , Jordan Caron is fine - tuning his game in the QMJHL this season playing for the Rouyn - Noranda Huskies .
Caron started the season with the Rimouski Océanic , but was traded to the Huskies 20 games into the season .
Through 29 games this season , the 6 ' 2 " , 206 lb winger has recorded 34 points ( 15 - 19 - 34 ) to go along with a +34 rating .
I recently had the opportunity to ask Jordan a few questions :
What was it like attending the Bruins development camp last summer ?
Did you get a good feel for what it is going to be like playing for the Bruins organization ?
What did you gain from that experience ?
It was a great experience .
I had the chance to meet all the organization and all the guys my age , so it 's going to be much easier next year when I go to that camp again
How would you describe your game ?
I can play both sides of the ice very good , I like to go in front of the net and I have a good shot .
What do you think is the aspect of your game that needs the most work to reach the next level ?
I do n't skate bad , but I know I will have to improve my explosion to play in the NHL .
What was it like being able to represent your country at the World Juniors ?
Did you think you were going to able to have that opportunity after you suffered the broken collarbone during the summer ?
It was probably the best time of my life over there .
We had a great group of guys and the staff and the fans were awesome ... and yes , I always believe in my chances of making the team .
Bruins GM Peter Chiarelli was very impressed with your play at the World Juniors .
Has Chiarelli or anyone else from the Bruins organization kept in close contact with you since being drafted ?
Have they told you what their expectations for your development are or how they think you will fit into the organization ?
I talked a couple times with Don Sweeney since i got drafted .
You said after you were drafted that you grew up as a Montreal Canadiens fan .
Have you been able to convert your friends and family from Canadiens fans to Bruins fans ?
There were no problems with that .
I think as soon as the Bruins drafted me , all my familly were converted .
You were recently traded from the Rimouski Océanic to Rouyn - Noranda Huskies .
How are things going with your new team and what was your reaction when you found out you were traded ?
I am from Rimouski and I always played there so it was hard to realize that I would n't be playing there anymore , but since I got to Rouyn everything has been perfect .
The city is good .
We have good fans , a good organization , and a very good group of players , so I like it a lot here so far .
When did you find out that the Bruins were planning on taking you at # 25 ?
Did someone from the Bruins let you know that they planned on using the pick to select you or did you just find out when your name was called ?
I really had no idea when and who was going to pick me , so I only found out when they said my name .
Have you spent much time in Boston ?
What are your impressions of the city ?
I spent one week during the development camp this summer and another week during the main camp .
I did n't get to visit the city or anything but from what I 've seen and heard , it is a very nice city .
Special thanks are owed to Jordan Caron , Derek Zona from The Copper & Blue , and Mélanie Allard of the Rouyn - Noranda Huskies for making this interview happen .

Scientists have returned from Antarctic waters hoping their non-lethal methods will influence Japan 's policy of killing whales for research .
The first New Zealand - Australia Antarctic Whale Expedition to research whales in the Southern Ocean returned to Wellington yesterday after six weeks in the Ross Sea .
Seventeen scientists from Australia and New Zealand , and one from France , on Niwa ship Tangaroa collected small skin and blubber samples from 60 humpback whales , attached satellite tags to 30 whales and recorded the calls of blue whales .
Australian Environment Protection Minister Peter Garrett said yesterday the expedition had achieved significant milestones .
" The research undertaken on this expedition indicates that there are effective and achievable ways to collect a whole range of important whale data without the need to kill these mammals . "
The Japanese Government - sponsored Institute of Cetacean Research has said the expedition will have little impact on their policy of killing whales – as many as 1000 a year – for research .
The institute 's spokesman , New Zealander Glenn Inwood , said yesterday he would not comment until the scientists made public their research .
The 1986 ban on commercial whaling allows the mammals to be killed for research , but scientific grounds for the hunt have been criticised by anti-whaling groups .
Mr Garrett said results from the voyage would be presented to an International Whaling Commission meeting in Morocco in June .
Australian Antarctic Division senior whale biologist Nick Gales said the research should answer questions about whales ' feeding habits , breeding and migration .
" Hauling them up ... and measuring parts of them really is not the type of [ information ] that the IWC requires . "
New Zealand 's IWC representative , Sir Geoffrey Palmer , said the research with Australia showed a deep commitment to end commercial whaling .
Sir Geoffrey said the voyage would put scientific pressure on Japan , which he expected to take part in discussions at the IWC in June .
" You can find out what you need to know by non-lethal research .
That 's a big message . "
Science Minister Wayne Mapp said $ 14 million had been put in by the two countries , which had committed to a voyage every two years .
Auckland University biological scientist Rochelle Constantine said skin samples could reveal the sex of a whale , which whales in a group it was related to and which whale population it was from .
The blubber samples could tell scientists about a whale 's diet .
" The Japanese have not embraced the new technologies .
There 's more and more you can do from a small tissue sample .
It lays down the challenge to Japan that you do n't need to kill whales to research them . "
Battalion Fire Chief Mike
Kane said there were no injuries and there was no evidence of leakage from any of the five cars .
The derailed cars did not tip over .

THE good news is that more Texans are paying attention to social - studies lessons than ever before .
The bad news is that they suddenly have cause .
On March 12th , the state board of education voted for a series of changes to the state 's history and social - sciences curricula .
The changes look small enough — a word here and there , a new name included , maybe a different way of phrasing an issue .
But the overall effect , if the changes are approved in May , will to be to yank public education to the right .
The board alluded to the controversial amendments in a polite press release : " All those who died at the Alamo will be discussed in seventh grade Texas history classes .
Hip hop will not be part of the official curriculum standards . "
The most dramatic change is that Thomas Jefferson has gotten the boot .
The conservatives on the board deemed him to be a suspiciously secular figure .
The new guidelines would pay more fond attention to their favoured presidents , Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon .
Phyllis Schlafly and the National Rifle Association are in .
So are the Black Panthers .
Some of the oddest changes concern economics .
Milton Friedman and Friedrich von Hayek will join Adam Smith , John Maynard Keynes , and Karl Marx .
And the board decided that references to " capitalism " and the " free market " should be changed to say " free enterprise " , because capitalism has a bad reputation at the moment .
That decision is almost inexplicable .
Capitalism has been through a rough patch , but surely the term itself is no more inflammatory than free enterprise .
For critics , this is a blatant attempt to indoctrinate children .
At the New York Times , an economics blogger concluded that based on his number of scholarly citations , Hayek was the beneficiary of an " ideological subsidy " .
The board 's conservatives counter that their work is merely a corrective to academia 's liberal bent .
At the national level , some are concerned about the impact on other states .
Texas is such a big textbook market that publishers typically accommodate it .
It is quite clear how this happened .
There are 15 people on the board , ten Republicans and five Democrats .
But more important is that among the ten Republicans are seven fierce conservatives , along with three who are merely staunch .
This is no coincidence .
Over the years Republicans have worked to stack the deck with social conservatives .
The school board seats are , for the most part , small - money races .
A candidate could win with just a few thousand dollars .
Yet the board has some power , as last week 's vote showed , and a determinedly ideological bloc can organise accordingly .
To the victor go the spoils , in other words .
It is a clever bit of political strategy , and Democrats could do it too if they put their mind to it .
In the meantime , even Texas Republicans are growing weary of the board 's antics .
Before the social - studies fracas , there was a separate and even more pitched debate over whether creationism should be taught alongside evolution in science classes .
The ringleader of that effort was the board 's chairman , Don McLeroy .
On March 2nd he was defeated in a Republican primary .
His opponent , Tom Ratliff , is conservative too .
But on his campaign website Mr Ratliff parsed some differences between himself and Mr McLeroy : " I believe God created the Heavens and the Earth millions and millions of years ago .
I do not believe , as my opponent does , that the Earth is a mere few thousand years old , nor do I believe , as my opponent does , that dinosaurs and mankind lived at the same time . "
The Texas board may be evolving itself .
We 're all the children of amateurs : amateur parents .
There 's no government department that will certify you as a parent ( thankfully ) , nor a university department where you get your PhD in being a daddy , nor a professional body ready to strike you off for not following mothering standards .
But any parent who 's held a newborn child in their arms has unconsciously taken the amateur 's oath : " I may not be a professional , but I 'm going to do whatever it takes to act like one . "
It 's a pity that too often we associate amateur with amateurish , and dismiss amateurs as second - rate pretenders to a professional throne .
What we should remember is that the word amateur has its roots in the French word for love : amour .
And amateurs do for love what professionals do for money .
Of course , many professionals love what they do ( and are lucky enough to get paid for it ) , and many amateurs deserve to have the term amateurish applied to their efforts .
Having worked in amateur theatre , I know too well how misplaced enthusiasm can override sense resulting in a four - hour panto .
But amateurs helped build the world we live in .
At the beginnings of the scientific age , scientists themselves were amateurs .
They toiled away examining nature to understand why things are the way they are .
They invented physics , chemistry and biology .
Although modern science may appear to be the preserve of a well - financed laboratory run by a Nobel - quality mind , the amateur scientist is not on the endangered species list .
For example , amateurs play a crucial role in fields where large numbers of observations are needed .
There are too many stars , comets and asteroids for only professional astronomers to keep an eye on , so we should n't be surprised that Pluto was spotted by an amateur , Clyde Tombaugh , in 1930 .
And the whole field of radio astronomy got a kick start when , in 1937 , amateur Grote Reber built a 9 metre dish in his back garden and plotted the first radio map of the sky .
Keeping track of bird movements and numbers is greatly aided by flocks of amateur ornithologists who report their observations to bodies such as the British Trust for Ornithology , and amateur palaeontologists get in on the act when they uncover new fossils .
In 1990 , a sociologist uncovered unseen fossilised reptile tracks in New Mexico , much to the surprise of professional scientists .
Even weather forecasting relies partly on amateurs who take thousands of measurements of temperatures and rainfall and report them to the US National Weather Service .
Also in the US , the Society for Amateur Scientists helps promote the relationship between professionals and amateurs , showing the hobbyist how to communicate with professionals and how to get their work published and recognised .
Its founder , Shawn Carlson , won a MacArthur Foundation " genius award " in 1999 honouring his creation .
Amateurs are also doing well outside the sciences .
In popular music , many bands get their start in a garage playing instruments with no formal training .
Only very few musicians have spent years in a music academy , yet love for their music has brought us the Beatles , the Stones and every single rapper .
Likewise – they help build the world we live in , most authors are amateurs , partly because the money to be made from writing is so poor , and partly because it 's hard to get a job as an author .
You have to be one to become one .
I once asked the writer Alain de Botton about the role of amateurs .
He responded nervously that he would n't want to be operated on by an amateur brain surgeon , or flown by an amateur pilot .
So I steered him back to the safer ground of amateur philosophy .
In any pub in Britain you 'll find plenty of Friday - night philosophers waxing lyrical .
But even in the world of serious philosophy , amateurs outrank the professionals .
Many of the great philosophers were amateurs , from Schopenhauer and Nietzsche to Sartre .
De Botton puts this down to university philosophy departments being so poor .
But perhaps there 's another reason : if there 's one subject we all study and can be passionate about , it 's the human experience .
So watch out when you 're down the pub : you might be sitting beside the next Nietzsche .
Or at least a bloke who counts butterflies for the sheer love of it .

Haiti Earthquake aid should go to Haiti 's popular organizations , not to contractors or NGOs Noam Chomsky Post - Earthquake interview by For decades , Noam Chomsky has been an analyst and activist working in support of the Haitian people .
In addition to his revolutionary linguistics career at MIT , he has written , lectured and protested against injustice for 40 years .
He is co-author , along with Paul Farmer and Amy Goodman of " Getting Haiti Right This Time : The U.S. and the Coup . "
His analysis “ The Tragedy of Haiti ” from his 1993 book Year 501 : The Conquest Continues is available for free online .
This interview was conducted in late February 2010 by phone and email .
It was first published in ¡ Reclama ! magazine .
The interviewer thanks Peter Hallward for his kind assistance .
Keane Bhatt : Recently you signed a letter to the Guardian protesting the militarization of emergency relief .
It criticized a prioritization of security and military control to the detriment of rescue and relief .
Noam Chomsky : I think there was an overemphasis in the early stage on militarization rather than directly providing relief .
I do n’t think it has any long - term significance ... the United States has comparative advantage in military force .
It tends to react to anything at first with military force , that ’s what it ’s good at .
And I think they overdid it .
There was more military force than was necessary ; some of the doctors that were in Haiti , including those from Partners in Health who have been there for a long time , felt that there was an element of racism in believing that Haitians were going to riot and they had to be controlled and so on , but there was very little indication of that ; it was very calm and quiet .
The emphasis on militarization did probably delay somewhat the provision of relief .
I went along with the general thrust of the petition that there was too much militarization .
Keane Bhatt : IF this militarization of relief was not intentionally extreme but rather just a default response of the US , is it just serendipity that there is a massive troop presence available to manage the rapidly mounting popular protests post - earthquake ?
Surprisingly large , politicized group comprised of survivors has already mobilized around demanding Aristide ’s return , French reparations instead of charity , and so on .
Noam Chomsky :
So far , at least , I do n’t know of any employment of the troops to subdue protests .
It might come , but I suspect a more urgent concern is the impending disaster of the rainy season , terrible to contemplate .
Keane Bhatt : Regarding relief work , aside from Partners in Health , Al Jazeera noted that the Cuban medical team was the first to set up medical facilities among the debris and constitutes the largest contingent of medical workers in Haiti , something that preceded the earthquake .
If their performance in Pakistan [ earthquake of 2005 ] is any indicator , they will probably be the last to leave .
Cuba seems to have an exemplary , decades - long conduct in foreign assistance .
Noam Chomsky : Well , the Cubans were already there before the earthquake .
They had a couple hundred doctors there .
And yes , they sent doctors very quickly ; they had medical facilities there very quickly .
Venezuela also sent aid quite quickly ; Venezuela was also the first country and the only country at any scale to cancel totally the debt .
There was considerable debt to Venezuela because of PetroCaribe , and it ’s rather striking that Venezuela and Cuba were not invited to the donors ’ meeting in Montreal .
Actually the prime minister of Haiti , Bellerive , went out of his way to thank three countries : the Dominican Republic , Cuba and Venezuela for their rapid provision of aid .
What Al Jazeera said about Pakistan is quite correct .
In that terrible earthquake a couple of years ago , the Cubans were really the only ones who went into the very difficult areas high up in the mountains where it ’s very hard to live .
They ’re the ones who stayed after everyone else left .
And none of that gets reported in the United States .
But the fact of the matter is , whatever you think about Cuba , its internationalism is pretty dramatic .
And the people who ’ve been working in Haiti for years have been awestruck by Cuban medical aid as they were in Pakistan , in fact .
That ’s an old story .
I mean , the Cuban contribution to the liberation of Africa is just overwhelming .
And you can find that in scholarship , but the public does n’t know anything about it .
Keane Bhatt :
On that point , you ’ve talked about how “ states are not moral agents .
They act in their own interests .
And that means the interests of powerful forces within them . ”
How does the history of exemplary humanitarian work as Cuban state policy relate to that thought ?
Noam Chomsky :
Well , I think it ’s just been a core part of the Cuban revolution to have a very high level of internationalism .
I mean , these cases you ’ve mentioned are cases in point , but the most extreme case was the liberation of Africa .
Take the case of Angola for example , and there are real connections between Cuba and Angola — much of the Cuban population comes from Angola .
But South Africa , with US support , after the fall of the Portuguese empire , invaded Angola and Mozambique to establish their own puppet regime there .
They were trying to protect Namibia , to protect apartheid , and nobody did much about it ; but the Cubans sent forces , and furthermore they sent black soldiers and they defeated a white mercenary army , which not only rescued Angola but it sent a shock throughout the continent — it was a psychic shock — white mercenaries were purported to be invincible , and a black army defeated them and sent them back fleeing into South Africa .
Well that gave a real shot in the arm to the liberation movements , and it also was a lesson to the white South Africans that the end is coming .
They ca n’t just hope to subdue the continent on racist grounds .
Now , it did n’t end the wars .
The South African attacks in Angola and Mozambique continued until the late 1980s , with strong US support .
And it was no joke .
According to the UN estimates they killed a million and a half people in Angola and Mozambique , nothing slight .
Nevertheless , the Cuban intervention had a huge effect , also on other countries of Africa .
And one the most striking aspects of it is that they took no credit for it .
They wanted credit to be taken by the nationalist movements in Africa .
So in fact none of this was even known until an American researcher , Piero Gleijeses unearthed the evidence from the Cuban archives and African sources and published it in scholarly journals and a scholarly book , and it ’s just an astonishing story but barely known — one out of a million people has ever heard of it .
Keane Bhatt : You mentioned the Venezuelan debt cancellation .
At the same time , the G7 is in the process of eliminating bilateral debt .
Why is that ?
Noam Chomsky :
Well they ’re talking about it , yeah .
The Venezuelans were first .
And they just completely canceled the debt .
G7 refused .
In the Montreal meeting , they refused to even discuss it .
Later , they indicated that they might do something .
Maybe they ’re embarrassed by the Venezuelan action .
But I ’m not sure how it ’s playing out .
As far as the IMF is concerned — the IMF is basically an offshoot of the US Treasury Department — they ’ve talked about it but so far they have not agreed , as far as I can discover , to cancel the debt .
Keane Bhatt : Bellerive , Prime Minister of Haiti , thanked the Dominican Republic , Cuba and Venezuela .
The DR has been lauded for its relief efforts : providing food , materials and medical care , for example .
But at the same time there are reports from the border of Dominican troops forcibly deporting family members of Haitian patients and sometimes even the patients themselves , in Jimaní , for example .
What is your take on these contrary developments taking place and is there any historical context that you would like to add ?
Noam Chomsky : Well , what the Dominican Republic does is up to Dominicans to decide , but the much more striking thing from my perspective , is that the United States has not brought in any — barely any refugees — even for medical treatment .
And that was harshly condemned by the dean of the University of Miami Medical School who thought it was just criminal not to bring Haitians to Miami where there ’s marvelous medical facilities while they have to do surgery with , you know , hacksaws in Haiti .
And in fact one of the first US reactions to the earthquake was to send in the Coast Guard to ensure that there would n’t be any attempt to flee from Haiti .
I mean , that ’s atrocious .
The United States is the richest country in the world , it ’s right next door to Haiti .
It should be offering every possible means of assistance to Haitians .
Furthermore there ’s a little bit of background here .
I mean , the earthquake in Haiti was a class - based catastrophe .
It did n’t much harm the wealthy elite up in the hills , they were shaken but not destroyed .
On the other hand the people who were living in the miserable urban slums , huge numbers of them , they were devastated .
Maybe a couple hundred thousand were killed .
How come they were living there ?
They were living there because of — it goes back to the French colonial system — but in the past century , they were living there because of US policies , consistent policies .
Keane Bhatt :
You ’re talking about the forcible decimation of peasant agriculture in the 1990s ?
Noam Chomsky :
It started with Woodrow Wilson .
When Wilson invaded all of Hispaniola , Haiti and the DR , the Wilson invasion was pretty brutal in both parts of Hispaniola .
But it was much worse in Haiti .
And the reasons were very clearly stated .
Keane Bhatt : Racism .
Noam Chomsky : Yeah .
The State Department said , well , the Dominicans have some European blood so they ’re not quite so bad .
But the Haitians are pure nigger .
So Wilson sent the marines to disband the Haitian parliament because they would n’t permit US corporations to buy up Haitian lands .
And he forced them to do it .
Well , that ’s one of the many atrocities and crimes .
Just keeping to this , that accelerated the destruction of Haitian agriculture and the flight of people from the countryside to the cities .
Now that continued under Reagan .
Under Reagan , USAID and the World Bank set up very explicit programs , explicitly designed to destroy Haitian agriculture .
They did n’t cover it up .
They gave an argument that Haiti should n’t have an agricultural system , it should have assembly plants ; women working to stitch baseballs in miserable conditions .
Well that was another blow to Haitian agriculture , but nevertheless even under Reagan , Haiti was producing most of its own rice when Clinton came along .
When Clinton restored Aristide — Clinton of course supported the military junta , another little hidden story ... he strongly supported it in fact .
He even allowed the Texaco Oil Company to send oil to the junta in violation of presidential directives ; Bush Sr. did so as well — well , he finally allowed the president to return , but on condition that he accept the programs of Marc Bazin , the US candidate that he had defeated in the 1990 election .
And that meant a harsh neoliberal program , no import barriers .
That means that Haiti has to import rice and other agricultural commodities from the US from US agribusiness , which is getting a huge part of its profits from state subsidies .
So you get highly subsidized US agribusiness pouring commodities into Haiti ; I mean , Haitian rice farmers are efficient but nobody can compete with that , so that accelerated the flight into the cities .
And it was n’t that they did n’t know it was going to happen .
USAID was publishing reports in 1995 saying , yes this is going to destroy Haitian agriculture and that ’s a good thing .
And you get the flight into the cities and you get food riots in 2008 , because they can’t produce their own food .
And now you get this class - based catastrophe .
After this history — it ’s only a tiny piece of it — the United States should be paying massive reparations , not just aid .
And France as well .
The French role is grotesque .
Keane Bhatt : May I ask , regarding Aristide ’s languishing in exile , was he right to go back to Haiti in 1994 in the way that he did , with US troops ?
Also , was he right to agree , under enormous pressure of course , to the neoliberal reforms laid out in the Paris Accords ?
Noam Chomsky :
Well , I happened to be in Haiti almost at that time — 1993 .
I was there for a while ; this was the peak of the terror .
And I ’ve been in a lot of awful places in the world .
Some of the worst , in fact .
But I do n’t think I ’ve ever seen anything like the misery and the terror that was going on in Haiti under the junta , with Clinton ’s backing at that time .
And there was a lot of discussion , I talked for example to the late Father Gerard Jean - Juste , one of the most popular figures in Haiti , who the government recently forced out , he was then underground in a church but Haitian friends took me to him .
He was very close to large parts of the population .
I talked to labor leaders who ’d been beaten and tortured but were willing to talk , and to activists and others .
And what most of them said is , Father Jean - Juste for example , what he said is , “ Look , I do n’t want a marine invasion , I think it ’s a bad idea .
But on the other hand , ” he said , “ my people , the people in the slums — La Saline , Cite Soleil and so on , they just ca n’t take it anymore . ”
He said , “ the torture is too awful , the terror is too awful .
They ’ll accept anything that ’ll put an end to it . ”
And that was the dilemma .
I do n’t have an answer to that .
Keane Bhatt : Was Aristide wrong to argue against calls ( made by some of his more militant supporters ) for armed struggle inside Haiti to restore democracy after the 1991 coup ?
Noam Chomsky : Not in my opinion .
Armed struggle would have led to a horrendous slaughter .
Keane Bhatt : On February 17th , Sarkozy was greeted to street protests by thousands of Haitians holding up images of Aristide , demanding his return , and demanding reparations for what the French extorted in exchange for recognizing Haiti ’s independence .
At that same address , Preval was shouted down and he withdrew into his jeep .
With this kind of sentiment brewing in Haiti right now , do you see Aristide ’s return as an important priority , or is it something that might be desirable but not that pressing ?
Noam Chomsky :
Well , the answer to that question is going to be given in Washington .
The United States and France , the two traditional torturers of Haiti , essentially kidnapped Aristide in 2004 after having blocked any international aid to the country under very dubious pretexts , not credible grounds , which of course extremely harmed this fragile economy .
There was chaos and the US and France and Canada flew in , kidnapped Aristide — they said they rescued him , they actually kidnapped him — they flew him off to Central Africa , his party Fanmi Lavalas is banned , which probably accounts for the very low turnout in the recent elections , and the United States has been trying to keep Aristide not only from Haiti , but from the entire hemisphere .
Keane Bhatt :
By which way is Aristide compelled to remain exiled ?
How exactly is his persona non grata status in the hemisphere maintained and by whom ?
What is preventing him from flying into a sympathetic country near Haiti , like Venezuela , for example ?
Noam Chomsky :
He might be able to go to Venezuela , but if he tried to go to the Dominican Republic , for example , they would n’t let him in .
And there ’s good reason for that .
International affairs is very much like the mafia , and the small storekeeper does n’t offend the Godfather .
It ’s too dangerous .
We can pretend it ’s otherwise , but that ’s the way it is .
There was one country , I think it was Jamaica if I remember correctly , that did allow Aristide in , over serious US pressure and protest .
And not a lot of countries are willing to take the risk of offending the United States .
It ’s a dangerous , violent superpower .
I do n’t have to tell you , you know the history of the Dominican Republic .
I do n’t have to tell you about it — that ’s the way it works .
Keane Bhatt : Using , as you ’ve said , the historical US legacy in the DR , can we turn to recent Dominican history ?
As this humanitarian aid is provided on behalf of the DR , and it fills in the vacuum left by a weak Haitian state , if we go back to the events leading up to the coup of 2004 , it worked under US aegis to actively destabilize Haiti by training the paramilitary rebels , Guy Philippe and Louis Jodel Chamblain … Noam Chomsky : I know .
And providing a base for them .
Keane Bhatt :
Is there some kind of a contradiction to provide charity for people who you ’ve actually worked to dismantle and destabilize ?
Noam Chomsky :
Well , you can call it a contradiction if you like , but it ’s also a contradiction for Sarkozy and Clinton to appear in Haiti without abject apologies for the terrible crimes that France and the U.S. under Clinton , particularly , have carried out against Haiti .
But they do n’t do it .
The head of Toyota has to go to Congress and apologize for hours because some people were killed by Toyota cars , but does Clinton have to go and apologize for what he did to Haiti ?
He dealt a death blow .
Does Sarkozy have to apologize for the fact that Haiti was France ’s richest colony and a source of a lot of France ’s wealth and they destroyed the country and then posed an indemnity as a price for liberating themselves , which the country was never able to get out of ?
A couple of years ago , in 2002 I think , Aristide appealed to France , to Chirac , to pay some remuneration for the huge debt that Haiti had to pay them …
Keane Bhatt : Twenty - one billion dollars …
Noam Chomsky : Yeah , for this huge debt that Haiti had to pay them .
And they did set up a commission led by Regis Debray , a former radical .
And the commission said that France has no need to give any compensation at all .
In other words , first we rob and then destroy them , and then when they ask for a little bit of help , we kick them in the face .
It ’s not surprising .
Keane Bhatt :
Although at the same time there are sources that say that while France put up an indifferent front , it was actually worried about a head of state bringing a legal case with overwhelming documentary evidence for international arbitration .
Noam Chomsky :
Well , they really did n’t have to worry , because the way power politics works , the World Court ca n’t do anything .
Look , there ’s one country in the world at the moment which has refused to accept World Court decision — that ’s the United States .
Is anybody going to do anything about it ?
Keane Bhatt :
You mentioned Clinton , now UN special envoy to Haiti , who intends to woo foreign investors and continue on a low - wage textile focus for Haitian economic development .
The lens of neoliberal economist Paul Collier , special adviser to the UN in 2009 , dominates the UN perspective of Haiti .
An advocate of sweatshop - led growth himself , he ’s lavished praise on the much - resented MINUSTAH occupation force there , and has even said that the Dominican Republic " is not engaged in the sort of activities , such as clandestine support for guerrilla groups , that beset many other fragile states . ”
Can a true humanitarian like Paul Farmer — representing a different development model based on fair wages , public health , strengthening the Haitian state — influence the UN as deputy special envoy ?
Noam Chomsky :
It 's a hard choice .
I do n't blame him for trying .
We live in this world , not another one that we 'd prefer , and sometimes it 's necessary to follow painful paths if we hope to provide at least a little help for suffering people .
Like Father Jean - Juste and the marines .
Keane Bhatt :
You ’ve talked about how the media created an artificial distinction between the South American ‘ Bad Left ’ and ‘ Good Left , ’ omitting Brazil 's important collaboration with Venezuela in the interest of maintaining this view .
However , with respect to Haiti , has n’t Brazil legitimately earned a secure place within the ‘ Good Left ’ ?
A center - left government of the South has spearheaded the MINUSTAH occupation and has pledged to increase its presence , after taking it over from the imperial architects of the coup ( US , France , Canada ) .
What factors made it so vigorous in supporting another deposed president of an equally geopolitically - unimportant country in recent times ( Zelaya of Honduras ) ?
Noam Chomsky : Good questions .
I have n't seen anything useful on Brazil 's decisions on these matters .
Keane Bhatt :
Any comments on the US media regarding Haiti following the earthquake ?
For example , Pat Robertson ’s ‘ pact with the devil , ’ David Brooks ’ ‘ progress - resistant culture , ’ pleas with transnational capital to create more sweatshops ( Kirstof ) , Aristide being a despot and a cheat ( Jon Lee Anderson ) .
Even Amy Wilentz has compared Aristide to Duvalier in the New York Times .
Noam Chomsky :
It 's been mainly awful , but I have n't kept a record .
The worst part is ignoring our own disgraceful role in helping to create the catastrophe , and consequent refusal to react as any decent person should — with massive reparations , directed to popular organizations .
Same with France .
Keane Bhatt : I guess my final question is for the future : there have been a discouraging two decades , from 1990 - 2010 , about the popular mobilization for political change in Haiti , and how to proceed , and I guess now that the Haitian people have struggled so hard through parliamentary democracy for 25 years and have so little to show for it , what are the lessons learned and possible strategies now that they ’ve exhausted this parliamentary , democratic approach ?
Two coups d’etat and thousands tortured and murdered in this process .
Noam Chomsky :
The lessons are , unfortunately , that a small weak country that is facing an extremely hostile and very violent superpower will not make much progress unless there ’s a strong solidarity movement within the superpower that will restrain its actions .
With more support within the United States , I think the Haitian efforts could have succeeded .
And that applies right now .
Take the aid that ’s coming in .
There is aid coming in — we have to show we ’re nice people and so on .
But the aid ought to be going to Haitian popular organizations .
Not to contractors , not to NGOs — to Haitian popular organizations , and they ’re the ones that should be deciding what to do with it .
Well you know , that ’s not the agenda of G7 .
They do n’t want popular organizations ; they do n’t like popular movements ; they do n’t like democracy for that matter .

The Reason So Many People Are Unemployed
Around the time of the Great Depression , a man named John Maynard Keynes made an incredible discovery .
The reason so many people were out of work was not really because of irresponsible banks or high taxes or reckless government policy .
It was really much simpler than all that : there was n’t enough money .
Now , as individuals , we ’d all like a little more money for ourselves .
But pause for a moment and think about what it means if there is n’t enough money in the economy as a whole .
A good way to wrap your head around this is to think about a much smaller case : instead of the whole economy , let ’s think about a now - famous babysitting co-op on Capitol Hill .
Instead of dollars , the co-op used its own scrip that was worth an hour of babysitting time .
When you wanted to go out , you ’d pay a couple hours to someone else to watch your kids ; then when they wanted to go out , they ’d pay you or someone else to do the same for them .
It all worked great for a while , until one day they found they had too few pieces of scrip .
Every couple had only a couple hours left and , having so little , they did n’t want to waste it .
So they all decided to save it for a very special occasion .
This was kind of an incredible situation — even though there were people who wanted someone to babysit their kids , and people who were willing to do just that , the deal did n’t happen , simply because the co-op had n’t printed enough colored pieces of paper .
Eventually the co-op learned their mistake , printed some more scrip and handed it out , and everybody went back to babysitting like before and were much happier for it .
The same thing happens in the real economy .
When there are n’t enough green - colored pieces of paper around , everybody gets worried and holds on to the little they have .
Even if you ’d like someone to build an extension on your house , and there ’s someone else out there who ’d like to build an extension on your house , the deal does n’t happen , just because you do n’t have enough green pieces of paper ( or , more realistically , dollars in your bank account ) .
This is a total waste .
You do n’t get the extension and the other guy does n’t get a job , all because we have n’t run the printing presses enough ( or added enough zeroes to the bank ’s computers ) .
Before the Great Depression , most countries would n’t simply print more colored pieces of paper .
They were on the “ gold standard ” and they would only print more currency when more gold was discovered .
This led to the most bizarre series of booms and busts as more gold was discovered in strange places and then “ used up ” by population growth or other things .
After Keynes , countries eventually stopped this silliness and just started printing their money directly .
As soon as they abandoned the gold standard , they begun recovering from the Great Depression .
But the power to print more money is obviously a very special power and you would n’t want it to fall into the wrong hands .
So , in the United States , we ’ve taken it away from elected politicians and given it ( mostly ) to the big banks .
The banks select people to run their local Federal Reserve and then some of those people ( along with some additional folks nominated by the President ) are selected to be members of a group called the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) .
The FOMC , essentially , decides how much money there should be in circulation , which in turn decides how many people have jobs .
You might think this sounds crazy — a bunch of unelected bankers get to decide how many people have jobs ? — and , in fact , it is crazy .
But I ’m not making it up .
Ask a macroeconomist , like Paul Krugman , and this is exactly what he ’ll tell you .
And if you look in the Federal Reserve Act or on the Fed ’s website , you ’ll find their mission is to “ promote effectively the goals of maximum employment , stable prices , and moderate long - term interest rates . ”
These multiple goals are relatively recent ; before 1978 , the goal was simply “ maximum employment , production , and purchasing power . ”
Now some people will claim that the Federal Reserve has done all it can to create more jobs but the recession is so deep this time that there ’s nothing else it can do .
But that ’s just not true — even the chairman of the Federal Reserve , Ben Bernanke , says it ’s not true .
He was asked about this in a Senate hearing .
As the Economist summarized his response : “ Mr Bernanke does not want to risk a de-anchoring of inflation expectations .
He is willing to accept 10 % or greater unemployment and the resulting economic and political fall - out in order to avoid that risk . ”
Which brings us to the subject of inflation .
Obviously if you print a lot of new money , it makes existing money worth a little less .
This is annoying , but is it worse than having people out of work ?
Well , it depends who you are .
If you have a lot of money , you ’re more worried about it becoming worth less .
But if you work for a living , you ’re more worried about people being out of work .
As you might expect , Mr. Bernanke has a lot of money , as do the other bankers on the committee and the people who selected them .
So they ’ve decided to let millions and millions of people be unemployed and the rest of us experience the resulting recession rather than risk the chance that some of their money might be worth a little less .
The biggest reason this is possible is because nobody realizes it .
If it was conventional wisdom that a bunch of unelected bankers looking out for rich people were the reason everyone was out of work , politicians would be forced to explain to angry voters why we had this crazy system and might actually consider doing something about it .
But , incredibly , it just seems like nobody has any idea .
Voters do n’t realize it , politicians do n’t understand it , journalists do n’t cover it .
And , in fact , they ’re so far from having any idea that it ’s really difficult to explain it to them .
When you say a bunch of unelected bankers are the reason there are no jobs , they just look at you like you ’re crazy .
I ’ve just spent a page or two explaining it and you still probably think I ’m crazy .
But it ’s true !
This is n’t some Ron Paul - type crackpot idea ; this is mainstream economics , from Paul Krugman to the head of George W. Bush ’s Council of Economic Advisors .
I feel a bit like the guy in one of those movies , going around and telling everyone that the murderer is standing right over there — right there , look ! — but nobody believes him and people continue to die .
It ’s incredibly frustrating , and I have no idea what to do about it .
One final point :
How did we get into this mess in the first place ?
Why did we suddenly find ourselves without enough money ?
Well , there was a housing bubble : for many years , house prices kept going up and up for no other reason than everyone was betting that they were just going to keep going up .
When house prices were unsustainably high , that was part of the money in circulation .
But when the music stopped and the bubble popped , house prices cratered and nearly $ 8 trillion disappeared overnight .
The government has printed a bunch of money since then , but nowhere near the $ 8 trillion we lost .
Obviously a lot of other bad stuff happened during the financial crisis , but this is the reason everybody is out of work .

The Albanian state flag is flown widely in ethnic Albanian parts of Kosovo A UN expert has said Albania is holding up inquiries into reports that Serbs captured during the 1998 - 99 Kosovo war were butchered for their organs there .
UN special rapporteur Philip Alston said the Council of Europe , Serbia and the EU authorities in Kosovo were all investigating the reports .
He called on Albania to allow an independent inquiry .
Albanian PM
Sali Berisha has dismissed the allegations as fiction and says they have already been investigated .
International attention was drawn to the alleged crimes in 2008 when former UN war crimes prosecutor Carla Del Ponte revealed in her memoirs that her team had investigated reports that around 300 Serbs held in Albania had had organs removed , apparently for sale to foreign clinics .
None of the efforts to investigate have received meaningful co-operation on the side of the government of Albania
Philip Alston
UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions According to her book , UN investigators searched a house in the Albanian town of Burrel in 2004 after receiving reports that Kosovo Albanian militants had used it as a base for removing Serbs ' organs before killing them .
" The investigators found pieces of gauze , a used syringe and two plastic IV bags encrusted with mud and empty bottles of medicine , some of which was of a muscle relaxant often used in surgical operations , " Ms Del Ponte wrote .
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia said its judges had never received evidence in support of the allegations .
During the Kosovo war , which ended with Serbia withdrawing its forces from the province after a Nato bombing campaign and an eventual unilateral declaration of independence by the ethnic Albanian majority , thousands of people were killed , most of them ethnic Albanians .
' Diplomatic ping pong '
Last year , Albania rejected a Serbian request for an investigation into the alleged abductions and killings .
Speaking to reporters in the Albanian capital Tirana , Mr Alston said the authorities in Albania strongly believed that the allegations were " politically motivated and absolutely without any foundation " .
" On this basis , none of the efforts to investigate have received meaningful co-operation on the side of the government of Albania . "
His own inquiries in Albania had met with a " game of bureaucratic and diplomatic ping pong " , said Mr Alston , who is the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions .
" The bottom line is that the issue is definitely stalled , " he added .
" All Albanian officials I have met with consider the claims , charges of killings , as ridiculous , " he said .
" If it is ridiculous , in order to get rid of this issue , make available a proposal for an independent investigation and offer genuine co-operation . "
Serbia welcomed the UN expert 's call for an independent investigation .
" That would be the right path to find out the truth and achieve full regional co-operation , " Bruno Vekaric , a spokesman for Serbia 's war crimes prosecutor , told Reuters news agency .

Who will save Margaret Page ?
28 March 2010
Media Release
Who will save Margaret Page ?
Margaret Page has resolved to kill herself .
She is starving herself to death , has not taken food for twelve days and has taken only a small amount of water .
She is enduring a long and painful death .
She is 60 years of age , suffered a cerebral haemorrhage 20 years ago and has been living for four years in the St John of God Care in Wellington .
This tragic case raises many important questions for the community .
Margaret ’s life is important she is a unique and unrepeatable miracle of God ’s loving creation .
The taking of one ’s life is contrary to the moral law .
Our life is a gift from God .
We are but stewards , not owners , of the life God has entrusted to us .
The decision to kill oneself , is not a rational decision .
She has been assessed by psychiatrists as being lucid , but was she also assessed as being severely depressed and if so , why is she not being treated for this condition ?
The management of St John of God Care claim that they have complied with their legal obligations .
Otago University ’s Professor John Dawson , an expert in mental health law said that the Bill of Rights Act recognised a person ’s right to refuse treatment .
“ To force food on someone is actually an assault on them . ”
The Chief Executive Officer , Ralph La Salle of St John of God Care , stated , “ We cannot force Mrs Page to eat .
Under the Bill of Rights
Act she has the right and is asserting her right to refuse treatment , which includes the provision of food and water . ”
These statements are challenged .
It is morally and legally acceptable to refuse medical treatment that is burdensome or futile .
Food and hydration are not medical treatment but the necessities of life .
It is a great injustice and a violation of human rights to withhold food and hydration from any person on the grounds that it is medical treatment .
Dr Tricia Briscoe , chairman of the ethics committee of the New Zealand Medical Association stated that Mrs Page ’s actions were not the responsibility of doctors .
A doctor was responsible for alleviating a patient ’s suffering , not to ward off death .
Even though doctors could not assist in suicide , they could give painkillers that hasten death .
Right to Life contends that doctors have a responsibility of care , especially for the weak and vulnerable .
The first principle of medical practice is to do no harm .
It is contended that the first duty of a doctor is to protect the life of his patient .
Mrs Page ’s distraught husband says his wife ’s life will now end in a final irony – the professionals who are caring for her are now involved in what amounts to assisted suicide .
Auckland criminal lawyer , Shane Tait , has stated that doctors could intervene to save Mrs Page ’s life .
If they did so , a conviction for assault was unlikely to be successful .
The Crimes Act , Section 41 , states ; everyone is justified in using reasonable force to prevent suicide .
Right to Life asks when will someone in authority intervene to save the life of Margaret Page ?

RBS warns the move could damage its attempts to recover from the financial crisis
The UK Treasury could be dictating bonus payouts at Royal Bank of Scotland for several years after seizing the power to shape the partially nationalised bank 's 2009 bonus pool .
RBS has revealed that it has reluctantly surrendered the right to decide how any bonuses should be paid for the current financial year , warning that it could harm the bank 's ability to recruit and retain staff .
In a circular to shareholders , RBS said it has granted the Treasury the right to " consent to the quantum and shape of the 2009 bonus pool " , as part of the terms of joining the government 's asset protection scheme ( APS ) .
" The board has agreed to this requirement solely on the basis that it is an essential part of the overall agreements for the refinancing of the group and accession to the APS , " it said .
RBS warned , though , that the move could damage its attempts to recover from the financial crisis .
" This requirement may adversely impact RBS 's ability to attract and retain senior managers and other key employees and thereby place RBS at a significant competitive disadvantage against its competitors as well as increasing the risks facing RBS and weakening management 's ability to deal with them , " it told its shareholders .
Investors are due to vote on RBS 's entry to the APS at a meeting on 15 December .
While the circular only refers to the 2009 bonus pool , it is expected that the Treasury will hold the power to consent to bonus payouts for as long as the bank continues to ask the government to insure its risky investments .
Public anger
The UK government currently owns 70 % of RBS .
This stake is managed by UKFI , and will rise to 85 % once the bank joins the APS - when it will receive another £ 25.5 bn from the taxpayer .
RBS can exit the scheme at any stage , but is expected to need the protection for several years .
Shares in RBS fell by over 5 % this morning , to 32.43 p , making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 .
Other banks also fell , as the fallout from the Dubai debt crisis continued to worry investors .
The public anger over banking bonuses has grown in recent months after it emerged that some financial institutions , such as Goldman Sachs , are making large profits again despite the recession .
But there are concerns in the City that the government could use its position as the largest shareholder in RBS for political means .
The Association of British Insurers , which represents major shareholders , is expected to issue an " amber top " warning to shareholders , possibly as soon as later today .
The warning is a sign that the ABI believes investors face a difficult decision when choosing whether or not to back entry into the APS .
Peter Montagnon , director of investment affairs at the ABI , said it was important that RBS was still able to pay its staff " commercial rates " .
" It would not be acceptable to yield to the short - term wishes of one shareholder if this means sacrificing value for all , " Montagnon warned .
Ronnie Fox , head of law firm
Fox , said the government 's decision to take control of RBS 's 2009 bonus pool was a " vote - catching " exercise that would harm the bank .
" Remuneration issues for the vast majority of staff are a matter for which a company 's management alone should be responsible .
If the shareholders , the owners of the business , are unhappy with the decisions taken by the management , they have the power to remove the management , " Fox said .
" It is a gross understatement to say that the interference by the Treasury will pose a ' challenge ' for management .
If total compensation ( including bonuses ) paid to profit - generating executives at RBS is significantly lower than competitive organisations are paying their senior staff , RBS will simply lose its best people . "

Brand names fight to stay in stores
As retailers adjust to tight - fisted shoppers , many stores are shrinking the number of name - brand products -- including detergents -- on their shelves .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Do n't be shocked if you can't find your favorite salad dressing or mouthwash on your next trip to Wal - Mart .
Large retailers -- including Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) , the world 's biggest -- are wrestling with having too many types of brand - name products .
At the same time , shoppers are buying less and looking for bargains .
So unless a particular brand is a top seller in its category , it 's getting knocked off the shelf -- and sometimes getting replaced by a cheaper store brand .
For example , Wal - Mart recently removed Glad and Hefty - branded storage bags from shelves , replacing them with its own lower - priced Great Value brand , according to the parent companies of both products .
In the case of Hefty , parent Pactiv Corp. ( PTV ) told CNNMoney.com that Wal - Mart reversed its decision , and will return its products to shelves this spring -- after Pactiv agreed to make the Great Value bags that will sell alongside the competing Hefty product .
" Hefty was off Wal - Mart 's shelves , but we are being brought back , " said Matt Gonring , spokesman for Pactiv Corp .
Bill Pecoriello , CEO of market research firm ConsumerEdge Research , expects Wal - Mart and other sellers will trim several name - brands across categories in coming months , or negotiate deals to get better pricing .
According to Pecoriello , those categories at greatest risk of losing brands are everyday - type purchases such as household products , toiletries and food staples .
These are also categories in which retailers have aggressively pushed their own house brands .
" If you consider the economics of this , if Wal - Mart can build customer loyalty for its own brand , which is also cheaper - priced and cheaper to stock than name - brands , then it will , " he said .
Heavyweight
Moves such as this are significant given Wal - Mart 's heavyweight status in the retail industry .
" Any change that Wal - Mart makes with its product assortment has enormous implications for the entire industry , " said Ali Dibadj , senior analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co .
Wal - Mart declined comment for this story .
Wal - Mart is not the only one doing this , according to Dibadj .
He says leading drug store chains , including CVS and Walgreens , grocers such as Kroger ( KR , Fortune 500 ) , and Wal - Mart 's rival discounter , Target ( TGT , Fortune 500 ) , are also looking to simplify their store shelves .
In good economic times , product variety is a must for retailers .
But in down times , when shoppers are n't buying much , variety can be a burden .
" Wal - Mart 's a little fed up , " said Lora Cecera , retail expert and partner at strategy consulting firm Altimeter Group .
" I think the feeling is that as these companies keep extending their [ product ] lines , it 's only causing confusion for shoppers and not really driving them to buy more products . "
As a consumer , she asked , " Do I really need to decide between 15 different types of toothpaste when I go to a store ? "
Dawn Willoughby , vice president - general manager of Glad brand for the Clorox Co. ( CLX , Fortune 500 ) , agreed .
" On an industry level , we 've been talking about simplifying product assortment for a long time , " said Willoughby .
" If you walk into a Wal - Mart or another large retail chain , there are so many products on shelves that it does make it harder to shop . "
Let 's make a deal
Besides cutting clutter , industry experts say Wal - Mart and other retailers are looking for more lucrative deals from suppliers on both prices and advertising .
In one recent example , according to published reports , Wal - Mart removed Arm & Hammer liquid laundry detergent from most of its stores .
But the discounter brought back the product after Arm & Hammer boosted its advertising for the product at Wal - Mart .
Arm & Hammer parent Church & Dwight ( CHD ) did not return calls for comment .
Other consumer product makers -- including Colgate - Palmolive and Procter & Gamble -- either declined comment or did not return calls .
Said Dibadj , " Perhaps one consideration in which product to cut is based on which company gives [ Wal - Mart ] the best deal . "
Citing the Hefty example , he said " these threats can become quite aggressive , such as delisting and subsequent relisting after a compromise .
Altimeter Group 's Cecera believes consumers stand to win from the retailers ' moves .
" In this recession , consumers have certainly become less discriminating with what they buy , " said Cecera .
" Consumers have rushed to value prices , and they are buying generic brands . "
She said retailers ' own brands have grown their market share by between 2 % to 6 % .
This newfound affection for store brands is " sticking , " said Dibadj .
He cites his firm 's recent survey finding that 77 % of consumers who traded down to less expensive private label products are happy with their decision .

Are you about to become ineligible for federal unemployment benefits ?
What will you do if Congress does n't extend the deadline to apply for additional benefits ?
E-mail realstories@cnnmoney.com and you could be part of an upcoming story .
Every developer seems to have a war story to tell the new recruits around the camp fire espresso machine , well this is mine .
It all happened about 9 years ago and most of the memories are still fresh in my mind ( post - trauma is like that ) but some details are a bit foggy and have been reconstructed to the best of my ability .
My first job out of university was at Mainsoft , their flagship product at the time allowed you to compile your Win32 C++ code to Unix .
Mainsoft has this gift of taking extremely talented people ( present company excluded of course ) in order to create awesome technical solutions to obscure problems which nobody would ever want to pay for .
Getting MS Visual C++ code to compile natively on Unix is not a simple task ( Microsoft love adding non-standard extensions to C++ ) and when you do get it to compile ( and link ) you have to supply all of the Win32 API so the damn thing will actually run .
One of my first tasks was to re-implement the registry as a service , up till then the registry was implemented as a file mapped to shared memory .
This had the unfortunate implication that if the customer ’s code ( or ours ) had a bug which crashed the program or wrote to a dangling pointer , the registry would be corrupted .
My job was to write a daemon which handled all the registry functions and replace the implementation in advapi.dll with stubs that call the registry service .
A lot of the work involved marshalling the data , you ca n’t depend on the types of parameters , is BYTE * a pointer to one BYTE or to an array ?
If it ’s an array what ’s its length ?
Luckily Microsoft document whether each parameter is in , out or both , whether pointers may be NULL and how to determine lengths of buffers .
I built a pretty nifty framework with template classes for each of these eventualities so that data was only transmitted between processes when needed .
As I said I was fresh out of university and one of the few things we learnt in Software Engineering ( most of the curriculum was Computer Science ) was to “ build one to throw away ” ( I think they called it prototyping ) , so I wrote a prototype with lots of printf statements [ 1 ] .
When it was done I was told that rather than throw it away and start from scratch I should get it to work on the other supported Unices .
Instead of removing all the printf s ( and thinking they may be useful in the future ) , I used dup2 [ 2 ] to map STDOUT to / dev/null .
When the project was almost done a new feature was added , create backups for the registry state , I do n’t know if there was any actual need for this but it was easy enough to do so we added it .
There was a small hiccough when I tried to find a Unix system call for copying files , but then I remembered that we were implementing Win32 ’s API and I could use CopyFile rather than re-implement it .
A few days later I got a bug report from our QA about application crashes when using the registry APIs , nothing consistent but it only happens in the latest version of the registry server I supplied .
This made no sense , the only change I made was backing up the registry files ( in the daemon ) and the crashes are happening in the registry client processes .
By attaching to a code dump I can see that the problem occurred when a string was returned as an out parameter , first the string length is transmitted , then the client allocates enough space to store it and copies it over .
The problem is that the length received was astronomical , something on the order of 2 gigabytes !
( remember this is circa 2001 ) .
The allocation failed and the crash was n’t far away .
After a few days of trying to reproduce the problem ( with intermittent success ) QA managed to find a reproducible scenario .
This scenario involved deleting the user ’s registry file ( if there is no registry present we copy over an initial registry file ) then an automated test was run and 20 minutes later the client application crashed .
The crash only happened when in the optimized build of the the registry server ( although it did n’t matter if the client was built in debug or optimized ) and it always happened in the same registry function call .
I put a breakpoint in the server and saw that we received the call and gave the correct answer in response , then I noticed something weird , the client app got the bad answer before we sent the correct one .
I was officially baffled and I called a more experienced developer in for a consult .
He had a look at the length received , 1,702,129,253 , printed it out in hex 0x65746E65 and said :
– “ this looks like a string . ”
– “ huh ” said I intelligently .
– “ Look , every two bytes are around 0x60 just like ASCII characters . ”
We cast the address of the number to char * and got “ entering function foobar ( ) ” , a quick grep later we realized that this was one of my printf ed lines .
But how was printf getting transmitted across processes ?
That question turned out to be easy to answer , the file descriptor accept returned for the new connection was 1 , now everybody knows [ citation needed ] that 1 is STDOUT so printf ( which writes to STDOUT ) was being sent over the socket .
But why was accept returning 1 ?
It was n’t a free descriptor !
Or was it ?
By using truss ( that ’s strace in Linux ) we found that someone was indeed calling close on 1 and the culprit was none other than CopyFile , when the registry server was launched it backed up the current registry file , however this file did n’t exist .
When asked to copy a non-existant file CopyFile should fail gracefully however this is what our implementation of CopyFile looked like :
bool CopyFile ( const char* from , const char* to , bool failIfExists ) { int fdFrom , fdTo ; bool success = false ; fdFrom = open ( from , O_RDONLY ) ; if ( fdFrom == - 1 ) goto End ; int openFlag = O_WRONLY ; if ( failIfExist ) openFlag = openFlag | O_EXCL ; fdTo = open ( from , openFlag ) ; if ( fdTo == - 1 ) goto End ; /* Actual work done here */ End : close ( fdFrom ) ; close ( fdTo ) ; return success ; }
When from did n’t exist a < gasp > goto </ gasp > was used , to skip over fdTo ‘s initialization , so close was called on an uninitialized variable which just happened to be 1 [ 3 ] , nobody told printf that the file descriptor it was writing to was closed and it went on failing merrily .
At some point down the line accept saw that 1 was available and returned it causing the subsequent printf ‘s to succeed ( although not exactly as intended ) .
Lessons Learnt
These lessons seem trivial now but as a new developer this bug really drove them home .
Always compile with warnings treated as errors ( - Wall - Werror ) Always initialize your variables , C++ is n’t C , ( nowadays even C is n’t C ) you can declare a variable anywhere so declare it when you can give it a value
Bits are bits are bits , if something has a value that does n’t make sense try to look at it another way .
The first part of most objects is the virtual pointer , if that does n’t point into the memory space of your DLL then you ’re probably not looking at an object after all .
goto really should be considered harmful , this was the first time I saw goto in real code and it bit me , hard .
I have seen benevolent goto ’s but as a rule they should be avoided
Last but not least , there is no such thing as a small feature , even the most trivial change can have astonishing outcomes
Reminiscing about this bug also made me thing about how it relates to Linus ’ Law : all bugs are shallow .
On the one hand this bug was extremely shallow ( it could have been caught by the compiler ) , on the other hand its shallowness was confined to a specific function , far , far away from where it manifested .
For all Mainsoft ’s customer ’s CopyFile is a black box , for them no number of eyeballs on the code would have discovered that trying to copy a non-existent file would cause STDOUT to be closed .
On the gripping hand if Linus ’ law is only relevant when the whole stack you ’re dealing with is open source then it ’s close to useless , how many opportunities are there to work on such a stack where even the hardware is open source ?

Canada defeats Russia 7 - 3 ( Photo © Alex Livesey / Getty Images )
Team Russia lost 7 - 3 to Team Canada in the 2010 Olympic Tournament ‘s quarterfinal .
A goal by Ryan Getzlaf gave the Canadians an early lead .
Team Russia did n’t use a powerplay chance and Dan Boyle made it a 2 - 0 game at the twelfth .
Rick Nash scored the 3 - 0 goal some seconds later with a quick counterattack .
But the Russians did n’t give up and with a blue line shot by Dmitriy Kalinin cut down Canada ’s lead after fourteen minutes .
After a good scoring chance wasted by Ilya Kovalchuk , Brendan Morrow restore Team Canada ’s three - goal lead with less than two minutes to go in the first period .
In the second period Canada scored two quick goals with Corey Perry and Shea Weber , and Bykov decided to bench Nabokov in favor of Ilya Bryzgalov .
Not much later Maxim Afinogenov with a nice shot scored the second goal of the game for the Russians , but midway through the game Corey Perry scored again after a neutral zone error by Sergei Zinoviev .
Russia added one goal to the count with a blue line slapshot by Sergei Gonchar to finish the second period 7 - 3 .
In the third period team Russia tried hard and got a big chance with Evgeni Malkin , but they did n’t manage to shift the momentum .
With this win Canada advances to the semifinals , where they will face Slovakia .
This attack was reported by WKRN Online and paints a truly frightening picture .
NASHVILLE , Tenn . - A Nashville man says he and his 10 - year - old daughter were victims of road rage Thursday afternoon , all because of a political bumper sticker on his car ...
Duren had just picked up his 10 - year - old daughter from school and had her in the car with him .
" He pointed at the back of my car , " Duren said , " the bumper , flipped me off , one finger salute . "
But it did n't end there ...
Once he started driving again , down Blair Boulevard , towards his home , he said , " I looked in the rear view mirror again , and this same SUV was speeding , flying up behind me , bumped me . "
Duren said he applied his brake and the SUV smashed into the back of his car .
He then put his car in park to take care of the accident , but [ Harry ]
Weisiger started pushing the car using his SUV .
Harry Weisiger has been charged with felony reckless endangerment , which is something , but it 's clear that his actions were n't just reckless ; they were intentional .
He used an SUV as a weapon , a weapon that could just as easily have been deadly .
We 've seen for the past week things escalate , and now it 's come to this .
Fuck Cantor and anyone who says this wave of violence , intimidation , and yes , terrorism , is being blown out of proportion to score political points .
This really needs to stop .
Update I
Harry Weisiger , the man accused of using his SUV to ram Mark Duren 's car , has told his side of the story to WKRN .
Harry Weisiger told News 2 , " He slammed on his brakes , and I hit him in the bumper when I tried to go around him . "
Weisiger , 70 , is accused of hitting Mark Duren 's car on Blair Boulevard around 4:30 p.m.
Friday ...
Weisiger did not mention the Obama bumper sticker when News 2 spoke with him Friday , but did admit fault for leaving the scene of the accident .
According to the police report , officers found Weisiger in the parking lot of Harris Teeter , where he said he had stopped to buy dinner .
Weisiger is charged with two counts of reckless endangerment , driving under the influence , refusing to take a breath test , and leaving the scene of an accident .
Update II
WKRN posted an update to its original story with a eye - witness account of the incident .
Isaf commanders say the priority is to get supplies to troops Burger bars and pizza joints in Nato bases across Afghanistan are being closed down in an effort " to increase efficiency across the battlefield " .
A Nato spokesman said that " amenities " at bases across the country are being phased out for logistical reasons .
He said officials at each base will decide exactly when they are axed .
Nato 's top Afghanistan commander , Gen Stanley McChrystal , made it clear last year that the days of Burger King and Pizza Hut on Isaf bases were numbered .
He expressed concern that burger bars , pizza restaurants and other stores in large International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) bases at Kandahar , Bagram and Mazar - e - Sharif served as a distraction to the military mission .
' Get refocussed ' " For several months now we have been in the process of bringing 39,000 extra troops to Afghanistan - in addition to extra equipment , ammunition and supplies , " the Nato spokesman told the BBC .
" Soldiers will still be able to eat pizzas and burgers - but served up in military canteens rather than in commercial outlets . "
The aim is to ' optimise ' efficiency at bases like Bagram A blog written in February by a senior Isaf morale welfare and recreation officer states the argument bluntly for closing down outlets such as Burger King , Pizza Hut and Dairy Queen .
" This is a warzone , not an amusement park , " the blog written by Command Sgt Maj Michael T Hall says .
" In order to accommodate the troop increase and get refocussed on the mission in hand , we need to cut back on some of the non-essentials .
" Supplying non-essential luxuries to big bases like Bagram and Kandahar makes it harder to get essential items to combat outposts and forward operating bases , where troops fighting every day need to be resupplied with ammunition , food and water . "
Command Sgt Maj
Hall said that closing such outlets will free up much needed storage space and reduce the amount of flight and ground convoy traffic across Afghanistan .
He said it would also free up " water and electricity needs required to run these businesses " .
Correspondents say that while the closures are not likely to bother troops on the frontline who live in tough conditions , many in the larger bases on lengthy 12 - month tours may complain it places an added burden on them .

A lot of the work I ’ve been doing the last several months is optimizing performance for NetNewsWire for iPhone .
The changes have n’t shipped yet , because I ’m not quite finished .
But one part of this might be interesting to other developers , so I figured I ’d write it up .
I optimized as much as I could , spent tons of time in Shark , went all multi- threaded with Core Data , switched away from my own queuing system to NSOperationQueue , optimized the XML parsing , etc .
But performance and memory use on my first - generation iPod Touch ( my development test device ) was still not nearly good enough with a big unread count ( of around 10,000 items ) .
At that point , having done everything else , the remaining issue was clearly Core Data .
So I tried more things , re-read everything I could about Core Data performance ( for the nth time ) , ran experiments , spent tons more time in Shark .
Trying to get it good .
No go .
Finally I realized I had to switch away from Core Data and use SQLite more directly .
Not completely directly — I use FMDB , a lightweight Objective - C interface that works on Macs and iPhones .
Gus wrote it .
It ’s good .
That meant a bunch more work — it ’s not like Core Data and FMDB are similar or meant to be similar .
So it was no drop - in replacement .
Not intended to be .
But why ?
I bet Core Data is the right way to go 95 % of the time .
Or more .
It ’s easy to work with .
It ’s fast ( in most cases ) .
It has schema upgrade tools .
The important thing to know , though , is that it ’s not a database .
It ’s an object graph and persistence manager .
( Check out the post on Cocoa with Love that goes into detail . )
But surely you ’re using objects
The difference between Core Data and a database was never that clear to me — until I found concrete examples .
After all , under the hood , in the code , every news item in a feed is an object .
Why would n’t I use an object persistence framework for that ?
They ’re objects , and I want to persist them .
Duh .
Seems like I should use Core Data .
So here are some concrete examples where direct database access made more sense than using Core Data .
1. Marking lots of news items as read or unread
The app gets from the Google Reader API a big list of item IDs that have been marked read or unread .
In Core Data , I had to loop through the list , change the status for each individual item .
The list could be up to 10,000 items long .
Not a good idea .
This is a very database -y operation .
With one query the app can set the status for a whole bunch of items at once , without having to instantiate them as objects : update newsItems set read = 1 where …
2. Deleting lots of items
Similar to # 1 above — from time to time the app deletes old , read , non-starred items from storage .
We ca n’t just let storage grow forever , especially not on an iPhone or iPod Touch .
With Core Data , I ran a query to figure out what items to delete .
Then ran a loop that deleted them .
Expensive .
With SQLite access , I just did a sinqle query : delete from newsItems where …
3 . Dealing with unique IDs from outside system
Core Data does uniquing , but that ’s not what this is .
The news items have an assigned unique ID that comes from another database .
When refreshing feeds , it ’s common to see news items that the app has seen before .
They might have been downloaded previously or they might have changed .
( We try to avoid the former , of course . )
This means that for each item in a feed , before it ’s saved , the app first has to get the existing news item .
This is slow .
( I tried various techniques : pre-fetching , fetching as needed , fetching only IDs of existing items for a feed , storing existing IDs in a set or dictionary , etc .
Nothing helped much .
Usually the solution was worse than the original problem . )
Because many thousands of items may come in during a refresh session , and every item has to be checked to see if it exists already , this was a huge performance hit .
Better not to do the fetch , right ?
With more - direct access , I could just do a insert or replace into newsItems … and it would add the item or replace the existing item .
Fast .
4 . Testing for the existence of an item
Sometimes the app just needs to know if something exists in the database .
With Core Data , it ’s a fetch .
With SQLite , here ’s one of my favorite tricks : select 1 from someTable where uniqueID = whatever .
In theory it should hit the index only , since it does n’t actually retrieve anything from the table itself .
It ’s fast , at any rate .
My favorite magic
Once I had the above ( and everything else ) working , there was still more optimization to do .
I had created a set of indexes that I thought would do the trick — but there ’s nothing like actually seeing what will happen when a query runs .
With direct access , with control over the indexes , I could test and iterate until I got the right set of indexes .
The magic is SQLite ’s explain query plan command .
It tells you what indexes will be used .
In the end
I did n’t entirely switch away from Core Data .
Feeds and folders are still Core Data objects .
Since there was no performance gain to be had by switching those over , I left them as -is .
It ’s just news items that got switched — but that ’s almost all the data .
Making the switch did mean I had to do some things manually that Core Data would have done for me : keeping any in -memory items synced with the database storage , mostly .
But , still , in the end , the new version of the system was less code than the Core Data version .
That will not be the case for most apps .
I took it as further indication that this was the right move for this particular app .
Warning
This is n’t about being a hardcore low - level developer or some crap like that .
I like Core Data a ton .
( I recommend Marcus Zarra ’s book , by the way , which I read twice . )
If I could have stuck with Core Data for everything , I would have .
( Rule : always work at the highest level possible . )
But how do you know when you might be better off with FMDB or other more - direct SQLite access ?
I think it goes like this , at least based on my experience :
Is performance good ?
Then stick with Core Data .
( That should cover 95 % or more of data - driven apps right there . )
Is Core Data really the cause of your performance problems ?
Can you optimize other things ?
Can you optimize your use of Core Data ?
Will going multi- threaded do the trick ?
Try .
If you can get performance good , then stick with Core Data .
Are your remaining performance problems really database -y things ?
In other words , are you doing things like setting one or a few properties across a big range of items ; deleting lots of items based on a condition ; or having to handle unique IDs from another database , and so you ’re constantly doing fetches ?
In other words , can you benefit by not treating your data as objects sometimes ?
If switching to direct database access wo n’t help , then stick with Core Data .
My warning : you probably do n’t need to switch away from Core Data .
It ’s the right answer almost every time .
( By the way , were this a Mac app only , Core Data would probably have been fine .
But it runs on iPhones too , and that ’s where performance optimization becomes so much more critical . )
Anyway : Core Data is the right answer , except when it ’s not , and hopefully I ’ve made it a little easier to figure out when it ’s not the right answer .

The Road to Hyperinflation
Inflationism is a slippery road – the road to hyperinflation .
The inflationist Bernanke Fed behaves as if they would not be “ dialling back ” from Quantitative Easing any time soon .
They talk the talk , but ca n’t walk the walk .
The inflationary genie is out of the bottle .
Taming it back will result in a crushing deflationary collapse .
The Fed will never let this happen again .
They did it once during the Great Depression , they wo n’t do it again .
The government ’s reaction is typical of a crisis associated with economic collapse and social unrest .
Hemingway put it so aptly : “ The first panacea for a mismanaged nation is inflation of the currency ; the second is war .
Both bring a temporary prosperity ; both bring a permanent ruin . "
Three years ago Äripäev , Estonia ’s leading daily business newspaper , published Alar Tamming ’s article “ Great Economic Crisis on the Way ” .
The article came out during the economic euphoria and the author himself is probably the only one who still remembers the final sentence : “ ... this time , do not complain that you were not forewarned . ”
The economic crisis is well under way .
However , there are major differences in predicting how the crisis will end .
Yes , “ under way ” , because most people still think that we will be soon coming out of the crisis , may be even within a couple of months .
Economic philosophizers still prognosticate that the economic boom is about re-emerge .
Many in the Establishment even declare that the crisis is over .
They forecast business as usual – the resurrection of the consumption - based economy , only if the banks were to start loaning again .
Unfortunately , this will be impossible .
They are mostly wrong , as suggested by history and chaos theory .
Even a superficial introduction to chaos theory leads us to observe that when a self - regulating system has reached the critical point , there is no returning to the previous level .
Just like a capitalistic society cannot return back to slavery , or just like slavery cannot return back to the primeval society of hunters and gatherers , so we can no longer return to the capitalistic economic model that is based on consumption .
Development of all complex systems , whether we are dealing with a society , a business , or a human being , always take place in cycles .
There is a time of balance ( equilibrium ) , then a period of confusion ( disequilibrium ) , and afterwards the system will be re-organised at a new , higher level , so that the problems that were a source of conflicts at the previous level will be resolved .
This is the essence of Hegelian dialectics .
For example , everyone can see these processes happening to their children – how teenagers are full of conflicts during their puberty and how they will grow out of them stronger and smarter than before .
Similarly , one can think of the end of the Soviet Era , when the system could no longer react to the external environment , which drove it to chaos ; and then a new social order emerged , a qualitatively new system , based on private capital .
Every entrepreneur probably remembers the same when thinking about development of his company , and can recall how crises have helped his company improve , if he ever managed to survive .
Without proper resolution of internal and external conflicts through development , every system is doomed to fail .
This is a basic application of Hegelian dialectics and a basic result associated with complex systems .
However , the current situation is rather complicated .
The economic system has gone critical – it has reached point from where there is no turning back .
The worst part is that the system cannot self - organise .
“ Normal ” business organisation typically means that if you are doing business and make wrong decisions in a particular economic environment , then you should also suffer the consequences .
In other words – if a bank has made bad loans , then we should let it fail .
Failure is part of capitalism .
Individuals and businesses that have deposited their money in this bank and , therefore , made a wrong decision , should also lose their money .
Simple and logical , this is what capitalism is all about .
Unfortunately , governments and central banks do not want to accept that .
They think that trying to feed a dead horse will bring it back to life .
And if it wo n’t revive , then it has to be fed even more .
They can vividly remember that when the horse was running strong , it had a good appetite .
So the endless bailout packages are not going to revive the economy .
Unfortunately , the system can no longer recover through normal pain – the Schumpeterian “ creative destruction ” .
Instead , the result there will be a long period of excruciating suffering – a systemic implosion .
Even worse , thanks to the human factor , an even bigger problem awaits .
The economy , which is just about to tailspin on one side of the road , will probably tailspin on the other side .
This represents the current inflation - deflation debate .
Everyone with a racing experience who has felt the car skid off the road knows that trying to countersteer too hard will get you in the ditch on the other side of the road .
While the deflationary forces exert strong deflationary pressure , the inflationist Bernanke Fed is trying hard to countersteer with inflation .
Some prices are indeed dropping now , but this is just the prelude to the real opus – hyperinflation .
Financial history teaches us that every time a financial crisis has been alleviated by printing more money instead of cutting costs and prices , it has ended up with hyperinflation .
Zimbabwe is the most recent example , but the list is almost endless : Bulgaria , Russia , Ukraine , Turkey , Argentina , Mexico – the list goes on and on .
We do n’t need to add the years behind the crises – everyone can easily find these from the Internet .
We refer the reader to our good friend Mike Hewitt , who has created an impressive compilation of such historical follies in his article “ Hyperinflation Around the World ” .
Hyperinflation goes with economy and finance just like attachments go with e-mails .
Here is how the great economist Ludwig von Mises describes it :
„ But then finally the masses wake up .
They become suddenly aware of the fact that inflation is a deliberate policy and will go on endlessly .
A breakdown occurs .
The crack - up boom appears .
Everybody is anxious to swap his money against " real " goods , no matter whether he needs them or not , no matter how much money he has to pay for them .
Within a very short time , within a few weeks or even days , the things which were used as money are no longer used as media of exchange .
They become scrap paper .
Nobody wants to give away anything against them . ”
Currency depreciation is actually quite common .
A survey including 120 countries provides evidence that over the past 7 years , the currencies of 90 countries have lost at least half of their value .
The thirty countries with relatively more “ stable ” currencies included mostly developed countries like the USA , Western European countries , Australia , and a few others that represent the “ core ” of the global monetary system .
However , this time the instability of the system has reached the core .
The current economic policies can only lead us to one result – the destruction of the current global monetary system through hyperinflation .
The flawed mainstream remedy , based on the failed doctrine of Keynesianism , is that in difficult times the state should intervene aggressively into the economy by spending more ( and bailing out everybody ) in order to protect jobs .
To use one of Peter Schiff ’s analogies , this is like poring gasoline on a fire ; it only serves to speed up the hyperinflation .
If the money for the stimulus actually exists in the government coffers as a result of previous savings , as is currently the case with Saudi Arabia , then this would be all right ; unfortunately for the developed world ( the “ core ” – U.S & Europe ) , this is not the case .
And calling the spending without actual savings with fancy terms like “ Keynesian stimulus ” ( or whatever ) ca n’t possibly change the essence of things .
The state provides for the stimulus with freshly - printed money that modern central bankers call euphemistically “ Quantitative Easing ” .
It is a textbook example of “ monetization ” that is rapidly depreciating the currency and later on rendering it practically worthless .
If printing more money and providing all sorts of stimuli and bailout packages could solve economic problems , then we would have been living in endless prosperity for hundreds of years , and Zimbabwe and Argentina would have been the economic powerhouses of the world .
Hyperinflation is not yet to be seen at the core , but the internal dynamics of process has its own inner logic and necessarily requires time .
When a car backs out of a garage , it first backs up in one direction , before it drives off in the other .
It appears for now that the U.S. auto manufacturers are saved , but this is actually a step towards hyperinflation .
Eventually , costs will have to go up , then prices , and eventually salaries .
In a positive feedback loop , higher wags lead to higher costs and higher prices – the dreaded wage - price spiral begins to speed up .
Typically , a shortage of money develops and the social pressure to inflate becomes insurmountable – when inflation is speeding up , the government and business would go through tough times , because the revenues for goods and services sold will never be enough to pay for rising wages and prices of raw materials .
In a normal economic cycle , a profitable business will have more money ( profits ) after producing goods out of raw materials , so it can buy even more raw materials and grow ; however , during hyperinflation business revenues are not enough to cover the rising cost of materials .
So every production cycle generates a loss and the company becomes poorer and poorer .
This simple concept may be hard to grasp at the moment for those who have never lived through hyperinflation , but when the time comes , it will be perfectly understood by almost everyone in the economy .
As grim as it may sound , there is a glimmer of hope – the beginning of the hyperinflation is also the beginning of the end for the Crisis .
Financial assets accumulated by individuals and businesses during the boom years have to be destroyed – the price for our financial folly today will be paid tomorrow .
There is no way around it , as the scarce economic resources backing these financial assets have been consumed through the sophisticated redistribution mechanisms of innovative financial instruments and deficit spending .
Unfortunately , there is no such thing as a free lunch – the Baby Boomer generation has had an extra lunch today , but will have to skip the lunch tomorrow .
The economic crisis is here and hyperinflation is on the way .
In conclusion , let us reiterate : “ Do n’t say you have n’t been forewarned . ”
But of course , this warning is just as good as giving a moralizing speech about drinking in a packed bar – no one would listen anyway .
However , you have been warned – protect yourself , buy gold !

Howard Dean , the guy who knows something about what Democrats need to do to win , had this message last night on the Rachel Maddow show .
This is like Washington was when I got there five years ago .
You know , the Democrats really were n't sure they were Democrats .
If you want to win , you actually can't sort of move to the middle and become a Republican .
You 've got to stand up and stand for the things that you got elected on and that the Democratic Party believes in and we have n't seen that in the healthcare bill and I think that 's part of the problem .
I do not think , however , that this is a referendum on health care .
I certainly do n't think it 's a referendum on President Obama .
I think it 's a very smart , tough Republican campaigner , people are upset because of unemployment and they do n't that the climate in Washington -- that people are listening to them in Washington .
They think they 're more interested in making deals with special interests than they are in dealing with the Wall Street bankers who ripped them off .
And on the blame game , he says get past it and move on .
I would say to my fellow Democrats that this not the time for appointing blame ....
There are plenty of things that went wrong , plenty of blame to be spread around .
People who blame others are losers .
If you want to win elections you stop blaming and you get to work .
And that 's what 's going to have to be done after this election ....
I think the message has been sent that if we plan to do better than this in 2010 , we 'd better do better for the American people between now and next November .
We need the Fighting Dem spirit of 2006 back again .
We need Democrats to act like Democrats -- even if they 're from Nebraska , to demonstrate to the American people that Washington can be on their side and not to be fooled by the likes of the banksters ' best buddy , Scott Brown .
Internet Explorer 9 is ' crazy fast ' according to Microsoft , but the Sunspider JavaScript results published by the company show that the latest browser from Redmond still lags behind many of its rivals .
The Sunspider results have become a familiar metric in how fast browsers are judged to be , and Microsoft 's IE8 was judged harshly for its poor performance .
At the preview event for IE9 at MIX , Microsoft 's Principal Program Lead Jason Weber insisted that the latest version of Internet Explorer would ' change the way you think ' with its speed .
And yet , Microsoft 's own published results confirm that the latest build of Apple 's Safari browser , Opera and Google 's Chrome are all still faster .
Weber justifies the difference between its 604 score and Opera 10.50 's 287 as " less than one eye blink " , pointing out that major changes under the bonnet of Internet Explorer will have a great impact on web browsing .
Those changes include a new JavaScript compiler that speeds up scripts without by passing them on to the second core on dual core PCs and a rendering engine that uses the Direct2D hardware graphics acceleration that 's in Windows Vista and 7 .
" We 're speeding up the real Web today , " says Webber ; " we believe we 've sped up everything by 10 or 11 per cent " .
In truth , the results do show a massive performance boost for Internet Explorer , and push it past the popular Mozilla Firefox browser .
The real world difference between the main browsers are now negligible - fractions of a second and unlikely to affect user experience or even be noticeable to the vast majority .

The UK “ Oil Age ” Begins
A couple of years ago I came across a single page from the Daily Mirror from 19th July 1913 .
It had been in the back of an old picture frame my mother was working on .
This would have been interesting in itself but this 97 year old sheet of paper had a very interesting story about the construction of Great Britain ’s first oil - driven battleship heralding the beginning of the “ Oil Age ” .
Further information on HMS Queen Elizabeth is available here : Wikipedia
Winston Churchill underlines the military importance of imported oil , leading the discussion to the country ’s potential self sufficiency in oil .
Clearly this is decades before off - shore oil discoveries in the North Sea so shale beds are considered along with a recent breakthrough demonstrating how some 20 gallons of oil can be economically produced from a ton of coal .
Of course some things never change , growing world demand was even reported to be forcing up the price of oil in 1913 .
As it turned out the UK never embarked on economically significant coal to liquids programmes or exploitation of the shale resources .
It ’s an interesting coincidence that just as coal was being discussed as a future source of liquid fuel UK production was peaking .
The all time peak production rate of UK coal was 1913 :
UK Coal Production
The image below shows the construction of an oil storage depot at Killingholme .
Interestingly this is now the site of a large ConocoPhillips oil refinery , opened in 1969 and sited here as a good place to land North African crude .
The simultaneous discovery of North Sea oil made it a highly successful venture now responsible for 10 % of UK petrol and 14 % of all other oil products .
WASHINGTON — Congress left for a two - week vacation Friday without extending jobless benefits for people who have been out of work for more than six months .
But that may not be as bad as it sounds .
The impact of the benefit cutoff will be limited , so long as lawmakers quickly fix the problem when they return next month .
The same holds true for a lapse in authorization for generous health subsidies for the unemployed and for a 21 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors .
Dropping the ball on jobless benefits does n't put Congress in a flattering light .
But unlike an episode three weeks ago , when Kentucky Republican Sen .
Jim Bunning held up a nearly identical measure over deficit concerns , Democrats do n't seem poised to reap political gain from this round of GOP obstruction .
The impasse means thousands of people will begin to lose jobless benefits when a current extension of unemployment insurance expires on April 5 .
In addition , a 65 percent subsidy for health insurance benefits for the unemployed under the COBRA program expires Wednesday .
The expiration of unemployment insurance means that people who have been out of a job for more than six months will gradually lose eligibility for additional weeks of benefits that are fully financed by the federal government .
The first six months of unemployment benefits would not be affected , since they are the responsibility of the states .
But someone whose six - month state benefits are running out after April 5 wo n't be eligible for a new 20 - week " tier " of federally financed benefits so long as the program has lapsed .
A person already receiving such benefits wo n't see them run out until they apply for additional weeks .
That means perhaps one in 50 of the 11 million people now receiving unemployment checks would be affected in the first week of the benefits expiration , according to the National Employment Law Project .
Almost 1 million people would see their benefits exhausted by the end of April .
The Democrats in control of Congress promise that any lost benefits will be made up for .
The more generous jobless aid started in 2008 and was extended through last year by the economic stimulus bill .
With unemployment averaging almost 10 percent nationwide , Democrats and Republicans alike want to see the benefits extended .
The most recent extension , passed earlier this month , was supposed to buy time for House - Senate negotiations on a yearlong extension .
It 's a long - standing practice on Capitol Hill to pad the national debt to pay for emergency jobless benefits , and the long - term extension would do just that .
But with the deficit projected at $ 1.5 trillion , Republicans are starting to balk .
" I think you 'll see a much greater commitment now to fiscal responsibility , " said Jon Kyl of Arizona , the No. 2 Republican in the Senate .
For Democrats , the episode exposed rifts .
Many Democrats say the unemployment benefits are an emergency and that financing them with tax revenue or budget cuts reduces their stimulative impact on the economy .
But Democratic deficit hawks are sympathetic to the GOP 's argument .

Among his other treasures , the pedagogue had a wife , whom he had married out of Mr Allworthy 's kitchen for her fortune , viz. , twenty pounds , which she had there amassed .
Thus , by divers little makeshifts , in that ingenious way which is commonly denominated " by hook and by crook , " the worthy pedagogue got on tolerably enough , and was thought , by all who understood nothing of the labor of headwork , to have a wonderfully easy life of it .
But above all , they admired his strong voice ; so that , when he uttered his oath , the whole school cried out , " The devil take me ! " with fearful bursts of laughter , shouts , and bounds , which delighted the musketeer , and bewildered the old pedagogue .
He said to himself , " He must be a miserable prig who would act the pedagogue here : one might as well go and lecture the trees for growing in their own shape . "
When the lesson was over she resumed without effort her seductive smiles , her voice became again soft and winning , but Philip could not so easily put away the pupil as she the pedagogue ; and this impression convicted with the feelings her stories had aroused in him .
As the nobleman of cultivated taste surrounds himself with whatever conduces to his culture -- genius -- learning -- wit -- books -- paintings -- statuary -- music -- philosophical instruments , and the like ; so let the village do -- not stop short at a pedagogue , a parson , a sexton , a parish library , and three selectmen , because our Pilgrim forefathers got through a cold winter once on a bleak rock with these .
He put his hand gently on her arm , and said , in the tone of a kind pedagogue ,--
Pelet , a profound silence reigned on all sides , and if by chance a murmur or a whisper arose , one glance from the pensive eye of this most gentle pedagogue stilled it instantly .
He could not but wish that Dorothea should think him not less happy than the world would expect her successful suitor to be ; and in relation to his authorship he leaned on her young trust and veneration , he liked to draw forth her fresh interest in listening , as a means of encouragement to himself : in talking to her he presented all his performance and intention with the reflected confidence of the pedagogue , and rid himself for the time of that chilling ideal audience which crowded his laborious uncreative hours with the vaporous pressure of Tartarean shades .
' Yes , I am , sir , ' replied the worthy pedagogue ; ' Mr Wackford Squeers is my name , and I 'm very far from being ashamed of it .
George 's education was confided to a neighbouring scholar and private pedagogue who " prepared young noblemen and gentlemen for the Universities , the senate , and the learned professions : whose system did not embrace the degrading corporal severities still practised at the ancient places of education , and in whose family the pupils would find the elegances of refined society and the confidence and affection of a home . "
It was in this way that the Reverend Lawrence Veal of Hart Street , Bloomsbury , and domestic Chaplain to the Earl of Bareacres , strove with Mrs .

High - pressure fragrance sprays will be installed at Asuwei dump , one of several hundred overflowing landfill sites that are the focus of growing public concern
Beijing is to install 100 deodorant guns at a stinking landfill site on the edge of the city in a bid to dampen complaints about the capital 's rubbish crisis .
The giant fragrance sprays will be put in place by May at the Asuwei dump site , one of several hundred tips that are the focus of growing public concerns about sanitation , environmental health and a runaway consumer culture .
Municipal authorities say they will also apply more plastic layers to cover the site in response to furious protests by local residents who have to put up with the stench when the wind blows in their direction .
The high - pressure guns , which can spray dozens of litres of fragrance per minute over a distance of up to 50 m , are produced by several Chinese firms and based on German and Italian technology .
They are already in use at several landfill sites , but they are merely a temporary fix .
Beijing 's waste problem - and China 's - is expanding as fast as its economy , at about 8 % each year .
With millions more people now able to afford Starbucks , McDonald's , Kentucky Fried Chicken and other elements of a western , throwaway lifestyle , the landfill sites and illegal tips that ring the capital are close to overflowing .
According to the local government , the city of 17 m people generates 18,000 tonnes of waste every day - 7,000 tonnes more than the capacity of municipal disposal plants .
" All landfill and treatment sites in Beijing will be full in four years .
That 's how long it takes to build a treatment plant .
So we need to act right now to resolve the issue , " said Wang Weiping , a waste expert in the city government .
" It 's necessary to restructure the current disposal system .
We can not rely on landfill anymore .
It 's a waste of space . "
Less than 4 % of Beijing 's rubbish is recycled – the UK recycles 35 % – but is still near the bottom of the EU recycling league .
Two per cent of Beijing 's rubbish is burned but the rest is dumped in landfill sites , which cover an area of 333,000 sq m.
Cities throughout the country face a similar problem .
There are more than 200 legal and illegal sites around Beijing , according to Wang Jiuliang , a photographer who has spent the past year recording and plotting the wastelands using GPS systems and Google Earth .
Together , they form what he calls " Beijing 's seventh ring " , where the city meets the countryside with smart new ring roads , expensive housing complexes and the detritus of consumer culture .
" People are forced to use these places for dumps and landfills .
There is no better place , " he says .
" China has become a consumer society over the past 10 or 20 years .
The authorities are working hard to solve the garbage problem , but it has emerged too quickly . "
Environment authorities in cities throughout the country are struggling to keep pace with this burgeoning problem .
According to the government , about 20 m tonnes of urban garbage went unhandled in 2008 .
They want to deal with the waste by burning it .
But government plans to build 82 incinerators between 2006 and 2010 have encountered an increasingly hostile " not - in - my - backyard " movement .
According to Chinese media reports , at least six incinerator projects have been put on hold due to public opposition , including Panyu in Guangdong province , Jiangqiao in Shanghai , and Liulitun and Asuwei in Beijing .
The number of rubbish - related public complaints in Beijing increased by 57 % last year , according to the Municipal Petition Office .
Many residents have safety fears about incineration facilities despite reassurances by the government .
In an attempt to win public confidence , the managers of a new 800 m yuan incinerator in Gao'antun set up a giant display screen earlier this month that contains real - time data on emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide .
But it continues to raise concerns because there are no figures for dioxins - the toxins released during the burning of plastic and other synthetic materials .
The plant has had to scale back operations in the face of public opposition .
In the longer term , the government plans massive investment and new legislation to double the capacity of waste disposal facilities , increase the incineration rate to 40 % and to cut the growth in the volume of rubbish to zero by 2015 through recycling .
There is a long way to go .
Currently , even when waste is separated by schools and companies , it is often just crammed back together by refuse collectors .
A Beijing News report last month noted that distribution and disposal plants are not designed to deal with separated waste .
" We just compress , pack and then bury everything directly , " said staff from Mentougou district waste transfer station .
Efforts to promote recycling have a long way to go .
Public litter bins offer two options - marked recyclable and non-recyclable - but few people are aware of the distinction because there has not been an adequate public education campaign .
" I am willing to take time and money to separate and recycle my rubbish , but there 's just no such system here , " said Beijing resident Cui Zheng .

Less than a week after CBS let the cat out of the bag on its own iPad HTML5 tests , more media companies appear to boarding the HTML5 video train .
Video services company Brightcove announced Monday morning that it will support HTML5 for its customers , offering " high quality , interactive , and advertising - supported Web video experiences for HTML5 - compatible devices . "
Two major Brightcove clients , the New York Times and Time Inc. , are participating launch partners , meaning that these two sources will have the option of ditching Flash in some cases in order to be more iPad compatible .
Brightcove 's announcement comes just days before the iPad launch , and the company makes no attempt to hide the fact that this is a major reason for the HTML5 support .
More than 1,000 Brightcove customers will be able to " easily expand the reach of their online video initiatives to popular consumer devices including the Apple iPad , iPhone and iPod touch , " wrote the company .
Brightcove currently provides support for device detection , playlist rendering , and playback of H.264 content , but plans to add support for customization , advertising , analytics , social sharing , and other features over the next year .
With such major names as the New York Times and Time on board , it 's pretty clear that media companies are n't holding out hope that Apple and Adobe will kiss and make up .
Like CBS , it 's likely that they 'll keep using Flash on their normal websites while allowing iPhone OS devices to access the HTML5 versions of the videos — at least for a while .
The remaining questions are when can we expect Hulu to hop on the HTML5 train , and will Netflix reconsider its stance on bringing its own streaming videos ( via Silverlight ) to the iPad ?

Students ranging from 10 - 13 years of age got to witness Mr. Kent ’s little skit at a Worcestershire school .
The lesson included a helpful ‘ real world ’ situation , which included Mr. Kent getting blasted by a gunman .
The exercise on Tuesday afternoon began when pupils were told there was a gun in the school .
Five minutes later , the alarm bell sounded and more than 300 pupils were sent out into the playground where they saw three teachers running across the field .
They saw a “ gunman ”  in the distance and heard what sounded like gunfire before seeing Mr Kent , a religious education teacher , fall to the ground .
His colleagues then appeared to try to resuscitate him .

GENEVA  Brushing aside allegations that it has resorted to torture , executions and mass detentions to crush political opposition , Iran made a defiant appearance before the United Nations ’ human rights body here on Monday , saying that it promoted and defended human rights and that Western critics were exploiting the issue for political ends .
Iran is “ in full compliance with the relevant international commitments it has taken on in a genuine and long - term approach to safeguard human rights , ” Mohammad Larijani , secretary general of Iran ’s High Council for Human Rights , told the United Nations Human Rights Council , which was conducting its first review of the country .
“ The situation of human rights has been consistently used as a tool to apply pressure against us ” by some Western governments , Mr. Larijani said .
In an apparent riposte to comments by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton earlier Monday that Iran was “ moving toward a military dictatorship , ” Mr. Larijani said Iran “ is becoming one of the prominent democratic states in the region . ”
SANTIAGO , Chile — Jacquelin Marin has no running hot water at home .
For a while , she had no real home at all .
But soon she 'll have both , with the sun heating water for her showers .
Marin and her neighbors are part of a pilot program to install solar water heaters in the houses of low - income families .
For Chile — a country with stark economic inequality and few fossil fuels — it 's a way to help the poor while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
Chile 's drastically different climate zones mean it's hard to devise any nationwide energy solution .
For now the program will begin in three disparate locations : 125 houses in the capital Santiago ; 68 houses in Curanilahue , a rainy former coal - mining town 370 miles to the south ; and 115 houses in Combarbala , 330 miles north in shrubby desert .
“ I never had a water heater before , a husband who could install one , nor the money to fuel it , ” said 39 - year - old Marin .
In 2002 , Marin joined a land takeover on the edge of a shantytown called Vista Hermosa , located in the poor western periphery of Santiago .
Riot police , water cannon tanks and tear gas were not enough to dissuade the determined squatters .
They stayed , constructing their homes with whatever materials they could purchase or find .
Marin and her neighbors from the shantytown went on to create a housing committee to change their flimsy abodes into real houses .
They saved up , organized the neighborhood , staged protests and badgered authorities , until finally 125 families were awarded subsidies from the Chilean housing ministry to start a new housing project .
“ Only 20 of the applicants were men , ” said Leonardo Dujovne from the Housing Ministry .
“ All the rest were women . ”
It was a long struggle and Marin , president of the housing committee Juntas Podemos ( We Women Can ) , admits to fits of depression along the way , especially when they had to move their shacks down the road so construction could begin .
The squatters endured a prolonged lack of water and electricity at the new site , the cold of winter and rain leaking through tin roofs and flooding the neighborhood .
Some abandoned the project , moving back to swell the households of relatives as poor as themselves .
Allegados , “ added ” relatives under the same roof , is a technical term in the overcrowded slums of Chile .
Others , like Jacquelin , her husband and two children , stuck it out .
Today , Marin earns the minimum monthly wage of about $ 300 as the key keeper at the construction site of the 125 new homes that will go to as many families from Vista Hermosa .
Her job is to ensure that fixtures and other finishes on the new homes stay put until she and her neighbors move in next April .
“ It ’s like getting a brand new car , ” she said , “ and this one is a Mercedes ! ”
The basic unit has two stories , two bedrooms , and a floor space of just over 500 square feet .
But it can be enlarged to three stories , up to four bedrooms and more than 750 square feet .
Interior walls can be moved or removed , and floors added or subtracted .
Outer walls feature aerated concrete blocks with central cells , like cinder blocks , and millions of minute air bubbles in their walls for extra thermal insulation .
The ceilings and bathroom walls are insulated with sheets of polystyrene foam covered by drywall .
To top off these cozy improvements , thermal - siphon solar water heaters crown the roofs .
The water heaters include a a flat solar collector and a holding tank for sanitary hot water , plus a kit to connect the water , pre-heated by the sun , to an auxiliary water heater .
Fueled by conventional gas , the second heater can maintain or increase water temperature in the winter .
The cost of each solar package with the auxiliary heater is $ 2,250 .
The construction of an additional 297 houses nearby is planned to begin this year nearby .
The per-house investment is close to $ 21,500 .
For a family of four , using 10.5 gallons of water per day at a temperature of 115 degrees Fahrenheit , consumption of gas for heating water should drop by 62 percent .
The new insulation standards should reduce energy demands for heat in winter by 45 percent and cooling demands in summer by 35 percent , said Minister of Energy Marcelo Tokman , while touring the site with then - President Michelle Bachelet .
Chile is a particularly poor country regarding fossil fuels .
Almost three - quarters of its energy consumption during 2007 was based on fossil fuels : crude oil , natural gas and coal .
The same year , the country had to import almost 100 percent of the crude oil and coal used , and most of its natural gas .
Petroleum products in Chile are as high as $ 4.35 per gallon of gasoline .
Of course , with Chile ’s minimum wage set at about $ 2 an hour , most laborers use public transport to get to work and , increasingly , bicycles to save on fare costs .
Solar water heaters are already popular in China , Israel and Spain .
California recently approved rebates for switching from gas or electric water heaters to solar units , and beginning this year Hawaii will make solar water heaters mandatory on all new homes .
The first housing project in Chile with these energy savers will be christened " We Woman Can . "
Jacquelin Marin said she regrets that Bachelet wo n't be president when ribbons on her new neighborhood are cut , but she intends to invite Bachelet to the opening anyway .
Maybe even to try her new hot shower .

The overhaul will apply to Comcast 's technology platform and products , which means all you malcontent Comcast cable , internet , and phone customers will soon be malcontent Xfinity cable , internet , and phone customers .
They 'll start rolling out the rebranding next week in about a dozen markets , with the rest of the country getting the Xfinity treatment later this month .
This comes at a time , conveniently enough , when Comcast would just possibly want to divert the conversation away from its upcoming merger with NBC .

One of the ironies about Democrats , especially in Congress , being so tentative about health care reform is that the anger the reform efforts seem to have unleashed is n’t really about health care reform at all .
That ’s not to say the anger is n’t real .
Take a look at this video shot by the Columbus Dispatch , of competing health care rallies yesterday outside the office of Democratic congresswoman Mary Jo Kilroy ( thanks to TPM Reader JL for the link ) .
Pay particular attention at the :50 second mark , where anti-reform protesters yell and throw a few bucks at a man holding a sign claiming he has Parkinson’s .
Those guys screaming about “ handouts ” would be perfectly at home at a rally in the 1990s , or the 80s , or the 70s and so on .
This is n’t new , and it ’s not original .
The social and cultural currents running through this debate exist independent of the debate , and the anger ca n’t be tempered or avoided by procedural figleafs that few people inside Washington understand or by better messaging .
At the end of the day , even abandoning reform wo n’t calm that kind of anger .
The Short Version : Dice proves once again its prowess at creating a masterful online multiplayer Experience !
We have a new king of online military shooters !
Using cooperative squad mechanics BFBC2 engages players in a visceral chaotic , but structured , online skirmish experience .
All that remains is to return to the franchises “ Buddy Action Comedy ” single player storyline , rather than this more “ serious ” approach which feels like a pretender instead of the unique offering BC2 can offer .
What you ’ll Like :
• Currently the KING of Online Military Shooters , so says Joe !
• Vehicles , Fully Destructible Environments and Changing Objectives come together to simulate an excellent battlefield experience .
• Squad Mechanics are the heart of this game , with almost every aspect encouraging squad coordination and Faction Teamwork .
• Superb and Visceral Sound FX create a feeling of a much larger engagement .
• The Bad Company Team still crack funny jokes , but a bit less so this time around .
What you ’ll Hate :
• Bad Company ’s Single player was stronger as a “ Buddy Action Comedy ” rather than a “ Serious Epic War Film ” .
• Its possible in some sections to just charge past the enemy , which auto - loads the next set of adversaries , completely skipping sections of the game .
• EA ’s Server Outages and Downtime during the first weeks of Release .
• Not Much Else ….( Quit Bitchin ’ about the Recon Class Newbs ! )

Using ActiveRecord with EventMachine
2010 -03-30 eventmachine
Given all my work with Fibers and EventMachine over the last three months , it should come as no surprise that I ’ve been working on infrastructure based on Fibers and EventMachine to get maximum scalability without the callback style of code which I dislike for many reasons .
Watch my talk on scaling with EventMachine if you need more background on the problem .
Now that I have RabbitMQ , Cassandra , Solr and the Amazon AWS services evented , the only holdup was ActiveRecord .
Some people may advocate using another ORM layer but when you have 2 - 3 other Rails apps , all sharing 100 + models , you ca n’t afford to maintain two separate ORM layers .
Plus , frankly I like the Rails stack : it works pretty well , is thoroughly documented and every Ruby developer is familiar with it .
So what do we need to do to get AR working event - style ?
At a high level , there ’s two things required :

So we just need to provide an exec method which uses Fibers under the covers to work asynchronously .
method for all traffic to the database .
So we just need to provide an exec method which uses Fibers under the covers to work asynchronously .
AR ’s connection pooling needs to be Fiber - safe .
Out of the box , it is Thread - safe .
Since we are using an execution model based on a single Thread with multiple Fibers , all the Fibers would try to use the same connection , with disastrous consequences .
These are the things that em_postgresql does .
postgres_connection is a basic , EM - aware Postgres driver .
It provides the Fibered exec ( ) method which makes the whole thing asynchronous .
em_postgresql_adapter.rb wraps postgres_connection to make it a proper ActiveRecord driver .
patches.rb overrides a bunch of AR ’s internal connection pooling to make it Fiber - friendly .
Unfortunately the latter makes one hack necessary – we have to have a list of current Fibers to release any lingering connections associated with those Fibers .
The Threaded version can use Thread .
list but Ruby does not provide an equivalent method for Fibers .
Instead I require the application to register a FiberPool with AR to clear stale connections .

So what does it all mean ?
Well , here ’s a Sinatra application that uses plain old ActiveRecord and is completely asynchronous !
Try ab -n 100 -c 20 http://localhost:9292/test to hit the app with 20 concurrent connections ; it will process them all in parallel , without any painful threading issues ( autoloading , misbehaving extensions , etc ) .
Awesome !
You should guess what ’s next .
Coming soon : the whole Rails stack , running asynchronously …

With Android 2.1 making its first appearence on the Nexus One , some Motorola DROID users may be wondering when it will be their turn .
If you can't wait for the official update to be sent out , which is due the first half of this year , here are 5 of the newest features that you can install , giving your DROID that 2.1 look ... now .
Fist off we 'd suggest installing the new , which will give you 5 home screens ( instead of 3 ) and the new 3D program 's list .
Begin by going into the DROID 's settings for applications and place a check next to " unknown source " .
Then download the launcher 2.apk file and install it on the DROID .
When you press the Home button on the bottom of the phone , it will ask you to open " Home " or " Launcher " .
If you select " Home " , it will go to the older layout , but if you select " Launcher " , it will take you to the new 2.1 layout .
You can switch between them at any time ( which will actually give you 8 total homescreens ) , or select the " Launcher " as the default if you do n't want to be asked each time .
Instead of installing the Gallery app listed below , there is now a .
You can download it here ( gallery3dmt.apk ) .
Up next is the newapp ( galleryflan.apk ) that once installed , will give you the same app that is on the Nexus One .
Just remember that your programs list will show two gallery icons , as one is the older and one is the newer app .
You can use it to view all of your pictures and videos , but the user interface and slick design is what makes this truly shine .
We like that you can easily move between images just by swiping across the screen ( instead of having to press the small arrows ) and that files can also be categorized by dates .
Theapp ( musicinstallable.apk ) is n't as flashy as the new gallery or launcher , but it is still a nice improvement over the one included on the DROID .
Once it 's installed and you click to run it , be sure to select " com.android.musik " from the list .
The new player has 4 tabs along to top for Artists , Albums , Songs , and Playlists , which allows for easier selection .
Also , when you are playing a song , it will show it on the bottom of the screen while you are navigating through the music app .
The ) uses the Weather Channel to pull your local conditions by GPS , and the news is categorized into Top Stories , U.S. , Sports , and Entertainment easy viewing .
Lastly , there is the newapp ( ) but you need to have the Gallery and News Genie / Weather Widget installed first , as well as having the physical Motorola Docking Station ( $ 30 ) or the DockRunner app installed from the Android Market .
The clock can be used in either portrait or landscape mode , and has icons on the bottom for the Alarm , Photo Slideshow , Music Player , and Home , with one icon on the top - right for Day & Night mode .
Unfortunately , it converts the temperature to be displayed as Celsius instead of Fahrenheit .
So there you have it , five Android 2.1 apps that you can use on the Motorola DROID .
Just remember that once the official 2.1 update for the DROID is released , that you should uninstall these first to avoid any problems .

Jim Letten , the United States attorney for New Orleans , recused himself from the case involving four men arrested last week on charges of interfering with the phones in Senator Mary L. Landrieu ’s office .
Mr. Letten said that after consulting with Justice Department officials , and “ in consideration of various relevant factors , ” he was allowing his first assistant attorney to handle the case .
Ms. Landrieu , a Democrat , has requested that Mr. Letten , who was appointed by President George W. Bush , be reappointed .
In addition , one of the four men arrested is the son of the acting United States attorney for the Northern District of Louisiana .
All right , mate , all right .
But if this really is the future of AR , let 's hope the marketing aspect is kept within reason .
While a heads - up Internet display and a pleasant voice encouraging me through my morning cup o' tea could be a decent addition to my a.m. routine , a bombardment of branding like the one envisioned here would leave me perpetually cranky .
In the chase for the playoffs , some NHL teams have a harder road to travel than others , and as we flip the calendar over to February , the Dallas Stars , St. Louis Blues and Calgary Flames will face the stiffest opposition during the rest of the regular season .
Over in the Eastern Conference , the rich are likely to get richer as the current division leaders , Washington , New Jersey , and Buffalo , all face relatively easy remaining schedules .
Follow after the jump for the complete breakdown ...
The following table shows the remaining games for each NHL team starting with tonight , February 1 , along with the average Points Percentage and Goals For / Against ratio in 5 - on - 5 play for their opponents , as an indicator of schedule strength .
We also have the number of times that each team has to play games on consecutive nights , using the NHL Super Schedule which I published last summer .
Home and road totals are included last .
For the sake of context , the average NHL team has a .559 Points Percentage ( thanks to the OTL point , most teams are above .500 ) , which translates to a 91 - point season across 82 games .
When teams play after having played the night before ( the 2nd half of a Back - To - Back Set ) , their Points Percentage typically dips significantly .
Last season , such teams had a .500 Pts % , as opposed to .557 overall .
Interestingly , the Dallas Stars will face the toughest opposition , but have the fewest Back - To - Backs remaining .
Obviously , the presence of Western Conference teams at the top of this list is due to them having to mostly play each other - the West is dominating the East this season , with an average Pts % of .573 to .545 ( and yet the East has more Overtime Losses , which makes even that comparison look closer than it should be ) .
This strength - of - schedule could have a net impact of a 2 - 4 points or so down the stretch ( for example : 27 games , 2 points per game available , and a difference of .050 = 2.7 total points ) .
Given the incredibly tight competition in the Eastern Conference , where positions 6 - 12 are separated by a mere two points , that 's definitely enough to make or break a few teams ' playoff hopes .
How will this impact your favorite team ?

You may now be able to choose from a wide assortment of protective screen films at Apple 's online or retail stores , but it looks like that wo n't be the case for much longer .
As iLounge is reporting from multiple sources ( and we have also heard ) , Apple will apparently stop selling all protective screen film products starting in May .
That includes both film - only products ( whether they are used for protective or anti-glare purposes ) , as well as cases that have a protective film built into them .
For its part , Apple is n't giving any reason for the move , or confirming it itself just yet , but it seems like it might not be the most popular decision if it is the case .
As iLounge points out , the single most popular iPod " case " in the Apple Store right now is , in fact , a protective film for the iPod touch .

It is the world 's most famous train journey , beginning in Moscow and ending in the dingy Pacific port of Vladivostok .
Along the way are Russia 's most picturesque vistas : Siberian rivers , the elegantly curving Lake Baikal , and the hazy Barguzin mountains .
There is also a lot of steppe .
But for those who always dreamed of travelling on the epic Trans - Siberian railway , but who never quite managed to stir from the sofa , help is at hand : a new website that takes you on a virtual tour of the 5,752 - mile route .
The multiplatform portal by Google Russia and Russian railways allows you to watch the view in real time as it unfolds from the train 's window .
Simultaneously you can plot the locomotive 's virtual progress eastwards on a Google map , looking at the satellite view or tracking the actual terrain and mountains .
The video footage covers the whole six - day journey .
You can choose different sounds to accompany it : the rumble of wheels , sugary Russian pop tunes , or the evocative playing of a balalaika .
Alternatively , you can listen to readings of Russian classics ( in Russian ) of Leo Tolstoy 's 1,400 - page War and Peace or Nikolai Gogol 's Dead Souls .
" We wanted to show the beauty of our country .
The Trans - Siberian railway is Russia 's unique calling card .
The idea was to bring the journey to people who may have thought about doing the trip but who never got round to booking it , " Alla Zabrovskaya , a spokeswoman for Google Russia , told the Guardian today .
Asked what her favourite view was , she said : " Baikal .
It made a big impression on me .
It was a beautiful day when the video was shot with brilliant sun and blue sky .

" Looking at the landscape is a very good way of relaxing . "
The website , which launched last Thursday , had received " an avalanche " of positive reviews from all over the world via Twitter , she said .
Train fans can watch all 150 hours of the epic journey , which starts in Moscow , trundles past suburban orange tower blocks , and goes on through 12 Russian regions and 87 cities .
For virtual travellers , of course , there is no need to queue for the loo or shower , and no danger of sharing a cabin with an omnipresent snorer .
( The downside is that you do n't get the scalding black tea served in a silver - leaf and glass holder . )
Alternatively , you can hop on and off – skipping to the highlights and diving into Russia 's rarely visited far east .
The website also offers a virtual guide , DJ Yelena Abitayeva , who gives a three - minute tour of key cities if you click on a red TV icon .
She starts off in Moscow and ends up in Russky Island , one of the furthermost points of Russia 's sprawling empire .
In Ulan - Ude – six time zones from Moscow , and close to the Mongolian border – Yelena shows off a giant statue of Lenin 's head .
She visits a Buddhist temple and spins some prayer wheels .
In the background a cow can be seen wandering across the road as a Lada drives past .
Filming took place in August 2009 , during Russia 's scorching summer , and was a major logistical feat .
Two video crews were involved , shooting out of the window as the train rattled across half of Europe and most of Asia .
Instead of the usual six days to reach Vladivostok , the camera team took 30 days , filming only in daylight and staying overnight in towns along the way .

" This project is very special .
We want to demonstrate how unusual and fascinating Russia really is and how much it can offer to a devoted tourist .
I know few people who travelled along the Trans - Siberian railroad but I am sure that a lot of people feel enthusiastic about this trip .
That 's why we hope that this project will become the starting point not only for the virtual but for real trips across Russia , " said Konstantin Kuzmin , the marketing director , Google Russia .
The project is n't entirely without its flaws .
The Moscow Times noted that " the simulated clickety - clacking of wheel over jointed track can become monotonous after a while .
But the paper also praised the site for cleverly showcasing '
Google 's latest technical advancements including the geo - tagged video allowing the trip to be plotted on a map in real time , and " the new YouTube support for ultra - high - definition video " .
Today , Russian railways said that the Trans - Siberian Express remains extremely popular with foreign tourists , who make up 80 to 90 % of its passengers .
A one - way non -stop ticket costs 6509 roubles ( £ 145 ) for a basic seat , and 17,500 ( £ 388 ) to 19,800 roubles ( £ 440 ) for a bed in a shared carriage .
Special tourist trains allowing you to stop off en route cost more .
Cheaper , and far easier , of course , to do it from home .

Some styles of beer , though , improve with a bit of age — not unlike a fine wine .
Prime candidates include beers that are high in alcohol ( e.g. Bigfoot Barleywine ) and those with a moderate amount of roasted grains ( e.g. Narwhal Imperial Stout ) .
Over time , oxygen sneaks into bottles and changes beer flavors , adding notes of sherry or port wine and smoothing out harsh alcohol flavors .
For the best results , vintage beers should hibernate in cool , dark places .

We built our first brewhouse using recycled dairy equipment .
We had to test our handywork , so we loaded it up with a heavy , dark Stout .
That first batch was a 13 - hour labor of love , and when we sipped the first bottle , we knew we had a keeper .
With a nod to the West Coast , we balance Stout ’s deep , roasted malt flavors with earthy , whole - cone hops .

The start of Celebration season is a festive event .
Once the first fresh hops arrive from harvest , the party begins !
We first brewed Celebration in 1981 , blazing the path for American - style IPAs and offering a new take on holiday beers , which are often spiced and sweet .
Famous for its citrus and pine aromas , Celebration is bold and intense , featuring Cascade , Centennial and Chinook hops — honoring everything we have at Sierra Nevada .

Each year , we try to top ourselves by making the hoppiest , most intense IPA we can muster .
We sample endless hop varieties during the annual harvest to choose the ultimate mix — flavorful and aggressive , yet refined .
Then we push them beyond their limits to reimagine Hoptimum , a remarkably drinkable triple IPA .

A traditional method is filling nylon sacks with hops and suspending them in fermentation tanks .
But sometimes we ’d remove those sacks — even weeks later — and they ’d be dry in the middle !
With the Hop Torpedo , we maximize every hop .
Beer circulates out of a fermenter , flows through the column of hops , and back into the tank .
By adjusting the time , temperature and speed of circulation , we can control the aromas and flavors in a finished beer .

Narwhal Imperial
Stout is inspired by the mysterious creature that thrives in the deepest fathoms of the frigid Arctic Ocean .
Rich with notes of espresso , baker ’s cocoa , roasted grain and a light hint of smoke , Narwhal brims with malt complexity .
Aggressive but refined with a velvety smooth body and decadent finish , Narwhal will age in the bottle for years to come .

A malt - forward monster lurking in the darkest depths .

We were in search of something fantastic .
Something juicy , something hazy , something ripe with notes of mango , melon and citrus .
So we said , " Reason be damned , " and filled our kettles with five hop varieties and loads of malt , oats and wheat .
Some may call that absurd .
We call it absurdly fantastic .

Bigfoot is a beast of a beer , packed with bittersweet malt and heaps of aggressive whole - cone Pacific Northwest hops .
First introduced in the winter of 1983 , Bigfoot is a cult - classic brewed in the barleywine style — strong and robust with the refined intensity of a wine .
Bigfoot is prized by beer collectors for aging in cellars .
Under the proper conditions , it can develop enticing new flavors and character as it matures in the bottle .
Each new release or “ expedition ” is vintage dated .
Collect your own and savor the evolving flavors .

Some styles of beer , though , improve with a bit of age — not unlike a fine wine .
Prime candidates include beers that are high in alcohol ( e.g. Bigfoot Barleywine ) and those with a moderate amount of roasted grains ( e.g. Narwhal Imperial Stout ) .
Over time , oxygen sneaks into bottles and changes beer flavors , adding notes of sherry or port wine and smoothing out harsh alcohol flavors .

Most Conservative MPs , including at least six members of the shadow cabinet , are sceptical about their party 's continued focus on climate change policies , it has been claimed .
The recent furore around " Climategate " has hardened the views of Tory MPs , many of whom were already unconvinced by the scientific consensus , and has led to increasing calls for the issue to be pushed down the priority list .
Tim Montgomerie , founder and editor of the ConservativeHome website , said climate change had the potential to be as divisive for the party as Europe once was .
" You have got 80 % or 90 % of the party just not signed up to this .
No one minded at the beginning , but people are starting to realise this could be quite expensive , so opinion is hardening . "
Montgomerie said that while some MPs simply did not believe the science , others felt it would harm the economy too much to focus on policies to reduce emissions .
" Some think , ' What is the point in taking all these decisions if India and China and others row ahead ? '
Nigel Lawson makes the point that 30 % of Indian people have no electricity and the Indian government has to give that to them .
The cheapest way to do that is fossil fuels . "
Lord Lawson chairs the Global Warming Policy Foundation , a thinktank that claims the climate debate has been distorted by exaggeration .
On pages 28 and 29 , Benny Peiser , director of the foundation , debates the issue with the Observer 's science editor , Robin McKie .
A recent BBC poll found that 25 % of people did not think global warming was happening – compared with 15 % in November – and a similar trend is taking place among Conservative MPs .
" You scratch almost any backbencher and you find they are sceptical and I know of six shadow cabinet ministers who are sceptical about the economic consequences of a low - carbon policy , " said Montgomerie .
He said the leadership was " recalibrating " its message .
Last week , representatives of 50 Tory councils gathered in London for a " Lean and Green " conference where Nick Herbert and Greg Clark – the shadow environment and energy secretaries – argued that green policies could save money and improve Britain 's energy security .
Clark rejected the notion that it was a change in direction .
" There is a real threat to our energy security and there is a risk of a black - out , " he said .
Green policies that developed alternatives to fossil fuels and persuaded people to reduce energy consumption were " win-win " because they saved money , provided energy security and reduced carbon emissions .
One MP said the party was much more likely to respond to economic arguments : " There is a large group in the party – probably the majority – who are sceptical .
That ranges from those who do n't believe any of it to those that think the climate is changing but are not sure how much it is down to human beings , to those who accept the science but think we could act , but then in one year China and India could wipe out that effort . "
There are fears that the issue could flare up after the election if the Conservatives win power – particularly around plans for a third runway at Heathrow , which the party has said it will scrap .
Tim Yeo , the Tory MP who chairs the environmental audit select ­committee , said the shift had come about because of scientific mistakes , and a " backwash " from Copenhagen .
" That has created a context in which it is easy for sceptics to build momentum and that is influencing a good number of politicians .
" What people have lost sight of is that serious climate - change scientists have always argued that the climate is changing gradually , that temperatures are rising and that one factor – and probably the main one – is the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
But they have never argued that it is easy to know how quickly that is happening .
The scientist at the centre of " Climate­gate " last night revealed he was so traumatised by the scandal that he considered killing himself .
Professor Phil Jones told the Sunday Times the support of his family , especially the love of his five - year - old granddaughter , had helped him to shake off suicidal thoughts .
Countless times throughout history we have seen governments tell the people that they will offer them security in the threat of danger .
In return the people would have their freedoms taken away and given tyranny .
Growing up in North America we have always had the perception of good versus evil , right verses wrong , and the good / right would always win in the end .
Movies where no matter what transpired the good guy always saved the day and got the girl .
However , somewhere along the way the true reality that “ bad things always happen to good people ” set in and the realization that we were slipping into tyranny set in .
The worst part about it is even when people are told of the tyranny and true plans of the world ’s elite , they do n’t even seem to get angry about it or feel as though it matters .
What happened to us ?
I guess the majority have been drinking too much tap water allowing for the fluoride , lithium , and other 150 to 300 chemicals to dumb us down and turn us into sheep .
Now days it is not uncommon to see articles with titles such as ‘ Public not worried about increased public surveillance : report ’ or ‘ Obama Information Czar Calls For Banning Free Speech ’ .
It is , however , absurd that the vast majority do not even seem to get angry from them .
As we slip further in George Orwell ’s 1984 of a completely controlled society and as the bankers and eugenics known as the New World Order carry out the final stages of their long running agenda , I ask , when are the people finally going to shake the sheepish looks off of their faces and the sheepish domineer out of their heads ?
Time is a luxury that we , as people , may truly no longer afford .
The next three years of our lives have to be the time where we make a difference and change the course of the future .
Every facet of our lives will change if we go along with the global elite ’s plans for a tax on living , a police state control grid , and a continued eugenics program that will see the murder of 80 % of the entire world ’s population .
This is not exaggerated in the least and the information is out there for people to research for themselves .
Break through the mind control today and truly make a difference for the future of your children , grandchildren , and in essence , the entire human race .
I ’d like to take this time to thank the people at the Canada Free Press for posting the news and truth as it is meant to be read .
Also , Alex Jones and his crew over at Infowars.com and prisonplanet.com , Webster Tarpley , and others who have spent the better part of their lives exposing the New World Order and the true criminals that are wreaking havoc on our lives .

One year ago today President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , popularly known as the Stimulus Bill .
That bill has become something of a flashpoint in the country ’s political conversation ( if you can call it that ) ever since , with Republicans making outlandish claims along the lines of “ it has n’t created one new job ” when of course it created many , and so forth .
Well , a year has gone by , and at least some of the facts are in .
And guess what ?
It worked .
Imagine if , one year ago , Congress had passed a stimulus bill that really worked .
Let ’s say this bill had started spending money within a matter of weeks and had rapidly helped the economy .
Let ’s also imagine it was large enough to have had a huge impact on jobs – employing something like two million people who would otherwise be unemployed right now .
If that had happened , what would the economy look like today ?
Well , it would look almost exactly as it does now .
Because those nice descriptions of the stimulus that I just gave are n’t hypothetical .
They are descriptions of the actual bill .
Really ?
Wait – a Republican told me that the stimulus bill was a failure and that it did n’t create any jobs !
Perhaps the best - known economic research firms are IHS Global Insight , Macroeconomic Advisers and Moody ’s Economy.com .
They all estimate that the bill has added 1.6 million to 1.8 million jobs so far and that its ultimate impact will be roughly 2.5 million jobs .
The Congressional Budget Office , an independent agency , considers these estimates to be conservative .
I know , I know .
Facts are so boring compared to exciting , incendiary talking points .
But here are some more facts .
Look , folks , there cannot be any serious doubt that the stimulus bill has done a lot of good .
Could it have been better ?
Sure .
Could it have been implemented more perfectly ?
Sure , though it ’s hard to find that much fault for minor bumps in the road in light of the bill ’s scope .
But here ’s the NYT again :
The program has had its flaws .
But the attention they have received is wildly disproportionate to their importance .
To hark back to another big government program , it ’s almost as if the lasting image of the lunar space program was Apollo 6 , an unmanned 1968 mission that had engine problems , and not Apollo 11 , the moon landing .
Unfortunately , though , the political universe in which we currently live is a very strange one .
Success is failure ; new jobs are not jobs ; up is down .
I ’m not sure what the best strategy is going forward , since talking honestly about what has actually happened does n’t seem to be in vogue .

There is still a chance that Hummer will fly again
Hummer 's suffering is about to be ended .
The lumbering giant is being put down by patriarchal General Motors , the American motoring giant 61 % - owned by the US government .
It is a sign of the times .
The former favourite of Moscow 's moneyed , and the wheels once favoured by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , has been hit by a double whammy of tighter belts in some of its markets and a dramatic shift in public opinion in others .
Driving the Hummer is an experience Large gas - guzzlers are increasingly being shunned by frugal , environmentally aware , or simply fashion conscious punters eager to downsize their modes of transport .
As a symbol of conspicuous consumption , or of a lack of regard for the environment , the Hummer makes its owners look distinctly out of touch with the current public mood .
It seems even the Chinese authorities are steering clear of the beast .
" The brand proposition of Hummer itself goes against the strategic outline of the Chinese government , which is mainly that they want to produce energy - efficient vehicles , " explains Klaus Paur , North Asia director for market research company TNS .
Which might go some way to explain why Chinese firm Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machines pulled the plug on an earlier agreement to buy the brand , having failed to gain clearance from Chinese regulators .
King of the Road The Hummer is arguably the most aggressive looking vehicle there is , and no wonder given that the original H1 , launched 18 years ago , was based on the US Humvee military vehicle .
Later versions were less macho , but only marginally so .
Its butch looks were key to the marque 's image .
The original Hummer was based on the military Humvee Driving a Hummer down the broad streets of Detroit is an experience , though what you get out of it depends on the strength of your nerves .
Seated high and mighty in a seat resembling a throne above the Hummer 's humming engine gives you a powerful feeling of being King of the Road .
Unless you are a mere journalist in a borrowed test car , that is , in which case the fear of hitting something , or even rolling straight over the odd low - slung Mustang , can easily make you sweat .
By the time you have managed to find a parking place wide enough you will resemble a genuine Desert Rat .
Still hope
But as Hummer production seems destined to end it is also clear that the truck will be missed by its loyal crowd of fans .
Indeed , there are still people out there who are convinced the vehicle has a future and that a market remains for it .
And GM is still eager to hear from anyone who wants to buy the brand .
" In the early phases of the wind - down , we 'll entertain offers and determine their viability , " says GM spokesman Nick Richards .
So although it might be time to prepare for Hummer 's funeral , it may well be premature to carve out its tombstone .

WASHINGTON  The Obama administration will begin a drive this week to expel Pepsi , French fries and Snickers bars from the nation ’s schools in hopes of reducing the number of children who get fat during their school years .
In legislation , soon to be introduced , candy and sugary beverages would be banned and many schools would be required to offer more nutritious fare .
To that end , Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack will deliver a speech Monday at the National Press Club in which he will insist , according to excerpts provided to The Times , that any vending machines that remain in schools be “ filled with nutritious offerings to make the healthy choice the easy choice for our nation ’s children . ”
The first lady , Michelle Obama , said last month that she would lead an initiative to reduce childhood obesity , and her involvement “ shows the importance all of us place on this issue , ” Mr. Vilsack said .
CALGARY , Alberta --
If the Detroit Red Wings extend their playoff streak to 19 seasons ,
might be looked back upon as their defining moment .
After the pivotal game , the team flew to Kelowna , a town general manager Ken Holland refers to as a " year - round paradise . "
Instead of heading into this rare three - day break between road games on a sour note , the Red Wings are upbeat and confident about their postseason chances .
Instead of being one point out of a playoff spot following a regulation loss , they are three points ahead of the Flames for the final berth in the Western Conference .
" That was a topic of conversation ( Sunday ) at dinner , " goaltender Jimmy Howard said .
" Got to get two points ( Monday ) to make these next three days enjoyable , allow us to relax just a little bit and have some fun . "
After a day off Tuesday , the Red Wings are scheduled to practice Wednesday and Thursday at Prospera Place , the 6,800 - seat home of the major junior Kelowna Rockets .
They will wrap up the trip with games in Edmonton on Friday and Vancouver on Saturday .
" Now the guys can have a day off and then practice really hard for two days in an environment where you get to relax a little bit and get ready for a push , " Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said .
" Because we got to have a real good push . "
When the schedule was released in July and Holland saw the three - day break , he pondered two options , neither of which was spending more time in the sub - freezing temperatures of Edmonton .
They considered Banff , the ski resort town just west of Calgary , but they 've been there before with the team .
" We decided we'd do something different , " Holland said .
Different for most of the players , but not to Holland and goalie Chris Osgood , who have summer homes 45 minutes north in Vernon , British Columbia , or Babcock , who played a year of junior hockey in Kelowna .
Holland was born in Vernon , where he says he will retire .
He likened the Okanagan Valley to Traverse City for its scenery and to Napa Valley , Calif. , for its roughly 40 vineyards .
The area is popular for golf , skiing and wine .
" It 's one of the best climates in Canada , " Holland said .
" It 's a popular winter destination for Canadians . "
It also is a popular summer home for NHL players , including Osgood , who has lived there for 14 years .
" I was golfing in ( former teammate ) Brent Gilchrist 's tournament and just fell in love with the area , " Osgood said .
" My mom lives about two hours away .
I just decided to stay out there .
" When I moved there , there was n't that many ( players and ex-players ) there .
Now , there 's got to be over a hundred .
It 's a beautiful area .
The weather is really good in summer and winter .
Just a great area to live . "
Holland is n't sure if the practices will draw capacity crowds , but he expects at least 3,000 to 4,000 fans per day .
" Hopefully , it puts a bolt of energy into our team , " he said .
The Red Wings will look to match a season - high four - game winning streak against the Oilers , who have the worst record in the NHL .
" To me is what gives a team confidence is when you start putting some streaks together , " Babcock said .
The Red Wings and Flames each have 13 games remaining .
But Detroit plays seven at home , Calgary just five .
While the Red Wings have only six games against clubs in playoff position and five games against the bottom - feeding Oilers and Columbus Blue Jackets , the Flames have a much tougher schedule , with nine games against teams in a position to make the postseason .
" We like our group .
We got to show that we 're worth liking , " Babcock said .
" You ca n't just talk about it , you got to do it .
( Monday ) is a good step for us . "

Subject : The Best ?
It 's impossible , and as a result , pointless , to rank shows , individual performances , songs or anything else related to the Grateful Dead as " best " or " worst " or anything in between .
To paraphrase Peter Parker , with subjectivity comes great ambiguity .
We can talk all day about an individual 's " best , " " worst , " etc .
But a universal one ?
It 's meaningless .
That said , it 's clear this concert is one of the band 's high points , from both a musical proficiency and sonically explorative standpoints .
And it is my personal favorite , with 3 - 23 - 74 a close second .
Speaking of which , while this is my favorite show , 1974 is my favorite year overall .
For my money , the " Morning Dew " here is worth the price of admission alone -- and without question my favorite version .
To this day , this performance leaves me exhilarated , exhausted and awestruck by the end of it .
I 've managed to learn Garcia 's two leads to the point I can play them fairly competently .
My performance is a poor - man 's version , at best , but it 's the only Dead song I 've done that for .
It 's that good , IMHO .
The other highlights for me include " Brown Eyed Woman , " " Mama Tried , " " St. Stephen , " " Jack Straw , " and " Estimated , " but every song on here is a treat in one way or another .

The Best ?
Reviewer : RiPHRaPH - favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite - May 29 , 2019
Subject : Very well played but not the pinnacle
We can begin by stating that this is a top show in the top month in the top year of the top band .
Listening to the concert in its entirety enables one to catch subtle nuances and tones .
I see many others assigning an overall rating based on recording quality or elevating shows that they attended or have a strong affinity for .
I just do n't see the sustained energy that others see .
First , lets begin with some facts .
There are 6 cover songs here , allowing for Lazy / Supplication as GD songs due to their close proximity .
There is no definitive Phil Zone here .
It is nearly but not a 3 hr long show .
The St Stephen is rare even for ' 77 .
Here are some observations .
Disappointing opening selection in Minglewood .
Loser is a top choice but not the raw emotion of 9/3/77
El Paso is nice but nobody is going to rate a show based on this song .
Give me TLEO from ' 73 , all others pale .
JStraw is nice but without the peaks of subsequent years ( kudos to Jerry for nailing his 2 lines )
Deal seems misplaced , wo n't find its legs and finish till it reached 1st set ending status .
VG BEW but Hartford was best .
Never been a fan of Dancin ' --> nice 1st set , but no versions that transcend ' 77 ( ex. Sugaree , 5/28/77 Hartford ) .
Not even the best Take a Step Back of that tour ( 9/3/77 )
26 min Scarlet / Fire ?
Nice , but nobody will call it transitional .
Top Estimated .
Fantastic St> NFA >St. Best DEW of all time .
OMSN falls flat as an encore .
2nd set is robbed of those great transitions between songs where you just float --> next song .
Missing that texture and feel .
Overall , very well played but seems a bit utilitarian .
Splitting hairs here as this week of shows bridges the gap between Swing show 2/27 and the beautiful Wonderland 3 night run 6/7-6/8-6/9 .
The illustrious fall ' 77 tour never happens without this and other shows of May ' 77 .
* disclaimer , my first show was 12/3/1979 .
Peace . - May 29 , 2019

Even though there are plenty better shows ... I can't give this any less than 5 stars .
The sheer power of the St. Stephen > Not Fade Away > St. Stephen > Morning
Dew sets this show above all others from 1977 , IMO .
I had a poor , Half - Step slow cassette of the second set for many years before I heard a good quality tape and before I heard any of the first set .
I did n't really care that much for the Scarlet , too much Donna warbling , but it has grown on me , and of course Fire has got to be the absolute best version ( except 3/5/81 , of course ) .
Estimated from those days is pretty raw , and Bob steps on Jerry 's solo by coming back in with " Na - na - na - na " just as Jerry 's hitting his stride , but Jerry just changes course and makes it sound planned .
Then the tape flips , and they start up St. Stephen , and we 're off on a wild and crazy ride .
There 's a point about 3 minutes before the actual return to St. Stephen , which I thought would have been the perfect place to make the transition , but instead Jerry pulls up into NFA chording , followed by a mini - drum break .
The transition is a gorgeous one when it does arrive .
What more needs to be said about the Dew .
To be honest , I 'm not that big a fan of the Dancing from this show ; it kinda drags , IMO .
There are better ones out there where Jerry makes equally heavy use of the envelope filter at a slightly faster tempo .
( On relistening , the tempo does n't seem that much a problem once the jam gets going . )
And certainly it 's a blasé first set otherwise --- no Help > Slip ! , no Let It Grow , not even a Cassidy , Jack Straw drags , Keith is stuck in chord mode ) .
And I can think of probably at least a dozen shows off hand from 72 - 74 that I like better than this or any 77 show .
But this one carries so much emotional weight in the Heady community , and is so powerful towards the end , that now that it 's been released , I highly recommend getting your copy while you can .
Now they just need to release 7/18/76 and 1/22/78 , and they 'll have covered that period very well .

Taking my daughter to see Cornell , as we entered Barton Hall our twenty something tour guide merrily cranked out " if we have any old GD fans - some people say this was the sight of the best show ever " .
Listening to this i can see why .

Subject : Keith on Keys
This is definitely a great show audio - wise and what 's even more interesting is that you can hear Keith playing the organ so clearly .
It really comes to life right in the beginning during Loser .
This is cool to me considering Keith was n't really the strongest organ player but could still lay down some different colors from time to time for Jerry to solo over and accentuate the band .

It really comes down to the Morning Dew .
I can see why this is so highly regarded .
It is funny though as I navigate my way through a number of spring 77 shows , I find many of theses shows have their staunch advocates .
That said , i see that each one of these shows ( Boston , Buffalo , Alabama , Atlanta , Baltimore , NYC , Hollywood Florida , Winterland all have their strengths )
The thing that separates Barton Hall is the exceptional Morning Dew .
I have many of these spring 77 shows handy , but my favorite go to recordings are 8-6- 71 Bertrando`s , 9-28-72 , 2-13-70 and 3-15-90 .
I find this Barton hall is especially about Jerry being on top of his game where I like to hear the interplay of the early 70 `s along with the ambiance and personal interaction of of the 60`s and early 70`s .
I`m also a huge fan of Brent in the late 80`s .
As far as the set list here and throughout spring 77 , they played the heck out of Help - Slip - Franklins - Sampson .
Anyway , it is a blessing to have access to all of these wonderful recordings .
When , I get bored with one show or period then I can move on for a while .

Additionally , every person has their own opinion , as well as their own subjective filter by and through which they interpret a show .
Song choice / set list , era , and many other factors influence individual opinion .
That being said I keep coming back to this show over and over .
Having listened to hundreds of shows , making my own list of top shows , revisiting those , etc. no show I have ever heard EXCEEDS this show .
Personally I am a ' 73 fan , but there are valid arguments to be made for each era 's superiority .
Here is why this show is one of , if not the best .
All arguments about Jerry being the leader aside , he was definitely the heart and soul of the band , especially post Pig .
Listen to the energy from the beginning to the end of this show .
Listen specifically to the energy Jerry had throughout the entire show .
Listen to what he is doing on the guitar in El Paso , Jack Straw , Deal , etc. and you will realize that there is an extra vibrancy even in the old standbys at the beginning of the show .
That does n't even begin to consider the songs that everyone raves about , Row Jimmy , Dancin , Scarlet - Fire , St Stephen - NFA - St Stephen , Morning Dew ... mere words cannot do justice .
Words like amazing and unbelievable and incomparable do n't capture the immensity of awe they inspire .
The whole is far greater than the sum of the parts , transcending even time and space ...
And PHIL , on PHIRE .
Phil is the engine , driving the juggernaut .
He and Jerry and Bobby were feeding off each other , inspiring each other , and the crowd was feeding off them , and they were feeding off the crowd .
This is a shining example of how the Dead and the crowd all formed a cohesive , organic whole .
As a musician and a person who has observed many , many musicians over many , many years I can tell you that musicians are like athletes .
Most especially , elite musicians are like elite athletes , there are days where everything you do is magical ,
For the Grateful Dead this happened many times .
For the Grateful Dead this happened on the stage of Barton Hall , at Cornell University , in Ithaca NY on the 8th of May , 1977 .
So this is simple , as the Grateful Dead were all actually human beings ( contrary to various lysergically induced musings ) , it was not possible for them to play a perfect show .
Every show has a missed lyric or someone hits a clinker .
Additionally , every person has their own opinion , as well as their own subjective filter by and through which they interpret a show .

First , I would like to know how I can download the MP3s so that I can put these shows on my mobile device and I do not need to use mobile data to stream the shows .
The links below did not work for me .
Secondly ,
I have always loved the Dead , but since Phish returned to touring in 2009 , I have really been caught up in their scene again .
However , the recent announcement of the Deads 50th shows , with Trey onboard , I have had a wonderful resurgence of listening to past Dead shows .
Unfortunately , I am old enough to only have been able to see one Dead show , in ' 94 , then Jerry died .
Phish has been more my generation and love em or hate them , they have continued a scene and amazing American subculture that needs to be perpetuated and I , for one , am over the moon about my two favorite bands and the two greatest figureheads of a culture I love so much , finally merging together to celebrate the Godfathers of our world .

Um - you know , there 's a reason why Cornell 5 - 8 - 77 gets referred to as " Legendary " " Best " etc. , etc .
Because IT IS Legendary and rightfully so .
Unless someone cut your feet off so you can't dance AND poked out both of your eardrums so you can't hear before you ever listened to this show you know it is undeniably a FANTASTIC show .
I was n't there , unfortunately , but my 1st show was Flushing Meadows , July ' 69 , at the New York Pavilion at the old Worlds Fair Sight ( think Men In Black ) so I have been listening for a long time and this is one of my favorite shows .
Even way back when was all I had was a many generations old Aud .
Cassette like everyone else had , I would put this sucker into my Walkman , or whatever it was , before I 'd go for a run in Wilbur Park in Oneonta , NY .
I RUN not jog .
I 'd cue up Scarlet - Fire and take off .
Sometimes I 'd be dancing as I ran - could n't help it - and like I said - I RUN .
And it was magical .
Dangerous , maybe , but magical .
I would be sailing along in our own little world - the one Fantastic Dead tunes allows us admission to .
So Haters : do n't hate just to hate .

Subject : So many " Best Version " songs here Contrary to popular opinion , this show is NOT overrated .
First off I wanna state that this is one of the best Dead shows I have ever heard .
Dancing in the streets is hands down , THE BEST version the Dead have ever pulled off .
It 's funky , the playing is tight , the jamming is loose , Jerry is making some crazy spacey , lazer beam sounding notes , and the rest of the band are all in sync to the jam .
It is seriously my favorite jam from the dead , from any song .
I honestly can not get enough of it .
My absolute favorite part of the jam is definitely the last 2 mins before they go back into the chorus one last time .
It is the CLEANEST they have ever played that particular part in any version of " Dancin ' "
The funk is exploding thru the roof at that point .
WOW .
100/100 ! 5 Stars !
Two thumbs up !
I 'm telling you , this is the best " Dancin ' " you 're gonna hear from the Dead .
Next , Scarlett Begonias > Fire On The Mountain .
Again , this is gonna be one of THE best version of S>F you are gonna hear from the Dead , ( My number 1 choice for best S>F has to go " 2/5/78 " , or the one from " Dick 's Picks vol 18 " , but that 's another review ) .
What makes a good S>F combo ?
" Scarlett " , the transitional jam , and " Fire " , all need to be good and consistent .
This " Scarlett " is smoking !
Exploding with energy throughout .
The playing is so dead on , Jerry 's vocal delivery is exceptionally good ( throughout the whole night for that matter ) Phil is in top form , never hitting a wrong note , the drums are perfect and bobby is on fire .
The jam in between the two songs are Grateful Dead at their best .
So psychedelic , so mellow , so inspired , so free flowing , so real .
Then " Fire " begins .
Wow .
Keep in mind that the Dead were playing this song more than over a year before it would actually be released in 78 on the album " Shakedown Street " .
The crowd must 've felt their mind being blown away from their head after hearing it .
Yeah Jerry flubbs on a couple of the lyrics but like I said , this was more than a year before they would release it commercially .
Anywho .

Wow !
Pleasantly surprised !
The energy comes through more than I remember and Keith truly shines .
On the SBD you every inch of his keyboard at all times .
Jerry and the rest of the band are no slouches either .
Hearing every bended note while Jerry shreds his solo in Row Jimmy is sublime .

Subject : --
The most overrated Dead show of all time is simply just Another Amazing Grateful Dead Concert .
No more , no less .
But , let 's not kid ourselves here - to deny the mythology of Cornell ' 77 is to deny that looming white elephant that makes this show more or less impossible to look at with any sort of objectivity .
If you 're a brand - new deadhead , and know nothing about Cornell ' 77 , just stop right here before reading any further reviews and take advantage of your position .
Cornell looms large for the weary Deadhead , sometimes irritatingly so , like someone you love dearly but whose reputation precedes them .
I do love Cornell ' 77 so , but to insult the entire legacy of the band by declaring with all the other minions this " the greatest show of all time " ?
Puh - leeeeze .
I actually find the patch on Minglewood distracting - gimme the good ol ' cassette tape days - hearing it fade up and in , swallowing us into the journey .
Although , I must confess I really am happy to have the patch on Supplication .
Loser , El Paso , the lsd - blooper - paranoia drive of TLEO - all of these are noteworthy for how the * sound * simply envelops and swallows the crowd - you can hear them , the on- edge , the soaking - dosed minions trying to be heard over the opening chords - that has long been one of my favorite things about Cornell - hearing the crowd 's total , without - choice submission to the band .
Listen to the line " sun so hot ... " in Jack Straw .
The band is , to my mind , columns of Americana - as - celestial light singing towards the spheres .
The is by far my favorite rendering of this tune .
Listen to the opening bars of Row Jimmy - it 's just a little too slow , a little too molasses - laden .
The crowd , again , knows it and fully " gets it " .
I think you'd be hard - pressed to find a finer version .
I 've converted people to deadheads from Dancin ' alone .
One particular friend I remember was amazed that this was the Grateful Dead ( he used to the Workingman 's FM - radio stuff ) .
Was a fan from then on .
Scarlet >
Fire - the tap - tap - tap hi-hat , signaling the explosion , * still * , after all these many years , gives me the chills .
As does the perfect , absolutely beside - ourselves ' fall ' into Fire .
You know the moment - when Mickey and Billy give up the rhythm and fall ' in ' , Jerry and Phil trading off those little notes back and forth to signal the start of the song .
No matter where I am I stop and let these moments sink in , like they 've done so many times before .
The goosebumps come from underneath .
It 's a deep , deep chill , guys .
The suite has such a tough act to follow I 've never given it as much attention as the first 2 /3rds of the show , but there 's no excuse for that - it 's beautiful .
Morning Dew is all about perfectionism in music .
So that 's that .

Do n't be deceived by your familiarity with this music folks - this is n't only a defining moment for this band , it 's one of the beautiful moments in American Music .
This is what happens , folks , when you mix Earl Scruggs , Chuck Berry , the nuclear bomb , and LSD .
This band was already immortal before 1977 , but here we have the consolidation of a New Sound , which you can hear them still reaching on 10.9.89 , for instance .
I was lucky enough to hear them touch it here and there during my first show at the Omni in March of 93 .
I feel like a privileged member of the human race to have seen and heard these guys still rubbing up against this horizon on occasion in the early 90s .

Subject : Highest quality Dead With fresh ears ( first time hearing Barton Hall end to end ) and some experience ( 200 + shows ) , I came to this " legendary " Dead show for the first time this am after being prompted by a cute rave call out for it on Google Maps , of all places .
While I 'd missed being at this one , I was at the Springfield show 2 weeks earlier and the Hartford show 2 weeks later ... anyways , after listening to this beautiful - and beautifully recorded - gig , I have to agree with the posters who feel this timeless music is best understood in its entirety , not in bits of this night or that .
Somehow , some way , this eclectic group of musicians , led by the gifted Garcia enjoying one of his great creative and physical peaks , and anchored by fellow genius Lesh , achieved and sustained a musical summit for about 6 - 9 consecutive months that feels unparalleled in their long career .
Sure , there may have been " higher highs " or more amazing moments , but , listening to the evidence , did they ever have a run like ' 77 when everyone was on his ( or her ) game all the time ?
To the Keith - bashers , pls consider his Barton solo on " They Love Each Other " - wowza !
To the " disco Dead haters , " pls consider " Dancin ' " once again - they never sounded tighter or lighter ... they 're clearly having a great time , and giving one !
So the verdict , to me , has to be Highest Rating / 5 Stars - not just for this specific show ( there are a few imperfections , as if that ever mattered at a Dead show ! ) but for the period 's entire body of work .

But the best ?
Hell it 's not the best from May let alone the year .
There are better first sets and better played and jammed second sets .
Bob and Donna both blow vocal cues and the St. Stephen > NFA >
St. Stephen is way too slow for my tastes and looses focus at the end of NFA .
It almost falls apart .
2/26/77 Swing Auditorium is better than this show ( first Terrapin ) as is the next night at Buffalo 5/09 / 77 .
The show at the Mosque 5/25 / 77 is more wildly jammed and has a much better set list .
The Dick 's Pick for Englishtown NJ is a better show .
Anyway , you get the point .
Now that what this show is n't has been established , what this show is is wonderfully recorded , slightly above average ' 77 Grateful Dead with one of the best Morning Dews they ever played .
It would be nice if Grateful Dead would officially release this show , but I 'm not holding my breath .

The best way I have found to activate the " Web " function of RealPLayer is to paste the Cornell url into the upper right search box labeled " video . "
It will say it cant find the video in my machine and will give a second option to search the web .
Click web and re-paste the Cornell url and feel the power of cookin ' with Phire .

The best way I have found to activate the " Web " function of RealPLayer is to paste the Cornell url into the upper right search box labeled " video .
"
It will say it cant find the video in my machine and will give a second option to search the web .
Click web and re-paste the Cornell url and feel the power of cookin ' with Phire .
Voila !
Now you can download the songs by the same process : left click - song 1 - to selectright ckick - song 1 - select " download this video " ( it wont be a video and will be playable in RealPlayer or WindowsMediaPlayer .
Do the same for song 2 and 3 etc. until you have the whole show .
RealPlayer puts them in it 's My Videos file so that is where you go to find them , move them around , burn them etc .
Hot Damn !
You have yourself a true 5 star show .

Oh yeah , go on Sugar Megs.com and download JGB 1978 - 02 - 18 .

And still my favorite Morning Dew .
Yes , there are folks that will take issue with my opinion , but that is what makes this Archive so cool .
We can say what we think in a safe , friendly environment , and when someone disagrees and points to another show , it gives us a reason to " visit " that show .....
At the end of the day , no rating .
Why ?
Because there is n't the 10 star rating some of these ' 77 shows deserve .

Subject :
The best of one of the best I 've always had a twinge of regret that I abandoned college in upstate NY ( Syracuse ) and moved to the SF Bay Area six months before this show ( in large part because I wanted to be nearer the whole SF Bay Area scene and the Dead ) .
All of my fellow Deadhead friends from college went to this show , and they rave about it to this day .
For my part , I caught the Dead 's June homecoming from this tour at Winterland exactly a month later .
But the Barton show became legendary .
Why ?
Well , of course the quality of the performance .
As more and more performances from the spring ' 77 tour have become available ( including the Winterland show I attended ) , it 's pretty clear the Dead were as close to " on " that night as they ever get .
Yet they were also pretty much " on " at , among others from that tour , the Pembroke Pines and Hartford shows , too .
( I will add that I tend to agree with Latvala -- the 5 - 22 - 77 show in Pembroke Pines was the closest to a peak show on this tour . )
The difference is that the Barton show has been available for ages -- passed from hand to hand through multiple tape generations -- and is probably the first ( and for a long time only ) tape many Deadheads had .
Because of that -- and because it was certainly one of the Dead 's better shows on a tour that is arguably one of the Dead 's best tours ever -- it has acquired an almost sacred if not mythic status .
As a former recording engineer , I can attest that this version is the best of the copies available in the Archive .
There are no perfect ones , that 's for sure .
Some prefer the Stevenson SM57 audience copy for reasons many like audience copies -- the sense of actually being in the audience and the like .
Me , I prefer soundboards .
This an excellent matrix , however .
Unlike most soundboard snobs , I think matrixes have their place ( see Fillmore East 9-19 - 1970 ) -- and this show is definitely one of them .
Technically , there are two faults with this copy that must be pointed out .
One is well - known : the splice - ins of the audience copy to replace the fade - in at the beginning of Minglewood and the gap in the Lazy Lightning -> Supplication transition .
The second is the bottom heavy EQ on the SBD .
( Betty loves bottom , if you do n't know by now . )
If you like Phil -- and who does n't ? -- this is great , though his prominence in the mix sometimes overpowers a bit .
The bottom heaviness also brings Bill 's kick drum to the fore , and the kick is oddly EQ'd and / or miked , making it both jolting and a bit muddy at the same time .
( If you are streaming this with WinAmp , put the EQ on and knock the 60 Hz fader down about 6dB .
If you 're using WMP , level the 30 Hz and 60 Hz bands down a good 6 dB or so .
One of these days , I 'm going to run the whole thing through Audacity and make this permanent . )
I 'm not going to critique the individual songs .
Is this the best Scarlet >
Fire from the tour , or any Dead show ?
Maybe .
My personal favorites from this show are Jack Straw , Lazy Lightning / Supplication , Scarlet / Fire ( of course ! ) , and last but certainly not least St. Stephen / Not Fade Away -- in which Jerry is on absolute fire .
By this point , most Deadheads will have a nice ' 77 spring tour collection as a playlist on their handheld or other dee-vices .
This show is undoubtedly a highlight .

The " it " factor
It 's not always about how impeccably well the band played , or solos and crescendos for all eternity .
Sometimes a show lives on in the heart of every Dead Head because of something intangible , or a combination of subtleties that create the perfect storm of a bootleg .
That 's
Cornell ' 77 .
For many of us , it was our first introduction to crystalline perfection as far as the sound of a Dead Boot on an XL II .
Getting baked and blaring Cornell ' 77 from the friend who had the best tape deck and speakers , or the friend with the best sound system in the car each of us drove in high school .
For a long time , and hundreds or maybe thousands of listens , this was the best performance with the best sound we had ever heard .
That does n't mean we were n't introduced to shows with better musicianship later on , but within that capsule of time Cornell ' 77 stood on its own .
It has the " it " factor in spades , and deserves as many stars as the archive allows one to give .

I have poo-pood this show for so long , but something interesting happened to me the other day , I actually LISTENED to it .
What got me to do this was listening to Loser at the Springfield show of the same year .
If you have not heard that version of this song , go NOW ( yes go right now ) and do so .
Unbelievable .
What I realized was that this run of shows was simply amazing for so many reasons .
First of all , Donna sang backup vocals very well , and she and Jerry had great harmonizing going on .
Jerry 's singing was clean and consistent , his playing was sublime , maybe the best and most soulfull I have heard from any series of shows .
Bobby , too was consistent and very strong throughout .
So when you add this all together , you get an amazing run of East Coast shows that really should be considered as a whole , not this show in particular , IMHO .
That sound that sound , they had this stony haunting slow rolling thing going at the time that was just amazing .
Overall for this particular show , still can only give it a 4 , but it is not as overated as I once thought .

It is also true that everyone has different tastes and the Dead did a great job do different genres with their music .
This show is one of my favorites because the second set was my baptism of the Dead in 1988 .

Heard this one so many times that I 'm just going to review it and not even stream it again .
This Scartet / Fire is indeed the best one they ever did .
It is pure alchemy and magic .
It always just makes me smile when I hear it , it is just so groovy ( to borrow an outdated expression ) .
However , my deadhead brothers and sisters , when considering greatest all - time shows , one must be a bit of an historian .
Were talking about a legendary band here with deep roots stretching out a long way .
Just off the the top of my head , I streamed a 72 '
Paris show yesterday and honestly it was pretty F . . . ing good .
I think to actually consider greatest shows , one has to consider the entire performance and how it leaves you in the end .
This one is disqualified based on its first set which is basically unremarkable .
The second set , taken as a whole , is a doozy , no doubt about it .
However , ( Brace yourselves ) considering their entire performance career , I do n't think this even makes the top ten .
At any rate it is popular for good reason , the second set is real nice .
Peace .

Subject : Heads up Kazzzz Totally agree with the previous reviewer .
If you could have put the Dead 's sound from 1972 into their ability from 1977 , they would 've been even more incredible .
I do n't like the disco Dead particularly either , but if you listen to Jerry and Bob 's chops ( especially during Jack Straw and Brown Eyed Women ) you should be able to recognize that they actually put some effort into practice during this era .
This was n't about riding the energy here and just letting things happening , they were making the energy by executing .
You can here that Jerry was getting back to his roots and practicing scales a ton this year and the year prior .
Too bad Bob was starting to get that annoying twang to his guitar and losing the fuzz from the early days .
Also sad that Keith was near the end of his career and his life .

Subject : Jerry OK , here 's the thing about the ' 77 shows .
I am not huge on the disco dead - type thing .
Dancin in the Streets does n't really do it for me .
And you are hard pressed to find any of the great early 70's stuff like The Other One and Dark Star .
And that is a shame .
But the reason I LOVE the ' 77 shows is Jerry is simply on fire .
The band in general is more musical in ' 77 than .
I think , at any other time .
Just listen to Brown Eyed Women in this show vs , say , Dane County ' 73 .
Jerry is just too good for words in ' 77 .
Every time I listen to it , I just shake my head in amazement .
And the Scarlet - Fire might be the best ever .
Do n't know if it 's the best show ever -- too many great ' 77 shows to chose from -- but it is up there if you want , in my opinion , the pinnacle of Jerry 's playing .

a marantz i believe .
he only had the second set .
i'd heard a little bit of dead , seen thier video , thought they were interesting as a cultural phenomenon , but wasnt really grabbed by the music i'd heard .
after that it was on .
the dead hour was brand new then and i never missed a show , taping every episode .
back then it was hard to find tapes of this vintage with the sound quality this tape had .
i do n't think i ever had a tape even of the period that were this hot .
the dead hour yield this finest sb recordings .
i think it 's funny when people dog this show , i usually think they are just trying to get a rise out of our more sensitive fellow junkies .
i read some where on here that this show was " sloppy and full of miscues " i think jerry omitting the second verse of ' fire ' is as sloppy as it gets , and it 's not really a gaff or miscue , it just aint there .
oh well .
it 's a phil show as they say .
now i'm gonna say things i never read or hear about this show .
donna sounds pretty , ya i said it .
you know it 's true .
row jimmy is fucking amazing .
sheets of sonic love and sorrow .
2nd jack straw since 1974 and it is totally reborn in that 77 throttle of bass and reverb .
dancing in the streets sucks in 77 .
sorry , i'm not an envelope fan .
turn that shit down so i can hear the guitar .
do not put wharf rat in the middle of that fucking sonic equivilent of of a coked out disco orgy .
sorry .
but thats why we love them right ?
they can move us to tears dancing and piss us off in the span of just a couple of hours .
also i think its funny when people say " rare " when referencing kg's organ playing .
he only played the organ on every version of scarlet , china doll , black peter and many others from 74 on .
i think alot of times people can't tell the difference btween a rhodes and a piano .
also alot of times it 's nearly impossible to ditiguish bobby 's wierd jazz licks from kieth 's punches .
sometimes i'll listen to a whole show just trying to focus on one instrument , it 's hard to do .
it 's seems to me people react strongly to the idea of " best " anything .
it doesnt really make sense to have that kind of mentality in reference to ... well anything , but in this case were talking dead .
taste is subjective , set and setting are as crucial to how you enjoy a dead show as to how you enjoy or exp anything .
emotions get attached to places they dont really belong .
is this the best dead show ?
best soundboard ?
no , how could it be ?
back when i was 17 and the dead were brand new to me , my friend asked me which show was the best .
i told him i hope they havent played it yet .
that cant be true today bcause jerry is gone or at least it 's much harder for us to hear him play now , but i think a similar philosophy can be applied to these recording we are blessed to have access to .
the best show ever is the next one you hear .

There is so much said about this recording but I would like to focus on just one track that makes this one of my favoirite Dead shows ... Dancin ' in the Streets .
This is without a doubt the best Dancin ' they ever did .
I challange anyone to find me a better version .
The guitar solo is incredible and I can't believe the guy below me dosent like the Mutron III !
I 'll never forget the first time I heard this track on my Beyond Description boxed set as a bonus track on Terrapin .
I 'll admit , I was n't a big fan of their late 70's studio work in my early unexpirenced days as a Dead Head , but after hearing Dancin ' I sought out all their live material from ' 77 .
I have never heard a guitar solo come close to the musical genius on this song .
It sounds like a psychedelic flute soaring through the clouds .
If you close your eyes and listen to this in the right mood , it will take you afloat with it !
Jerry Garcia must have been totally dialed in to give us that solo .
Row Jimmy has this effect as well .
Everyone has different tastes and different styles they would prefer to hear the band play , but when it comes down to the performance and the skill required to play , this show is one of the best .
May 7th , 8th , and 9th are the crest of the Grateful Dead wave for me .
These shows were distinct and masterful , they display the band 's incredible penchant for intricate soloing and synchronized jaming .
The Dead met each other on a sonic plane and conversed with their instruments for these shows .
Thanks to Betty for preserving this moment in such great sound quality , and this great site for putting it up !

This is an opinion from a person who definitely does n't consider themself to be an expert on Dead performances .
Starting as far back as the early seventies , I 've seen some Dead shows and Garcia Band shows .
I recently read the NYT 's articule about the Dead where some Deadheads rated shows .
Then afterwards I took a long car ride and was able to listen to non -stop Dead music .
This is not an objective studently analysis --- the day that I did that trip was April 7th and the radio station played a show from April 7th 1972 in England .
I 'm not sure whether it was that , for a long time , I had n't listened to the Dead in that way or maybe it had something to do with being on the road , I 'm not sure what it was --- maybe a flashback .
Nevertheless , the point , I found the April 7th 1972 show to be better than this Barton Hall show , ( which is some sort of holy grail ) not that this is bad , but the April 7th 1972 show seemed to be more trippy / creative .
I could be totally wrong but was interested in knowing what others thought about that .

Subject : Still great to this day As ( over ? ) hyped as this show is , I still come back to it regularily , as it was the show that got me obsessed with the Dead 12 years ago .
Back in high school , almost everyone in the school was a Deadhead ( walking into my school was like walking into a sea of tie - dye ) , and I never really gave them much of a chance .
I was more of a Floyd guy .
The Dead were always playing in the background wherever I went , but it was mostly studio albums or 80's / 90 's live stuff .
Nothing against Mydland - era Dead , or the studio stuff , but it took me hearing this , after recieving it from a friend , to fully appreciate all aspects of the Dead .
Now I have too many shows to count , from 66 - 95 .
It all started here , hearing Loser , Row Jimmy , Scarlet > Fire , Morning Dew , etc .
Not the most jam - heavy show by a long shot , even for ' 77 , but the playing is so tight , and the sound so pristine thanks to Betty , that this is a perfect show to introduce a newbie to the Dead .
Out of all May ' 77 , I come back to this , 5/7 , and 5/21 the most .
I agree with the reviewer below me who said that after hearing this , especially if it 's early in your Deadhead career , you will always compare various live Dead songs to the versions found here .
When you listen to a live Minglewood , you will always compare it to this version , and so on .
Definitely NOT overrated .
Great work on the remaster Rob !
It really makes me appreciate this show even more .

Thank you Betty Cantor !
This is one of the finest recordings in the Archive !
Along with 2 - 26 - 77 , this recording is soooooo fine , with lots of rich , thick bass .
Phil is in the zone , so turn up the sub - woofer !
Sure there is a lot of hype surrounding this show , but I think it is warranted .
The performance is awesome , and not much else compares to the sound quality .
Also listen to 2 - 26 , and 5 - 5 thru 5 - 9 , 1977 , and judge for yourself !

There I am blessed to have attended this amazing show .
Obviously , at the time we had no idea of the historical significance of this performance in GD lore , but I do remember thinking this was the best Dead show I had ever witnessed ( first 3/73 at the Nassau Coliseum ) when we exited the show in the wee hours to a fresh blanket of snow from a freak spring storm .
That winter was the blizzard of ' 77 in Buffalo and caused me to transfer to Arizona State the following fall .
Amazingly , I had to miss the next night 's show in Buffalo as we were heading back to Long Island ( another incredible performance that I only got to enjoy on tape / CD ) .
1977 was simply magical .
I do not know if this was the " best ever " but it is definitely in my personal Top 3 attended shows .
I do know one thing though , the " Scarlet / Fire " may have been the most beautiful performances of a Dead tune I would ever witness .
After all these years and countless ( mostly West coast ) shows , I still believe that to be true .
Maybe we will get a Scarlet / Fire when The Dead come to LA in May with Warren blazing away while channeling Jerry .
We are all blessed that these mid-60 year old guys still have a passion for what can only be described as the most incredible catalog of music in contemporary history .
Let 's just say THANK YOU !
They ARE truly a " band beyond description . "

But this IS a KILLER show , with every song being well - played , and HIGH spirited .
We all know ' 77 was a great year , and it 's hard to find an off show .
But this one is as good as ANY and better than most ( with the exception of the 10 - 29 - 77 DeKalb show .
This I believe to be their best show that year ) .
And the Cornell versions of " Dancin ' in the streets " and " Saturday Night " are quite possibly the best the boys ever performed .

It 's very good , but ... ehh , it 's not the " best ever . "
I have to agree that this one is overrated .
It 's ' measured ' and ' even ' as one reviewer said and the playing sits comfortably , but it 's not that inspiring .
The sound quality is superb and the mix makes it a pleasure to listen to .
But let 's face it , the first set just drags .
They kick off with a promising energetic " Minglewood , " but then play several sleeper tunes in a row , with long silent gaps between every song .
This version of ' Jack Straw ' is especially lethargic and disappointing .
It 's like they took the entire first set to warm up .
There are some standouts , the second set is much better than the first and the grooves are nice and tight .
Overall it 's very good and worth a listen , but let 's not get carried away !
If this is the " best ever , " I 'd hate to hear what the bad stuff sounds like .

In reality , this is probably the most circulated TAPE back in the day that was BY FAR the best sounding TAPE we had heard .
Before Dick 's Picks , before this wonderful site , there was Barton Hall 5 - 8 - 77 .
We all had it and it was the best sounding TAPE in our collections .
It holds memories for us all .
For me , this tape was an annual passage into the rite of spring .
You know , that first day when the weather was finally nice enough to roll all the windows down in the car and go for a little cruise on that glorious first day of spring , this was the TAPE that You put in and cranked , just to make it that much more glorious .

Subject : Easy way to capture I do n't know why more people do n't suggest this , but you can stream any of these shows with winamp .
Winamp comes with a " disk writer " option .
If you do the following :
1. start a stream in winamp .
press CTRL -P
2. CTRL-P will display the output method being used .
the default is " directsound Output "
3. use your mouse to select the " Nullsoft Disk writer plugin "
4 . Once you select the disk writer , a rectangle button that reads " configure " appears at the bottom of the preferences menu .
5 . All this button does when you click it is ask where you want the output files to be written .
Choose or create a directoy .
It automatically writes each file to wave format .
6 . You 'll have to restart the stream once you switch the output , but it 's a hell of a lot easier than capturing the sound with a wave recorder and cutting the tracks up .
It also takes less time as the streams are no longer in real time when you 're using the " disk writer " option .
You can also write the files with DSP / sound enhancers ( like isotope ) enabled .
It 's the easiest way to grab this music .
Maybe a pain the 1st time you try , but it 's the best way to capture streams & I 've tried them all .

About 23 percent of the universe is made up of mysterious ' dark matter ' -- invisible material only detected through its gravitational influence on its surroundings .
Now two astronomers based at the National Autonomous University of Mexico ( UNAM ) have found a hint of the way it behaves near black holes .
Their results appear in a letter in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
In the early universe , clumps of dark matter are thought to have attracted gas , which then coalesced into stars that eventually assembled the galaxies we see today .
In their efforts to understand galaxy formation and evolution , astronomers have spent a good deal of time attempting to simulate the build up of dark matter in these objects .
The UNAM astronomers , Dr. Xavier Hernandez and Dr. William Lee , calculated the way in which the black holes found at the centre of galaxies absorb dark matter .
These black holes have anything between millions and billions of times the mass of the Sun and draw in material at a high rate .
The researchers modelled the way in which the dark matter is absorbed by black holes and found that the rate at which this happens is very sensitive to the amount of dark matter found in the black holes ' vicinity .
If this concentration were larger than a critical density of 7
Suns of matter spread over each cubic light year of space , the black hole mass would increase so rapidly , hence engulfing such large amounts of dark matter , that soon the entire galaxy would be altered beyond recognition .
Dr. Hernandez explains , " Over the billions of years since galaxies formed , such runaway absorption of dark matter in black holes would have altered the population of galaxies away from what we actually observe . "
Their work therefore suggests that the density of dark matter in the centres of galaxies tends to a constant value .
By comparing their observations to what current models of the evolution of the universe predict , Hernandez and Lee conclude that it is probably necessary to change some of the assumptions that underpin these models -- dark matter may not behave in the way scientists thought it did .
There is an attractive presentation about presenting knowledge from the various roles like practicians , software people , and scientists :
How to tell stuff to the computer .
It describes a triangle ( see below ) , whose corners are practical domain knowledge ( lower left corner ) , software artifacts ( top corner ) and science ( low right corner ) .
The picture proposes some technologies inside the triangle .
The most important things in the triangle are – in writer ’s opininion – the steps in the lines connecting corners .
In his / hers conclusion the writer forecasts that in future there is a revolution , caused by descriptive logics ( see http://www.lisperati.com/tellstuff/conclusion.html).
I warmly agree that conclusion , because logic has a very strong role in the framework of symbolic analysis .
Instead , it is difficult to see what is the beef in the desriptive logic here :
http://www.lisperati.com/tellstuff/dl.html, the text contains traditional monolitic Lisp .
However , the idea of the title : Marriage of Logic and Objects is a very good vision .
I have had the same goal in the architecture of AHO hybrid objects .
Furthermore , there is a solid contact surface between semantic web and symbolic analysis ( see more ) .
Symbolic and holistic approach for estimating knowlege produced by the software
The triangle ( above ) is useful as a base for illlustrating software development and its knowledghe representation , too .
In the lower triangle ( see below ) I have named the corners respectively : Domain knowlege , source of program and information system ( IS ) pragmatics caused by the software .
The last corner is not science as in the triangle about , but it simulates all purposes to understand the software and its value as an empiric product .
The last corner is then an attempt to get empiric and practical research information from the implemented software .
It is then a large approach .
It has two sides :
problem specific approach supported by reverse engineering and holistic approach in order to evaluate the whole
There some essential roles in the figure .
All essential information is thought to be stored into an imagined megamodel ( specification , resource information , sprints , tests etc ) .
The three lines are :
The left line describes software development , to code .
The line from top to the right lower corner is symbolic analysis containing the technology spaces : GrammarWare , ModelWare , SimulationWare and KnowledgeWare .
For practical purposes there is a problem reasonign technology ( PRT ) close to the right corner .
The bottom line is a problem , because there is no direct support for estimating how does a system satisfy all possible user needs , but there are some technologies to create end user services so that they can be mapped into code and remain visible in the system .
SOA , aspects , Zachman architecture and metrics are some means for that purpose .
Some links :
Tim Bray , co-inventor of XML and , until recently , Sun employee , has announced in a blog posting " Now A No - Evil Zone " , that he has taken up a position at Google as " Developer Advocate " and will be focussing on Android .
Bray says he had long considered Google as a " plausible match " as it is web - centric , works on search and is open - source friendly , but previous approaches had stalled as he did not want to move from Vancouver .
With the new position , he will be working remotely from Vancouver , promoting development on and around Google 's open source phone platform Android , but notes " There ’s nothing that says I ’m just doing Android , but it seems that there ’s enough Android work to keep a dozen of me busy " .
Bray sees Android as the opposite of Apple 's " sterile Disney - fied walled garden surrounded by sharp - toothed lawyers " , and refers to Dave Winer 's observation that Android is the first - ever platform without a vendor .
" It 's the only kind of platform I want to help build " says Bray , who wants to prove Apple 's approach wrong .
He adds " The tragedy is that Apple builds some great open platforms ; I ’ve been a happy buyer of their computing systems for some years now and , despite my current irritation , will probably go on using them . "

Predictably , I reject all of that .
Yes , there are new details to the spending freeze .
But no , that does not change our initial assessment of it as Hooverism .
Just because a policy is n't as bad as it could be does n't make it inherently good or worth supporting .
Sure , the economic crisis could have been worse .
But just because unemployment nationwide has n't yet hit 15 % does n't mean that 10 % is good .
The Obama spending freeze fails on both policy and political merits , and I 'll briefly take both in turn .
Policy
We are told that the freeze will kick in after the 2010 budget year , so there will be another increase now , and then a freeze .
The freeze will not be applied across the board , but it will be applied .
Some programs will be exempted , but many others will not - including elements of education and health care services .
Yes , the White House has said that their initiatives on education and health care will still proceed , but unless the White House is going to exempt the entire Departments of Education and Health and Human Services from this directive , there WILL indeed be cuts made in those areas .
Marcy Winograd , a teacher and progressive candidate for CA - 36 , pointed out that feds fund things like ESL , field trips , and such .
By the terms of this freeze , such discretionary spending is subject to cuts if the White House wants to find money for some other initiative .
The economics of this are also quite damaging .
Government spending really means jobs .
Every program that the feds fund employs people .
Most spending goes towards salaries .
So when we are told that some departments will face a freeze , that means new hiring will be frozen as well .
Sure , there might still be a jobs program , but it will be limited in its effectiveness by this freeze .
Further , we are told that the freeze will NOT be adjusted for inflation .
As costs rise , federal spending necessarily must rise with it .
But if that wo n't happen thanks to this freeze , a budget dollar in 2010 will not go as far in 2013 .
Program budgets wo n't be able to keep up , and something will have to give - either salaries or program services to the public .
Either outcome is deflationary and recessionary .
It also likely means greater costs in the future , both to government and the private sector , as important things get left undone or postponed .
You probably already know this country faces a massive infrastructure backlog .
Our roads are falling apart , our national parks need maintenance .
But as The Transport Politic points out , those backlogs are likely to continue under this spending freeze , meaning that whenever we do get around to fixing those things , it 'll cost more money in the future - and will hurt investment and economic growth in the interim .
In other words , the overall amount of federal spending , including discretionary spending , needs to be higher to produce economic recovery , reinvest in our infrastructure , and ensure that individual and family needs are met .
We need more , not less , and not a freeze , even a limited freeze .
Again , the freeze could be worse .
But it is still a bad idea .
Politics
The politics of this are even worse .
By far the worst aspect of it is that it embraces the right - wing tea party argument that government spending is out of control , unsustainable , and must be reined in .
It suggests the White House views that as a winning political argument , which is quite concerning as it indicates they are unlikely to further embrace progressive economic policy in any meaningful way .
And if it 's a " limited freeze " then Obama will please exactly nobody .
The progressive base rejects it on both policy and framing grounds .
Republicans will reject it because they 'll point to other spending increases he has done .
And the independents , who Obama thinks this will sway , will likely agree with the Republicans , since the freeze is incomplete and therefore will not address their concerns .
At worst they might see it as a sign Obama is n't being straight with them .
Many of us were elated at Obama 's victory in 2008 because we hoped and expected it would produce progressive change and beat back right - wing arguments and framing .
We never expected that Obama would , once in office , embrace John McCain 's proposals , certainly not the spending freeze .
But here we are .
For those of us who see our primary organizing task as being permanent defeat of the right - wing and its ideas , this is a big blow , and helps explain why so many of us have reacted as strongly as we did .
The precedent this sets is also troubling .
Many of us have been arguing that we desperately need MORE spending , not less .
Spending to help states in crisis .
Spending to help improve existing programs that have been defunded and underfunded and screwed over since Reagan took office .
That will become much more difficult when Obama has set a precedent that spending is something to be limited , not embraced .
Instead of fighting the battle to expand our government 's role in helping grow the economy , we have to fight rear - guard actions against our own president 's embrace of neoliberal policy .
Finally , I 've become very troubled to see people defending the president turning to conservative framing to do so .
For example , those who claim government spending is " full of waste . "
We hear that all the time from right - wingers here in California who want to stop new spending programs and new taxes on the wealthy to save our schools .
But what we 've seen in the studies , even those studies conducted by Arnold Schwarzenegger , is that " waste " does n't really exist in any meaningful level .
What will happen with this spending freeze instead is that people will lose their jobs , see their wages cut , or find the programs they rely on become less effective or go away completely .
All of those are right - wing outcomes .
Not anything any progressive can or should support .
Conclusion
It 's unfortunate , but there it is .
Yes , the details matter , but progressives can and must fight this .
Congress may block it , but only if we organize to ensure that happens , and even then we 'll have to battle our own president .
I know some people want to turn this into the usual pie fight over whether we back Obama enough or not .
But for me that 's not what this is about .
I fight for progressive policy no matter who is in office .
When they choose to embrace non-progressive policy , we must organize to stop it .
For some reason or another , all of us like to believe that Earth is special - after all , our planet is the only one able to sustain life that we know of .
Indeed , Earth is special in its own way , but life would not have been possible without the significant contribution of material coming form space .
In fact , a new study shows that the compounds making up DNA and RNA actually originated in space , not on Earth as previously thought , and were brought here by meteorite fragments and other similar objects .
" We believe early life may have adopted nucleobases from meteoritic fragments for use in genetic coding which enabled them to pass on their successful features to subsequent generations , " said the leader of the study , Zita Martins of the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London .
In 1969 , a meteorite fragment , known today as the Murchison meteorite , crashed in the Australian outback .
A thorough analysis , following its discovery , showed that it contained uracil and xanthine molecules ( nucleobases ) , which are building blocks for genetic materials made up of a heavy carbon isotope .
On Earth , such molecules contain only light carbon isotopes .
However , these two molecules are just a few of many others found in the respective fragment .
" There are about 70 different amino acids in the Murchison meteorite .
About six or so are the same kinds of amino acids associated with life on Earth , " said David Deamer from the University of California .
The uracil molecule is one of the four bases for the RNA molecule , therefore it is invaluable to life .
Deamer points out that , although these molecules have been proven to originate in space , they could have been developed on Earth just as well .
Nevertheless , the proportion of molecules originating only in space or only on Earth is currently unknown .
" We do n't know the answer yet .
Most people would say that both contributed to the organic compounds available on Earth , but we do n't know with certainty how much of one compared to the other , " said Deamer .
Between 3.8 and 4.5 billion years ago , when primitive life first appeared , the Earth and Mars could have been literally bombarded with meteorites similar to the Murchison , thus studying the impact they would have had on different planets could reveal how life evolved in the solar system .
" Because meteorites represent leftover materials from the formation of the solar system , the key components for life - including nucleobases - could be widespread in the cosmos .
As more and more of life 's raw materials are discovered in objects from space , the possibility of life springing forth wherever the right chemistry is present becomes more likely , " said Mark Sephton , professor of Earth science and engineering at Imperial College London and co-author of the study .
According to South Korea 's Yonhap News Agency , a 1,500 - ton naval vessel with a crew of 104 sank off of the island of Baengnyeong in the Yellow Sea ....
SITTING DUCK :
The video clip on YouTube shows this kereru being shot .
Video footage has emerged of a tourist shooting a kereru - a protected native species - and holding two dead , bloody birds in his hands .
The video , which features tourists who are believed to be Norwegian , shows the native wood pigeon being shot and falling from a tree .
Kereru are an absolutely protected species under the Wildlife Act and shooting one carries a fine of $ 100,000 or a year in prison .
Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson said she was " absolutely outraged " by the footage , which she found " despicable " .
The Conservation Department was investigating .
The video , posted on YouTube three days ago , also shows tourists shooting a paradise shell duck .
Watch the video here .
Warning : contains content that may disturb .
Paradise shell ducks are a game bird which can only be hunted during the hunting season , which starts in May , and with a licence .
Hunting game birds without a licence and outside the hunting season carries a $ 5000 fine .
The kereru's numbers are in decline due to habitat loss , predation , competition and illegal hunting .
Native trees depend on kereru to spread seeds , and the bird 's decline would mean the decline of native forests .

The murmuring in parliament is that the digital economy bill will get its second reading on Tuesday 6 April – the day that Gordon Brown is expected to hop into a car and head over to the palace to ask for the dissolution of parliament .
The timing is precise : by getting its second reading in the Commons , the bill becomes eligible to go into the " wash - up " – the dirty process by which bills that have run out of proper parliamentary time are hurried through to royal assent via a series of backroom deals .
But what shape is the digital economy bill in now , compared to what we were offered by the Digital Britain report ( DBR ) last June , and the first reading of the digital economy bill ( DEB ) in the House of Lords last December ?
Let 's examine what we were promised , and what we seem to have .
This is not easy : the bill tends to add bits to other existing acts , such as the Communications Act of 2003 and the Copyright , Designs and Patents Act of 1988 .
You can see an explanation of its contents at the Department of Business , Innovation and Skills 's DEB page .
Ofcom
Extension of role to include reporting on communications infrastructure and media content , and power to determine who gets access to which airwaves .
The Conservatives are n't keen on Ofcom , whose powers they want to curtail .
So far mostly untouched by amendments .
Status : Extension may survive wash - up , but probably not a Tory administration .
Minimum broadband speed of 2Mbps
Does n't actually require legislation .
( Neither " broadband " nor " megabit " appears in the bill . )
This becomes a new Ofcom responsibility , watched over by the secretary of state for business .
£ 6 annual levy on fixed phone lines
Shifted in the Queen 's speech to the finance bill , because it requires new tax measures .
Status :
Will find out in the budget on Wednesday .
Regional funding for local news consortiums , funded from licence fee
Digital Britain said that £ 130 m annually now spent helping people shift to digital TV could fund ITV regional news programmes .
Ofcom would appoint " providers of regional or local news " .
The Conservatives oppose it ; it would probably get deleted in the horse - trading of the wash - up .
Status : Dead .
Analogue radio switchoff by 2015 ; re-organisation and merger of some local DAB ensembles
Still in the bill , but now at the discretion of the secretary of state .
A new clause ( 97A ) would be added to the Broadcasting Act 1990 .
Status : Alive .
Tax breaks for video games industry
Suggested in the DBR , not in the DEB , possibly in the budget next week .
Status : Missing in action .
Video games age classifications
The DBR said that rules should make it illegal to sell a video game rated 12 or over to an underage buyer , and take away games classification from the British Board of Film Classification , and give it to the Video Standards Council .
That part of the DEB has sailed through virtually untouched .
Status : Alive .
Internet domain names
UK government could intervene directly in the use and registration of .uk internet sites , currently the responsibility of the independent Nominet , to prevent sites being registered for " illicit use " .
After commissioning a report from Ofcom , the secretary of state could take away registration powers and give it to a different organisation .
Status : Alive .
Channel 4
Specifically told to support " people with creative talent " , particularly through film , and to produce " high - quality digital content " .
Failure to do so could lead to sanctions from Ofcom , including a fine .
Status : Alive .
Electromagnetic spectrum
More Ofcom powers – this time to let it enforce licences and impose fines on operators who misuse or abandon spectrum , and set new pricing systems on previously auctioned spectrum .
Status : Unclear if a Tory government would let this continue ; but alive .
Adding PLR ( Public Lending Right ) to e-books and spoken books
Every time a library lends an audio book or e-book the copyright holder gets a small payment .
Sailing through : the text is essentially untouched from its introductory form .
Status : Alive .
Reducing online piracy and copyright theft
By far the most contentious part of the bill and the source of huge popular opposition .
The DEB adds a clause to the Communications Act 2003 that says that ISPs must provide " copyright owners " ( defined murkily in the Copyright , Designs and Patents Act 's section 173 with details ( though not identities ) of copyright infringers .
Quite possibly , anyone could claim to be a copyright owner .
As altered , the bill now allows for ISPs to be required to block access to sites that allow " substantial " infringement .
One of Lord Mandelson 's principal targets here – urged on by the BPI and Federation Against Copyright Theft and Federation Against Software
Theft – is " cyberlocker " sites that let people store files , or move them between two people easily , which , lobbyists argue , allows widespread copyright infringement .
The argument then becomes how you tell whether a cyberlocker is being used for substantial infringement .
But as they do n't publicise their contents ( they are like safe deposit boxes for the web ) , how can it be determined whether they are substantially infringing ?
One site that would immediately be trapped by this provision is Wikileaks – which exists solely to republish leaked , and hence copyrighted , work .
Would a Trafigura - like company in the future use the DEB to shut off UK access to the site if something embarrassing appeared there ?
The bill allows for the " temporary suspension " of internet connections for those deemed to have allowed multiple copyright infringement after warnings from their ISPs ( who are required to maintain " copyright infringement reports " on users , anonymously ) .
Hotels and businesses that offer free or paid - for Wi-Fi have expressed serious concerns that they would have to shut such services down .
The record industry is happy with the proposals , but many citizens are n't : in two days more than 10,000 people had contacted their MP via the 38 Degrees site to express concern and demand proper debate of the proposals .
A " proper " debate would take so long it would kill the bill – although Harriet Harman , the leader of the Commons , did suggest in a tweet that it will get " debate " .
The Tories , however , seem to be in favour .
Status : Alive , and likely to survive wash - up .
Orphan works ; extension / licensing of copyright / performers ' rights
" Orphan works " are copyrighted works whose owner is unknown ; this would create a means to license them .
The extension of copyright / performers ' rights proved controversial in the Lords .
Status : Orphan works may survive the wash - up ; copyright extension is less clear .
So will it pass ?
The campaign against the anti-piracy provisions may rouse MPs to try to get the bill examined properly in the Commons on its second reading .
But with an election looming , and many MPs preparing to leave the House for the last time , some may feel it's not worth fighting over – especially as a potential Tory administration may rip it up anyway .
It 's going to be a very close - run thing .
OTTAWA — Even before she opened her mouth for the first of three speeches this week on Canadian soil , American right - wing antagonist Ann Coulter had already scored a victory of sorts .
Coulter , who was to speak at the University of Western Ontario on Monday night , received a pre-emptive and private caution about the limits of free speech in Canada from the provost of the University of Ottawa , where she appears Tuesday .
The letter was immediately leaked to select conservative news organizations , with Coulter telling one that the university was “ threatening to criminally prosecute me for my speech . ”
For a strident provocateur who ’s speaking on “ Political Correctness , Media Bias and Freedom of Speech , ” the University of Ottawa warning — however tepid — was pure oxygen for the fire .
“ We , of course , are always delighted to welcome speakers on our campus and hope that they will contribute positively to the meaningful exchange of ideas that is the hallmark of a great university campus , ” wrote Francois Houle , vice - president academic and University of Ottawa ’s provost .
After mentioning the Charter of Rights and Canada ’s free speech laws , Houle invited Coulter to “ educate yourself , if need be , as to what is acceptable in Canada ” and noted , by example , that “ promoting hatred against any identifiable group would not only be considered inappropriate , but could in fact lead to criminal charges . ”
Coulter is famous for saying “ not all Muslims may be terrorists , but all terrorists are Muslims . ”
She also famously ranted that “ the government should be spying on all Arabs , engaging in torture as a televised spectator sport , dropping daisy cutters wantonly throughout the Middle East , and sending liberals to Guantanamo . ”
Houle ’s letter was leaked to the National Post in Canada and to newsmax.com — the self - described “ leading independent online news site with a conservative perspective ” — in the United States .
Coulter ’s representatives did not respond to an interview request Monday from The Canadian Press , but she told newsmax.com in an email that : “ The provost of the u. of Ottawa is threatening to criminally prosecute me for my speech there on Monday — before I ’ve even set foot in the country ! ”
Coulter , a regular commentator on Fox News , is not known for getting hung up on the details .
She ’s perhaps best known in Canada for saying this country is “ lucky we allow them to exist on the same continent ” after the Canadian government refused to join the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
Her tour is being organized by the International Free Press Society , a group whose website presents Islam as the pre-eminent threat to democracy and free speech across the western world .
“ This jihad , like all jihads before it , will continue until a sharia - based caliphate rules the world , or until it is defeated , ” says the society ’s policy statement .
Among its board of advisers are conservative bloggers Ezra Levant and Kathy Shaidle , polemicist Mark Steyn and far - right Dutch political leader Geert Wilders .
Coulter ’s reported $ 10,000 - per- speech fee , meanwhile , is being covered with the assistance of the Claire Boothe Luce Policy Institute , an American outfit that calls itself the “ home of conservative women leaders . ”
It lists Margaret Thatcher and Sarah Palin among those who “ have inspired millions and impacted the world for the better . ”
Even critics of Coulter say that attempting to muzzle her only gives her a louder bark .
“ In terms of putting limits on what she ... should say or should n’t say , I ’m not sure that helps , ” said New Democrat MP Paul Dewar , whose riding includes the University of Ottawa campus .
“ It might add fuel to the fire that she will be probably starting tomorrow . ”
Liberal MP Scott Brison told Coulter ’s political opponents to “ vote with your feet . ”
“ If you do n’t agree with what she has to say , then ignore her . ”
Coulter wraps up her Canadian tour at the University of Calgary on Thursday .
Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) addresses the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington on Friday .
Bachmann : Obama ' intending to fail '
Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) urged conservatives Friday to fight to prevent an American “ decline ” created by the policies of President Barack Obama .
In a long and meandering speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference evoking numerous historical references to the American Revolution and the Second World War , Bachmann said that time and again Americans have chosen “ greatness ” over “ decline . ”

Conservatives , Bachmann argued , are the only ones positioned now to choose greatness .
“ The joy of being an American is that we get to choose .
We get to choose our destiny , whether it is decline or greatness , ” she said .
Recalling an early trip Obama made abroad in which the president asserted that while he does believe in American exceptionalism he ’s also sure other countries believe in their own superiority , Bachmann blasted him for not unequivocally establishing American dominance .
“ If everyone is exceptional , then no one is exceptional , ” she said .
“ Decline can happen quickly , even to a great nation .
It ’s a sobering thought . ”
Moving to her criticism of the president ’s spending , Bachmann pointed to a chart of rising federal deficits .
“ This is intending to fail , ” she said .
“ They have left us holding an invoice of $ 105 trillion in unfunded federal liabilities , ” she went on , alluding to the federal government ’s entitlement programs .
“ Sounds to me like someone is choosing decline . ”
Some of Bachmann ’s other criticisms were more extreme , such as her assertion that the Obama “ thought police ” did n’t want Americans to come to the same realizations those in the audience have about the administration .
Art-loving Australians have thrown a spanner in the works as US president Barack Obama and his entourage prepare to fly into Canberra next week .
The White House has announced that Mr Obama will arrive next Thursday for a 24 - hour visit before returning to the US to try to push his controversial domestic healthcare reforms onto the statute books .
The Federal Government hopes Parliament will sit for special sessions on Thursday and Friday , when Mr Obama will address Parliament before leaving the country .
But the popularity of the Masterpieces From Paris exhibition at the National Gallery means accommodation is booked out across the capital .
There is already little room for the thousands of staffers and politicians who flood into Canberra on sitting weeks .
Leader of the House Anthony Albanese says he is working on the logistics and will make an announcement soon .
Masterpieces From Paris is the largest and most valuable collection of art ever exhibited in Australia and features 112 paintings by artists including Vincent van Gogh , Paul Gauguin , Paul Cezanne and Claude Monet .
More than 300,000 people have already visited the exhibition , which was only expected to have 250,000 visitors in total .
Visitors , 80 per cent of whom have travelled from interstate , have queued for up to three hours to view the exhibition , which will be on show until April 18 .
The priceless works are on loan from the Musee d'Orsay in Paris and it is the first time they have been brought together in an exhibition outside of France .
Seven van Goghs , nine Gauguins , eight Cezannes and five Monets are among the works showcasing the explosive arrival of modern art in Europe .
A U.S. judge is ordering Isohunt , one of the world 's leading BitTorrent search engines , to remove all infringing content .
Isohunt 's operator said Tuesday that the decision would likely shutter the site , which has 30 million unique monthly visitors .
The injunction targeting Isohunt follows similar rulings against competing pirate sites like Mininova and The Pirate Bay , although the Bay has thus far eluded compliance .
A federal court sided last year with the MPAA , ruling that Isohunt was an unlawful avenue to free movies , music , videogames and software – the first U.S. ruling on the legality of a BitTorrent site .
Hollywood 's legal tactics shuttered TorrentSpy in the United States in 2008 , but the merits of the case were never decided .
Gary Fung , the 27 - year - old Canadian who runs Isohunt , said he and the MPAA are now haggling over how to comport with March 23 injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles .
" It is axiomatic that the availability of free infringing copies of plaintiffs ' works through defendants ' websites irreparably undermines the growing legitimate market ( .pdf ) for consumers to purchase access to the same works , " Wilson wrote in support of his injunction .
The judge added that " upwards of 95 percent of all dot - torrent files downloaded from defendants ' websites " return infringing material or works " at least highly likely to be infringing . "
Wilson ordered Fung to comply within his order within 14 days of the MPAA providing Fung a list of content to be removed .
And therein lies the dispute .
The judge , while giving the parties until April 12 to hammer out an agreement , is demanding that Isohunt cease " creating , maintaining or providing access to browsable website categories of dot - torrent or similar files using or based on infringement - related terms . "
That 's jargon for keyword searching .
" Filtering against keywords .
It amounts to nothing less than taking down our search engine , " Fung said in a telephone interview .
Fung 's position is that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act requires Hollywood to provide links to files to be removed .
Keyword searches , he said , could scoop up non-infringing works .
" We 're discussing the mechanics , the process that is reasonable for an injunction , " Fung said .
" We 're still trying to hope that the judge will do the right thing . "
The MPAA was not immediately prepared to comment .
The sites included in the judge 's ruling include ISO Hunt , Torrentbox and Podtropolis .

Former Rep. J.D. Hayworth ( R - Ariz . ) said Sunday that the expansion of state laws allowing gay marriage could lead to people marrying horses .
Hayworth , during an interview with an Orlando , Fla. , radio station explained : " You see , the Massachusetts Supreme Court , when it started this move toward same - sex marriage , actually defined marriage - now get this - it defined marriage as simply , ' the establishment of intimacy . ' "
Hayworth 's spokesman quits
" Now how dangerous is that ? " asked Hayworth , who is challenging Sen.
John McCain from the right in Arizona 's GOP Senate primary .
" I mean , I do n't mean to be absurd about it , but I guess I can make the point of absurdity with an absurd point , " he continued .
" I guess that would mean if you really had affection for your horse , I guess you could marry your horse . "
The former Republican congressman then insisted that the " only way " to prevent men from marrying horses is to create a federal marriage amendment .
Hayworth noted that he supports such an amendment .
In fact , the 2003 Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling striking down a ban on gay marriage defined marriage as " the voluntary union of two persons as spouses , to the exclusion of all others . "
The Arizona Republic is a member of the Politico Network .
Solar cells are cute and all , but let 's be real -- these things are far too inefficient for mainstream use .
Scientists at the California Institute of Technology are working hard to remedy that very issue , and they 've recently concocted a " new type of flexible solar cell that enhances the absorption of sunlight and efficiently converts its photons into electrons . "
The solution relies on arrays of long , thin silicon wires embedded onto a polymer substrate , which uses just a fraction of the expensive semiconductor materials required by conventional solar cells .
According to professor Harry Atwater , these cells have " surpassed the conventional light - trapping limit for absorbing materials " for the first time , and we 're told that the arrays can convert between 90 and 100 percent of the photons they absorb into electrons , and yes , that does mean that they have a near - perfect internal quantum efficiency .

I. There Will Be Blood ( and Oil )
What is it about oil men and the oil industry ?
Maybe they still believe in the old dream .
embodied in the 1960s television show The Beverly Hillbillies that any hard working ( white ) man could drill a well --- and become a millionaire overnight .
J.D. Rockefeller , 19th century founder of Standard Oil was the standard bearer of that dream .
David Rockefeller is the current scion who keeps that dream alive .
And the Bush Family , which also has its hands in oil , has been his political champion in the arena for several decades .
Rockefeller helped facilitate the Oil for Hostages deal that swept Reagan - Bush into power .
John Hinckley Jr. who tried to assassinate Reagan , was the son of an oil man , owner of Vanderbilt Oil .
http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/...
But Big Oil is bigger --- and older --- than the Bush Clan .
The whole 20 year Viet Nam " war " from 1955 to 1975 was an oil scam .
http://www.brojon.org/...
You like scary stories ?
Then read this one , about how Laurence Rockefeller , aid to Gen.
MacArthur , sold weapons to Ho Chi Minh in order to help drive the French out of Southeast Asia , so that Standard Oil could get the rights to all that South China Sea oil .
That ’s right .
The war that killed tens of thousands of our young men and women --- and millions of Vietnamese --- was fought over some oil that already rich Americans wanted so that they could get even richer ---
You know , the recent film There Will Be Blood with Daniel Day Lewis , may have been onto something .
Maybe oil men really are rat bastards .
If Big Oil was just about who will profit from the earth ’s need for energy , it would be bad enough .
But the entire fossil fuel industry has two other strikes against it .
First , their products are slowly destroying the earth .
Everyone acknowledges this now --- except for a handful of oil industry lackeys .
The 2000 election results were predetermined the moment the Democrats nominated Al " Global Warming " Gore .
There was no way that Big Oil would allow a conservationist into the White House .
All the election fraud that went down in Florida and then later at the Supreme Court had just one purpose --- to give Exxon and the others eight more years to squirrel away the cash .
Which brings me to the other problem with fossil fuels .
Oil will run out pretty soon .
And as the wells dry up , so will the source of all that blood stained money that has been used to buy presidents , fund wars and in general turn a handful of men around the world into demi-gods .
Lest you think that oil only entered politics after WWII , here is a document from 1922 about the Oil Wars that followed the Great War , written by Sylvia Pankhurst .
The great Capitalists and Generals understand this : the world contest presents itself clearly to their minds .
They prepare systematically and without compunction for the strife , arranging the wars in which the lives of millions will be sacrificed with the same coolness as Cabinet Ministers manipulate a general election or their wives organise bazaars .
They believe the strife inevitable , and by this fatalism , divesting themselves of all sense of responsibility , they merely take what care they can to be on the winning side .
http://www.marxists.org/...
There will be blood , indeed .
I can not list all the atrocities that the U.S. has perpetrated against other countries in the name of oil profits for people who already had more oil than they would ever spend .
If I were a more religious person , I would speculate that the devil put oil underground in order to tempt men to sin and to accelerate the coming of the End of Days .

Big Oil , Enemy of Democracy
If you read my stuff before , you know that back in July , 2009 I wrote about how Kochs Industries , the largest privately owned company in the United States , has links to both the so called Brooks Brothers Riot in Florida , 2000 ( when a bunch of Republican political operatives violated federal law and crossed state lines in order to stop the lawful counting of votes ) and to the Tea Parties .
http://journals.democraticundergroun...
Big Oil wants the public to think that these anti-democratic protests are spontaneous , the very essence of the democratic process .
However , they are more akin to the fascist rallies held in Germany before WWII .
Speaking of fascists ----
The Standard Oil group of companies , in which the Rockefeller family owned a one - quarter ( and controlling ) interest , 1 was of critical assistance in helping Nazi Germany prepare for World War II .
This assistance in military preparation came about because Germany 's relatively insignificant supplies of crude petroleum were quite insufficient for modern mechanized warfare ; in 1934 for instance about 85 percent of German finished petroleum products were imported .
The solution adopted by Nazi Germany was to manufacture synthetic gasoline from its plentiful domestic coal supplies .
It was the hydrogenation process of producing synthetic gasoline and iso - octane properties in gasoline that enabled Germany to go to war in 1940 — and this hydrogenation process was developed and financed by the Standard Oil laboratories in the United States in partnership with I.G. Farben .

Yep , yep .
The biggest , nastiest war the world was ever seen was brought to you by the good folks at Standard Oil .
But wait !
There is more .
Remember the plot to oust FDR from office and replace him with our very own version of Il Duce ?
If you do , congratulations !
They did not teach you about it at school .
You must have read it on your own .
America would be a better place if more people read about its history .
Anyway , guess which company was part of the American Liberty League , which engineered the failed coup ?
You guessed it .
Standard Oil .
http://coat.ncf.ca/...
Is there nothing these guys will not do in their mad frenzy to acquire more money ?
Apparently not .
That is why I warned , yesterday , that election 2012 will be a proxy war , between the Oil Industry ’s handpicked candidate and President Obama .
And given the way that Big Oil has behaved during previous elections , we should not expect them to play fair .
They had a taste of what it was like to wield absolute power under the two oil industry Texans ( Bush and Cheney ) for eight years .
Iraq was invaded , so that the progeny of Standard Oil --- Exxon , Chevron and the rest --- could feed off someone else ’s crude .
Oil price gouging was not just tolerated by the Bush administration , it was facilitated — even if it meant profit losses for the manufacturing sector , travel , the retail industry .
Back in early 2001 I predicted that Bush ’s selection would end up pitting Big Oil against Just About Everyone Else .
And last year , we saw what happens when Just About Everyone Else gets pissed off at Big Oil .
The nation ’s many other industries did something very unusual .
They united behind a Democratic candidate .
However , Big Oil has learned its lesson , and it is forming strategic alliances , again , with some of the same folks Bush - Cheney snubbed after Selections 2000 and 2004 .
It now has the health insurance industry in its pocket .
It is wooing the Banksters .
Everyone who wants Obama to start throwing bank executives in jail needs to remember that Bush Jr. arranged to give the industry a $ 700 billion slush fund -- at a time when Congress was almost certain to go along with it , i.e. right before the 2008 elections .
Now , Bush ’s Supreme Court has made it easier for the Banksters to use that slush fund in the next election .
So , you could say that it is n’t that Obama does not want to reform the banking industry .
He dare not reform it , in the same way that a man can not point a loaded gun at his own head and pull the trigger .
Them are the facts of life in Corporate Fascist America --- and you do not like it , then start doing something to reform our elections process , do n’t heap all the blame a few of the politicians that our system of democracy ( ha ! ) has helped elect .
If the oil industry can line up enough other industries --- and especially if they can snag the all important Corporate Media with promises of regulation roll backs the way that Rove did in 2000 --- they will become a force to be reckoned with .
Actually , they already are a force to be reckoned with .
They just do n’t have a viable candidate .
Ms. Oil Industry Gets What Oil Industry Wants Palin can not win .
America still thinks that women in power are 1 ) incompetent , 2 ) unnatural and 3 ) bitches --- as they showed in the 2008 primaries .
They would run Gov. Rick Perry of Texas if they thought they could get away with it — but he is so closely tied to the Bush Family his name might as well be " Jeb " .
Though I do not know who the Republicans will field in 2012 , I can tell you one thing with 100 % confidence .
Big
Oil will choose the candidate and he / she will be ready , on day one , to 1 ) roll back measures the Obama administration has taken to prevent oil price gouging 2 ) to sign away all the nation ’s beaches to oil companies 3 ) to cut funding for alternative energy programs 4 ) to hire a bunch of governments scientists to declare that Global Warming is bunk 5 ) to give Israel the green light to attack Iran , so that some more foreign oil can be " liberated " and last but most important 6 ) to worsen the Depression which Bush Jr. started .
For , as a man who might as well have been an Oil Man ( if he had not decided to follow in the path of the Rothschild Family and become a bankster and war profiteer instead ) said
Capital must protect itself in every way ... Debts must be collected and loans and mortgages foreclosed as soon as possible .
When through a process of law the common people have lost their homes , they will be more tractable and more easily governed by the strong arm of the law applied by the central power of leading financiers .
People without homes will not quarrel with their leaders .
This is well known among our principle men now engaged in forming an imperialism of capitalism to govern the world .
By dividing the people we can get them to expend their energies in fighting over questions of no importance to us except as teachers of the common herd .
- J.P. Morgan
Divide and conquer the working class .
Take away their homes ( something JP Morgan Chase knows all about ) .
Drive them into poverty .
Distract them with political theater .
That is the formula of the modern corporate fascist in America .
We are going to see a whole lot more of it in the months to come .
And no one does it better than Big Oil .
Hmm .
One phrase in that quote just caught my eye .
Imperialism of capitalism .
He did not mince words did he ?
The next time someone tells you that we are at war in Oceana in order to liberate its citizens , snap back " But J.P. Morgan said it was part of an effort by ‘ the imperialism of capitalism to govern the world . ’ "
Oh , the horror .

In what is bound to become a much debated and highly controversial experiment , a team of US scientists have wired a computer to a cat 's brain and created videos of what the animal was seeing .
According to a paper published in the Journal of Neuroscience , Garrett Stanley , Yang Dang and Fei Li , from the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology , University of California , Berkeley , have been able to " reconstruct natural scenes with recognizable moving objects " .
The researchers attached electrodes to 177 cells in the so - called thalamus region of the cat 's brain and monitored their activity .
The thalamus is connected directly to the cat 's eyes via the optic nerve .
Each of its cells is programmed to respond to certain features in the cat 's field of view .
Some cells " fire " when they record an edge in the cat 's vision , others when they see lines at certain angles , etc .
This way the cat 's brain acquires the information it needs to reconstruct an image .
Recognisable objects
The scientists recorded the patterns of firing from the cells in a computer .
They then used a technique they describe as a " linear decoding technique " to reconstruct an image .
Scientists saw recognisable objects
Other scientists have hailed this as an important step in our understanding of how signals are represented and processed in the brain .
It is research that has enormous implications .
Artificial brain extensions
It could prove a breakthrough in the hoped - for ability to wire artificial limbs directly into the brain .
More amazingly , it could lead to artificial brain extensions .
By understanding how information can be presented to the brain , some day , scientists may be able to build devices that interface directly with the brain , providing access to extra data storage or processing power or the ability to control devices just by thinking about them .
One of the scientists behind this current breakthrough , Garrett Stanley , now working at Harvard University , has already predicted machines with brain interfaces .
Such revolutionary devices should not be expected in the very near future .
They will require decoding information from elsewhere in the brain looking at signals that are far more complicated than those decoded from the cat 's thalamus but , in a way , the principle has been demonstrated .

This January a 511 - pound monster of a bluefin tuna sold at Tokyo ’s Tsukiji fish market for $ 175,000 — by far the highest price paid for a fish in nine years .
By that afternoon , customers at Kyubey , a Michelin - starred restaurant a stone ’s throw from the market , were dining on the tuna ’s fatty belly , or toro , the most opulent and rich cut from the most valuable fish in the world .
Japanese diners could soon face much higher bills for bluefin .
This month a meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) in Doha , Qatar , is slated to consider a proposal to ban all commercial trade of the Northern bluefin , Thunnus thynnus , grouping it with megafauna superstars such as the white rhino and the Asian elephant .
Japan imports about 80 percent of the total bluefin catch in the Atlantic and Mediter­ranean , even as those stocks have plummeted to such paltry levels that many scientists speculate that the fish could be headed for extinction .
Never before has such a commercially important animal been subject to an international trade ban , and proponents have braced for furious opposition .
To qualify for a complete trade ban , CITES requires that the population of a species must have declined to less than about 20 percent of its historic population size or have suffered from an extremely high recent rate of decline .
And although it is no simple task to measure the total size of a population that wanders from the Mediterranean to the Gulf of Mexico over its decades - long life span , recent scientific committees organized by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ( ICCAT ) agree that the Northern bluefin meets the criteria .
Another condition of a CITES listing is that enforcement inspectors must be able to identify the tuna — a task that turns out to be almost as difficult as measuring the population .
There are three species of bluefin tuna — Northern , Pacific and Southern — and even trained taxonomists have trouble distinguishing Northern bluefin from its Pacific cousin .
The problem extends all the way to the plate .
Late last year a team of researchers from Columbia University and the American Museum of Natural History examined 68 samples of tuna smuggled out of sushi restaurants in New York City and Denver .
They found that 19 of 31 restaurants either could not identify or misidentified the species of tuna they were serving — for example , replacing bluefin with bigeye ( or vice versa ) .
Of the nine samples of fish advertised as “ white tuna , ” they discovered that five were not tuna at all but rather escolar , a fish banned as a health hazard in Italy and Japan because it contains indigestible wax esters that can cause diarrhea .
Traditional DNA analysis techniques could not identify the various species of tuna ; the fish are too genetically similar .
Instead the researchers introduced a new approach .
Conventional DNA “ barcoding ” techniques break apart DNA sequences into a jumbled bag of base pairs , then compare how similar the bag is to a reference bag .
The new approach looks at the order of nucleotides in a DNA sequence at a specific location on the genome .
The approach enables positive identification of any tuna sample — even one that is sitting on a bed of rice .
“ Some sort of DNA - based identification will be a critical component for making CITES an effective regulation , ” says Jacob Lowenstein , one of the co-authors of the research .
“ This will probably in the short term become the standard tool for regulatory bodies . ”
And even if the CITES proposal fails , there will still be much to enforce .
ICCAT is charged with setting bluefin catch quotas in the Atlantic and Mediterranean , and by most accounts it has done a terrible job of it .
“ ICCAT was convened and established in the 1960s because of widespread concern by tuna fishermen over the decline of bluefin tuna , ” says Carl Safina , president of the Blue Ocean Institute .
“ Since its inception the bluefin population has done nothing but go down . ”
Even though ICCAT sets catch quotas far higher than the recommendations of its own scientific advisory board , poaching and smuggling are still rampant .
In 2007 , for instance , ICCAT had set the quota for the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean at 29,500 metric tons of bluefin , even though scientists had recommended that ICCAT shut down the Mediterranean fisheries for two months during spawning season and limit total catch to less than 15,000 metric tons .
Fishermen caught an estimated 61,000 tons , most of it in the Mediterranean spawning grounds .
Says Safina , “ It ’s an all - out war on the fish at the moment . ”

On his FNC program The O’Reilly Factor , host Bill O’Reilly engaged in full blown fear mongering tonight as he compared President Obama ’s attempts to pass healthcare reform with George W. Bush ’s belief that Saddam Hussein was a threat to the United States .
Only in the fractured realm of Fox News could a healthcare bill be equated with an unjust war that has killed thousands of people .
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :
Advertisements
O’Reilly said , “ President Obama sincerely believes that healthcare reform will make America stronger , just as President Bush sincerely believed that Saddam Hussein was a threat to the world , but both men could be wrong , and it ’s very possible that Obamacare could cause mass chaos in our medical system , and drive the treasury into bankruptcy .
That ’s not a scare tactic .
That ’s real life .
The President must know Obamacare is a huge risk for the country , and at this point I believe the risk is not worth taking .
Bill - O suggested that private insurance reform was the answer .
Simply saying that something is n’t a scare tactic does not make it so .
O’Reilly was engaging in fear mongering of the highest order .
Where is the evidence that healthcare reform with throw our medical system into chaos ?
How could this healthcare reform bill throw our system into chaos when it does n’t contain a public option or any major changes to healthcare delivery mechanism ?
As far as bankrupting the treasury , O’Reilly needs to look at the CBO numbers .
The healthcare bill will save the country money .
The current system is already bleeding us dry .
The comparison between George W. Bush and Iraq and Barack Obama and healthcare is not only faulty , but also insulting .
The decision to pass a healthcare reform bill is not the same as manipulating intelligence to justify a war that has killed or injured hundreds of thousands .
O’Reilly was trying to demonize healthcare reform by comparing it to the unpopular Iraq war .
The two decisions are not the same , and it never ceases to amaze me that Fox News can jam so much misinformation into one minute of programming .
They are true masters of their trade .
MoMA ’s Department of Architecture and Design has acquired the @ symbol into its collection .
It is a momentous , elating acquisition that makes us all proud .
But what does it mean , both in conceptual and in practical terms ?
Contemporary art , architecture , and design can take on unexpected manifestations , from digital codes to Internet addresses and sets of instructions that can be transmitted only by the artist .
The process by which such unconventional works are selected and acquired for our collection can take surprising turns as well , as can the mode in which they ’re eventually appreciated by our audiences .
While installations have for decades provided museums with interesting challenges involving acquisition , storage , reproducibility , authorship , maintenance , manufacture , context — even questions about the essence of a work of art in itself —
MoMA curators have recently ventured further ; a good example is the recent acquisition by the Department of Media and Performance Art of Tino Sehgal ’s performance Kiss .
The acquisition of @ takes one more step .
It relies on the assumption that physical possession of an object as a requirement for an acquisition is no longer necessary , and therefore it sets curators free to tag the world and acknowledge things that “ cannot be had ” — because they are too big ( buildings , Boeing 747 ’s , satellites ) , or because they are in the air and belong to everybody and to no one , like the @ — as art objects befitting MoMA ’s collection .
The same criteria of quality , relevance , and overall excellence shared by all objects in MoMA ’s collection also apply to these entities .
In order to understand why we have chosen to acquire the @ symbol , and how it will exist in our collection , it is necessary to understand where @ comes from , and why it ’s become so ubiquitous in our world .
A Little History
Some linguists believe that @ dates back to the sixth or seventh century , a ligature meant to fuse the Latin preposition ad — meaning “ at ” , “ to , ” or “ toward ” — into a unique pen stroke .
The symbol persisted in sixteenth - century Venetian trade , where it was used to mean amphora , a standard - size terracotta vessel employed by merchants , which had become a unit of measure .
Interestingly , the current Spanish word for @ , arroba , also indicates a unit of measure .
The @ symbol was known as the ‘ ” commercial ‘ a ’ ” when it appeared on the keyboard of the American Underwood typewriter in 1885 , and it was defined as such , for the first time , in the American Dictionary of Printing & Bookmaking in 1894 .
From this point on the symbol itself was standardized both stylistically and in its application , and it appeared in the original 1963 ASCII ( American Standard Code for Information Interchange ) list of computer codes .
At the time @ was explained as an abbreviation for the word “ at ” or for the phrase “ at the rate of , ” mainly used in accounting and commercial invoices .
Ray Tomlinson’s @
In 1967 , American electrical engineer Ray Tomlinson joined the technology company of Bolt Beranek and Newman ( BBN ) , where he created the world ’s first e-mail system a few years later , in 1971 , using a Model KSR 33 Teletype device .
BBN had a contract from the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense to help in the development of ARPAnet , an early network from which the Internet later emerged .
Working with Douglas Engelbart on the whole program , Tomlinson was in particular responsible for the development of the sub - program that can send messages between computers on this network .
It was the first system able to send mail between users on different hosts connected to the ARPAnet , while previously mail could be sent only to hosts that used the same computer .
In January 1971 , @ was an underused jargon symbol lingering on the keyboard and marred by a very limited register .
By October , Tomlinson had rediscovered and appropriated it , imbuing it with new meaning and elevating it to defining symbol of the computer age .
He chose the @ for his first e-mail because of its strong locative sense — an individual , identified by a username , is @ this institution / computer / server , and also because … it was already there , on the keyboard , and nobody ever used it .
Is @ Design ?
The appropriation and reuse of a pre-existing , even ancient symbol — a symbol already available on the keyboard yet vastly underutilized , a ligature meant to resolve a functional issue ( excessively long and convoluted programming language ) brought on by a revolutionary technological innovation ( the Internet ) — is by all means an act of design of extraordinary elegance and economy .
Without any need to redesign keyboards or discard old ones , Tomlinson gave the @ symbol a completely new function that is nonetheless in keeping with its origins , with its penchant for building relationships between entities and establishing links based on objective and measurable rules — a characteristic echoed by the function @ now embodies in computer programming language .
Tomlinson then sent an email about the @ sign and how it should be used in the future .
He therefore consciously , and from the very start , established new rules and a new meaning for this symbol .
Why @ Is in the Collection of The Museum of Modern Art
Tomlinson performed a powerful act of design that not only forever changed the @ sign ’s significance and function , but which also has become an important part of our identity in relationship and communication with others .
His ( unintended ) role as a designer must be acknowledged and celebrated by the one collection — MoMA ’s — that has always celebrated elegance , economy , intellectual transparency , and a sense of the possible future directions that are embedded in the arts of our time , the essence of modern .
What Have We Acquired ?
Tino Sehgal ’s Kiss presents interesting affinities with @ in that it is mutable and open to interpretation ( the different typefaces one can use ) yet still remains the same in its essence : it does not declare itself a work of design , but rather reveals its design power through use ; it is immaterial and synthetic , and therefore does not add unnecessary “ weight ” to the world .
A big difference between the two pieces is the price , which brings to an extreme the evanescent difference between art and design .
Being in the public realm , @ is free .
It might be the only truly free — albeit not the only priceless — object in our collection .
We have acquired the design act in itself and as we will feature it in different typefaces , we will note each time the specific typeface as if we were indicating the materials that a physical object is made of .
A Few More Details About @
The @ symbol is now part of the very fabric of life all over the world .
Nowhere is this more vividly demonstrated than in the affectionate names @ has been given by different cultures .
Germans , Poles , and South Africans call @ “ monkey ’s tail ” in each different language .
Chinese see a little mouse , and Italians and the French , a snail .
For the Russians @ symbolizes a dog , while the Finnish know @ as the miukumauku , meaning the “ sign of the meow , ” and believe that the symbol is inspired by a curled - up sleeping cat .
The @ symbol has become so significant that people feel they need to make sense of it ; hence it has inspired its own folkloric tradition .
The @ sign is such an extraordinary mediating symbol that recently in the Spanish language it has begun to express gender neutrality ; for example , in the typical expression Hola [ email protected ] [ email protected ] [ email protected ] y [ email protected ] [ email protected ] [ email protected ] !
( Hello old friends and new friends ! )
Its potential for such succinct negotiations ( whether between man and machine , or between traditional gender classifications and the current spectrum ) and its range of application continue to expand .
It has truly become a way of expressing society ’s changing technological and social relationships , expressing new forms of behavior and interaction in a new world .

The United States apparently has reached the point where it must either accept that Iran will develop nuclear weapons at some point if it wishes , or take military action to prevent this .
There is a third strategy , however : Washington can seek to redefine the Iranian question .
As we have no idea what leaders on either side are thinking , exploring this represents an exercise in geopolitical theory .
Let 's begin with the two apparent stark choices .
Diplomacy vs. the Military Option
The diplomatic approach consists of creating a broad coalition prepared to impose what have been called crippling sanctions on Iran .
Effective sanctions must be so painful that they compel the target to change its behavior .
In Tehran 's case , this could only consist of blocking Iran 's imports of gasoline .
Iran imports 35 percent of the gasoline it consumes .
It is not clear that a gasoline embargo would be crippling , but it is the only embargo that might work .
All other forms of sanctions against Iran would be mere gestures designed to give the impression that something is being done .
The Chinese will not participate in any gasoline embargo .
Beijing gets 11 percent of its oil from Iran , and it has made it clear it will continue to deliver gasoline to Iran .
Moscow 's position is that Russia might consider sanctions down the road , but it has n't specified when , and it has n't specified what .
The Russians are more than content seeing the U.S. bogged down in the Middle East and so are not inclined to solve American problems in the region .
With the Chinese and Russians unlikely to embargo gasoline , these sanctions wo n't create significant pain for Iran .
Since all other sanctions are gestures , the diplomatic approach is therefore unlikely to work .
The military option has its own risks .
First , its success depends on the quality of intelligence on Iran 's nuclear facilities and on the degree of hardening of those targets .
Second , it requires successful air attacks .
Third , it requires battle damage assessments that tell the attacker whether the strike succeeded .
Fourth , it requires follow - on raids to destroy facilities that remain functional .
And fifth , attacks must do more than simply set back Iran 's program a few months or even years :
If the risk of a nuclear Iran is great enough to justify the risks of war , the outcome must be decisive .
Each point in this process is a potential failure point .
Given the multiplicity of these points — which includes others not mentioned — failure may not be an option , but it is certainly possible .
But even if the attacks succeed , the question of what would happen the day after the attacks remains .
Iran has its own counters .
It has a superbly effective terrorist organization , Hezbollah , at its disposal .
It has sufficient influence in Iraq to destabilize that country and force the United States to keep forces in Iraq badly needed elsewhere .
And it has the ability to use mines and missiles to attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf shipping lanes for some period — driving global oil prices through the roof while the global economy is struggling to stabilize itself .
Iran 's position on its nuclear program is rooted in the awareness that while it might not have assured options in the event of a military strike , it has counters that create complex and unacceptable risks .
Iran therefore does not believe the United States will strike or permit Israel to strike , as the consequences would be unacceptable .
To recap , the United States either can accept a nuclear Iran or risk an attack that might fail outright , impose only a minor delay on Iran 's nuclear program or trigger extremely painful responses even if it succeeds .
When neither choice is acceptable , it is necessary to find a third choice .
Redefining the Iranian Problem
As long as the problem of Iran is defined in terms of its nuclear program , the United States is in an impossible place .
Therefore , the Iranian problem must be redefined .
One attempt at redefinition involves hope for an uprising against the current regime .
We will not repeat our views on this in depth , but in short , we do not regard these demonstrations to be a serious threat to the regime .
Tehran has handily crushed them , and even if they did succeed , we do not believe they would produce a regime any more accommodating toward the United States .
The idea of waiting for a revolution is more useful as a justification for inaction — and accepting a nuclear Iran — than it is as a strategic alternative .
At this moment , Iran is the most powerful regional military force in the Persian Gulf .
Unless the United States permanently stations substantial military forces in the region , there is no military force able to block Iran .
Turkey is more powerful than Iran , but it is far from the Persian Gulf and focused on other matters at the moment , and it does n't want to take on Iran militarily — at least not for a very long time .
At the very least , this means the United States cannot withdraw from Iraq .
Baghdad is too weak to block Iran from the Arabian Peninsula , and the Iraqi government has elements friendly toward Iran .
Historically , regional stability depended on the Iraqi - Iranian balance of power .
When it tottered in 1990 , the result was the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait .
The United States did not push into Iraq in 1991 because it did not want to upset the regional balance of power by creating a vacuum in Iraq .
Rather , U.S. strategy was to re-establish the Iranian - Iraqi balance of power to the greatest extent possible , as the alternative was basing large numbers of U.S. troops in the region .
The decision to invade Iraq in 2003 assumed that once the Baathist regime was destroyed the United States would rapidly create a strong Iraqi government that would balance Iran .
The core mistake in this thinking lay in failing to recognize that the new Iraqi government would be filled with Shiites , many of whom regarded Iran as a friendly power .
Rather than balancing Iran , Iraq could well become an Iranian satellite .
The Iranians strongly encouraged the American invasion precisely because they wanted to create a situation where Iraq moved toward Iran 's orbit .
When this in fact began happening , the Americans had no choice but an extended occupation of Iraq , a trap both the Bush and Obama administrations have sought to escape .
It is difficult to define Iran 's influence in Iraq at this point .
But at a minimum , while Iran may not be able to impose a pro-Iranian state on Iraq , it has sufficient influence to block the creation of any strong Iraqi government either through direct influence in the government or by creating destabilizing violence in Iraq .
In other words , Iran can prevent Iraq from emerging as a counterweight to Iran , and Iran has every reason to do this .
Indeed , it is doing just this .
The Fundamental U.S. - Iranian Issue
Iraq , not nuclear weapons , is the fundamental issue between Iran and the United States .
Iran wants to see a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq so Iran can assume its place as the dominant military power in the Persian Gulf .
The United States wants to withdraw from Iraq because it faces challenges in Afghanistan — where it will also need Iranian cooperation — and elsewhere .
Committing forces to Iraq for an extended period of time while fighting in Afghanistan leaves the United States exposed globally .
Events involving China or Russia — such as the 2008 war in Georgia — would see the United States without a counter .
The alternative would be a withdrawal from Afghanistan or a massive increase in U.S. armed forces .
The former is not going to happen any time soon , and the latter is an economic impossibility .
Therefore , the United States must find a way to counterbalance Iran without an open - ended deployment in Iraq and without expecting the re-emergence of Iraqi power , because Iran is not going to allow the latter to happen .
The nuclear issue is simply an element of this broader geopolitical problem , as it adds another element to the Iranian tool kit .
It is not a stand - alone issue .
The United States has an interesting strategy in redefining problems that involves creating extraordinary alliances with mortal ideological and geopolitical enemies to achieve strategic U.S. goals .
First consider Franklin Roosevelt 's alliance with Stalinist Russia to block Nazi Germany .
He pursued this alliance despite massive political outrage not only from isolationists but also from institutions like the Roman Catholic Church that regarded the Soviets as the epitome of evil .
Now consider Richard Nixon 's decision to align with China at a time when the Chinese were supplying weapons to North Vietnam that were killing American troops .
Moreover , Mao — who had said he did not fear nuclear war as China could absorb a few hundred million deaths — was considered , with reason , quite mad .
Nevertheless , Nixon , as anti-Communist and anti-Chinese a figure as existed in American politics , understood that an alliance ( and despite the lack of a formal treaty , alliance it was ) with China was essential to counterbalance the Soviet Union at a time when American power was still being sapped in Vietnam .
Roosevelt and Nixon both faced impossible strategic situations unless they were prepared to redefine the strategic equation dramatically and accept the need for alliance with countries that had previously been regarded as strategic and moral threats .
American history is filled with opportunistic alliances designed to solve impossible strategic dilemmas .
The Stalin and Mao cases represent stunning alliances with prior enemies designed to block a third power seen as more dangerous .
It is said that Ahmadinejad is crazy .
It was also said that Mao and Stalin were crazy , in both cases with much justification .
Ahmadinejad has said many strange things and issued numerous threats .
But when Roosevelt ignored what Stalin said and Nixon ignored what Mao said , they each discovered that Stalin's and Mao 's actions were far more rational and predictable than their rhetoric .
Similarly , what the Iranians say and what they do are quite different .
U.S. vs. Iranian Interests
Consider the American interest .
First , it must maintain the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz .
The United States cannot tolerate interruptions , and that limits the risks it can take .
Second , it must try to keep any one power from controlling all of the oil in the Persian Gulf , as that would give such a country too much long - term power within the global system .
Third , while the United States is involved in a war with elements of the Sunni Muslim world , it must reduce the forces devoted to that war .
Fourth , it must deal with the Iranian problem directly .
Europe will go as far as sanctions but no further , while the Russians and Chinese wo n't even go that far yet .
Fifth , it must prevent an Israeli strike on Iran for the same reasons it must avoid a strike itself , as the day after any Israeli strike will be left to the United States to manage .
Now consider the Iranian interest .
First , it must guarantee regime survival .
It sees the United States as dangerous and unpredictable .
In less than 10 years , it has found itself with American troops on both its eastern and western borders .
Second , it must guarantee that Iraq will never again be a threat to Iran .
Third , it must increase its authority within the Muslim world against Sunni Muslims , whom it regards as rivals and sometimes as threats .
Now consider the overlaps .
The United States is in a war against some ( not all ) Sunnis .
These are Iran 's enemies , too .
Iran does not want U.S. troops along its eastern and western borders .
In point of fact , the United States does not want this either .
The United States does not want any interruption of oil flow through Hormuz .
Iran much prefers profiting from those flows to interrupting them .
Finally , the Iranians understand that it is the United States alone that is Iran 's existential threat .
If Iran can solve the American problem its regime survival is assured .
The United States understands , or should , that resurrecting the Iraqi counterweight to Iran is not an option :
It is either U.S. forces in Iraq or accepting Iran 's unconstrained role .
Therefore , as an exercise in geopolitical theory , consider the following .
Washington 's current options are unacceptable .
By redefining the issue in terms of dealing with the consequences of the 2003 invasion of Iraq , there are three areas of mutual interest .
First , both powers have serious quarrels with Sunni Islam .
Second , both powers want to see a reduction in U.S. forces in the region .
Third , both countries have an interest in assuring the flow of oil , one to use the oil , the other to profit from it to increase its regional power .
The strategic problem is , of course , Iranian power in the Persian Gulf .
The Chinese model is worth considering here .
China issued bellicose rhetoric before and after Nixon 's and Kissinger 's visits .
But whatever it did internally , it was not a major risk - taker in its foreign policy .
China 's relationship with the United States was of critical importance to China .
Beijing fully understood the value of this relationship , and while it might continue to rail about imperialism , it was exceedingly careful not to undermine this core interest .
The major risk of the third strategy is that Iran will overstep its bounds and seek to occupy the oil - producing countries of the Persian Gulf .
Certainly , this would be tempting , but it would bring a rapid American intervention .
The United States would not block indirect Iranian influence , however , from financial participation in regional projects to more significant roles for the Shia in Arabian states .
Washington 's limits for Iranian power are readily defined and enforced when exceeded .
The great losers in the third strategy , of course , would be the Sunnis in the Arabian Peninsula .
But Iraq aside , they are incapable of defending themselves , and the United States has no long - term interest in their economic and political relations .
So long as the oil flows , and no single power directly controls the entire region , the United States does not have a stake in this issue .
Israel would also be enraged .
It sees ongoing American - Iranian hostility as a given .
And it wants the United States to eliminate the Iranian nuclear threat .
But eliminating this threat is not an option given the risks , so the choice is a nuclear Iran outside some structured relationship with the United States or within it .
The choice that Israel might want , a U.S. - Iranian conflict , is unlikely .
Israel can no more drive American strategy than can Saudi Arabia .
From the American standpoint , an understanding with Iran would have the advantage of solving an increasingly knotty problem .
In the long run , it would also have the advantage of being a self - containing relationship .
Turkey is much more powerful than Iran and is emerging from its century - long shell .
Its relations with the United States are delicate .
The United States would infuriate the Turks by doing this deal , forcing them to become more active faster .
They would thus emerge in Iraq as a counterbalance to Iran .
But Turkey 's anger at the United States would serve U.S. interests .
The Iranian position in Iraq would be temporary , and the United States would not have to break its word as Turkey eventually would eliminate Iranian influence in Iraq .
Ultimately , the greatest shock of such a maneuver on both sides would be political .
The U.S. - Soviet agreement shocked Americans deeply , the Soviets less so because Stalin 's pact with Hitler had already stunned them .
The Nixon - Mao entente shocked all sides .
It was utterly unthinkable at the time , but once people on both sides thought about it , it was manageable .
Such a maneuver would be particularly difficult for U.S. President Barack Obama , as it would be widely interpreted as another example of weakness rather than as a ruthless and cunning move .
A military strike would enhance his political standing , while an apparently cynical deal would undermine it .
Ahmadinejad could sell such a deal domestically much more easily .
In any event , the choices now are a nuclear Iran , extended airstrikes with all their attendant consequences , or something else .
This is what something else might look like and how it would fit in with American strategic tradition .
TRENTON — Christopher J. Christie , the first Republican elected governor of New Jersey in 12 years , unveiled a $ 29.3 billion budget on Tuesday that relies almost exclusively on spending cuts to reverse the sagging fortunes of a state he sees as battered by the recession and choking on its tax burden .
To close a deficit that he asserted was approaching $ 11 billion , Governor Christie called for the layoffs of 1,300 state workers , closings of state psychiatric institutions , an $ 820 million cut in aid to public schools , and nearly a half - billion dollars less in aid to towns and cities .
He also suspended until May 2011 a popular property - tax rebate program , breaking one of his own campaign promises .
Democrats were quick to characterize Mr. Christie ’s proposal as falling disproportionately on the backs of the middle class , the poor , the elderly , schoolchildren , college students and inner-city residents , while leaving largely unscathed the wealthy and most businesses .
But Mr. Christie was ready for that line of attack .
“ Today , we are fulfilling the promise of a smaller government that lives within its means , ” he said at a joint legislative session here .
“ The defenders of the status quo have already begun to yell and scream .
They will try to demonize me .
They will seek to divide us rather than unite us .
But even they know in their hearts , if not yet in their minds — it is time for a change . ”
At least some of that money was likely to have come from the £ 150 million raised by Live Aid and Band Aid .
More than three million copies of Do They Know It 's Christmas sold in just five weeks in late 1984 to raise funds for the estimated eight million Ethiopians facing starvation .

Lady Gaga Is Probably Not An Illuminati Shill
Conspiracy theorists have seized on Lady Gaga ’s latest music video , “ Telephone , ” as evidence that she ’s a mind - controlled agent of the CIA .
If that sounds like a stretch , consider that VigilantCitizen.com has raked in over 1,300 comments on its conspiratorial analysis of “ Telephone . ”
Hundreds of thousands of people have likely read it , and perhaps many believed .
Vigilant Citizen ’s warning to America is that Gaga and other singers have been given the full Manchurian - Candidate treatment under the CIA ’s “ Monarch Program ” and unleashed on pop culture to rep the devil - worshipping Illuminati .
The wider goal of the conspiracy remains hazy , but it has to do with seducing and softening up the hoi polloi with a mind - controlling pageantry of outrageous sex , decadence , murder , madness , and technological excess — all elements in “ Telephone ” and preparatory ingredients in a transhumanist , authoritarian New World Order .
But let ’s backtrack .
What is this CIA “ Monarch Program ” ?
Vigilant Citizen talks about it as if it ’s a well - established fact .
Curious and unwilling to put anything past the CIA , I went in search of credible sources testifying to its existence .
But the whole notion of the program originates with one woman named Cathy O’Brien and I would n’t call her credible .
I would call her batty .
The “ Monarch Program ” is a figment of O’Brien ’s “ recovered memories . ”
The inducement of such memories , almost always fabricated , was a fad in the 1980s , and fueled that decade ’s satanic sex abuse scare .
Michael Barkun , in Culture of Conspiracy : Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America , writes that O’Brien was hypnotized by her husband and began recalling her brainwashing under the Monarch Program and subsequent work as a CIA drug smuggler and sex - slave to George H.W. Bush and Hillary Clinton .
The claims were so outlandish that her critics included the late Jim Keith , an originator of the black - helicopter conspiracy theory , and the author of Saucers of the Illuminati and Casebook on the Men in Black .
Culture of Conspiracy notes that a Ufologist investigated O’Brien ’s story with an open mind and gave up after finding her accusations “ never came backed with hard evidence . ”
I do n’t mean to imply the CIA has n’t tried controlling people ’s minds or programming them .
It has .
You need n’t look any further than Project MKULTRA for proof of that .
But Vigilant Citizen stakes its Gaga theory on the existence of a separate , unsubstantiated CIA conspiracy that ’s been dismissed as improbable by the black - helicopter people — and for that the website loses all credibility .
More interesting than the question of Lady Gaga ’s dark history with the CIA is that of Vigilant Citizen ’s popularity .
How to explain it ?
The easy answer is that conspiracy theorists have always been around .
But there ’s no denying we live in especially paranoid times , and Vigilant Citizen ’s popularity is helped by the fact that an oligopoly controls the airwaves – raising perhaps legitimate concerns that content is being screened and manipulated by a small cadre of record executives .
It also helps that Lady Gaga ’s music is unprecedented and provocative — and that she ’s thrown red meat to the conspiracy theorists by , for instance , posing in a Masonic temple wearing Hello Kitty dolls .
And I admit with no reluctance that Vigilant Citizen is an entertaining read and makes astute points here and there .
The website was somewhat correct in linking Gaga with Fritz Lang ’s Metropolis , the dystopian sci-fi film from Weimar Germany .
She derived her name from “ Radio Gaga , ” a Queen song whose promotional video was set in Metropolis .
And she ’s posed for a photo shoot ( caution : graphic ) in a robot outfit , scaling skyscrapers with a Zeppelin and sprawled naked bodies in the background , leaving no doubt that she ’s fashioned herself after Weimar modernism .
That fact itself is a riddle of the zeitgeist .
But maybe the deeper meaning in Vigilant Citizen ’s popularity is that music — and I mean everything from the marches of John Phillips Souza to Elvis ’s alleycat yowls to Lady Gaga ’s androidal croon — is moving and terrifying , a force of nature as well as a reflector and creator of culture .
If the Puritans ascribed to music occult , evil , and paranormal properties , so do some modern Americans .
Vigilant Citizen speaks for them .
The last day of IDF is usually reserved for an entertaining keynote by Pat Gelsinger , but since Pat has moved on to his new role as Senior VP and GM of the new Digital Enterprise Group , someone else had to fill his shoes .
That someone else is none other than Justin Rattner , quite possibly the best person for the job .
Rattner 's keynote started off with a clearly nervous tone , would n't you be if you were on the receiving end of the Gelsinger torch ?
Mannerisms aside , Rattner is an extremely capable engineer and he should have no problems fulfilling the demands of his new role .
His keynote today was n't able to top Gelsinger 's past keynotes but he's on the right track to picking up where Pat left off .
The keynote was a bit long and drawn out , but in the usual style of Gelsinger , Rattner provided a good look at what is coming down the road in a segment he called Platform 2015 .
The idea is to be able to look at trends that will be reality in the next decade , and here are some of the more interesting points ...
Earlier this week I looked at the tournament format for these Olympics and yesterday commented on the teams in Group A. Today , I 'll take a look at Group B which , in my opinion , is the toughest road to the gold medal .
Why ?
Because each team needs to accumulate as many standings points and as strong a goal differential as possible against the three other teams in their group to determine their overall seeding for the playoffs .
With Russia , the Czechs and Slovakia grouped together there 's a better chance that the team winning the pool sees a game go to overtime or that the three teams split their games against one another .
Even if one team does manage to go 3 - 0 ( all in regulation ) there 's a very good chance they wo n't be able to rack up the goal differential like the top teams in Groups A and C .
After the jump we 'll take a closer look at each of the teams in this " Group of Death " ( thanks soccer ! ) : Latvia , the Czech Republic , Slovakia and Russia .
Team - Latvia
Predicted Finish - 12th after Group stage , eliminated in qualification round .
Latvia is , in truth , probably not bringing the worst roster to the Olympics in the tournament .
They'd be in much better shape if they swtiched groups with , say , Germany .
But they 're not .
Instead they 're in a group with three legitimate teams that all need to not only win but win and ratchet up the score .
With 14 players on the same club team in the KHL ( Riga Dinamo ) they 'll likely be a lot more cohesive than the other teams to start the tournament .
It 's unfortunate for them that even if they do manage an upset in the first game , one in the fourth game is a lot more important .
Even with an upset in the Group stage they would likely still be finishing in the bottom 8 and would need to play another " big " country to advance to the quarterfinals .
Last year 's world championships showed should give them some hope .
They picked up a 3 - 2 shoot - out victory over Sweden in the round robin and a 2 - 1 shoot - out victory over Switzerland , so they 're no push - overs .
But ... that was Switzerland minus Jonas Hiller and Sweden minus their Red Wings contingent .
This tournament promises to be a lot more difficult .
Where 's Arturs Irbe when you need him ?
Edgars Maskalkis , the starter for Riga , is also the likely starter for Latvia in these Olympics .
His .910 save percentage in the KHL bests that of his crease - mate Martin Prusek 's ( Hey ! Senators fans ! ) .903 but is only 17th in the league overall behind former Oiler draft pick Alex Fomitchev , former Canadian World Junior goalie Jeff Glass and former U.S. Olympian Robert Esche .
He 's not a bad goaltender but he's one of the few starting goalies in this tournament that is n't an elite goalie in the NHL .
On defence the Latvians bring a pair of NHLers in Karlis Skrastins and Oskars Bartulis .
Skrastins in particular is a help as he's been a second pairing guy for the Dallas Stars this year and leads their defence in ice - time on the PK with good results .
I expect him to play huge minutes for the Latvians in defensive situations and even though he 'll be overmatched he wo n't be OVERMATCHED like the rest of his teammates .
The Latvians chose to go with 8 defenders on the club and four of the rest come from Riga and yet none of them are named Sandis Ozolinsh who actually plays for Riga and leads the defence in both points and ice - time per game .
It seems an odd choice to leave the veteran at home , especially for a team as offensively challenged as Latvia .
Especially since he 's familiar with the North American game and the smaller ice surface .
Especially because eh'e the face of Latvian hockey !
Where is the Wizard of Oz ?!
At any rate , they 've replaced him with a bunch of other guys who also play for Riga .
Martins Karsums is the only forward with any recent NHL experience and has managed a couple of near - PPG seasons with the Providence Bruins before being shipped off to the Tampa Bay organization where his performance crashed .
He recently returned to the KHL ( Riga ... Shocking ! ) though I 'm unsure if he did it to prepare for the Olympics or because he 's soured on his chances of making it in North America .
Beyond Karsums - and if you 're talking about your team 's offensive threats for the Olympics and use the phrase " beyond Karsums " you 're in trouble - the team 's next best weapons are likely Aleksandrs Nizivijs ( 34 points in 47 games ) and Janis Sprukts ( 31 points in 50 games ) who are the top two Latvian scorers on Riga ( the team 's leading scorer is Marcel Hossa who 's in the Olympics , but not playing for Latvia ) .
It will surely be a tough slog for this group and I certainly do n't have any reservations about choosing them to finish at the bottom of the totem pole .
It 's basically the 13th best club in the KHL without their leading scorer coming to play in the Olympics .
That , my friends , is B - R - U - T - A-L .
Team - Czech Republic
Predicted Finish - 7th after Group stage , eliminated in quarterfinals .
The Edmonton Oilers are a much better team with Ales Hemsky than they are without him .
That 's true of the Czechs too and I 'm sure Michal Handzus will get a rougher greeting from the Czechs than he did from the Oilers when the Czechs and Slovaks meet later this week .
And while the Czechs will miss Hemsky , the replacement is n't J.F. Jacques either .
In addition to a very solid NHL contingent the Czechs have brought some KHL men with them to Vancouver .
Josef Vasicek is currently 14th in KHL scoring with 44 points in 53 games and his last stint in the NHL with the New York Islanders ( 2007 - 08 ) saw him lead the team in Corsi ( + 8.8/60 ) despite taking on decent opposition and starting a lot in the defensive zone .
He should probably anchor a defensive line on this club , perhaps with Tomas Plekanec , who has had a pretty rough road this year in Montreal .
Milan Michalek , Martin Erat and Martin Havlat have all been used in a power - v- power set with their NHL teams at times over the last two years and could be counted on to do more of the same in this tournament .
If the Czechs can successfully create two lines that can check a bit they 'll be able to use Jaromir Jagr in a pure scoring role where he 's likely good enough to still have some substantial success .
It will be a lot of fun to see him play and I hope he looks fantastic so that any rumours of him signing with the Oilers can be met with joy instead of dread .
Joining him in offensive situations might be Patrik Elias and Thomas Fleichmann who have generally been sheltered a little bit at times this season ( but not like you 'd shelter a rookie , they can certainly play ) and possess definite offensive skills .
The forward group sounds good but they could definitely use one more power - v-power stalwart in Hemsky , especially against the teams really deep at forward like Canada and Russia .
The defense is solid but not dynamic .
Zbynek Michalek and Jan Hejda should form an excellent top defensive group .
Both players have been used in that role over the last few seasons and both have been playing on poor ( or worse ) teams for most of that time ( Michalek 's Coyotes are quality this year ) which has given them ample opportunity to play in the most difficult situations against some of the best players in the world .
The fact that both guys are in the Western Conference adds to their credentials as legit shut - down guys in this tournament .
Roman Polak is being faced with the same situation this year in St. Louis .
His Corsi is a seemingly unimpressive - 2.2/60 but when you take into consideration the fact that he 's doing it against top opposition and with the second worst ratio of offensive to defensive zone draws in the entire NHL for a defender ( 197 OZ draws and 358 DZ draws ; the only player with a worse ratio is Taylor Chorney ...
Pat Quinn is so , so , so dumb ) then suddenly that number looks pretty darn good .
This dude is moving the puck the right way more often than not against the league 's best ; put him with Tomas Kaberle and all of a sudden the team has two pairs that can match up well against anybody in any situation .
The D is filled out by Pavel Kubina , Marek Zidlicky and Filip Kuba who will surely be used when the time is right ( i.e. with the puck moving the right way adn on the power play ) and they have enough skill that they can take advantage .
These guys might only see 15 or some minutes per game and there 's really no reason for it to be any more .
Backing them up is Tomas Vokoun who has been an elite starter in the NHL since the lockout .
Among goalies with at least 100 games played in that time the guy with the best save percentage is Tomas Vokoun ( .923 ) .
Save percentage may not be everything , but it is something , and that 's a mighty fine number .
These guys probably are n't going to give up a lot of goals .
I have this club finishing in 7th after the Group stage and playing Canada in the quarterfinals .
I think Canada 's team is better but not so much better that it 's anywhere close to a sure thing .
Yesterday I picked Canada to win the gold medal but , honestly , they 're a favourite with a 20 % chance of winning the tournament .
There are a lot of good teams in Vancouver .
Team - Slovakia
Predicted Finish - 6th after Group stage , eliminated in quarterfinals .
They finally have a goalie .
Jaroslav Halak has done enough to show me that he 's the real deal .
Halak has been very good for the last couple of years in the NHL and he 's been very good for a couple of years in the AHL before that .
What was once a true weakness on this squad is now a strength .
Unfortunately , it 's a few years too late .
Players like Miroslav Satan , Jozef Stumpel and Ziggy Palffy are still holding on to roster spots after what seems like decades on the national team .
This is n't the same club that lost in the World Championships last Spring ( there was no Hossa and no Chara ) but there 's also a reason that they 're now ranked 9th in the world behind Switzerland and Belarus : they just do n't have the depth of the best teams in the world and are more prone to upsets from the minnows .
On defence the team is relying on Zdeno Chara and Lubomir Visnovsky .
Andrei Meszaros is a strong second pairing option for the Tampa Bay Lightning but in this tournament he could easily get exposed .
Milan Jurcina is a bottom pairing man with the Blue Jackets and Andrej Sekera has trouble staying in the line - up in Buffalo .
When he does get in , he 's the most sheltered defender they have .
The two other names - Richard Lintnar and Martin Strbak - are familiar to long - time NHL fans as guys that could n't keep a job in the league .
They have two legit players on the back - end which , in this tournament , just is n't going to be enough .
The bottom end of the defence could get exposed in the NHL and the top teams in this tournament are much better than what we see in the NHL .
The situation with the forwards is really quite similar .
Marian Gaborik will be relied upon to carry the team offensively , Marian Hossa should likely be separated from him to anchor a " Shawn - Horcoff - line " and Michal Handzus will be getting all the dirty assignments in the defensive zone against the " lesser " matchups , just like he does in L.A .
The problem , of course is a ) the " lesser " matchups in this tournament are really good and b ) the help on each of these three imaginary lines is less than stellar .
Branko Radivojevic played some very tough minutes for the Wild in 2007 - 08 ( and then was run out of the league for only scoring 17 points and finishing - 14 ... but he was top three in terms of qualcomp , had 156 OZ draws v. 283 DZ draws and finished with a positive Corsi ... hmmm , I wonder if I know of a team that could use a guy like that ... ) .
He is a suitable option to join Handzus on the checking unit .
Gaborik 's group can be filled out by old ( very OLD ! ) buddies Ziggy Palffy and Pavol Demitra .
Marian Hossa , meanwhile , can perhaps carry his brother Marcel who 's having a fine season in the KHL and ... Tomas Kopecky ( ? ) in the " Shawn Horcoff power - v- notsomuchpower role .
These guys just need more real players .
But I picked them to finish sixth and get a win over one of the Czechs or Russians .
It 's just one of those " feeling " things .
For most of these players , it 's their last chance and they know it .
The emergence of Jaroslav Halak is almost tragic .
Finally this group of great players has a goalie they can count on and now they 're too old to take advantage .
Team - Russia
Predicted Finish - 3rd after Group stage , Bronze medal .
This team is the class of the group and , in my opinion , neck - and - neck with Canada for best club on paper .
So why pick them for bronze ?
I do n't think the Russians will generate the kind of goal differential against the Czechs and Slovaks that they 'll need to overcome the Swedes / Finns who are going to have two also - rans to beat up on in Group C ( Germany and Belarus ) .
The Russians are going to be need to be absolutely merciless in their opener with Latvia to have a chance ( merciless with Latvia ... never ... ) .
And if the Swedes or Finns do finish on top after the Group stage , as I expect , it means that Canada and Russia are on a collision course to meet in the semi-finals if they finish 2nd and 3rd .
I 've picked Canada to win that one which leaves Russia in the bronze medal game , but the shoe could end up on the other foot .
The Russian team is overflowing with talented forwards .
Alex Ovechkin leads the NHL in goals and points .
Evgeni Malkin won the scoring race last season .
Ilya Kovalchuk has scored more goals since the lockout than anyone except for Ovechkin .
Three more players are averaging a point - per - game or more in the KHL ( Morozov , Radulov , Zinoviev ) .
Ovechkin's teammate , Alex Semin , is a three - time thirty goal scorer who 's nearing a point - per game average for his career .
Then there 's Pavel Datsyuk , the two - time defending Selke trophy winner and finalist for the Hart trophy last season .
Does your team have three pairs that can play shut - down defence ?
No ?
You 're screwed .
The elite forward talent is three lines deep .
In terms of line composition I expect Pavel Datsyuk to lead an outscoring power - v-power line , taking Backstom 's place between Ovechkin and Semin .
Frightening line .
All three are used to taking on the best players in the world and coming out on top and that 's not likely to change in the next two weeks .
Ilya Kovalchuk , who always seems at his best playing for the national team , will take an offensive role on the club , perhaps with Malkin as the center and either Alex Radulov or old Thrashers ' linemate Maxim Afinogenov .
If that 's the offensive zone " soft ( ish ) " minutes line that is , once again , frightening .
The Ak - Bars Kazan trio of Morozov - Zaripov - Zinoviev will likely be re-united for these Olympics ( the three played together for a few years before Zinoviev moved on to a new team ) .
I do n't know exactly what kind of minutes to expect from them but it probably wo n't be the toughest available as opposing coaches will surely be keying on the five ( or six ) guys mentioned above .
The " what 's left " fourth line of Fedorov - Kozlov - Radulov / Afinogenov is still a very good group and they wo n't be seeing a tonne of ice unless one of the above lines is struggling .
The defence has been branded a weakness by comparison to the amazing offence but it 's also strong .
Sergei Gonchar is a phenomenal all - around defender .
He was considered an offense - only guy when he came over but after his performance with the Penguins in the playoffs last Spring I think most fans know he 's now a guy you can trust in all situations .
Another guy used to the most difficult minutes and plenty of PK is Anton Volchenkov .
His Corsi number is in the black despite the best opposition and a somewhat difficult zone - start ratio , which is likely what he 'll be seeing in these Olympics , except with consistently amazing forwards ( Jonathan Cheechoo on waivers ! ) .
Andrei Markov is a difference - maker for the Canadiens and is the last of the big three defenders for the Russian squad .
Three legitimate # 1 defenders in the NHL .
The Russian defense goes down a notch from here but if this your " weakness " you 've clearly got a very good team .
With eight defenders it 's possible that the Russians go with four four - man units , in which case two of these remaining players will be seeing limited ice - time along with ( what I assume would be ) Fedorov 's group of forwards .
For that job I nominate Dmitri Kalinin ( who sucked for Buffalo and likely sucks in Russia ) and Konstantin Korneyev ( who skipped the part where he sucks for Buffalo ) .
Actually , I just wanted to make that joke .
Korneyev looks pretty good , so we 'll leave Kalinin with Edmonton Oilers defender Denis Grebeshkov instead .
Given Grebeshkov 's penchant for ... unusual ... decisions , it might be wise to have Fedorov there to play third defenceman in case a mess needs cleaning up .
Next up is Blue Jackets defender Fedor Tyutin , a second pairing man for the Blue Jackets who will likely be put on the third pairing here in an effort to shield him from the Crosbies and Ovechkins Zetterbergs of the world .
Should they go with the five man units I think they should put Tyutin with Ilya Nikulin and the Malkin - Kovalchuk line to handle the offensive zone draws .
Nikulin plays in the KHL much to the chagrin of Don Waddell 's Atlanta Thrashers .
Nikulin is second in the KHL in TOI per game and has 32 points in 47 games so he 's got some pop in his bat .
The - 3 on an Ak Bars team that 's +30 on the season implies that he 's either terrible defensively ( not likely given the other numbers ) or that he 's taking the tough minutes on his club team .
My bet is that he does n't look at all out of place on the biggest stage of them all .
And that leaves Konstantin Korneyev to move up and play with the big three .
Korneyev leads CSKA Moscow in ice - time ( over 23:00 per game ) and +/- which is generally a very good combination .
He can also score some with 28 points in his 53 KHL games .
None of these bottom five are as good as the top three but they 're a lot better than what they 're being given credit for as far as I 'm concerned .
The Russian goalies are all good .
Nabokov , Bryzgalov and Varlamov have all put up good numbers but my bet is that we see Nabokov in goal and , if he falters , that Bryzgalov is the next choice .
Varlamov is coming off an injury and with the two other goalies there 's really no need to rely on the young guy with a wonky groin .
The Russians are a fantastic club and may be the best team in the tournament .
I have the Russians and Canadians pretty far out in front but I think the tournament 's structure sees them meet in the semis .
If it happens , it could be the most epic semi-final in quite sometime .

Now some of you may not get this as it is a little geeky , but seriously , this is funnier than a midget hooker trying to reach the $ 20 you left her on the 5 ′ book shelf .
So , Quiznos released a coupon :
The FAIL in this coupon is the coupons web address ( URL ) .
** UPDATE ** Quiznos may have removed the coupon from their site **
http://quiznos.com/subsandwiches/Offers/BannerOffer.aspx?val=100.00&ed=12312010&hk
Why is that fail ?
Well , if you look closely , there is a part of the URL that says ‘ val=100.00 ’
You can change that number to anything you WANT !!
That ’s right , they left their coupon open to be hacked .
For example , this link –
Will get you this coupon :
You can try it out for yourself .
Just copy and paste the link into your browser and change the value of val=xxx.00
So last night for Dinner I took my Quiznos Coupon to attempt to get a free dinner , to see if this would work straight out .
I went into Quiznos and ordered the Beef / Bacon Bullet , and a Bistro Steak Sammie from their 2 for $ 5 promotion .
While it was cooking I walked to the checkout register and was taken care of by the store manager .
( I only assume he was a manager as there were 6 younger people working at this location , and he seemed to be telling them things they should be doing )
I hand the Manager my coupon , and he looks at it , and looks at it , and looks at it .
In total he examines the coupon for a good 2 - 3 minutes .
During this time two things happen .
One , my food is done and ready to go .
Two , the local police pull up and get in the line to order food .
Now
What I am doing is n’t necessarily illegal , but it is questionable .
And I ’ve read many horror stories involving Managers and local Police , so this could get interesting .
After thoroughly examining the coupon , the Manager barely looked at me to try to judge my character at all , he finally decided it was a good coupon .
He did his magic on the register , gave me my food and my receipt , and I headed straight out of their with prize in hand .
Do n’t believe me ?
BAM !:
BONUS HACK !!!
If you look at that coupon URL closely , there is a part of it that says ‘ ed=12312010 ’
That ’s the expiration date .
You can change that to what you want .
For example , changing it to 12311776 will change the expiration date to December 31st 1776 .

One of the most sacred commandments of the NFL is that elite players are n't supposed to change uniforms .
The league 's rules and customs are explicitly designed to discourage this .
And when players do move , common sense tells you they usually target teams in glamorous towns with championship pedigrees .
But for the first time in NFL history , one franchise is threatening to upturn both of these orthodoxies .

Yo ,
Raggajungle .bizzle add the great Psychoradio into the sidebar of the mainpage .
Click the icon to listen directly the stream with your player or click the ticker to go to the Psychoradio - website with more info bout the radiostation .
Max. respect to LammMann & crew !
a lil history :
The PsychoRadio stream went online on the 31st of july 2008 .
Basicly for a bunch of friends from all over Germany to have their favorite RaggaJungle mixtapes available everywhere and everytime .
There was no radio playing RaggaJungle and we just can’t live without it .
First thing when we arrive at a party is connecting the laptop to the WIFI , turning on PsychoRadio and plugging it into the stereo .
And we always have the fucking best music !
Beginning 2009 HoT recognized PsychoRadio , contacted LammMann in IRC and made us aware that this little webradio is worth to be pushed to a new level .
At first we could convince HoT himself to do some live shows .
Thanks to those and his promotion for PsychoRadio , specially in the russian - speaking area ( big up to all junglists there ! ) we soon had 100 slots filled .
We ’re planning to do more live shows and to spread RaggaJungle cause we fucking love it .
If some DJ wants us to put his tape off the stream .
PsychoRadio is strictly non-commercial !
We want to thank our listeners , the DJs , the community , websites like raggajungle .biz , our hoster www.thoenix.de for the awesome support and the server and last but not least HoT for bringing us in touch with the DJs and the scene .
We love you guys !
Maximum respect !
Update 2019 : This site is offline .
“ Economywide cap and trade died of what amounts to natural causes in Washington , ” said Fred Krupp , president of the Environmental Defense Fund , who has been promoting the idea for more than two decades .
“ The term itself became too polarizing and too paralyzing in the effort to win over conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans to try to do something about climate change and our oil dependency . ”
Cap and trade was first tried on a significant scale 20 years ago under the first Bush administration as a way to address the problem of airborne sulfur dioxide pollution — widely known as acid rain — from coal - burning power plants in the Eastern United States .
A limit was imposed on emissions from the plants , and utilities were allowed to buy and sell permits to comply .
Today it is considered one of the most effective environmental initiatives .
Image Senators Lindsey Graham , left , John Kerry and Joseph I. Lieberman are working on bipartisan climate change legislation .
Credit ... Matthew Cavanaugh / European Pressphoto Agency
Environmentalists and industries resurrected the idea in recent years as a centerpiece of measures to address global warming and growing oil imports .
Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts , both Democrats , built their climate change bill last year in large measure around it .
But in trying to assemble a majority to pass it , Mr. Waxman and Mr. Markey dished out a cornucopia of concessions and exemptions to coal companies , utilities , refiners , heavy industry and agribusinesses .
The original simplicity was lost , replaced by a bazaar in which those with the most muscle got the best deals .
Opponents labeled it a tax - and - redistribution scheme .
“ We turned it into ‘ cap and tax , ’ and we turned that into an epithet , ” said Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute , a free - market research organization supported by conservative individuals and corporations .
“ We also did a good job of showing that a bunch of big companies — Goldman Sachs , the oil companies , the big utilities — would get windfall profits because they ’d been given free ration coupons . ”
C. Boyden Gray , White House counsel in the first Bush administration and a strong advocate of the acid rain cap - and - trade program , said that opponents were largely correct in labeling the Waxman - Markey plan a tax , because so many of the pollution allowances were given away to industry rather than allocated based on past emissions .
ON MARCH 4th
The Economist ran a story about the challenges facing scientists who are trying to find out which greenhouse gases come from where .
On March 8th a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Steve Davis and Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution 's campus at Stanford University brought to the fore a further problem in trying to figure out who emits what — one that turns not on how carbon flows through the atmosphere and biosphere , but on how it flows through the world economy .
Who should be held responsible for the greenhouse - gas emissions involved in making , say , a flat - screen television ?
The country where the television is made ?
Or the country where it ends up being used ?
Looking at the carbon emissions associated with a country 's consumption , rather than its production , does not change the general outline of what is going on in the world : rich people still emit more carbon dioxide than poor people do .
But it does heighten the contrast .
Rich countries which import manufactured goods from poorer ones end up with even higher emissions ; poor countries that export a lot of manufactured goods with lower ones .
Using figures from 2004 , the most up to date that have the sort of industry - specific data they need , Dr Davis and Dr Caldeira reveal the striking scale of this effect .
They find that roughly a quarter of the world 's emissions end up being consumed somewhere other than where they are produced .
For a few small and reasonably post - industrial countries , such as Switzerland , the emissions associated with total consumption ( emissions produced in Switzerland minus those associated with goods produced there and subsequently exported plus those associated with goods imported ) are more than twice the emissions actually produced on Swiss territory .
More generally , emissions made on their citizens ' behalf elsewhere in the world add a third or more to most European countries ' emissions .
For America the effect is smaller , but still significant — about 12 % .
For China the situation is , obviously , reversed .
Taking its exports into account reduces emissions by a quarter .
In terms of emissions as usually counted , China overtook America a few years after these figures were collected , and thus became the planet 's largest source of industrial carbon dioxide ; if one drops China 's total and bumps up America's to reflect the patterns of consumption , though , America will surely remain number one for a while .
Trying to understand the scale of these flows in absolute terms is hard , but here is an illustration .
It is as though more than 500 large ( 1,000 megawatt ) power plants in China were sending all their electricity to other countries , but all their emissions still counted as Chinese .
The authors write , and many will agree , that this form of accounting “ provides grounding for ethical arguments that the most developed countries — as the primary beneficiaries of emissions and with greater ability to pay — should lead the global mitigation effort . ”
But , though the ability to pay is not much in doubt , the idea that the benefits from this process all accrue to the developed world is a little simplistic .
This is , after all , trade : benefits flow the other way , too , in the form of a great deal of money .
The big emerging economies were not duped into taking on the developed world 's carbon emissions .
They knew what they were doing and have profited from it .
That said , looking at carbon emissions this way does make the world seem a grimmer place , for three reasons .
The first is that the Carnegie analysis , and similar work elsewhere , show that much of what has seemed like progress on the climate is anything but .
As Dieter Helm of Oxford University and his colleagues pointed out a few years ago , Britain may be proud of cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by some 15 % from 1990 to 2005 , but the consumption that produced many of those emissions is still going on , and so are the emissions — they are just going on elsewhere .
Indeed , according to the Carnegie analysis , Britain 's balance of trade in carbon dioxide ( its imports less its exports ) in 2004 was greater than that of any other big European country : 253 m tonnes , almost half as much as the emissions from the country 's own territory .
The second reason for gloom is that the trade involved is not a zero - sum game .
Moving emissions away from de-industrialising developed countries does not just shift them unchanged from one column to another in some great climatic spreadsheet .
It makes the emissions bigger , because the energy infrastructure of developing countries is more carbon intensive .
According to the Carnegie analysis the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of industrial energy used to make exports is 50 % greater in China than in America .
This is one of the reasons why assumptions made in the 1990s about the likelihood of the world economy becoming ever less carbon intensive have not come to pass .
Trade is moving production from less carbon - intensive economies to more carbon - intensive ones .
The third reason for gloom is that seeing things this way makes dealing with the emissions problem even harder .
The only international agreement on the matter , the Kyoto Protocol , limits emissions only from the developed countries that are party to it .
Although there is little evidence that such limits have in and of themselves driven carbon - intensive industries out of the countries concerned — a phenomenon known as carbon leakage — they do make the natural movement of industry to the developing world , where emissions are unconstrained , harder to deal with .
If the world were uniform with respect to the price of carbon , it would not matter where the carbon was emitted .
Someone , somewhere would be paying , and the costs could be passed on , or not , according to the circumstances and what the market would bear .
But in a world where only some countries have carbon prices , emissions moving elsewhere move from regulated to unregulatable .
One can imagine schemes that might tackle this issue .
In February , at the launch of an analysis of carbon leakage by the Carbon Trust , a British investor and policy shop , Adair Turner , the chairman of the British government 's Committee on Climate Change , sketched out a possibilty .
In some cases it might make sense to impose a border tariff on imports from a country with no cost to its carbon .
The tariff would be set at the cost , on the importer 's carbon markets , of the emissions that would have been given off if the goods in question had been made in the importing country .
The money raised through such a tariff would then , as a matter of equity , be invested in mitigation or adaptation strategies in the country doing the exporting .
Such a scheme might be seen as one of the sources of “ innovative financing ” that the Copenhagen accord wants to look for .
One benefit of this would be that the system would provide incentives for the exporting country to start pricing carbon at the point of production , since it would then capture the proceeds itself and be able to control their use , rather than having them spent according to priorities set , at least in part , by the developed importing country .
But such elegant solutions remain at present entirely theoretical .
The challenges of a world in which those who have believed they have been cutting emissions find that they have not , and where the market is moving industrial production to places where its emissions are unlikely to be capped and also higher than they would be elsewhere , are already there to be seen .
Lord Ashcroft 's non -dom status
Do the recent revelations about Lord Ashcroft confirm that the Conservatives still only look after themselves and are not to be trusted ?

Airport security chiefs may have thought they had enough to worry about with shoe bombers , underpants bombers and people who forget to put their toothpaste into those little plastic bags .
But , if so , they were reckoning without Benedict XVI .
At a meeting in the Vatican at the weekend , the pope made an authoritative – if entirely unexpected – incursion into the raging debate over the planned use of airport body scanners .
He told an audience from the aerospace industry that , notwithstanding the threat from terrorism , " the primary asset to be safeguarded and treasured is the person , in his or her integrity " .
Respect for the principles he enunciated " might seem particularly complex and difficult in the present context " , he told his audience , which included airport managers , airline executives , security workers , pilots , cabin and ground staff .
They had to contend with problems arising " from the economic crisis , which is bringing about problematic effects in the civil aviation sector , and the threat of international terrorism , which is targeting airports and aircraft " .
But , he warned : " It is essential never to lose sight of respect for the primacy of the person . "
The pope 's words will delight civil liberties campaigners opposed to a device that strips passengers virtually naked .
But those involved in airport security will no doubt point out that , when he himself travels — on Alitalia – the pope and his entourage are simply waved through security controls .
An exception was in 1984 when a permanently installed detection mechanism in Luxembourg alerted security officials to the fact that John Paul II and his aides were packing significant quantities of metal .
It had been activated by their crosses .
-- from " Why We Need to Have Empathy for Tea Party
Lunatics " by Michael Bader , on AlterNet today
Self - defense and armed resistance are frequently called for .
Racist stereotypes , innuendo and hostility run rampant .
The Constitution is its sacred text and Glenn Beck its most beloved prophet .
They do n't usually wear aluminum hats but perhaps they should .
The causes and dynamics , however , are the same .
And so just as I have empathy for my patients , I have come to have empathy for the Tea Partiers , even as I despise their influence and work hard to defeat their ideology .
It 's crucial that the Left does likewise , because if we do n't understand the ways that decent , god- fearing , and victimized people can come to espouse such a dangerous ideology , we wo n't be able to fight them effectively .
There is n't one cause of paranoia .
Tomes have been written about it .
Individual variations and exceptions abound .
A few generalizations , however , can be made .
Paranoid people are trying their best to make sense of and mitigate feelings of helplessness and worthlessness .
Their beliefs are attempts to solve a profound problem , albeit in ways that distort reality .
People can't tolerate feeling helpless and self - hating for very long .
It 's too painful , too demoralizing and too frightening .
They have to find an antidote .
They have to make sense of it all in a way that restores their sense of meaning , their feeling of agency , their self - esteem , and their belief in the possibility of redemption .
They have to .
They have no choice .
That 's just the way the mind works .
The paranoid strategy is to generate a narrative that finally " explains it all . "
A narrative -- a set of beliefs about the way the world is and is supposed to be -- helps make sense of chaos .
It reduces guilt and self - blame by projecting it onto someone else .
And it restores a sense of agency by offering up an enemy to fight .
Finally , it offers hope that if " they " -- the enemy , the conspirators -- can be avoided or destroyed , the paranoid person 's core feelings of helplessness and devaluation will go away .
are frequently political neophytes who prize independence and tell strikingly similar stories of having been awakened by the recession .
Their families upended by lost jobs , foreclosed homes and depleted retirement funds , they said they wanted to know why it happened and whom to blame .
[ L]ike my patients , the Tea Party folks find in their paranoid views about politics a narrative that " explains it all , " that reduces their sense of helpless confusion , and that channels their feelings of victimization into one of self - righteous militancy .
They go from passive victim to active agent , from guilty to innocent , but all at the price of distorting reality into one full of malevolent conspiracies .
The payoff is that they are no longer confused .
They are reborn and now , thankfully , have the " answer . "
And that answer is that big forces are hurting and enslaving them .
While these forces include the banks and large corporations , the main culprit is , of course , the government .
People do n't have a direct and immediate experience of Goldman Sachs ; they do , however , experience government every day , not only on television news shows , but via laws , taxes , public services ( or the lack thereof ) , law enforcement , etc .
Some become simply depressed or resigned , others turn to strategies of distraction or addictive self - medication .
Others might face their feelings more directly , tolerate them , and find alternative solutions , e.g. turn to friends , therapists or various communities of support .
Still others may find relief for painful feelings by projecting all meaning and agency onto God .
And some simply fight back against " reality , " despite long odds .
For new Tea Party members , however , the drift toward paranoia is facilitated by the right - wing media machine that offers several ready - made narratives perfectly designed to help its consumers clear up their confusion , understand their helplessness , absolve them of any blame and offer a way out .
The conspiratorial alliance of business and government , a growing tyranny intended to disenfranchise , disarm and exploit ordinary citizens , secret pacts to overthrow the Constitution , etc. all currently led by an un-American , godless , colored , elitist , contemptuous foreigner : Barack Hussein Obama .
A grim and frightening picture of the world to be sure .
Psychologically speaking , however , it offers relief from helplessness and a sense that things are falling apart .
It offers a sense of cohesion and identity based on certainty , a commonality of interests , innocence , and even martyrdom .
While the world of the Tea Partiers is filled with danger , it is a danger mitigated by moral certainty , clarity of purpose and a definable external enemy .
It 's real .
We all feel it .
Most of us do feel helpless in relation to the most important aspects of our lives , from the nature of our work to its security , from our politicians who are on the corporate dole to those perpetuating gridlock through their narrow ideology , from the quality of our health care to its availability , and from the isolation and loneliness of everyday social life .
The pain of self - blaming is also ubiquitous in the cultural assumption that our lot in life is determined primarily by individual ability , not by getting help from others .
Confusion , anxiety , disconnectedness and a sense that " things are falling apart " are not crazy feelings .
They are accurate and valid responses to a highly alienated and often abusive social world .
they can't be changed by rational argument .
I have never been able to help a paranoid patient even a little bit by arguing with his or her view of reality .
Not one bit .
The only way I have been able to make any headway is using our relationship to provide real experiences that have a shot at providing an alternative and more satisfying " solution " to their underlying fears .
Only then can I begin to offer a counter - narrative , one that acknowledges their pain and innocence , but enables them to more accurately identify its sources and , therefore , its antidote .
to the extent we want to reach people who are drawn to Tea Party , patriot , libertarian , and other right - wing movements but are not yet hard - line ideologues , or prevent others from becoming so , we have to begin with empathy .
We have to get inside their heads , figure out how their choices are reasonable from their point of view .
It would help if we found ways to get into relationship with them , to demonstrate a genuine curiosity not about their paranoid theories but about the underlying pain and fear that is the source of them .
In this way , perhaps we can figure out how to speak to that pain and fear in ways that are both authentic and comforting .
Perhaps we can figure out what experiences they might need to have in order to feel safe enough to at least listen to another narrative : ours .

I know , I know , the last thing you want to read is some smart aleck telling you how we have to " understand " the Teabaggers .
But trust me , San Francisco psychologist - psychoanalyst Michael Bader knows how we feel .
That 's why he threw that " lunatics " in his title . " " This hodgepodge of people and groups spout frankly paranoid beliefs as received wisdom , " and he follows up with a pungent sampling of some of the nuttier ones .
He also notes of the movement : " I hate these folks , " he writes , " but I also understand them . "
And , he adds , hewith them .
" They share the same psychology as the paranoid patients I treat every day , " except that the Teabaggers ' paranoid beliefs are There 's mild paranoia , Bader tells us , and more severe forms .
" A patient I saw spun tale after tale of slights , interpreted innocuous events as malignant , saw conspiracies everywhere , and always imputed malevolence to others ' motives . "
Does that ring a bell ?
Then so , I think , will this description of how paranoia works ( once again , the boldfacing is simply my own crude highlighting , and should be ignored by anyone who possesses basic reading skills : Bader provides striking cases of severely paranoid patients whose invented terrors he was able to trace back traumas they were unable to deal with .
Terrifying as the invented terrors were , they were somehow more manageable than the underlying ones , which had at least some basis in reality .
" The core truth about paranoia , " he writes , is that " it is an attempt to lessen unbearable feelings of self - blame and powerlessness .
" From Frank Rich's Sunday NYT column , The Axis of the Obsessed and Deranged , " he cites the finding that the Teabaggers , far from being experienced right - wing political types -- They turned to Glenn Beck , the , books by Ayn Rand and George Orwell , and radical right - wing websites .
Quoting this " crucial observation " of Rich's , " Many describe emerging from their research as if reborn to a new reality , " Bader goes on :
Of course lots of people experience those feelngs of guilt and helplessness , but only some turn to paranoia for relief .
Nobody really knows , Bader tells us , why different people make their different choices .
It may be that you 're nodding agreement but impatient .
Sure , you say , but have n't we sort of instinctively understood all of this ?
And where has understanding it gotten us ?
And that 's the point .
The first thing Bader insists we understand is that " the anxiety , helplessness , and pain that generate " the paranoid " storyline " " is not irrational or crazy .
"
" The ' problem , ' " says Bader , " is that Tea Party activists move from legitimate feelings and normal longings to paranoid political positions that are dangerous and cruel . "
But because the paranoid delusions have been put in place for powerful psychological and emotional reasons , The hardened cases may indeed be beyond our reach .
But , Bader argues , Easier said than done , you say ?
For sure .
And as I 'm sure Bader as a trained psychologist understands better than any of us , it 's pretty hard to help people who do n't want to be helped , whofor help .
But he has a nice line about the Teabaggers serving " as a spur to get our own house -- and movement -- in order . "
And his framing of the issue at least opens the possibility of creating some sort of path toward providing more reality - based solutions to people who surely do want help for the very real pain they 're in .

This is a simulated observation of a massive star viewed along the plane of the disk .
This visualization of dust emission traces the density and temperature of the gas cloud that surrounds the star .
The regions that are currently ionized ( in red ) and have been ionized in the past ( blue structures ) show how the nebula flickers .
The clouds of gas from which massive stars form will flickerlike a candle over the course of thousands of years , as the star 's radiationhits dense structures in the clouds , new simulations show .
One aspect of the formationof massive stars ?
those 10 to 100 times the mass of the sun ? has puzzledastronomers for decades :
How do they get so big without blowing away all thegas around them ?
All stars form from the collages of huge , spinning cloudsof gas .
Once the density and temperature of the nascent star are highenough , the new star begins to fuse hydrogen atoms into helium ?
the process ofnuclear fusion that fuels stars .
While smaller stars do n't begin burning untiltheir natal cloud has completely collapsed , most massive stars begin to shinewhile the clouds are still collapsing .
The ultraviolet light from those big stars ionizes thesurrounding gas ( ions are atoms with an electric charge ) , forming a nebula witha temperature of about 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit ( 10,000 degrees Celsius ) .
Suchintense radiation would be expected to blow the rest of the gas cloud away , which would cause the growth of the massive star to taper off .
But this was n' tthe case , researchers found .
Thomas Peters , a researcher at the University of Heidelbergin Germany , ran computer simulations of massive stars in the act of forming andfound out why the massive stars do n't blow away all the remaining gas .
His study found that the gasaround massive stars does not fall onto the star evenly , instead formingfilmentary concentrations where the gravity of the gas causes it to collect inclumps .
These filaments of gas absorb the star 's ultravioletradiation as it passes through , shielding the rest of the surrounding gas .
Theshielding explains how gas can continue to fall into the tar , as well as whyionized nebulas appear to so small , in the view of radio telescopes .
Thenebulas shrink back as they lose their ionization .
Over thousands of years , this shift makes it look as though the nebula were flickering like a candle .
The finding , detailed in the March 10 issue of TheAstrophysical Journal , has implications for how astronomers interpret the ageof massive stars .
" So far , these ionized nebulae were just thought to beexpanding bubbles of hot gas , and the measured size of these bubbles was usedby observers to infer the age of its central star , " Peters said .
" Ourresults are of particular importance because the simulations show that thereis , in fact , no direct relation between the size of the nebula and the age ofthe massive star , so long as the star is still growing .
This is the case over asignificant fraction of the total lifetime of a massive star . "
SAT SCORES are n’t everything .
But they can tell some fascinating stories .
Take 1,623 , for instance .
That ’s the average score of Asian - Americans , a group that Daniel Golden - editor at large of Bloomberg News and author of “ The Price of Admission ’ ’ - has labeled “ The New Jews . ’’
After all , much like Jews a century ago , Asian - Americans tend to earn good grades and high scores .
And now they too face serious discrimination in the college admissions process .
Notably , 1,623 - out of a possible 2,400 - not only separates Asians from other minorities ( Hispanics and blacks average 1,364 and 1,276 on the SAT , respectively ) .
The score also puts them ahead of Caucasians , who average 1,581 .
And the consequences of this are stark .
Princeton sociologist Thomas Espenshade , who reviewed data from 10 elite colleges , writes in “ No Longer Separate , Not Yet Equal ’’ that Asian applicants typically need an extra 140 points to compete with white students .
In fact , according to Princeton lecturer Russell Nieli , there may be an “ Asian ceiling ’ ’ at Princeton , a number above which the admissions office refuses to venture .
Emily Aronson , a Princeton spokeswoman , insists “ the university does not admit students in categories .
In the admission process , no particular factor is assigned a fixed weight and there is no formula for weighing the various aspects of the application . ’’
A few years ago , however , when I worked as a reader for Yale ’s Office of Undergraduate Admissions , it became immediately clear to me that Asians - who constitute 5 percent of the US population - faced an uphill slog .
They tended to get excellent scores , take advantage of AP offerings , and shine in extracurricular activities .
Frequently , they also had hard - knock stories : families that had immigrated to America under difficult circumstances , parents working as kitchen assistants and store clerks , and households in which no English was spoken .
But would Yale be willing to make 50 percent of its freshman class Asian ?
Probably not .
Indeed , as Princeton ’s Nieli suggests , most elite universities appear determined to keep their Asian - American totals in a narrow range .
Yale ’s class of 2013 is 15.5 percent Asian - American , compared with 16.1 percent at Dartmouth , 19.1 percent at Harvard , and 17.6 percent at Princeton .
“ There are a lot of poor Asians , immigrant kids , ’’ says University of Oregon physics professor Stephen Hsu , who has written about the admissions process .
“ But generally that story does n’t do as much as it would for a non-Asian student .
Statistically , it ’s true that Asians generally have to get higher scores than others to get in . ’’
In a country built on individual liberty and promise , that feels deeply unfair .
If a teenager spends much time studying , excels at an instrument or sport , and garners wonderful teacher recommendations , should he be punished for being part of a high - achieving group ?
Are his accomplishments diminished by the fact that people he has never met - but who look somewhat like him - also work hard ?
“ When you look at the private Ivy Leagues , some of them are looking at Asian - American applicants with a different eye than they are white applicants , ’’ says Oiyan Poon , the 2007 president of the University of California Students Association .
“ I do strongly believe in diversity , but I do n’t agree with increasing white numbers over historically oppressed populations like Asian - Americans , a group that has been denied civil rights and property rights . ’’
But Poon , now a research associate at the University of Massachusetts Boston , warns that there are downsides to having huge numbers of Asian - Americans on a campus .
In California , where passage of a 1996 referendum banned government institutions from discriminating on the basis of race , Asians make up about 40 percent of public university students , though they account for only 13 percent of residents .
“ Some Asian - American students feel that they lost something by going to school at a place where almost half of their classmates look like themselves - a campus like UCLA .
The students said they did n’t feel as well prepared in intercultural skills for the real world . ’’
But what do you do if you ’re an elite college facing tremendous numbers of qualified Asian applicants ?
At the 2006 meeting of the National Association for College Admission Counseling , a panel entitled “ Too Asian ? ’’ looked at the growing tendency of teachers , college counselors , and admissions officers to see Asians as a unit , rather than as individuals .
Hsu argues it ’s time to tackle this issue , rather than defer it , as Asians ’ superior performance will likely persist .
“ This does n’t seem to be changing .
You can see the same thing with Jews .
They ’ve outperformed other ethnic groups for the past 100 years . ’’
Which leaves us with two vexing questions :
Are we willing to trade personal empowerment for a more palatable group dynamic ?
And when - if ever - should we give credit where credit is due ?

Palin , Psy - Ops & ' Condescending ' Libs
In the 1980s , while a reporter for the Associated Press , I had the opportunity to chat over the phone with legendary CIA psy - war specialist Edward Lansdale .
A mutual friend had set up the contact , which I hoped might lead to a more formal interview .
Email
Printer friendly
Though that hope did n’t pan out – and Lansdale died in 1987 – I was struck by one thing that Lansdale told me about how he sold his propaganda message inside a target country .
He said the goal was n’t to plant a story in a publication that people knew to be under U.S. control , because their defenses would be up .
The trick , he said , was to plant propaganda in a publication that was perceived to be open and honest because the readers ’ defenses would be down and thus they would be more susceptible to the message .
In other words , they first had to be fooled about who controlled the outlet and what its biases were .
Given Lansdale ’s historic work in the Philippines and South Vietnam , he was referring to CIA psy - war operations in those and other foreign countries .
But the last several decades have seen many of those CIA - style techniques imported back into the United States , especially regarding how to get Americans to absorb political propaganda .
A key strategy of the Right has been to convince as many Americans as possible that the U.S. news media has a “ liberal bias , ” a canard that has stuck even though newspapers have been traditionally pro-Republican and most media outlets are owned by giant corporations reflecting the interests of wealthy individuals .
Still , over the past 30 years , the Right has spent tens of millions of dollars building anti-journalism attack groups dedicated to making the “ liberal bias ” case .
At the same time , the Right has invested billions of dollars in constructing its own vertically integrated media apparatus , reaching from print to radio to TV to the Internet .
The “ fair and balanced ” slogan of Fox News is itself a propaganda message , reminding viewers of the supposed “ liberal bias ” of the mainstream media .
Making the Right ’s strategy even more effective , the Left shifted its emphasis since the 1970s away from media and the so - called “ war of ideas . ”
The Left closed down promising new outlets , like Ramparts and Dispatch News ; sold off to neoconservatives and conservatives influential media properties , such as The New Republic and The Atlantic ; and watched as others failed for lack of money , such as Air America Radio .
The resulting media imbalance had another consequence : the mainstream media tilted further rightward to protect against career - threatening attacks from the Right .
The greatest danger to a journalist ’s career was to be tagged with the “ liberal ” label .
Easy Marks
Despite that reality , many rank - and - file Americans – having heard endlessly the assertions about “ liberal media bias ” – were on the alert to left - wing propaganda while lowering their defenses against right - wing propaganda .
Thus , they became easy marks for messaging that blamed America ’s problems on tax - and - spend Big Government and that equated “ freedom ” with letting Big Corporations do pretty much whatever they wanted .
With centrists , neocons and hard - line rightists dominating the American media landscape , progressives got the shortest of shrift in U.S. policy debates .
They had little opportunity to weigh in on foreign crises ( think back on the run-up to the war in Iraq when anti-war voices were ignored or dismissed as treasonous ) .
Nor did liberals get much of a chance to explain how government intervention was important for addressing domestic problems ( the dominant view of both mainstream and right - wing media in recent decades has been a faith in the “ magic of the marketplace ” ) .
While there are surely exceptions to this rule – a few liberal editorial writers are permitted here and there and MSNBC is experimenting with a liberal evening line - up – the truth is that the Left has become the favorite punching bag of American politics , absorbing endless blows and lacking the media counterpunch to hit back .
That fact was illustrated again on Sunday in the neoconservative Washington Post , which led its influential “ Outlook ” section with a giant headline “ Why are liberals so CONDESCENDING ? ”
The article by Gerard Alexander , a University of Virginia professor and the Bradley lecturer at the neocon American Enterprise Institute , lambasted liberals for taking pride in grounding their arguments in empirical data .
“ American liberals , to a degree far surpassing conservatives , appear committed to the proposition that their views are correct , self - evident , and based on fact and reason , while conservative positions are not just wrong but illegitimate , ideological and unworthy of serious consideration , ” Alexander wrote .
“ Indeed , all the appeals to bipartisanship notwithstanding , President Obama and other leading liberal voices have joined in a chorus of intellectual condescension . ”
The Post illustrated this remarkable attack on an entire wing of U.S political thought with photos of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , comedian Jon Stewart , blogger Markos Moulitsas and President Barack Obama .
Pelosi was quoted as saying that Republican congressional “ disruptions are occurring because opponents are afraid not just of differing views – but of the facts themselves . ”
Responding to Republican criticism , Obama was quoted as saying : “ That ’s factually just not true , and you know it ’s not true . ”
The Left ’s weak position in media could not have been better demonstrated than by seeing the neocon Washington Post – what the Right still calls the “ flagship ” of the “ liberal media ” – publishing a denunciation of liberals as “ condescending ” for daring to defend their proposals as anchored in facts .
Palin ’s Zinger Plus , the notion that neoconservatives and right - wingers are n’t condescending toward liberals and progressives is bizarre , after years and years of the Right ’s sneering attacks on “ lib - rhul ” proposals as “ communist ” and after neocons condemned Iraq War critics as “ America haters " and " blame - America - firsters . ”
One only needed to listen to former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin ’s speech on Saturday night to a Tea Party convention to realize how upside - down the Post ’s Outlook article was .
Palin ’s mocking of the American Left was typical of what can be heard daily across the AM radio dial , on Fox News , and from Republican politicians .
“ A year later , I 've got to ask the supporters of all that [ Obama agenda ] , how is that hopey - changey stuff working out for you ? ”
Palin said to gales of laughter .
Or you could have tuned in to the influential business channel CNBC on Monday and heard one of its top anchors , Larry Kudlow , denouncing “ wacko liberal ideas . ”
Yet , it is the American Left that has to defend itself against the charge of “ condescension ” for having tried to defend its ideas by arguing that they are based on fact and reason .
There is also the inconvenient truth that the Right has operated in a fantasy policy world for several decades to the detriment of the United States and , indeed , the planet .
Scientific evidence -- from evolution to climate change -- is dismissed out of hand in favor of faith - based arguments .
The same has been true of economics .
George H.W. Bush once correctly described Ronald Reagan ’s notion that tax cuts would generate more revenue to eliminate the federal deficit as “ voodoo economics . ”
When Reaganomics was reprised by George W. Bush in the last decade , his father ’s assessment was confirmed once more .
The younger Bush ’s reckless tax cuts , combined with the bipartisan deregulation of banks and other businesses , contributed to a decade in which – for the first time since the Great Depression – the United States experienced zero job growth .
Bush ’s policies also took the federal government from surpluses in Bill Clinton ’s last year to more than a $ 1 trillion deficit , while setting the stage for today ’s Great Recession .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Lessons from America ’s Lost Decade . " ]
Then , there were the neoconservative falsehoods about Iraq ’s WMD and Saddam Hussein ’s ties to al - Qaeda .
In 2002 - 03 , when a few brave souls dared dispute those neocon lies , the powerful neocons questioned the patriotism and even the sanity of the dissidents .
The Bush administration , aided and abetted by the Post ’s neocon editors , waged a years - long jihad against former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson and his CIA officer wife , Valerie Plame , for Wilson ’s criticism of Bush ’s case for war .
After all that history of abuse directed toward Americans who stood up for the truth , the Post ’s neocon editors now have opened up a new line of attack against liberals and progressives , accusing them of “ condescension ” for having the audacity to assert that their arguments are based on fact .
Alexander ’s article in the Post is , in essence , a fancily written version of the Right ’s “ populist ” anti-intellectualism .
Anyone who insists on checking out facts and applying reason must be an “ elitist . ”
That this “ condescending ” attack line against the Left is being trumpeted by the supposedly “ liberal ” Washington
Post makes it all the more powerful to many Americans .
Reagan ’s Heir Now , with the emergence of Sarah Palin as the latest heir to Ronald Reagan ’s legacy – and as a potential next President of the United States – it is clear that empiricism will be snowed under again by a blizzard of half - truths , emotional appeals , historical myths and nasty zingers .
Anyone who dares speak up for facts and reason will be portrayed as a pointy - headed intellectual out of touch with “ real Americans . ”
It was n’t an accident that Palin opened her speech to a Tea Party convention in Nashville , Tennessee , on Feb. 6 , by noting Reagan ’s 99th birthday .
Amid the sustained applause that greeted her , Palin said , “ I am so proud to be American .
Thank you .
Gosh .
Thank you .
Happy birthday , Ronald Reagan . ”
Beyond positioning herself as Reagan ’s ideological descendant , Palin put herself on the side of “ real people , not politicos . ”
She spoke up for “ commonsense , conservative principles ” and put the blame for all that was wrong in America on Obama and the Democrats , while accusing them of falsely blaming George W. Bush for the mess .
In hailing Scott Brown ’s Senate victory in Massachusetts as a “ shout - out revolution , ” she drew laughter by claiming that “ yet again , President Obama found some way to make this all about George Bush , ” adding : “ The only place that the Left has n't placed the blame is on their agenda .
So some advice for our friends on that side of the aisle .
That 's where you 've got to look because that 's what got you into this mess .
The Obama / Pelosi / Reid agenda will leave us less secure , more in debt and under the thumb of Big Government .
That is out of touch and is out of date .
And if Scott Brown is any indication , it is running out of time . ”

The American Right again has taken on the “ populist ” mantle of the plucky underdog facing down the “ elitist ” Obama and his arrogant entourage of House Speaker Pelosi , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , defenders of Big Government , not to mention the “ liberal ” news media .
In this narrative , Palin , the Fox News personalities and poor Rush Limbaugh are the real victims who must face the cruelty and condescension of an all - powerful , arrogant Left .
Whether or not Edward Lansdale would be proud that his psy - war theories are coming back to America to roost is n’t clear , but he would have recognized what the neocons and the Palinistas are up to .

Former George W. Bush economic advisor Keith Hennessey is tired of the Obama administration dragging its predecessor 's name through the mud .
So rather than simply imply or assert that President Obama 's fiscal record is worse than George W. Bush 's , like most conservatives do , Hennessey actually tries to make the argument that Obama 's policies are more profligate than Bush's .
I remember Bush 's fiscal policies , and the political environment that surrounded them , pretty well .
In the wake of the Bush administration 's collapse , its defenders have been mostly laying low , trying to make their man look good by taking passive - aggressive shots at his successor .
I 've been waiting for Bush 's loyalists to try to rewrite the past .
So consider this fisking the beatdown that was nine years in the making .
1. Hennessey begins by saying that the Bush administration got blindsided by optimistic budget projections :
It is true that 10 years ago we had a budget surplus of more than $ 200 billion , and that CBO projected surpluses “ stretching out toward the horizon . ”
When CBO built its budget baseline for 2001 , they had not yet accounted for the bursting of the late 90 ’s tech stock market bubble and the effect it would have on federal revenues .
Like families , businesses , and investors , CBO made a mistake : they projected future revenue growth that was never going to occur .
Critics of the Bush Administration hinge their comparative argument on this single mistaken budget projection which in hindsight analysts from both parties acknowledge was wildly inaccurate .
Here 's what actually happened .
Aaron Dykes & Alex Jones
Infowars.com
February 9 , 2010
In an urgent message on the systematic betrayal of the tea party , Alex Jones warns against the turncoats and deceivers flocking from the weakened GOP and FOX News wings to harness the populist uprising that briefly found life outside of the traditional two - party system .
Sarah Palin made more than headlines this past week– attempting a takeover of the tea party movement , backing GOP hack Rick Perry over a real & viable candidate , pitching for war on Iran and assessing Obama ’s weaknesses in 2012 .
Her presence as the keynote speaker at the ‘ Tea Party Nation ’ event this past weekend signaled a realignment of the once pro-Constitution tea party with the empty ideals of the Republican party , urging upset Americans to let go of their anger towards the two - party system and support a GOP platform once again .
Further , in traveling to Texas to stump for incumbent Governor Rick Perry after speaking under the Tea Party Nation banner , Palin is slighting the one real tea party candidate running in Texas– a rising Debra Medina who is insistent on shaking up the status quo and triumphing over party stooges Perry & Hutchinson .
As of today , Medina is reportedly only 4 points behind challenger Kay Bailey Hutchinson .
If no candidate gets 50 % , a run-off is forced between the top two candidates .
What ’s more , phony Palin fundamentally betrayed the sentiments of millions of Americans– whether at the tea parties or not– who have articulated their desire to scale down the Federal government and bring back troops from an unsustainable global U.S. empire .
In a stunning statement on FOX News , Palin suggested that ‘ if ’ Obama played ‘ the War Card ’ by starting a war with Iran , only then would he have a viable chance at reelection in 2012 .
With the obvious implication that she too is eyed for 2012 , Palin reinforced unconditional support for Israel ’s agenda and urged Obama towards the same end .
[ efoods ]
Palin proves to be yet another front for NeoCon aggression in the middle east .
Her senseless and deranged drumbeat for an Iranian War , like her support for torture and opposition to detainee rights , follows a recent column from Daniel Pipes lauding such a war as the only way to save Obama ’s presidency .
Palin ’s perceived ditziness is no excuse .
At the very best , Palin ’s confused - coloration between FOX - esque turncoats like Glenn Beck , Mike Huckabee and Rick Perry and ‘ grassroots ’ constitutionalists within the tea party movement demonstrates her flippant viewpoint and her naïveté .
However , like Glenn Beck , Sarah Palin is not clueless or wrong .
She too is a wolf in sheep ’s clothing – not a Libertarian , Constitutionalist , freedom - lover or populist .
Instead , both Beck and Palin are duplicitous and deceiving whores of the global establishment , practiced at fooling well - meaning followers into betraying their own interests .
Palin ’s presence at the forefront of GOP presidential hopefuls for 2012 gives insight into a dismal political field cynically weeded of any independent or level - minded candidates .
Instead , the system , which tricks the people again and again , favors a selection of potential successors guaranteed to be worse than the president before .
Who but Obama could follow the abuses of George W. Bush ?
Who could be worse than Sarah Palin after Obama ?
Who but Palin could allow a president as unpopular as Obama to think of digging in for another term ?
Are we destined to lose all we have as we are trapped between the Devil and the deep - blue sea , headed towards WWIII and an apocalyptic economic atmosphere ?
Hopefully not .
But as Alex notes , we do n’t have time to be fooled yet again by a political sideshow– a bait & switch– meant to volley between fundamentally - rotten Democrats and fundamentally - rotten Republicans .
Americans must rise above that tightly - controlled paradigm , take a deep breath , and root out the evil and corruption deep within the system before all is lost .

Ed. note : Authors Gever Tulley and Julie Spiegler 's Fifty Dangerous
Things ( you should let your children do ) builds on the premise that " dangerous " things we avoid are often eye - opening and educational .
One such dangerous thing : Cooking food in your dishwasher .

We 've examined using the dishwasher to poach salmon and clean potatoes in the past ; here 's another take on the unusual oven .
Advertisement
An oven is an insulated box with a heating element inside .
Looked at that way , is the dishwasher that much different ?
Sure it has spray arms for water and uses soap , but it is also insulated and has a heating element .
That makes it an oven — with a few extra features thrown in .

Cooking in the dishwasher is not much different than baking ; you just need to keep the food from getting soapy .
Here 's how to make dishwasher chicken , hot dogs , or vegetables :
…
Aluminum Foil
Raw Chicken , Hot Dogs , or Vegetables
Butter
Salt or Spices ( optional )
Meat Thermometer ( or Adult )
How to :
Prepare food .
Cut chicken into strips about 1 ⁄2 inch wide .
If you do n't like chicken , hot dogs , vegetables , or apples work just as well .
Place food in center of a sheet of foil .
Dab with butter and add salt or spices if you like .
Seal it up .
Fold up , then carefully roll the edges of the foil to create a watertight packet .
You can add another layer of foil if your foil is thin .
Place packet in top rack of dishwasher ( middle if you have three racks ) and finish loading the dish - washer with dirty dishes .
Do not let packet get punctured by the rack or any dishes .
Cook it .
Run the dishwasher on the hottest setting ( at or above 160 degrees F ) .
After the wash cycle finishes , make sure the dry cycle completes before opening .
Check it .
Carefully remove the foil packet from the dishwasher and examine for punctures .
Discard and try again with the next load of dishes if any holes are found .
Open the packet and check to make sure your chicken is thoroughly cooked .
Enjoy .
Toast goes particularly well with dishwasher chicken .
Note : Undercooked chicken can be unsafe to eat .
Check your food carefully before consuming .
Use a meat thermometer

Fifty Dangerous
Things explores the idea that many " dangerous " things that are interesting , eye - opening , enlightening or just plain fun !
And while there are aspects of danger in virtually everything we do , the trick is to learn how mastery actually minimizes danger .
Walking is dangerous when we start as babies , but we persevere and it becomes safe .
Next we learn to negotiate stairs .
Why stop there ?
Why not practice and become proficient at walking on the roof or walking on a tightrope ?
These are just a few of the Fifty Dangerous

Gen . David Petraeus said Tuesday of the ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' policy : ' This is not a sound bite issue . '
Petraeus open to ' do n't ask ' repeal
Gen . David Petraeus told the Senate Armed Services Committee Tuesday that he ’s willing to consider changing the military ’s ban on openly gay military service .
Asked by Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , who opposes changing the " do n’t ask , do n’t tell " policy , whether a thorough review was needed before the law could be repealed , the head of the U.S. Central Command that oversees the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan asked to read an 8 - minute statement outlining his thoughts .

“ This is not a sound - bite issue , ” Petraeus said .
Denied the opportunity to go on at length , the general kept his remarks brief .
“ I believe the time has come to consider a change to ‘ do n’t ask , do n’t tell , ’ ” Petraeus said , adding that it should be done carefully and include the review directed by Defense Secretary Robert Gates to assess the effects on recruiting , retention , morale and unit cohesion .
Petraeus did not release his full statement after Tuesday ’s hearing but could later , perhaps at another hearing .
The popular four - star Army general has been suggested by some Republicans as a potential presidential candidate in 2012 .
He 's denied such ambitions , but plans to speak this month at Saint Anselm College in Manchester , N.H. , in the state that has traditionally held the nation ’s first presidential primary .
Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) plans to introduce legislation to repeal the " do n't ask , do n’t tell " policy .
The first step in that process will take place Thursday , when the Senate Armed Services Committee holds an informational hearing on the issue .
Three former officers — former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Marine Gen. John Sheehan , former Air Force Maj. Michael Almy and former Navy Lt. Jenny Kopfstein — are scheduled to testify .
Video cameras were not the ubiquitous devices in 1986 that they are today , so the only video footage of the Space Shuttle Challenger most of us have seen are the live network broadcasts captured by the lenses of CBS and CNN .
Optometrist Dr. Jack Moss , however , was playing with his new Betamax camcorder that chilly January morning , and recorded the sad event from his front yard in Winter Haven , Florida , about 70 miles southwest of Cape Canaveral .
Moss had never shared the tape with the media or NASA , but a week before he died this past December , he fished it out of his attic and handed it over to the Space Exploration Archive , a non-profit organization in Louisville , Kentucky .
The Archive transferred the video to digital formats and released it to the public domain in time for the 24th anniversary of the disaster this past week .
“ That ’s trouble of some kind , George , ” says Moss , as the shuttle ’s single smoke plume suddenly expands and then splits into a Y - shape .
As Moss and other onlookers spend several moments contemplating if something had gone wrong , a neighbor checks the news inside his house , only to return and confirm “ It exploded ! ”

Towers Watson , a big benefits consulting firm , surveyed senior financial executives last year and found that two - thirds planned to decrease the stock portion of their companies ’ pension funds by the end of 2010 .
They typically said their stock allocations would shrink by 10 percentage points .
“ That ’s 10 times the shift we might see in any given year , ” said Carl Hess , head of Towers Watson ’s investment consulting business .
Economists have speculated that a truly seismic shift in pension investing away from stocks could be a drag on the market , but they say it would not be long - lasting .
Corporate America ’s change of heart is notable all on its own , after decades of resistance to anything other than returns like those of the stock markets .
But it ’s even more startling when compared with governments ’ continued loyalty to stocks .
When governments scale back on the domestic stocks in their pension portfolios these days , it is often just to make way for more foreign stocks or private equities , which are not publicly traded .
Government pension plans cannot beef up their bonds that mature many , many years from now without dashing their business models .
They use long - range estimates that presume high investment returns will cover most of the cost of the benefits they must pay .
And that , they say , allows them to make smaller contributions along the way .
Most have been assuming their investments will pay 8 percent a year on average , over the long term .
This is based on an assumption that stocks will pay 9.5 percent on average , and bonds will pay about 5.75 percent , in roughly a 60 - 40 mix .
( Corporate plans do their calculations differently , and for them , investment returns are a less important factor . )
The problem now is that bond rates have been low for years , and stocks have been prone to such wild swings that a 60 - 40 mixture of stocks and bonds is not paying 8 percent .
Many public pension funds have been averaging a little more than 3 percent a year for the last decade , so they have fallen behind where their planning models say they should be .
If we ’re lucky , Thursday ’s summit will turn out to have been the last act in the great health reform debate , the prologue to passage of an imperfect but nonetheless history - making bill .
If so , the debate will have ended as it began : with Democrats offering moderate plans that draw heavily on past Republican ideas , and Republicans responding with slander and misdirection .
Nobody really expected anything different .
But what was nonetheless revealing about the meeting was the fact that Republicans  who had weeks to prepare for this particular event , and have been campaigning against reform for a year  did n’t bother making a case that could withstand even minimal fact - checking .
It was obvious how things would go as soon as the first Republican speaker , Senator Lamar Alexander , delivered his remarks .
He was presumably chosen because he ’s folksy and likable and could make his party ’s position sound reasonable .
But right off the bat he delivered a whopper , asserting that under the Democratic plan , “ for millions of Americans , premiums will go up . ”
Wow .
I guess you could say that he was n’t technically lying , since the Congressional Budget Office analysis of the Senate Democrats ’ plan does say that average payments for insurance would go up .
But it also makes it clear that this would happen only because people would buy more and better coverage .
The “ price of a given amount of insurance coverage ” would fall , not rise  and the actual cost to many Americans would fall sharply thanks to federal aid .
The month of December was supposed to be a bright spot in the Treasury 's tax withholding calendar : after all taxes used to be the way this great nation funded its coffers until the Fed and Primary Dealers came along .
And with Wall Street bonuses presumably at record levels , the withholdings were expected to jump not only compared to December of last year , but to all Decembers .
Well , as is the norm with this administrations , these expectations never materialized , and instead rolling withholdings hit recent record lows .
The rolling twelve month individual tax witholdings in December dropped to a new multi- year low of $ 1.298 trillion ( an 8.2 % decline from last December ) .
Yet this was nothing compared to the company tax witholdings .
We thought November was bad at $ 99.2 billion .
December came in at a stunning $ 92.8 billion , 61.5 % lower then the LTM December 2008 number .
Record financial profits , record bonuses , and the Treasury and US taxpayers are none the wiser .
How this stacks up on a month over month basis is presented below : in December individual tax withholdings were $ 151.7 billion , a surprising 9.4 % reduction from December 2008 ( $ 166 billion ) , while corporate tax withholdings were down a whopping 16.1 % , at $ 39.8 billion .
The all time record profits on Wall Street have been insufficient to even meet last year 's tax collections , as Main Street has completely collapsed .
Now this is a budget deficit change you can truly sink you teeth into .

Readers of the Guardian know that this newspaper has been at the forefront of championing changes to our libel laws .
And with good reason .
As one of the leading proponents of investigative journalism , its lawyers have frequently appeared in the courtroom , defending its right to publish information which is in the public interest .
Unfortunately , the Guardian and other media outlets have too often found themselves on the losing side of the battle .
Our current libel laws , cobbled together over decades of legal practice , have sometimes proven to be a disincentive against investigating and reporting the things that matter to our democracy .
This is an issue that has been growing in importance , and urgency , over the past few years .
Most recently , we 've seen concerns about the number of costly defamation cases against respected scientists , researchers and writers .
These developments have been a matter of great concern to the government , and myself personally , and we 've already implemented immediate actions to reform the system , such as reducing the success fees lawyers can charge for " no win , no fee " cases from 100 % of costs to 10 % , a figure which is much fairer and more proportionate .
And in January the Ministry of Justice established the libel working group , including media and legal representatives , free speech campaigners , and members of the scientific and academic communities .
Their report , published this week , makes some useful proposals .
Together with the responses we received to our recent consultation on defamation and the internet , and the recent report of the department of culture , media and sport select committee , we will use these recommendations to develop further reforms which will protect freedom of expression while continuing to ensure that individuals who are the subject of defamatory reporting have access to justice .
Today we 've announced that , if re-elected , we 'll be pushing ahead with action on a number of issues .
We want to make changes as speedily as possible , but in some cases this may need legislation .
We have therefore signalled our intention to introduce a draft Libel Reform Bill in the next Parliament .
The main areas we are looking at are threefold .
Firstly , we 'll be introducing a single publication rule , under which a defamation claim will have to be brought within one year from the date of the original publication .
The interests of people who are defamed will be protected by giving the court the power to extend this period where necessary .
This element will specifically tackle the problem of internet publishing , and the way the law currently allows defendants to be taken to court every time allegedly libellous content is accessed online .
This causes great uncertainty , as publishers are effectively subject to open - ended liability .
Clearly , our current laws are not fit to handle the realities of the 21st century media landscape and internet use – this change will address that .
Secondly , the Bill will include provisions to prevent the growth of so - called " libel tourism " , which some believe has been increasing rapidly in recent years .
I 'm asking the Civil Procedure Rule to consider tightening the rules where the court 's permission is required to serve defamation cases outside England and Wales .
This will help head off inappropriate claims at the earliest stage and stop them from reaching court .
Finally – and perhaps most importantly for the media – we 'll be looking at whether to introduce a statutory defence to protect publications that are in the public interest .
A statutory public interest test which is clearly and simply expressed could help ensure that the work done by journalists , scientists and NGOs to investigate and inform the public can continue – while also preserving the right we all have to protect our reputations .
These changes build on the discussions that have taken place over the last two months among the members of the libel working group , all of whom have made a very valuable contribution to the debate .
This is only the start of the reform process .
We 'll continue to consult with the media and legal professions , NGOs and the public as we develop our thinking further .
The English legal system is something we should all be proud of .
Fair and open court proceedings , access to justice for all , and equality before the law are some of the basic tenets of our democracy , and these need to be valued and protected .
The last thing I want to see is our libel law being used to bring our legal system 's reputation into disrepute .
From people bringing their claims in English courts despite there being little or no link to this country , to the high costs of defending a court case discouraging journalists and editors from pursuing and publishing stories the public should know about – these have a chilling effect on freedom of expression and are matters of concern to us all .
At the same time , we also need to ensure that there is not a publishing " free - for - all " , when articles of no public interest and little factual accuracy are produced , causing harm and hurt to those involved .
We do need strong , effective libel laws to protect the reputations of those who fall into this category .
The steps the government has announced today will help restore a fair balance between these two needs .

PARIS ( Reuters ) - Mounir Moufarrige , president and chief executive of French fashion house Emanuel Ungaro , has resigned just over two months after a widely panned collection by American actress Lindsay Lohan .
Mounir Moufarrige , former Chief Executive of French fashion house Emmanuel Ungaro , speaks during an interview with Reuters in Paris February 22 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jacky Naegelen
Ungaro said in a statement on Wednesday that Moufarrige would continue to advise the company , which has gone through several stylists and two chief executives since couturier Emanuel Ungaro retired in 2004 .
A spokeswoman for Ungaro said Moufarrige ’s departure had nothing to do with Lohan .
“ Mounir Moufarrige has withdrawn from serving as president of Emanuel Ungaro in order to devote more time to his other businesses , namely , in the watch and jewelry industry , ” the statement said .
Moufarrige hired Lohan as artistic adviser for the spring / summer 2010 show in October .
His stated aim was to give the aging brand an “ electric shock ” that would jolt sales and pull in young , star - struck fashionistas .
Lohan had only weeks to put the collection together , advising chief designer Estrella Archs .
The resulting buttocks - exposing mini-dresses and heart - shaped nipple pasties were not deemed a success by fashion critics .
While fans of Paris couture were aghast , lamenting the demise of a legendary fashion house , Moufarrige voiced optimism after the show and pointed to global interest in Lohan and her style .
The Ungaro spokeswoman said that Lohan would stay on in her role , as would Archs .
As president of Chloe , Moufarrige replaced Karl Lagerfeld with a then - 25 - year - old Stella McCartney , who would went on to become a success with critics as well as the buying public .
Emanuel Ungaro , founded in 1965 , was acquired by American high - tech entrepreneur Asim Abdullah in 2005 from Italian house Ferragamo .
Moufarrige joined the company in 2006 , having previously worked at Richemont .
Marie Fournier , who used to work at Dior in licensing and was recently involved in business development at Ungaro , was appointed general manager , the company said in a statement .
ATHENS : Before he took up his post as special United Nations envoy to Cyprus , Alexander Downer enthusiastically declared that he would '' fix up '' the ' ' untidy ' ' problem of reuniting Greeks and Turks on the island .
Almost 18 months later , the former Australian foreign affairs minister has discovered - like so many before him - that it might not be so easy .
He faces calls for his resignation amid accusations of favouritism and complaints he does not spend enough time on the island .
He dismisses the censure - levelled mostly by Greek Cypriots - as ' ' part of the political colour ' ' .
'' Because this is a conflict situation there are always people who will have different views , '' he said in a telephone interview from Cyprus 's divided capital , Nicosia .
The United States and Russia have agreed to a new nuclear arms treaty that will be signed April 8 in Prague , Czech Republic , President Obama announced Friday after speaking with his Russian counterpart .
The treaty substantially cuts the nuclear weapons that the United States and Russia will deploy and will significantly reduce missiles and launchers , Obama said .
It follows a 1991 treaty that expired in December and about which the United States and Russia have been negotiating .
“ In many ways , nuclear weapons represent both the darkest days of the Cold War , and the most troubling threats of our time , ” Obama said .
“ Today , we have taken another step forward in leaving behind the legacy of the 20th century while building a more secure future for our children . ”
Obama also said the treaty would show that the United States and Russia , the world ’s major nuclear powers , intended to lead on the issue .
“ By upholding our own commitments under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , we strengthen our global efforts to stop the spread of these weapons , and to ensure that other nations meet their own responsibilities , ” the president said .
Obama said the treaty was part of his effort to improve relations with Russia .
“ Since I took office , I have been committed to a “ reset ” of our relations with Russia , ” Obama said .
“ When the United States and Russia can cooperate effectively , it advances the mutual interests of our two nations , and the security and prosperity of the wider world .
We have worked together on Afghanistan .
We have coordinated our economic efforts through the G - 20 .
We are working together to pressure Iran to meet its international obligations .
And today , we have reached agreement on one of my administration ’s top priorities - a pivotal new arms control agreement , ” he said .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , who also attended Obama ’s briefing , said the agreement shows “ deep and substantive cooperation on a matter of vital importance ” with Russia and that “ patient principled diplomacy can advance our national interests . ”
Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who addressed reporters along with Clinton , said the reductions would not hurt the United States .
According to the White House , the agreement would require both Russia and the United States to reduce their long - range warheads to 1,500 .
This is 74 % lower that the START number in 1991 and 30 % lower than the limit of the 2002 Moscow Treaty .
Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev discussed the treaty in a telephone conversation Friday morning .
It was their 14th direct meeting or phone call on the issue .
Prague was chosen for the treaty signing to commemorate the anniversary of Obama ’s April 5 , 2009 , speech in the Czech capital where he offered his vision for reducing global nuclear arsenals .
“ I am pleased that almost one year to the day after my last trip to Prague , the Czech Republic -- a close friend and ally of the United States -- has agreed to host President Medvedev and me on April 8th , as we sign this historic treaty , ” Obama said .
The treaty represents part of his administration plans to deal with nuclear weapons , Obama said .
“ The following week , I look forward to hosting leaders from over forty nations here in Washington , as we convene a summit to address how we can secure vulnerable nuclear materials so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists .
And later this spring , the world will come together in New York to discuss how we can build on this progress , and continue to strengthen the global non-proliferation regime . “
The treaty will require Senate approval .
Earlier this week , Obama met with Sens. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) and Richard Lugar ( R - Indiana ) to discuss passage .

A problem with treating somebody with a dual diagnosis has been that this type of individual often finds it hard to accept the need for dual diagnosis drug rehabilitation .
All addicts suffer from denial as this is a symptom of the condition , but a breakthrough can often occur when the addict can get past their denial and see the need for help .
This moment of insight is often not as easy for the person with dual diagnosis to reach .
Their other mental health issue can seriously detract from their ability for any type of insight into their own behaviour ; for instance those with bipolar and schizophrenia usually have poor judgement .
If the individual is able to recognise the need for dual diagnosis drug treatment then there is far less hope of it being successful .
When you ca n’t see a problem you are unlikely to put much effort into fixing this problem .
In fact for many people with a dual diagnosis it is hard to let go of the belief that their addiction is helping them cope with their other problems ; this may have in fact been the case in the beginning , but the only place that addiction leads is misery .
When it comes to dual diagnosis drug rehabilitation the traditional methods for treating the addiction might be counterproductive .
This will of course depend on the severity of the other mental health issue .
Update : Man to stand trial
SPARTA -- Neighbors say Thomas Alan Heugel presented himself as an ordained minister and emergency medical technician who helped people by performing minor procedures , like body piercing or removing skin tags .
Authorities say his medical dabbling crossed into the criminal , and accuse him of performing circumcisions without a medical license on adult men .
" He needs to be taken off the streets , " said a man who identified himself as Heugel 's former boyfriend .
The man , who did not want to be identified , said he witnessed Heugel , 56 , performing the surgery on men and reported the Sparta man to the police .
Heugel was arraigned Wednesday in Kent County District Court , charged with Health Profession - Unauthorized Practice and Occupational Code- Performance Occupation Without a License .
If he 's convicted , the felony unauthorized practice charge has a maximum penalty of four years in prison .
Kent County sheriff 's investigators say Heugel was performing circumcisions on men , in addition to massages and body piercing .
Heugel allegedly passed himself off as a medical doctor to his patients and performed the procedures at his home on Cherry Street .
" I do n't know what the attraction is , " sheriff 's Lt. Kevin Kelley said of the procedure .
" I do n't know , and the detective does n't know . "
Kelley said Heugel advertised on Craig 's List and a Web site called " adam4adam.com " and then wore what looked like uniforms worn by a medical professional .
Heugel also administered a local anesthetic in at least one case , according to Kelley .
None of the known procedures appear to have been botched , police say .
Heugel was released on a $ 5,000 personal recognizance bond .
He could not be reached for comment , and no one answered the door at his home .
Neighbor Maria Horn , 53 , says she used to be Heugel 's friend , but later took the side of his ex-boyfriend when the two split up .
She said he represented himself as an ordained minister , an emergency medical technician and had vehicles modified to look like vintage police cruisers .
After losing his job as a car salesman , Horn said Heugel began performing the circumcisions , including one procedure on a man from Canada .
She said he would also remove skin-tags and pierce ears , in addition to other activities .
Police worry there may be other victims and ask anyone with information to call Detective Ed Kolakowski at 336-5179

" The beginning of a revolution is in reality the end of a belief " Gustave LeBon +++ VISITORS PLS CLICK blog title ABOVE for today 's page +++ -...oh and make sure to click on the links within the stories for substantiating info
In this post I would like to talk about what has in the last few months truly inspired my mind to believe and understand that life is truly what we all make it .
We are responsible for all we are and do in life .
That ’s right I will say it again it is your state of mind that can make you who you are or want it to be in the future .
That being said , I would like to touch briefly on the people that seek to take your power and energy away from you .
Recently my wife was speaking with a women as to helping her achieve her life ’s goals and gaining confidence while doing so in her life goals .
My wife is the sweetest and most giving person I have ever met and she wears her heart on her sleeve .
Many times giving of herself to others at the cost of her own time .
Now you may say I am judging her so kind because I am her husband .
However that is further from the truth .
It is that untamed heart and giving spirit that has drawn me to her .
Now that being said .
Yes , as her husband I see many things others do not or will ever see or understand .
I see the things that most by speaking for the first time with my wife or seeing her will never take the time to learn or find in her .
However it is this above all that makes me see where my wife in many ways is truly a god given angle placed on the earth .
Because she has never thought harm or wished ill will to any who have tried to destroy that wonderful quality that makes her so loved by family and friends alike .
In the business we are in and have chosen for our life long desires .
It is a sad fact that many people we seek to mentor or guide will be at a point in life where they are uncomfortable with others or being told there is truly a better way to be successful or a new life .
These people are looking for the fight or catch that will cost them money time and above all work to achieve what many of these type people are hoping just falls in their laps .
They are of the mind that if work or any kind of true effort is involved than they may not or would not be willing to invest in themselves .
It is this type of person that my wife was speaking to the other day .
The women was clearly not willing to see any faults of her own .
While seeing the faults in others so clearly .
In her responses she was seeking to destroy or rent space in my wife ’s mind and take away my wife ’s power by speaking negatively and things that really had nothing to do with the betterment of my wife ’s life or the goals of our success in helping others .
It is for this reason that my wife straight away began her self talk and removed this negative person from her focus and vision .
It is one of the first things we learn in Mentoring for free .
Keep your thoughts on your dreams and goals , and keep them off of the things and people that cause you stress and negative emotions .
This is not easy , but it ’s very important .
By self talking my wife was able to maintain her adult response and keep her power of positive mind .
When others seek to destroy you or say you are not as good or able to achieve your desires and goals .
Remember that it is how you respond to them that can either break your spirit and empower them or let what they speak out of their mouths to just be what it is , rubbish and negative energy vampire draining emotions .
Removing them straight away from your space and your light of the positive keeping your power and gaining more by understanding that you are ok just the way you are and it is none of your business as to what others think or speak of you as to what you think and understand of who you are yourself .
Preserve your emotional energy by staying calm and positive in difficult situations rather than allowing yourself to be upset or angry .
Be above the realm of the so called thinking patterns as to reactions hoped to have been gained by these type people .
Take ample time to rest completely so you can recharge your physical and emotional batteries .
Well drinking lots of water to hydrate and refresh the mind and soul .
Before going on to the next person you seek to help or mentor too , so as not to carry on the weakened energy to them .
The better rested you are , the more effective you will be in your business and relationships with friends and prospective people really needing a helping hand .

Rep. James Clyburn ( D - S.C. ) said ' the jeering , the people out there carrying nasty signs and spitting on people ' reminded him of the 1960s , when he was subject to abuse as a black civil rights protester in the South .
Clyburn decries lack of decorum
House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn said Monday that the breakdown in House decorum over the weekend — accompanied by protesters outside the Capitol hurling insults and spitting on a black lawmaker — is a “ festering sore ” that runs back to last September , when a Republican yelled “ You lie ” at President Barack Obama .
Clyburn said “ the jeering , the people out there carrying nasty signs and spitting on people ” reminded him of the 1960s , when he was subject to abuse as a black civil rights protester in the South .
And Clyburn said the fact that a Texas Republican yelled “ baby killer ” inside the House chamber itself as a Democrat spoke Sunday night and Republicans “ egged on ” protesters in the House gallery earlier in the day is “ what endangers this society . ”

“ I see a larger breakdown , ” said Clyburn , who pressed unsuccessfully last September for his South Carolina colleague , Republican Rep. Joe Wilson , to go to the well of the House and apologize to the full chamber for insulting Obama .
“ I said that ’s what this would lead to , and we saw it ” Sunday , Clyburn said .
“ If something is not done , it is going to grow , fester like a sore and then run , ” he said .
“ That ’s what ’s going to happen .
“ It ’s a festering sore that ’s taking place out here and ... disrupting the decorum of the House of Representatives .
That , to me , is what endangers this society . ”
The line “ fester like a sore and then run ” comes from a Langston Hughes poem that ’s also invoked in the Lorraine Hansberry play “ Raisin in the Sun , ” about a black family on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s .
Clyburn himself is a product of the civil rights movement in his native South Carolina , and his comments reflect an underlying racial current in the bitter health care debate .
Rep. Emanuel Cleaver ( D - Mo. ) was spat on by a protester while walking to the Capitol on Saturday .
Another protester yelled a racial epithet at Rep. John Lewis ( D - Ga . ) .
Clyburn himself has been subject to racist mail , including an anonymous fax sent to his South Carolina office in the past week , addressed to “ James the Slimy N — — Clyburn ” and with a drawing of a hangman ’s noose and crude gallows .
“ That is about as derogatory a statement as you can make in our society , and you ’re going to tell me that ’s about health care ? ”
Clyburn said of the spitting incident involving Cleaver .
“ Nobody can tell me that ’s about health care . ”
It clearly still rankles Clyburn that Wilson apologized to the president through White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and not directly .
“ This indirect stuff — I understand what that is .
I ’ve seen it all my life , ” Clyburn said .
“ How the hell do you apologize to the president [ by ] talking to Rahm Emanuel ?
He does not have enough respect for Barack Obama to apologize to him . ”
Clyburn said he also wants Rep. Randy Neugebauer ( R - Texas ) , who admits to yelling “ it ’s a baby killer ” when Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) was speaking about the health care reconciliation bill Sunday , to apologize to the full chamber .
“ I do n’t think they [ Republicans ] have enough respect for the House to do it , ” Clyburn said , but both parties then risk more erosion in the chamber .
He and other Democrats have pointed to a highly unusual incident Sunday afternoon , when Republicans on the floor rose and clapped in support of anti-health - care - bill protesters being removed from the visitors gallery by Capitol police .
“ Two people [ were ] in the balcony jeering , disrupting the proceedings on the floor .
Then they stand up and clap for them , 10 or 12 of them , might have been more , ” Clyburn said .
“ I saw them applauding — they were not behind the rail .
They were in the rows . ”
“ Those people up there were violating the rules , but they were being egged on by people down [ on the floor ] who were violating House rules . ”
Natalie McAnulla says she fell victim to “ Big Brother - style government intervention ” when authorities last week raided her downtown Lawrence store , prompting her to stop selling the controversial synthetic marijuana , K2 .
She questions whether it would have happened had she just kept her mouth shut .
Instead , McAnulla had spoken out to legislators against two state bills that would make the substance illegal .
“ Only weeks after my testimony was given , my store was raided by the FDA , KBI and local law enforcement officials .
Another business owner testified , and his warehouse was also raided , ” said McAnulla , owner of Sacred Journey , 1103 Mass .
“ There must be a dozen other places in the area where these same products are sold … but because these store owners did not stand up to the law enforcement community , their stores were not investigated . ”
Agents from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , which led the raid , have not explained why they took items form the store or from a warehouse in Oskaloosa , home to Bouncing Bear Botanicals , which supplied different items to the Lawrence store , including K2 .
“ The FDA cannot discuss an ongoing investigation , ” Tom Gasparoli , FDA spokesman , said Friday .
FDA and Kansas Bureau of Investigation officials seized McAnulla ’s entire supply of K2 — which produces a high - like effect if inhaled — in addition to many other plants and herbs .
McAnulla said government agents also froze her bank accounts .
“ I ’m left to run a store on nothing , ” she said .
McAnulla is trying to draw a crowd of 500 to a rally she ’s hosting at 2 p.m. Saturday in South Park , just down the street from her store .
She ’s protesting how she ’s been treated .
“ If I can be placed at the edge of extinction by government officials just because I had the courage to speak out against oppressive legislation , then it can happen to anyone , ” McAnulla said .
Officials arrested Bouncing Bear owner Jonathan Sloan , and he was charged with eight felony drug offenses , including the unlawful manufacturing and distribution of controlled substances .
Sloan was released from Jefferson County Jail on $ 150,000 bond , pending an April 13 preliminary hearing .

PERESTROIKA , the series of political and economic reforms I undertook in the Soviet Union in 1985 , has been the subject of heated debate ever since .
Today the controversy has taken on a new urgency  not just because of the 25th anniversary , but also because Russia is again facing the challenge of change .
In moments like this , it is appropriate and necessary to look back .
We introduced perestroika because our people and the country ’s leaders understood that we could no longer continue as we had .
The Soviet system , created on the precepts of socialism amid great efforts and sacrifices , had made our country a major power with a strong industrial base .
The Soviet Union was strong in emergencies , but in more normal circumstances , our system condemned us to inferiority .
This was clear to me and others of the new generation of leaders , as well as to members of the old guard who cared about the country ’s future .
I recall my conversation with Andrei Gromyko , the foreign minister , a few hours before the plenary meeting of the Central Committee that elected me as the party ’s new general secretary in March 1985 .
Gromyko agreed that drastic change was needed , however great the risk .
I am often asked whether my fellow leaders of perestroika and I knew the full scope of what we had to do .
The answer is yes and no  not fully and not immediately .
What we had to abandon was quite clear : the rigid ideological , political and economic system ; the confrontation with much of the rest of the world ; and the unbridled arms race .
In rejecting all that , we had the full support of the people ; those officials who later turned out to be die - hard Stalinists had to keep silent and even acquiesce .
Ayatollah Khamenei criticised US support for anti-government protesters Iran 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has used a televised Iranian New Year address to accuse the US of plotting against the country .
He said the US government could not " talk about peace and friendship and at the same time plot and plan sedition " .
His words come a day after President Barack Obama sent a new year video message to Iranians saying Washington 's offer of dialogue still stood .
However , the Iranian leader did not refer directly to Mr Obama 's message .
In his address in the north - eastern city of Mashhad , broadcast on state TV , Ayatollah Khamenei said the US might have been making friendly overtures but its policies showed its intentions were different .
" Eight months after the elections they took the worst possible stance , " he said .
" The president called those rioters and saboteurs ' civil rights activists ' . "
Washington has criticised the Iranian authorities for cracking down on protesters in a series of large - scale clashes following a disputed presidential election last June .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
In his video message , Mr Obama said the Iranian government had " chosen to isolate itself " but that the US still wanted justice and dignity for Iranians , and less internet censorship .
" Even as we continue to have differences with the Iranian government , we will sustain our commitment to a more hopeful future for the Iranian people . " he said .
It was the second such recording sent by the US president for the festival of Nowruz , a 12 - day holiday celebrating the beginning of the New Year on the Persian calendar .
Last year he became the first US leader for decades to reach out directly to Iran 's people and government , offering a " new beginning " in US - Iranian relations .
But since then , Mr Obama 's offers of engagement over Iran 's nuclear ambitions have been largely spurned , and US efforts to impose new sanctions have been slow to find wide support from UN members .

Last saturday I came back from the Krita Hackfest 2010 , after being eight days in Deventer .
It was a really long , intense and amazing sprint .
The sprint started on friday when almost the whole Krita team came together .
It was nice to see everyone again and also meet with Vera , Adam and Peter who I have n’t met before .
We also got some lovely Krita t- shirts .
Creating a vision
The biggest part of Saturday was the vision session .
Even though Krita existed for quite a long time it never really had a vision .
Over time and with different developer teams the overall direction of Krita changed from being a GIMP replacement into a more painting oriented application .
As a result we now have a vision ( Peter , Boudewijn and Cyrille blogged about it ) which focusses Krita on being a sketching and painting application .
It was quite surprising how many comments the blog posts triggered .
They covered the whole range from “ Pure awesomeness ” to “ very disappointed ” .
I think it shows that on hand the Krita is going into the right direction , but there is also some interest in a Krita based photo manipulation application .
Fortunately almost everything in Krita is a plugin , so photo oriented features can continue as plugins even when they are not part of the main Krita package .
Depending on developer interest there might even be another application based on Krita technology in the future .
Once the switch to git is done it should also be easier to maintain these things .
Development
As Boudewijn already wrote in this weeks Last week in Krita we spend the rest of the week on improving stability and performance .
We also implemented several usability improvements that we discussed during the weekend .
I spend Sunday evening and Monday morning on replacing the old algorithm for brush outline .
Now the brush outline works correctly even when zoomed and is a bit faster when moving the cursor .
The code is now shared with the selection visualization too .
After that I continued with the paintop cleanup .
Creating a new paintop in Krita is now very easy .
A simple paintop needs only two classes ( settings widget and the paintop itself ) and Lukáš demonstrated that you can write a new paintop in few of minutes .
Besides the cleanup I continued the work on the paintop presets , which can now show images that are cut out from the new scratchpad that Boudewijn created .
The screenshot below shows the preset chooser with the scratchpad .
Cyrille also did some nice work to reduce the size of the presets , so that they are mostly just a few kilobyte big even with the preview image .
Another cool things that we got out of the discussion on the weekend was the design for a new slider to replace KDoubleNumInput with a tablet friendly widget .
After Boudewijn blogged about it Justin Noel created a very nice widget for us .
After doing some small adjustments like double and exponential support the slider is now being integrated into Krita .
Visiting the Durian team
On thursday we visited the Durian team in Amsterdam .
This was one of my highlights in this sprint .
Ton Roosendaal showed us the Blender Institute , which was much bigger than I had expected .
We attended one of the weekly meetings where every artist and developer show the work in the last week .
In about two hours we saw some really amazing stuff like the the face of main character Sintel and some early dragon scences .
I ’m sure that the final movie will be fantastic .
After that we went to a nice
Thai restaurant nearby , where we had lots of inspiring discussions .
If you are interested in digital painting another DVD might be interesting : David Revoy , who does the concept art for Durian , creates a training course that can be pre-ordered from the Blender shop ( Preview here ) .
Thanks !
The sprint was so much fun and such a nice time .
My biggest thanks go to Boudewijn , Irina and their family for the amazing work they put into this sprint .
Many thanks also to the Durian team for the opportunity to have a look at their work .
Good luck with the rest of your project !
And of course to KDE e.V and the community which made this sprint possible .

I 'm writing an article on testing Perl 5.12.0 RC 1 for Perl Pub , and my life is much easier thanks to a handful of projects and developers .
Thank you to :
local : : lib , for supporting per-project module installation directories .
I have the system Perl , Perl 5.10.1 , and now Perl 5.12.0 RC 1 installed on this test server , and they do n't interfere with each other .
That 's handy !
CPAN ::SQLite , for making the CPAN installation process easier .
Using a SQLite index is faster and more frugal with memory , especially when I have a pile of distributions to install to test with the software I want to test .
Module : : Install , even though I gripe about the software frequently and had to work around a confusing bootstrapping issue , it 's worked well since that point to install the software I care about for the project .
Parallel building and testing for Perl 5 itself , as it sped up the installation and testing process for the RC .
( Of course , I went to lunch during that phase , but still .... )
The new CPAN configuration system , which did n't require me to answer a lot of questions to configure a CPAN mirror and installation system .
I 'm definitely doing something more complicated than the default installation of Perl 5 , but my input in the process has been to fix things that definitely needed human intervention , not to babysit the process to make decisions where the defaults were fine .
This is a definite improvement over last time I had to manage several parallel installations of different Perl 5 versions .
Thanks to everyone who 's contributed to these projects .
Update : Chris Prather pointed out App :: perlbrew , which would have made my life easier a day ago .
See his Brewing Up a Storm for more information .
John Hicklenton finished his last book the day before he travelled to Zurich A respected graphic artist known for characters such as Judge Dredd has died at the Swiss - based assisted suicide centre Dignitas , it has been revealed .
John Hicklenton , 42 , who lived in Brighton , died at Dignitas on 19 March following a 10 - year fight with multiple sclerosis .
He was best known for his work in cult British comic 2000 AD .
Mr Hicklenton 's agent , Adrian Weston , described him as a " clear - sighted and visionary " person .
He was a strident MS campaigner and appeared in an award - winning television documentary called Here 's Johnny that charted his battle with the condition .
' Great privilege '
In the feature , he said : " Drawing is my walking now , I run with it , I fly with it .
" It 's keeping me alive .
I have a thing with it .
I can't wait to get a piece of paper with a pen because it's what I can control .
" I have n't got MS when I 'm looking at my pictures and I have n't got it when I 'm drawing them either .
It gives me an ability to express that fear . "
Mr Weston said : " He was one of the most clear - sighted and visionary people I have ever met .
" Having worked with him was one of the greatest privileges of my professional life . "
He said that Mr Hicklenton completed his last book , 100 Months , the day before he travelled to Zurich .
The MS Trust said : " John was best known for his work on comic 2000 AD and for illustrating characters such as Judge Dredd , but he also led a high - profile campaign for better rights for people with MS .
" In 2008 , his documentary on his battle with the disease , Here 's Johnny , received Grierson awards for Best Newcomer and Best Arts Documentary .
" The fact that John Hicklenton was prepared to use his fame to raise awareness of a condition so often overlooked by the media , and to wage his personal war on MS so publicly is something that is greatly appreciated by people in the MS community . "

Protesters say the demonstrations are peaceful but the IDF disagrees
The Israeli Defence Force has barred Israelis and foreigners from two West Bank villages , the scene of protests against Israel 's " separation wall " .
Soldiers have posted flyers declaring areas around the villages of Bilin and Nilin are " closed military zones " .
The restriction applies to the areas every Friday , the day that protests are held , for the next six months .
Activists have been protesting against the barrier for five years in what they say are mostly peaceful demonstrations .
But the Israeli Defence Force says it considers the protests to be " violent and illegal " .
Israel says the barrier was established to stop Palestinian suicide bombers entering from the West Bank .
But Palestinians point to its route , winding deep into the West Bank around Israeli settlements - which are illegal under international law - and say it is a way to grab territory they want for their future state .
In 2004 , the International Court of Justice in The Hague issued an advisory ruling that the barrier was illegal and should be removed where it did not follow the Green Line , the internationally recognised boundary between the West Bank and Israel .
' Inciters '
Around 100 members of the security forces have been injured policing the demonstrations , a spokesman said .
" Every week violent , illegal riots take place in the area of Nilin and Bilin , during the course of which members of the security forces are wounded and heavy damage is caused to the security fence and to public property , " a statement from the IDF said .
" In an effort to prevent the inciters of these riots from reaching the area in which the riots take place , three weeks ago , OC Central Command signed an order designating the area between the fence and the villages of Nilin and Bilin as a closed military zone . "
The statement said residents of the villages were exempt from the order .
Protests at the " separation barrier " , a fence between Palestinian land and Israeli settlements , had attracted young Israelis and peace activists from around the world .
Some demonstrations had also been attended by stone - throwing Palestinian youths .
Israeli security services have fired tear gas , stun grenades , rubber bullets and on occasion live rounds at protesters .
There have been two fatalities among protesters and an American peace activist suffered brain damage after being hit by a teargas canister .
Remember E-cards ?
I used to love sending E - cards to my friends and family members during the holidays and for special occasions .
It was a fast , free and efficient way to get in touch with them and share my love without having to worry about postage and writing dozens of individual letters .
Facebook gifts should be used for the same purposes as E - cards .
They are to remind your friends that you are thinking of them and wish them well on specific occasions .
Unfortunately , several Facebook users are abusing this feature and destroying the value and the sentiment of gifts .
If you send Facebook gifts dozens of times per week and leave the generic “ I got it just for you ” message , you diminish the sentiment of gift giving .
Essentially , you are just spamming the walls of your Facebook friends .
I understand that as online marketers it ’s hard to keep in close contact with the hundreds and thousands of connections we ’ve made via social media outlets .
Facebook gifts are actually a great way to drop your friends a message and let them all know you are still around and keep them thinking of you .
However , if you abuse this feature , you ’re friends will think of you in a negative way .
Here are a few things to consider when sending Facebook messages :
1. Facebook gifts are good in moderation
Sending too many will only aggravate and annoy your friends .
What ’s too many ?
Honestly , I think that anything more than once a week should be considered excessive .
I know I do n’t have an anniversary , birthday , holiday or special event every week .
Sending blessings and prayers are thoughtful , but how thoughtful are they without a personal message ?
2. Personalization = Value
Personalize the message in the Facebook gifts .
Do n’t just say “ I hope you like it ” .
Make your messages genuine and your friends will appreciate the fact that you are n’t sending generic messages .
3 . Send relevant gifts
Do n’t send a Christmas gift in July .
I ’ve seen this happen and again , it diminishes the value .
What ’s your opinion on Facebook gifts ?
Leave some feedback below and let me know what you think … .

Well , is n't this a novelty ?
The well practiced skill of lusting after Korean gear from afar wo n't be necessary with Motorola 's latest Android 2.0 handset , as we 're hearing the Motoroi is headed to US shelves this March .
Moto Korea head honcho Rick Wolochatiuk was on hand at the Korean launch to confirm that the new handset " will be launched in other markets around the world , " with the US specifically confirmed for a March release .
The Motoroi , if you recall , is a 3.7 - inch capacitive touchscreen spliced atop hardware good enough to record 720 p video and output it via HDMI .
An 8 megapixel camera with Xenon flash should ensure you get pretty decent photos too .
But what are we doing telling you about it when there are perfectly good promo videos after the break ?
Go get 'em !
I wanted to make you aware of a new book out entitled Introverts in the Church : Finding Our Place in an Extroverted Culture by Adam McHugh .
You can also follow Adam at his blog Introverted Church .
I was very interested in seeing the book in print because Adam had let me know that he cited a post of mine concerning introversion in the church .
That post is reposted below .
In the coming weeks I hope post a review of Adam 's book .
Introverts in the Imago Dei ? ( reposted from 6.19.2007 )
In Lectures 6 - 7 of The Varieties of Religious Experience William James moves from his discussion of the healthy - minded believer to speak of the sick soul .
Again , the sick souls are those who tend to be the more pessimistic believers among us , those of us preoccupied with the problems of existence .
In my own research , I 've labeled this type the Winter Christian and the Existential Believer , so I wo n't write more about them in this post .
What I do want to write about starts with James ' sick soul type but goes in a different direction .
Specifically , I want to write about the place of introverts at church .
Most people are aware of Jung 's typology of Introverts and Extroverts .
What you may not be aware of is that trait affectivity is highly correlated with these types .
Specifically , positive affectivity is significantly associated with extraversion and negative affectivity is associated with introversion .
That is , extraverts tend to be energetic and enthusiastic while introverts tend to be mellower or even melancholic .
The point here is that James ' sick soul type is very often going to be an introvert and the healthy - minded type is very often going to be an extrovert .
It is this connection that I want to discuss .
Here 's the question I want to ask you :
Do introverts fit in at church ?
The answer , obviously , is that it depends upon what kind of church we are talking about .
In liturgical churches I expect introverts and extroverts fare about the same .
But in non-liturgical churches they may fare differently .
Specifically , non-liturgical churches tend to be more sociable churches .
So , let 's call them that .
That is , there are liturgical churches and there are sociable churches .
Sociable churches tend to emphasize relationality among its members .
For example , a large part of the sociable church experience involves lengthy greetings ( being greeted and greeting others ) , adult bible classes that are conversational and oriented around fellowship ( e.g. , in my church we sit at tables drinking coffee , eating donuts , and chatting ) , and the in - depth sharing of personal prayer requests .
This is not to say that liturgical churches are n't sociable or do n't have sociable facets to them .
It 's just the simple recognition that going to a Catholic mass ( the prototypical liturgical experience ) differs greatly from my day at church at the Highland Church of Christ in Abilene , TX .
My experience is heavy on the “ visiting , ” as they say here in Texas .
In these highly sociable churches there is an implicit theological theme that marries sociability with spirituality .
That is , being sociable — visiting intensively , and being willing to " get into each other 's lives " — is highly prized .
To a point , this is understandable .
A sociable church is going to rely on extraverts to make the whole vibe work .
But introverts fare poorly in these sociable churches .
The demand to visit , mix , and share with strangers taxes them .
Worse , given that these social activities are declared to be " spiritual , " the introvert feels morally judged and spiritually marginalized .
As if their very personality was spiritually diseased .
Consequently , the " issue of the introvert " is one of the big overlooked problems in these sociable churches .
For example , church leaders often want to make church more " meaningful . "
What they mean by this is that they want to create an atmosphere were deep human contact can be made .
This is a fine goal , a worthy goal .
However , to pull this off in an ordinary church setting demands a degree of sociability that introverts just do n't have .
Take a typical church service , communion service , small group service , or bible class .
Let 's say , to make it more “ meaningful , ” you ask the participants to find someone sitting close to them to have a spiritually - oriented exchange / conversation with .
A time of sharing .
Well , the introverts are just going to HATE this activity .
They may hate it so much that they just might stop coming to your services .
In fact , I know introverts at my church who purposely come in late to avoid the perfunctory meet - and - greet that occurs right at the start of our services ( " Find someone close to you and say hello ! " ) .
Now , you may say that these introverts just are n't good people .
But you would be wrong .
Introverts are very , very relational .
They just are n’t sociable .
And to confuse the two is a grave theological and ecclesial mistake .
But many churches fail to make this distinction .
They tacitly set up the following equation for church life :
Spirituality = Sociability
1 . From a psychological perspective , introverts do n't change into extraverts ( or visa versa ) .
To expect this is ridiculous .
2 . From a moral perspective , you are moralizing aspects of personality : Extravert = Good and Introvert = Bad .
3 . From a pastoral perspective , you are confusing relationality with sociability .
That is , your pastoral intervention , although well - intentioned , demands a kind of personality to work well .
It is true that deeper relationships are needed at church , but the route is n't always best achieved by throwing strangers together into forced conversation .
4 . From a theological perspective , you are insinuating that introverts are not created in the Imago Dei , in the Image of God .
( In fact , the etymology of the word " enthusiasm , " that trait of the extravert , means " filled with or by God . "
The association , then , is that introverts are NOT filled with or by God . )
For example , I was once visiting with a church leader at my church who was making a recommendation that , to make our adult classes more " meaningful , " we would need to share more of our lives in these classes .
I stated that such a recommendation would drive the introverts crazy .
The response was , " God is about relationships and church is about relationships .
Thus , if these people are n't going to be involved in relationships they will just have to change .
"
The problems with this formulation are obvious :
This last is the most worrisome .
For years , sociable churches have ignored the introverts in their midst .
Worse , they have sent a consistent message that they were less spiritual than their extraverted brothers and sisters .
That to be like God was to be extraverted .
In my opinion , the damage this subtle message has caused has been enormous .
Would you like fries ( or onion rings or chicken tenders ) with that ?

There ’s something perverse about a city that deems it wise to distribute instructional pamphlets in health centers aimed at teaching young people to shoot heroin properly into their veins — then bans homemade cupcakes and vegan tofu brownies from sales at school cafeterias .
There ’s a freaky quality to a high school where you can get free condoms , but not fresh banana bread .
Or a kindergarten that offers books about acquiring AIDS or promoting the wedded union of Harry and Steve — where you can buy Stacy ’s Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips and Cool Ranch Dorito’s .
But Toll
House cookies like grandma used to make are forbidden .
This is not satire or wacky science fiction .
This is New York , circa 2010 .
And the demonic nannies who run the joint have decided that your aunt ’s famous carrot cake — not sex , drugs or hydrogenated oil — will kill you .
There was nary an ounce of fat present at City Hall last week , as several hundred sleek and preservative - free parents and designer tots showed up for a “ Bake - In ” to protest the Department of Education ’s latest boneheaded attempt to keep kids slim .
Carrying signs reading “ Joel Klein , Get Out of the Pantry , ” the first muffins were launched in the war between a hip , nutritionally sophisticated crowd , and the education ignoramuses they say are threatening kids ’ health and bankrupting school bake sales .
“ We do n’t wanna eat junk ! ” said Cassius Easton , 6 .
“ It ’s dire , ” said Helen Greenberg of Community School in the East Village .
“ I ’m the organic popcorn lady .
At $ 1 a bag , I funded the sugar cane trays we want to replace Styrofoam lunch trays ! ”
Take that .
The department opposes recyclable materials !
The lunacy behind the fight pitting Mom and apple pie vs. pre-packaged Pop - Tarts stems from a new department rule that ’s aimed at reducing fat and calories .
The school mafia has ordered that homemade goods can be sold just once a month — and not near the cafeteria .
This is based on the belief that snacks bearing printed calorie counts on packages are superior to potentially caloric treats .
The move has decimated the bake sales schools use to raise money for things like trips and art supplies at a time of budget cuts .
But what the city is really saying is this :
We do n’t trust you to raise your kids .
Or rather :
We do n’t trust people of certain racial and economic makeups to raise their kids .
So it was disheartening that last week ’s Bake - In was limited to parents from downtown Manhattan and Queens , folks who have access to and funds for nutritious food .
But there was not one attendee from Crown Heights or Harlem , the city ’s obesity belt .
Schools should teach good eating , not push kids to preservative - packed junk .
Various private organizations have cropped up , devoted to bringing fresh food and produce into neighborhoods that lack Whole Foods .
Seeds in the Middle in Crown Heights , which I profiled recently , sells food at a discount in PS 91 .
This should be encouraged , not banned .
But make no mistake .
It is control , not good health , that government craves most .
For years , the city has pushed an agenda of sexual permissiveness and AIDS education on its youngest kids .
This is the first time officials have gone for the stomach .
Fortunately , after an outcry , no new pamphlets promoting heroin use will be distributed in Health Department facilities in the next fiscal year .
One down .
Now bring back the bake sales .
SUCCESS GETS ‘EM BY THE BAWLS
I ’m no shrink .
But the world of happily ever after has been upended of late by men who have no trouble committing — just not to women above their pay grades .
The madonna - whore cliché is alive and well .
Tiger Woods scratched an itch that could be salved only by humiliating his goddess wife with a cast of interchangeable , sexting skanks .
Maureen Dowd won a Pulitzer , but lost an actor .
Kate Winslet took home an Oscar , while her hubby cavorted with a gal younger and needier .
Now Sandra Bullock , fresh from her Academy Award win , is the latest lady hit below the belt — by hubby Jesse James , who found a tattooed woman easier to grab onto than America ’s sweetheart .
Plus , the bimbo comes with printed instructions .
How tough is it to be a man , what with all these babes eager to dry your tears when the little woman makes good ?
Do something original .
Grow up .
Aw , Gloria , lib a little !
Feminism , unlike politics and the circus , is sorely lacking in fresh talent .
The grandma of fem lib , Gloria Steinem , is 76 and bitter .
In an interview with Reuters , the onetime ( undercover ) Playboy Bunny griped that chicks have yet to come a long way , baby — ignoring the fact that we ’ve made mammoth strides in positions from law to secretary of state .
Steinem sticks to the old saw that gals only make 70 cents to a man ’s dollar .
That statistic was demolished several years ago when studies , conveniently ignored , found that young women make roughly the same as men .
Older ones only lag after stepping away from the rat race , by choice , to have kids .
Saying she wo n’t see a female president , Steinem makes the sweeping generalization that “ female authority is still associated with a domestic setting . ”
She does n’t know me .
I ’m an expert in ordering in , but lack the talent to boil an egg .
Admit you ’ve won , Gloria .
Though I sincerely regret my lack of domestic skills .
Hit cabbies with pain of de-feet
Taxi victims — unite !
Two readers suggested a method for ripped - off riders to recover some of the money we overpaid to drivers who , for years , revved up their meters .
Stop tipping .
When your taxi driver protests that he ’s starving in the absence of that extra buck , tell him you ’re just taking back what was extorted from your wallet .
Problem is , this method punishes the good guys along with the creeps .
I think I ’ll use the passive - aggressive approach : my feet .
Arrogance of scrape - and - sue pol
Stupidity pays .
At least that ’s what Brooklyn Councilwoman Letitia James is banking on , as this woman of the people presses a lawsuit based on her senior moment .
In July , David Day parked his truck on the street — legally .
James rolled in behind him and , walking between the vehicles , scraped her leg on his truck hitch .
So she ’s suing .
James brings down $ 122,500 annually from taxpayers .
Day makes a tenth of that .
He wrote to his tormentor : “ You are famous and powerful while I ’m a nobody without means who has done you no harm . ”
See ya in court .
While the world sees Iran up to nuclear arms , Qatar and Iran have signed a memorandum of understanding regarding helping to preserve the environment .
Qatarâ€™s Gulf
Times reported that a memorandum of understanding was signed on February 22 by Qatarâ€™s Minister for the Environment , Abdullah bin Mubarak bin Aboud al - Midhadhi , and by Iran 's environment head Mohamed Javad Mohamedi Zadeh .
In the understanding , the two countries agree to be involved together in a number of environmental areas :
Managing green reserves , green spaces , plant growth and animal husbandry , in addition to the environmental management of coastal areas , desertification control and the exchange of experiences and expertise between the two countries .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
We have already noted several environmental projects that Qatar has unilaterally been involved in , including the construction of a new green LEED convention center ( see image ) in Doha , an agreement between Qatar 's Doha Bank and UNESCO to " Green the Middle East , " and a television program by Qatar TV , " Stars of Science , " that focused on environmentally friendly science and technology projects .
But does their abilities in any way match the pace that 's been set by the rest of the world , and can Iran look past its current activities and see a greener future ?
Iran 's involvement in environmentally friendly projects has been largely overshadowed by its ongoing nuclear energy program , however ; which many countries fear is being undertaken for the purpose of acquiring nuclear weapons .
They do have some environmental projects , including one we reporting on bio-fuels from algae at a site near the large Maharlu Salt Lake in Fars Province .
But Iran can not hide its nuclear ambitions .
As we have noted in several articles , nuclear energy , even for peaceful purposes , is not exactly the most environmentally friendly .
Other regional countries , including Jordan and Abu Dhabi , are also considering nuclear power stations .

The work was carried out on mice A " molecular switch " that can prevent Huntington 's disease from developing has been found in mice .
A US study concluded the mutated huntingtin protein , which causes the disease , could be stopped in its tracks by a subtle chemical modification .
It is hoped the work could lead to much - needed treatments for the inherited disorder .
The study , by the University of California , Los Angeles , is published in the journal Neuron .
It is thought between 6,000 and 8,500 people in the UK have Huntington 's disease - a neurological condition that starts to show in mid-life and slowly impairs a person 's ability to walk , talk and reason .
Children who have one parent with the condition have a 50 % chance of developing it themselves and often it is passed on before people are aware that they have it .
There is no cure for the illness and treatment focuses on managing the symptoms .
This finding suggests an exciting new avenue to develop therapeutics for Huntington 's disease
Study leader Dr William Yang Although it is known that a protein mutation underpins the disease , it is not exactly clear how that mutation causes the damage seen in those with the condition .
In the latest study , researchers found a small section of the mutated protein that can be modified by phosphorylation - a chemical process in the body that alters how proteins function .
In mice they found blocking this phosphorylation caused the animals to develop disease symptoms .
But when they tried to mimic the process the disorder did not develop .
This research offers an exciting avenue of exploration in the quest to prevent or slow down the disease process
Cath Stanley
Huntington 's Disease Association
It follows previous work showing phosphorylation reduced the tendency of the mutant huntingtin protein to form clumps and another study showing it could help cells get rid of the toxic version of the protein .
Study leader Dr William
Yang said together the studies suggested a new direction of research into the formation and clearance of the huntingtin protein in the disease process .
" We were surprised to find that subtle modification of only two amino acids in this very large protein can prevent the onset of disease .
" This finding suggests an exciting new avenue to develop therapeutics for Huntington 's disease . "
Huntington 's Disease Association head of care services Cath Stanley said : " Although in the very early stages , this research offers an exciting avenue of exploration in the quest to prevent or slow down the disease process . "

Mitt Romney urged caution for the general election , but indicated that has no problem letting the party sort out its divisions in primaries .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Romney warns tea parties
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is warning the tea party activists to not run third party candidates that would “ divide ” Republican voters and waste opportunities for the GOP .
Romney said in an interview with Newsmax posted on the conservative outlet ’s website Monday night that he was pleased the conservative grassroots movement is “ silent no longer . ”

The likely 2012 GOP presidential candidate cautioned though that while he supports the idea of conservative challenges in GOP primaries , third party tea party - backed candidates in the general election could be disastrous .
“ Divide and fail is the result , ” Romney said of third party challenges .
“ That would hand over the country to [ President ] Barack Obama and [ House Speaker ] Nancy Pelosi and [ Senate Majority Leader ]
Harry Reid , and that would be very sad indeed . ”
While Romney urged caution for the general election , the former governor indicated that has no problem letting the party sort out its divisions in primaries .
Asked about libertarian Rep. Ron Paul ’s ( R - Texas ) place in the GOP , Romney said “ we welcome his participation in our party , ” adding “ we ’re a big - tent party . ”
Romney also would n’t take sides in the Senate primary fight in Florida between Gov. Charlie Crist and former state House Speaker Marco Rubio .
“ I like both of those individuals .
I have n’t decided whether to endorse one or the other or neither , but I hope whoever wins the primary is able carry on very effectively in the general election , ” Romney said .
“ We need more Republican senators in Washington very badly right now . ”

PHILADELPHIA — President Obama challenged wavering members of his party on Monday not to give in to political fears about supporting health care legislation , asserting that the urgency of getting a bill through Congress should trump any concern about the consequences for Democrats in November .
In a high - octane appearance that harked back to his “ yes we can ” campaign days , Mr. Obama jettisoned the professorial demeanor that has cloaked many of his public pronouncements on the issue , instead making an emotional pitch for public support as he tries to push the legislation through a final series of votes in Congress in the next several weeks .
With the fate of his signature initiative on the line , and Republicans eager to portray Democrats as out of step with the country and incapable of governing , Mr. Obama seemed to relish the opportunity to cut loose and make his case on his terms , as he often has at pivotal moments .
And , with his back to the wall , the president appeared intent on reassuring his party that he was as confident as ever in his powers to explain , persuade and capture the politics of the moment .
Oh , do I have a confession to make today !
I ’ll tell it straight : I got lucky .
I got really lucky , and despite my admonitions to the contrary , I ’m being hailed as a hero and savior of the day .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
To give you some background on the story , I have three sites to deal with .
Our primary site is active , where production is run and from where clients are served ; and we also have a secondary center to where production can be moved in the event of a catastrophic failure of the primary site .
We also have a third “ backup ” site where all of the data is pooled , written to media , and shipped to offsite - storage .
In a nutshell , the data flows from the primary to the secondary , then to the backup site .
All of the various data does this , but last Friday , I was concerned with the database .
“
Our byzantine license
precludes us from
doing anything more
robust with [ our
antiquated database ] …
”
We have what I would consider to be an antiquated database .
Our byzantine license precludes us from doing anything more robust with it , so we just use log shipping to ensure that the data is replicated to all of the backup instances in a timely manner .
Due to bandwidth considerations , this happens at the top of every even - numbered hour .
Last Friday , I was working late in order to get through a particularly large backlog , and I was in the zone .
I had my headphones on and not a care in the world , until I got an instant message from someone in our New York office .
The question was simple , but profound : “ How often do we backup the primary database ? ”
That ’s not the sort of question that you should give a knee - jerk response to , even at the best of times .
I considered the possible answers for a moment , and then I remembered that it was Friday night at 5:45 pm .
Ignoring the query , I immediately opened remote terminals to all of the backup databases and shut them down , preventing any data being replicated from the primary .
Reasons and Repercussions
As it turned out , that last step saved us .
What had happened was that someone in New York had accidentally deleted several thousand records from the database , and I managed to shut down the backup databases before the 6 o’clock log shipping .
If I had n’t been contacted when I was , or if I had n’t immediately turned off the backup databases , then scant few minutes later the transaction log that contained the command to delete the records would have percolated throughout the backup instances , wiping the data everywhere .
I got lucky .
Admittedly , had the data been lost from all of the instances , it still would n’t have been the end of the world ; as I mentioned , we do move tapes offsite .
I could have called our media storage people and had them ship us the tape .
I could have then recovered the last instance of the database from the tape , replayed it up to the point of that mistaken command .
Then , I ’d have put it on an external hard drive , driven to the datacenter , copied it off and activated it .
It would probably only have taken two days .
Not a catastrophe but , like I said , I got lucky and managed to avoid that particular headache .
“
What made me shut
down the databases
with only the slightest
hint that something
was wrong ?
I do n’t
know , and that ’s hard
to deal with .
“
The reason that I ’m being hailed as a hero is because of my swift response in shutting down the secondary databases .
What everyone marvels at , but no one really considers , is why I took that action .
What made me shut down the databases with only the slightest hint that something was wrong ?
I do n’t know , and that ’s hard to deal with .
Since I do n’t know , I can only chalk it up to experience .
It was late on a Friday , that was n’t a conversational kind of question , and then there was also my knowledge of the person asking it :
That question did n’t strike me as the kind he would pose ‘ off the cuff ’ , so to speak .
In the end , I can only say that it was my intuition and experience in dealing with the network and those people that prompted my reaction .
My biggest problem with this is that experience and intuition are impossible to teach .
They must be acquired .
That being said , there are some things which can be taught ; and so , yesterday , my supervisor and I held a training session for everyone in the company .
The underpinnings of the data flow and backup policies were covered , and we highlighted the fact that what really saved us was the fact that someone spoke up immediately about a problem , and told a person who could respond effectively .
I have worked hard to make sure that our users know that they can come and tell us about problems and mistakes without being rebuked , and our training session emphasized that behavior .
My experience certainly gave me pause , and I ’m in the middle of evaluating how I can deal with what would have happened if we had missed that 15 minute window .
If it happens again , at a less opportune time , what can I do to make sure that the recovery process is n’t stretch across two days ?
I have to answer that question now .
Maybe you should reconsider some of the critical systems in your infrastructure , and re-evaluate your disaster recovery plan .
If you do n’t have one , I urge you to build one .
Like many things , by the time it ’s obvious that you need one , it ’s too late .
The team made flies with sperm that glows red and green US researchers using genetically engineered fruit flies with glowing sperm have tracked the seed 's progress inside the female , in real time .
By making the fly 's sperm glow green or red , researchers from Syracuse University are able to see previously unobservable events unfold .
Competition between sperm is a key component of sexual selection .
The researchers hope their findings will also offer new insights into human reproductive biology .
' Knocked us out '
In nature , monogamy is often the exception , promiscuity usually the rule , the BBC's Matt McGrath reports .
But whenever a female of any species mates with more than one male there is a battle between the sperm of the potential fathers as they attempt to fertilise the eggs .
Scientists regard this type of sexual selection as a very important force for evolutionary change .
The trick of making fly sperm glow to see how they compete was first employed in 1999 , by scientists from the University of Chicago .
Now the Syracuse University researchers have gone one better , by watching the sperm race in real time , the journal Science reports .
Prof Scott Pitnick says it was a jaw - dropping moment when he saw the multicoloured sperm through the microscope for the first time .
" It turns out that they [ the sperm ] are constantly on the move within the female 's specialised sperm - storage organs and exhibit surprisingly complex behaviour , " Prof Pitnick said .
" It far exceeds our expectations , in that we can essentially track the fate of every sperm the female receives .
" It 's seeing all the novel observations , the complexity of what sperm do inside the female reproductive tract that no - one has ever been able to observe before .
That 's really knocked us out . "
Prof Pitnick and his colleagues say they have created glowing sperm for other species .
They believe their technique could be used to understand not just issues of evolution but to potentially solve problems of fertility in humans .

The son of cult filmmaker Robert Downey Sr. , Robert Downey Jr. lived a Hollywood life that nearly swallowed him .
His struggles with addiction were well publicized throughout the '90s and early '00s , but in the past few years , the focus has again shifted back to his acting .
Which is as it should be .
Robert Altman once called him the greatest actor of his generation , and Downey has racked up a body of work that makes a good argument for the claim , stretching from his turn as a drug- crazed L.A. kid in Less Than Zero through his Oscar - nominated portrayal of Charlie Chaplin in Chaplin , memorable collaborations with Altman and James Toback , and , more recently , a great starring turn in Shane Black 's meta - buddy film Kiss Kiss , Bang Bang .
Currently , Downey can be seen in Richard Linklater 's animated Philip K. Dick adaptation A Scanner Darkly , playing a paranoid , drug - addled roommate to Keanu Reeves ' equally addicted undercover cop .
Downey recently spoke to The A.V. Club about paranoia , conspiracies , and other pleasant subjects .
Advertisement
The A.V. Club : I 'll start with the hardest question of all .
Whose decision was it to put you in a beret for much of this movie ?
Robert Downey Jr :
If I remember correctly , I just thought that he should be getting more and more of a French underground / fascist / MI5 look as we went along .
Advertisement
AVC : How familiar were you with Philip K . Dick before doing this film ?
RD : I was a relative dummy .
I essentially would see his name when I went to see Blade Runner or Minority Report or the like .
But he certainly is my kind of strange .
Advertisement
AVC : Did you read a lot of his work before making the film ?
RD : I did n't read at all , I left that to the other professionals .
I figured Woody Harrelson would come in and decide that if I did something off - beat , he'd do something more off - beat .
And Keanu did all the research and Winona looked pretty , so we had everything covered .
Advertisement
AVC : The film is about drugs , and several cast members have had very public histories with drugs .
Did that feed into the experience of making the film ?
RD : You'd think it would , but it 's such a technical endeavor .
For me , it was just a lot of memorization and a lot of choreography , because it was a very short schedule .
So I essentially remember it as kind of a [ Richard ]
Linklater boot camp of shoot , gym , eat , study , shoot .
Advertisement
AVC : Did the fact that you knew you were going to be animated later affect your performance ?
RD : It just gave us a lot of leeway that we may not have otherwise been afforded .
If your body mic is sticking out , if your hair needs a trim …
It 's just like " Oh , we 'll fix it later . "
It would be kind of great to do every movie like that .
Advertisement
AVC : Do you see this becoming a viable approach for making films ?
RD : I think , just like Rick said , that it was a good idea for this film .
Pretty much everyone has said , " Wow , using the rotoscoping to tell this story was very appropriate , and therefore it was cool that he chose to go that way . "
Now after he did Waking Life , I do n't think he was saying " I 've got all this technology , what other film can I do and tell it this way ? "
It just kind of came to him that it would be a way of enhancing this Dick - ensian story .
Advertisement
AVC : People are going to talk about the relationship between the government surveillance in this film and the Bush administration 's accessing of bank and phone records .
How do you see this film relating to the current situation ?
RD : You can always make comparisons , whether they are acute or broad .
I would leave that to the people who like to assert themselves in those areas .
Advertisement
To me , it 's cyclical .
Twenty years ago , 30 years ago , there were similar issues coming up .
Technology has advanced to the point of where …
It 's funny , I read the other day that Sky Dayton of Earthlink is going to make the city of Anaheim the first Wi -Fi city .
And I thought that was strange , seeing as how A Scanner Darkly takes place in Anaheim .
It 's as if good filmmaking — the timing of telling a story — by necessity aligns itself with something that 's — for lack of a better word — synchronistic and timely .
I do n't know that A Scanner Darkly would be as interesting a film in ' 99 or ' 98 .
AVC : You 've called your character in Short Cuts your first " creep . "
Your character in A Scanner Darkly is another one .
What does it take to play a creep ?
Advertisement
RD : You 've gotta think creepy thoughts .
The great thing about Linklater is we'd be futzing around and rehearsing in some Austin , Texas Hilton boardroom and some girl would come in with the eggs , and she'd have , like , a really big zit on her neck or something , and I 'd go like " Wow , nice bug bite " when she left .
Next day , you come in and there in the rewrites , I 'm calling someone a bug bite .
So I guess everybody has a little creep in them , that kind of self - conscious thinking about other people , thinking about people in a derogatory way , thinking about how you can manipulate and alpha - dog the situation .
In A Scanner Darkly , everybody 's pretty much such a wreck that it's that scramble to get an upper hand while you 're losing your mind .
AVC : You 're also playing a particular sub -species of creep in this , someone who has a lot of paranoia going on .
How do you get inside that mindset ?
Advertisement
RD : I would just venture a guess and say our generation has a predisposition to understanding that we 're on the fucking verge of something , and yet that something seems a little nebulous and remote because it has n't happened .
And some people say the writing 's on the wall , and I say , " I do n't know .
Who put it there ? "
But when those inclinations are activated , they tend to result in something paranoiac .
This whole idea of conspiracy and manipulation , it 's as old as the trees , because life is messy and hard .
And to consolidate things down into a belief that a few people are evil and that they 're doing this …
It 's just not that way , if you ask me .
There are some root assumptions and some directives that a whole myriad of societal bigwigs have .
It 's kind of like they all went to the same school , and the same school is very Nietzschean in that anything that does n't increase your power is not worth investigating .

[ pagebreak ]
AVC : It seems like a conspiracy - theory summer , with The Da Vinci Code and A Scanner Darkly .
What do you think is going on in the culture to bring all this up at this moment ?
Advertisement
RD : I think we 're misunderstanding somewhat that the current revolution and cataclysm is more of an externalization of a big shift in our consciousness generally .
And because matters of the spirit are much more terrifying than anything that could ever happen in the material world — because obviously one creates the other , does n't it ?
Things are thought first and experienced later , rather than we just have these couple of senses that are …
A lot of it to me is just physics now .
We 're finally starting to recognize and admit that the senses are creating as much as they are perceiving .
The eye is pretty much creating the image that it perceives , which is just so weird .
For everyone that I know , and I expand that to pretty much all of us that have that intuitive hint that there is so much more going on than could ever meet the eye , it 's unsettling as hell .
I have a feeling that we 're recognizing how unsettling the bigger picture can be .
When , in fact , should n't it be comforting to know that it just ain't all that serious ?
Having that sense of play and feeling that you can actually kind of create your own reality to a certain extent .
Advertisement
A Scanner Darkly is a bit more of a mirror than The Da Vinci Code , which is kind of like a Ferrari engine of a bastardization of a book I love , Holy Blood , Holy Grail .
To me , that whole phrase " I looked into a mirror darkly , " from Corinthians [ as Dick reworked it in A Scanner Darkly ] applies to it , that idea that if you 're seeing something that is very evil and sticky and dark and seemingly manipulative , is it seeing you ?
AVC : Like the idea of staring into the abyss and having it stare back .
RD : I do n't even know why I would remember this , but I remember being in Thailand and shooting Air America with Mel Gibson , what , fucking 20 years ago , and being in Bangkok and seeing that kind of depravity .
I hear it 's quite different now .
But there 's still that aspect of wholesale destruction of the sanctity of femaleness and all that , and then you go up in the mountains and there 's the monks in their robes , and you can feel like you 've never been in a more blissful , loving place in your life .
Advertisement
But we 're on location , and I just remember like , just what a dog means there , it 's a little different .
There was some puppy running around the set one minute , and then I just looked out my trailer door and this truck just backed up over it and just , ugh , slushed it .
And I did n't expect to see that kind of disregard for something that we , as Americans , would be like " Not the puppy ! "
And it 's really weird to think that other places , or maybe other aspects of what we consider to be our American way , are just that callous and that kind of fucked up .
Advertisement
AVC : I 'll try to shift to something a little bit more pleasant .
RD : [ Laughs . ]
Okay .
AVC : Anything beyond dead puppies has got to be more pleasant .
RD : I just figured I 'd beat you to the punch in case you wanted to go down to the end of that dark road .
[ Laughs . ]

AVC : You were involved in one of the scariest scenes I have ever seen in a movie , and that 's when you are questioning Mike Tyson in Black And White .
Was that as on the edge as it looks ?
RD : Well yeah , the director James Toback was like " Just go tell him … "
And I was like , " What ?
Just go tell him that I had a super - gay dream about him , and I was wondering if he'd hold me ? " [ Laughs . ]
And Mike was like off in the corner deciding what Versace shirt to wear for the scene .
He 's like [ adopts Tyson voice ]
" Yeah , we 're going to improvise .
Yeah , just do n't have him saying any weirdo gay stuff . "
And when I said it , he was like " You ca n't talk to me like that , man , I 'm on parole man , I 'm on parole . "
And I said , " Will you hold me ? "
He said , " If I hit you , I 'll pull my punch . "
But Mike Tyson pulling his punch is like a donkey trying , I do n't know , to bite an apple out of your mouth or something .
Advertisement
AVC : So which is more of a challenge to you as an actor , a straightforward action film like U.S. Marshals , or a self - conscious action film like Kiss Kiss , Bang Bang ?
RD : Kiss Kiss , Bang Bang is one of my favorites , if not my favorite movie that I have ever done , so it 's not a fair comparison .
I do n't remember anything about U.S. Marshals except that we were running around and pretending like we could ever hold a candle to The Fugitive .
[ Laughs . ]
I just remember like , " Strap on your bulletproof vest , you 're in the bayou ! " [ Laughs . ]
What the fuck what ?
Where 's the story ?
Kiss Kiss , Bang Bang is a fucking Maserati engine of a plot .
It 's Shane Black , it 's Joel Silver , it 's Mrs. Downey [ Downey 's wife , Susan Levin ] producing , and me and Val Kilmer just going toe - to - toe in great shape .
Shane Black , who I 've adored ever since he wrote the definitive buddy picture of all time , Lethal Weapon .
So yeah , I mean , that one to me was alive and innovative and the other was something else .
Advertisement
AVC : You have a diverse bunch of films coming out .
How much of that is a conscious choice on your part ?
RD : I 'd say it 's 50/50 .
Sometimes having a childish approach to things , well , I just did this type of movie , so now I should do …
At what point do you , as a writer , or me , as an actor , stop imagining that we 've got to show what we can do !
It becomes a bit more of an intuitive game , you know :
Who are the people ?
What kind of experience am I going to have ?
Because … I was reading this thing , Time magazine or something , it was talking about the kind of brain chemistry of happiness and what it really means and how misconceived it has been .
Making the jump from $ 40,000 to $ 70,000 a year is a big deal but making the jump from $ 70,000 to $ 140,000 you 'd think would be a bigger deal , but it actually creates more stress for most people .
At a certain point you have to think , how much more of your life do you want to enjoy and how much are you sacrificing by how much harder you have to work , and how much more you have to hustle to make that extra dough — that at the end of the day is n't going to buy you any more happiness ?
Not that it can to begin with .
So I tend to look at things as like , am I going to be stronger , wiser , and gladder at the end if I go to fucking Bulgaria to shoot this whatever ?
[ Laughs . ]
And I 'm like , no , I 'm not .
Advertisement
AVC : Part of what 's been interesting about your career is , however accidentally , you never got to go to that point where you could make the big action films .
In the long run , are you happier for that ?
RD : The long run is , I 'm 41 and I have a feeling oftentimes when the chips are down or I 'm just awake and my whole psyche is booting up , one of the first things that screams at me is , " Why did n't you ? ! "
You know ?
It 's like , well , because maybe if I had , if I had n't had these kind of diversions or disappointments or challenges , maybe certain parts of that outside stuff would have been more tangible and doable , but maybe in the long run I 'd say , " God , you never know . "
To me , there is an excitement about this next chapter that I could never have anticipated .
I was burned out when I was 22 , and I 've seen … I do n't know … some of us have done a great job with it .
Keanu is in really good shape with what he has created .
Johnny Depp is a great example of someone being able to find balance .
Sean [ Penn ] , without tying his shoelaces together at all , kind of had a long trajectory of getting the type of attention he really deserved and the type of monetary compensation .
To the point where people always assumed he was going to be the greatest thing they 'd see in a movie that year .
So he was kind of in a way underappreciated .
Advertisement
So I do n't know , that 's the funny thing .
Comparison is such a fucking dangerous game .
Everybody 's got their own thumbprint , and that leads them to their own weirdo , winding road of experiences .
You will need to trim the paper to a specified size .
To do this I just use my hands and tear it ; if you are a perfectionist you may want some scissors .
First you will tear the newspaper in half ( at the fold ) leaving you with about 12 " of width .

Measure out the length of the toilet paper roll and tear horizontally - scissors here for perfectionists though I promise it will be okay if it is a little off .

Staring at the Earth : The MTGs will gather far more detail , faster
European nations like the scope of a multi-billion - euro project to upgrade their weather satellites , but they have not been able to push the scheme ahead .
A meeting of the Eumetsat organisation failed on Friday to approve all the documents related to the proposed Meteosat Third Generation programme .
Two of the agency 's 26 member - states said they would reserve their votes .
The key dissenter is thought to be Germany which has ongoing issues with the share - out of industrial work .
Until all nations approve the content of the MTG programme , it cannot be opened for funding and cannot be implemented .
Angiolo Rolli , Eumetsat 's director of administration , declined to name the two countries that withheld their votes at a special Council gathering , although he did acknowledge that the issue of work sharing was a factor .
" We hope the member - states will be able to resolve their reservations by the end of June , " he told BBC News .
Industrial rivalry MTG is one of the biggest and the most complex space projects ever undertaken in Europe .
The system will comprise six satellites , with the first spacecraft likely to be ready for launch in 2016 .
METEOSAT - BIGGER , BETTER Europe 's 1st imaging satellite ( 800kg ) was launched in 1977 ; it had just three channels Today 's 2nd generation imager ( above ) has 12 channels ; it 's a 2 - tonne class spacecraft
The planned 3rd generation imager will be a 3 - tonne satellite ; it will have 16 channels MTG adds a second platform : a sounding satellite to see the different layers in the atmosphere
Consortium wins big weather prize
They are expected to bring a step change in capability , resulting in more accurate and more detailed weather forecasts .
MTG is a joint undertaking between the European Space Agency ( Esa ) and Eumetsat , the international agency charged with looking after Europe 's Meteosats .
In the new programme , Esa will oversee the research and development phase of MTG , and the building of its prototype satellites .
Eumetsat , on the other hand , will oversee the ground control system and the future operation of the spacecraft .
Sorting out Esa 's side of the programme has been a drawn - out process with both France and Germany competing to lead the project .
Earlier this month , Thales Alenia Space ( France ) was finally asked to enter negotiations for a 1.3bn euro contract , beating out EADS Astrium of Germany .
The award , however , is the subject of a review within Esa which will report in June , the same month the Eumetsat dissenters have promised to reconsider Friday 's documents .
Large investments
Mr Rolli said he was encouraged by the general enthusiasm for the scope of the programme , and Eumetsat 's side of it in particular .
" This I think is a very positive result we achieved on Friday , that there was a very large , almost unanimous , consensus on the content of the programme , which is not only the user requirements but the way the programme is going to be conducted and the financial envelope associated with it , " he explained .
That envelope is 2.4bn euros ( at 2008 prices ) .
When the content of the MTG programme is finally approved , member - states will then be asked to fund it .
As a mandatory programme within Eumetsat , this means the contribution of each country will be based on its relative economic status ( Gross National Income ) .
Under present circumstances , this means Germany , the UK , and France will be the main funders .
With the scale of investment Germany is also putting through the Esa side of MTG , it will become the project 's biggest sponsor overall .

Raising the amount of vitamin D in the blood appears to help some people -- at least those deficient in the vitamin -- reduce their risk of heart disease by about 30 % , researchers announced Monday .
The findings , though preliminary , support further investigation of the interplay between vitamin D and heart health .
Observational studies have linked heart disease with low vitamin D levels in the blood .
In recent years , studies have shown that as many as three - quarters of Americans have a concentration in their blood that is under the normal level of 30 nanograms per milliliter .
But it has been unclear if people with low vitamin D have more heart disease because of the vitamin deficiency or for other reasons , such as lack of exercise , said Dr. J. Brent Muhlestein , the lead author of the new study and director of cardiovascular research at Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Salt Lake City .
He announced the findings at the American College of Cardiology annual meeting in Atlanta .
“ The question we looked at is , if you do something about it , like taking vitamin D supplements , does that reduce the risk ? ” he said .
Researchers have been uncomfortable randomizing people with low vitamin D into a group that receives supplements and a group that does not because , in theory , every vitamin D deficiency should be treated .
Low vitamin D levels can contribute to weaker bones and have been associated with increased risks of several diseases , including several types of cancer .
Instead , Muhlestein ’s group examined data from more than 9,000 people who had been diagnosed with low vitamin D and who had a blood sample taken at a later date .
About half of the people had normalized their vitamin D levels by the time of the second blood sample , and they showed much less heart disease compared to people whose levels were still below normal .
“ What we did was observational and not definitive , but we think it adds significantly to the story , ” Muhlestein said .
“ It ’s at least a reasonable piece of evidence to add to the hypothesis that low vitamin D is causative of cardiovascular risk and treatment can reduce cardiovascular disease risk . ”
It ’s not clear , however , whether the people who improved their vitamin D levels did other things to benefit their health , such as lowering their cholesterol or blood pressure , that might account for the lower risk of heart disease .
Moreover , the pages of science journals are littered with now - disproved studies suggesting that various nutrients , such as vitamins E , C and folic acid , might prevent or treat heart disease .
“ It turned out those things did n’t help .
The low levels seem to be just markers for people who are less healthy , ” said Dr. Douglas Weaver , immediate past president of the American College of Cardiology and chief of cardiology at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit .
“ But I think these studies that show a relationship between heart attack and vitamin D are going to provoke a lot more research to understand what is going on . ”
Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin from exposure to sunlight .
It ’s also found in a limited number of foods , including salmon and fortified milk .
Adequate levels may strengthen the immune system and reduce inflammation , Muhlestein said .

Pandoc filters
Summary
Pandoc provides an interface for users to write programs ( known as filters ) which act on pandoc ’s AST .
Pandoc consists of a set of readers and writers .
When converting a document from one format to another , text is parsed by a reader into pandoc ’s intermediate representation of the document — an “ abstract syntax tree ” or AST — which is then converted by the writer into the target format .
The pandoc AST format is defined in the module Text .
Pandoc .
Definition in the pandoc - types package .
A “ filter ” is a program that modifies the AST , between the reader and the writer .
INPUT -- reader --> AST -- filter -->
AST -- writer --> OUTPUT
Pandoc supports two kinds of filters :
Lua filters use the Lua language to define transformations on the pandoc AST .
They are described in a separate document .
JSON filters , described here , are pipes that read from standard input and write to standard output , consuming and producing a JSON representation of the pandoc AST : source format ↓ ( pandoc ) ↓ JSON - formatted AST ↓ ( JSON filter ) ↓ JSON - formatted AST ↓ ( pandoc ) ↓ target format
Lua filters have a couple of advantages .
They use a Lua interpreter that is embedded in pandoc , so you do n’t need to have any external software installed .
And they are usually faster than JSON filters .
But if you wish to write your filter in a language other than Lua , you may prefer to use a JSON filter .
JSON filters may be written in any programming language .
You can use a JSON filter directly in a pipeline :
pandoc -s input . txt -t json | \ pandoc - citeproc | \ pandoc -s -f json -o output.
html
But it is more convenient to use the -- filter option , which handles the plumbing automatically :
pandoc -s input. txt -- filter pandoc - citeproc -o output.html
For a gentle introduction into writing your own filters , continue this guide .
There ’s also a list of third party filters on the wiki .
A simple example
Suppose you wanted to replace all level 2 + headings in a markdown document with regular paragraphs , with text in italics .
How would you go about doing this ?
A first thought would be to use regular expressions .
Something like this :
perl - pe 's /^##+ (.*) $/\*\1\*/'
source.txt
This should work most of the time .
But do n’t forget that ATX style headings can end with a sequence of # s that is not part of the heading text :
## My heading ##
And what if your document contains a line starting with ## in an HTML comment or delimited code block ?
<!-- ##
This is just a comment --> ~~~~ ###
A third level heading in standard markdown ~ ~ ~ ~
We do n’t want to touch these lines .
Moreover , what about Setext style second - level heading ?
A heading ---------
We need to handle those too .
Finally , can we be sure that adding asterisks to each side of our string will put it in italics ?
What if the string already contains asterisks around it ?
Then we ’ll end up with bold text , which is not what we want .
And what if it contains a regular unescaped asterisk ?
How would you modify your regular expression to handle these cases ?
It would be hairy , to say the least .
A better approach is to let pandoc handle the parsing , and then modify the AST before the document is written .
For this , we can use a filter .
To see what sort of AST is produced when pandoc parses our text , we can use pandoc ’s native output format :
% cat test . txt ## my heading text with * italics * % pandoc -s -t native test.
txt Pandoc ( Meta {unMeta = fromList [ ] } ) [ Header 2 ( " my- heading " , [ ] , [ ] )
[ Str " My " , Space , Str " heading " ] , Para [ Str " text " , Space , Str " with " , Space , Emph [ Str " italics " ] ] ]
A Pandoc document consists of a Meta block ( containing metadata like title , authors , and date ) and a list of Block elements .
In this case , we have two Block s , a Header and a Para .
Each has as its content a list of Inline elements .
For more details on the pandoc AST , see the haddock documentation for Text .
Pandoc .
Definition .
We can use Haskell to create a JSON filter that transforms this AST , replacing each Header block with level >= 2 with a Para with its contents wrapped inside an Emph inline :
#!/usr/bin/env runhaskell -- behead.hs import Text.Pandoc.JSON main :: IO ( ) ( ) = toJSONFilter behead maintoJSONFilter behead behead :: Block -> Block Header n _ xs ) | n >= 2 = Para [ Emph xs ] behead ( n _ xs ) xs ] = x behead x
The toJSONFilter function does two things .
First , it lifts the behead function ( which maps Block -> Block ) onto a transformation of the entire Pandoc AST , walking the AST and transforming each block .
Second , it wraps this Pandoc ->
Pandoc transformation with the necessary JSON serialization and deserialization , producing an executable that consumes JSON from stdin and produces JSON to stdout .
To use the filter , make it executable :
chmod +x behead.hs
and then
pandoc -f SOURCEFORMAT -t TARGETFORMAT -- filter ./behead.hs
( It is also necessary that pandoc - types be installed in the local package repository .
To do this using cabal - install , cabal v2 - update && cabal v2 - install -- lib pandoc - types . )
Alternatively , we could compile the filter :
ghc - package - env=default -- make behead.hs pandoc -f SOURCEFORMAT -t TARGETFORMAT -- filter ./ behead
Note that if the filter is placed in the system PATH , then the initial ./ is not needed .
Note also that the command line can include multiple instances of -- filter : the filters will be applied in sequence .
LaTeX for WordPress
Another easy example .
WordPress blogs require a special format for LaTeX math .
Instead of $ e=mc^2 $ , you need : $ LaTeX e=mc^2 $ .
How can we convert a markdown document accordingly ?
Again , it ’s difficult to do the job reliably with regexes .
A $ might be a regular currency indicator , or it might occur in a comment or code block or inline code span .
We just want to find the $ s that begin LaTeX math .
If only we had a parser …
We do .
Pandoc already extracts LaTeX math , so :
#!/usr/bin/env runhaskell -- wordpressify.hs import Text.Pandoc.JSON
= toJSONFilter wordpressify maintoJSONFilter wordpressify where wordpressify ( Math x y ) = Math x ( " LaTeX " ++ y ) wordpressify ( x y ) x ( y ) = x wordpressify x
Mission accomplished .
( I ’ve omitted type signatures here , just to show it can be done . )
But I do n’t want to learn Haskell !
While it ’s easiest to write pandoc filters in Haskell , it is fairly easy to write them in python using the pandocfilters package .
The package is in PyPI and can be installed using pip install pandocfilters or easy_install pandocfilters .
Here ’s our “ beheading ” filter in python :
#!/usr/bin/env python " " " Pandoc filter to convert all level 2 + headings to paragraphs with emphasized text . " " " from pandocfilters import toJSONFilter , Emph , Para pandocfilterstoJSONFilter , Emph , Para def behead ( key , value , format , meta ) : behead ( key , value , , meta ) : if key == ' Header ' and value [ 0 ] >= 2 : keyvalue [ return Para( [ Emph( value [ 2 ] ) ] ) Para ( [ Emph( value [ ] ) ] ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : toJSONFilter( behead )
toJSONFilter ( behead ) walks the AST and applies the behead action to each element .
If behead returns nothing , the node is unchanged ; if it returns an object , the node is replaced ; if it returns a list , the new list is spliced in .
Note that , although these parameters are not used in this example , format provides access to the target format , and meta provides access to the document ’s metadata .
There are many examples of python filters in the pandocfilters repository .
For a more Pythonic alternative to pandocfilters , see the panflute library .
Do n’t like Python ?
There are also ports of pandocfilters in PHP , perl , javascript / node.js , Groovy , and Ruby .
Starting with pandoc 2.0 , pandoc includes built - in support for writing filters in lua .
The lua interpreter is built in to pandoc , so a lua filter does not require any additional software to run .
See the documentation on lua filters .
Include files
So none of our transforms have involved IO .
How about a script that reads a markdown document , finds all the inline code blocks with attribute include , and replaces their contents with the contents of the file given ?
#!/usr/bin/env runhaskell -- includes.hs import Text.Pandoc.JSON import qualified Data .
Text .IO as TIO import qualified Data .
Text as T doInclude :: Block ->
IO Block @ ( CodeBlock ( id , classes , namevals ) contents ) = doInclude cb , classes , namevals ) contents ) case lookup " include " namevals of namevals Just f ->
CodeBlock ( id , classes , namevals ) < $> , classes , namevals ) TIO.readFile ( T.unpack f) Nothing -> return cb cb = return x doInclude x main :: IO ( ) ( ) = toJSONFilter doInclude maintoJSONFilter doInclude
Try this on the following :
Here 's the pandoc README : ~~~~ { include = " README " } this will be replaced by contents of README ~~~~
What if we want to remove every link from a document , retaining the link ’s text ?
#!/usr/bin/env runhaskell -- delink.hs import Text.Pandoc.JSON
= toJSONFilter delink maintoJSONFilter delink delink :: Inline -> [ Inline ]
Link _ txt _ ) = txt delink ( _ txt _) txt = [ x ] delink x[ x ]
Note that delink ca n’t be a function of type Inline ->
Inline , because the thing we want to replace the link with is not a single Inline element , but a list of them .
So we make delink a function from an Inline element to a list of Inline elements .
toJSONFilter can still lift this function to a transformation of type Pandoc -> Pandoc .
A filter for ruby text
Finally , here ’s a nice real - world example , developed on the pandoc - discuss list .
Qubyte wrote :
I ’m interested in using pandoc to turn my markdown notes on Japanese into nicely set HTML and ( Xe ) LaTeX .
With HTML5 , ruby ( typically used to phonetically read chinese characters by placing text above or to the side ) is standard , and support from browsers is emerging ( Webkit based browsers appear to fully support it ) .
For those browsers that do n’t support it yet ( notably Firefox ) the feature falls back in a nice way by placing the phonetic reading inside brackets to the side of each Chinese character , which is suitable for other output formats too .
As for ( Xe ) LaTeX , ruby is not an issue .
At the moment , I use inline HTML to achieve the result when the conversion is to HTML , but it ’s ugly and uses a lot of keystrokes , for example < ruby > ご < rt></rt> 飯 < rp > （</rp > < rt > はん </rt><rp > ）</rp> < /ruby > （はん） sets ご飯 “ gohan ” with “ han ” spelt phonetically above the second character , or to the right of it in brackets if the browser does not support ruby .
I ’d like to have something more like r[ はん ] ( 飯 ) or any keystroke saving convention would be welcome .
We came up with the following script , which uses the convention that a markdown link with a URL beginning with a hyphen is interpreted as ruby :
[ はん ] ( -飯)
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-} -- handleruby.hs import Text.Pandoc.JSON import System .
Environment ( getArgs ) ( getArgs ) import qualified Data .
Text as T handleRuby :: Maybe Format -> Inline -> Inline Just format ) x @ ( Link attr [ Str ruby ] ( src , _ ) ) = handleRuby ( format ) xattr [ ruby ] ( src , _ ) ) case T.uncons src of T.uncons src Just ( ' -' , kanji ) , kanji ) | format == Format " html " ->
RawInline format $ formatformat " < ruby > " <> kanji <> " < rp > (</rp ><rt > " <> ruby <> kanjiruby " </rt><rp > )</rp></ruby > " | format == Format " latex " ->
RawInline format $ formatformat " \\ruby { " <> kanji <> " } { " <> ruby <> " } " kanjiruby | otherwise ->
Str ruby ruby _ -> x = x handleRuby _ x main :: IO ( ) ( ) = toJSONFilter handleRuby maintoJSONFilter handleRuby
Note that , when a script is called using -- filter , pandoc passes it the target format as the first argument .
When a function ’s first argument is of type Maybe Format , toJSONFilter will automatically assign it Just the target format or Nothing .
We compile our script :
ghc -- make handleRuby
Then run it :
% pandoc - F ./handleRuby -t html [ はん ] ( -飯) ^D < p >< ruby >飯< rp >(</rp><rt>はん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></p> % pandoc - F ./handleRuby -t latex [ はん ] ( -飯) ^D \ruby {飯}{はん}
Note : to use this to generate PDFs via LaTeX , you ’ll need to use -- pdf- engine=xelatex , specify a mainfont that has the Japanese characters ( e.g. “ Noto Sans CJK TC ” ) , and add \usepackage {ruby} to your template or header - includes .

The French agency tasked with enforcing strict anti-piracy regulations has been left severely embarrassed after the revelation that its logo contains pirated material .
The Hadopi agency unveiled its new logo at a ceremony presided over by French culture minister Frédéric Mitterrand , who said that the agency " finally had a face " .
Hadopi will enforce new laws that will strip citizens of internet access after three accusations of piracy , similar to measures championed by Lord Mandelson .
However , within hours Hadopi was forced to withdraw and rework the logo after it emerged that it had used a font owned by France Telecom .
Graphic designer Jean - François Porchez , who created the font for the company in 2000 , has said that he is considering legal action over the infringement .
Plan Créatif , the design agency behind the logo , has now admitted that it used the font despite copyright laws , and is changing the design to one that is legal .
The incident is just the latest in a string of embarrassing copyright mistakes by the Sarkozy government , which has strongly supported some of the harshest anti-piracy measures in Europe .
Last year Sarkozy 's party was caught out after it illegally used music from American band MGMT at an event and on videos after the band 's label refused permission for its use .
The party was also found to be illegally copying DVDs of a documentary about the French leader .
At long last , Google Maps has routes specifically for bikes .
With the click of a mouse , the new feature allows you to plot the best ( and flattest ! ) ride from Point A to Point B. Several cities , including New York , Minneapolis , San Francisco and Portland , Oregon , have bike - specific mapping sites .
But Google is rolling it out in 150 cities nationwide and announcing it Wednesday at the 10th Annual Bike Summit in Washington , D.C .
" This has been a top - requested feature from Google Maps users for the last couple years , " says Shannon Guymon , product manager for Google Maps .
" There are over 50,000 signatures on a petition . "
The news thrilled bike advocates , who have for years been pushing – and petitioning – the search giant to include bike routes on Google Maps .
No longer do they have to rely upon paper maps or open - source DIY map hacking or crazy - cool helmet - mounted heads up iPhones .
" This new tool will open people 's eyes to the possibility and practicality of hopping on a bike and riding , " says Andy Clarke , president of the League of American Bicyclists .
" We know people want to ride more , we know it 's good for people and communities when they do ride more – this makes it possible .
It is a game - changer , especially for those short trips that are the most polluting . "
Cyclists will have to map their victory lap from their desks , because Google 's cool mapping tool is available only on a computer for now .
" Making the bike - route tool available on Google Maps for mobile devices is a high priority , ” Guymon says .
But it ’s a priority without a launch date .
To create the mapping tool , Google developed an algorithm that uses several inputs – including designated bike lanes or trails , topography and traffic signals – to determine the best route for riding .
The map sends you around , not over , hills .
But if you really want to tackle that Category 1 climb , you can click and drag the suggested route anywhere you like , just like you can with pedestrian or driving routes .
Users can suggest changes or make corrections to routes using the ever - present " report a problem " feature on Google Maps .
Google kicked its bike - mapping effort into high gear in October when it started using improved datasets that provided more specific information about trails , street details and more granularity on college campuses .
The Rails - to - Trails Conservancy provided Google with information on 12,000 miles of bike trails nationwide , and the League of American Bicyclists helped gather data on bike lanes and so forth .
“ We ’ve got a five - person team in Seattle that has spent the majority of its time working on this project since October , ” says Guymon .
To test the tool , bike - commuting Google employees vetted suggested routes against their own experience , pointing out discrepancies on routes or time allowances .
Google Maps for bikes has a unique look and feel .
Bike trails are prime cycling turf – " They 're like the highways for cyclists , " Guymon says – so they 're indicated in dark green .
Streets with dedicated bike lanes are light green .
And streets that do n't have a bike lane but are still a decent route because of their topography , light traffic or other factors are indicated by dotted green lines .
Do n't go looking for turn - by - turn GPS - based navigation though .
That feature remains strictly auto -centric .

Almost 170 years after Oliver Wendell Holmes read these words to the Boston Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge the pseudoscience of homeopathy continues to thrive .
An EU commission statement estimates that some 30 million people in the EU use homeopathy , while the WHO estimates that around 500 million in the world use it .
Since Wendell Holmes ' time a colossal body of evidence has been amounted showing that homeopathy has no medicinal effect beyond the placebo effect .
The core concepts of homeopathy fly in the face of science and logic .
homeopathy uses highly dilute solutions of a substance to treat disease .
Most homeopathic solutions are so dilute that there is almost no chance that they will contain even a single molecule of the original active agent .
Counterintuitively , homeopathic practitioners claim that the more dilute the solution , the stronger the homeopathic remedy .
This contradicts the well - known phenomenon of dose response , which says that the more of a chemical an organism is exposed to , the greater the effect .
Take one sleeping pill and it will help you sleep ; take two and the effect is even more powerful ; take 100 sleeping pills and you are not likely to wake up … ever !
On the other hand , homeopaths would suggest that the more dilute the solution , the more " powerful " the effect .
But how could a solution of something that does n't contain even a single molecule of active ingredient have any effect ?
Here , things get even more bizarre .
They suggest that water has memory .
Seemingly , water has the ability to remember contact with certain substances , while at the same time being able to forget all the raw sewage and fecal matter that it has been in contact with .
If homeopathy is nothing but water , why do so many people continue to believe it works ?
Scientists and sceptics who engage with advocates of homeopathy usually end up throwing their hands up in the air in frustration .
The reason is that most people who have come to believe in homeopathy do not do so based on scientific data or for particularly rational reasons .
As such , it is unlikely that anyone who did not come to a particular position based on logic or reason will be argued out of that position using logic and reason .
Indeed , no amount of rational argument will convince proponents of this modality that they are misguided .
Holmes was well aware of the ineffectiveness such an exercise , stating that " … it is impossible not to realize the entire futility of attempting to silence this asserted science by the flattest and most peremptory results of experiment .
"
It is tempting to criticise such beliefs on the grounds that the people who hold them are somehow lacking basic cognitive skills .
In fact , people who believe in all kinds of strange things are often very rational in other aspects of their life .
I would instead argue that the faulty thinking that many engage in is a byproduct of our mind works .
The human brain evolved not only to explain the world around us ; it evolved to deal with an innumerable amount of tasks .
Cultural transmission does not occur by downloading information , as was once believed , but rather is based on an inferential system .
We classify things in our environment into ontological categories .
Most things we encounter in our environment fall into one of the following groups : person , animal , natural object , tool and plant .
Each ontological category has a set of characteristics that define it and set it apart from other categories .
We make certain inferences about objects based on which ontological category it belongs to .
For instance , we are not surprised when a dog walks down the street but would find it strange if we saw an oak tree doing so .
Locomotion is part of our mental template for people and animals but not plants .
We find certain counter - intuitive notions more memorable than blander ones , a prerequisite for a successful meme .
Superstitious beliefs often combine ontological beliefs with a category violation .
For instance , disembodied souls and inanimate statues that can cry , hear or bleed represent category violations for a person and a natural object respectively .
However , not all superstitious beliefs are equally believable .
While the belief in ghosts is widespread , the belief that ghosts cannot think and have desires is virtually non-existent .
Violations must allow for further inferences , otherwise they result in cognitive dead ends .
Although few of my readers literally believe in superheroes and zombies , that does not stop us from making inferences about what their needs , wants and limits would be if they did exist .
The idea that water has memory is a categorical violation .
Memories are characteristic of a person or animal but not a natural object .
Crucially , the belief that water has memory does not block further cognitive inferences .
Conversely , we would find it much more difficult to believe that water remembers the substances that other water had been in contact with .
This type of belief is rare since it prevents us from making further inferences .
We have experience with the concept of remembering things that we have been in contact with but do n't have experience of what it is like to remember things other people have been in contact with .
People I met when I was younger — people who I have not seen for many years – still have an influence on me now .
Likewise , it is not such a large cognitive leap to believe that substances that came into contact with water still have an influence over it .
Another important component of homeopathy is vitalism .
The idea that we are more than just the aggregate of chemical and mechanical processes is an appealing one .
Vitalism appeals to our core intuitions .
Vitalists believe that the laws of science are inadequate to explain life processes .
There must be something more to it – a soul or some elan vital .
All of us operationally view ourselves as both body and mind , even those of us who outright reject the idea of a disembodied self or soul .
The self is not something that governs the brain , rather the self is the outcomes of brain processes .
However , our brain does a wonderful job of convincing us otherwise .
The father of homeopathy , Samuel Hahnemann , saw the vital force as a " spirit like " force that maintained life .
He believed that the inner vital force maintained the body 's internal balance .
When the body became ill it would push the illness outwardly , causing the symptoms of the disease or illness to manifest .
Many homeopaths believe that all disease come down to one thing — the disturbance of the vital force .
They believe that only homeopathic remedies stimulate the vital force into action .
Sympathetic or imitative magic is found in cultures the world over .
Sympathetic magic is based on two related concepts : the law of similarity and the law of contagion .
The former states that like things produce like effects , while the latter is the idea that items that have been in contact continue to affect each other .
Perhaps the best known example of sympathetic magic is the use of voodoo dolls to place a curse on a specific person .
Cargo cults would also engage in sympathetic magic by building landing strips and radio towers to encourage the airplanes that delivered them precious cargo during World War II to come back again .
In the past , whooping cough and a sore throat were often treated by tying knots in a piece of string and hanging it around the ill person 's neck .
The knots were supposed to symbolise the tightness in the person 's throat .
Liverworts have been used for hundreds of years as a cure ailments of the liver , probably because of the plant 's resemblance to the liver .
A cure for pneumonia was to tie the lungs of a sheep to the soles of the feet of a patient .
Golden objects and butter were commonly used as cures for jaundice .
It was believed that warts could be cured by rubbing them on a frog , most likely because of the frog 's warty appearance .
The use of oysters , rhinoceros horns and tiger penises as aphrodisiacs are all examples of sympathetic thinking .
The list goes on and on .
In a similar vein , homeopathy uses the concept of " like cures like . "
It is based on the idea that substances which produce symptoms similar to those of a particular illness can treat that illness .
For instance , homeopaths may treat a person suffering from hay fever with an onion extract , since both produce watery eyes and a runny nose .
The idea that water can still remember things it was previously in contact with , is an example of the " law of contagion . "
In this regard , homeopathy is similar to the concept of holy water that is common to many religions .
The brain processes that lead someone to believe in homeopathy exist in all of us .
Our mental capacities evolved to aid in our survival , with erroneous beliefs an emergent property of our intuitive psychology .
We are all prone to cognitive dissonance aversion , memory illusion , and confirmation bias .
Such cognitive traps are probably adaptive and essential to mental well - being .
The biologist Lewis Wolpert suggests that scientific thinking is in fact aberrant .
Science is a conscious departure from intuition and common sense .
Homeopathy is parasitic upon brain processes that originally evolved for other activities .
If we want to understand why people believe in homeopathy , we must first understand how such beliefs enlist our evolved mental capacities .

I do n’t listen to talk radio all that often , but appreciate all efforts from whatever quarter that get people rebelling against reckless government actions .
As far as I can tell , there ’s general talk radio consensus at this point that bailouts and stimulus packages do n’t help the economy .
But a huge hole remains — the perennial myth that “ World War II brought us out of the Great Depression . ”
As Bob Higgs has shown , in numerous scholarly as well as popular publications and interviews , the private sector of the economy continued to perform poorly throughout World War II and normal , civilian - oriented prosperity only resumed after the war , in 1946 .
The misconception that World War II was a period of prosperity apparently comes from measurements such as the unemployment rate falling from an estimated range of somewhere between 9 and 15 % in 1940 , down to 1.2 % in 1944 .
As Dr. Higgs points out , this is not surprising given that a total of 16 million people served in the military forces during the course of the war , and were thereby removed from the labor force .
Meanwhile , industry shifted to producing vast amounts of materiel to be destroyed — planes , ships , guns , etc .
If such production created prosperity , then building airplanes simply to crash them into the ocean would indeed be good economic policy .
At the same time , consumer goods became largely unavailable and / or rationed , and standards of living remained quite low .
Yet the attitude of “ shared privation for the common good ” in many ways made people feel no longer depressed despite the very real fact that the economy remained below pre-1929 levels of prosperity .
Thus , the Depression continued despite the end of idle labor or the perception of the people living at the time .
As Dr. Higgs points out :
diverting nearly 40 percent of the total labor force into military - related employment and producing mountains of guns and ammunition do not create genuine , sustainable prosperity , as people would discover if they tried to operate an economy on this basis for more than a brief period .
If the war is supposed to have ended the Depression , then why did n’t the end of the war plunge the country back into depression , or at least recession ?
Instead , despite more than 10 million men reentering the civilian work force and large - scale government spending ending with FDR ’s death and the war ’s end :
The year 1946 , when civilian output increased by about 30 percent , was the most glorious single year in the entire history of the U.S. economy .
By 1948 , real output was back on its long - run growth trend , and during the decades that followed , the economy was spared the sort of deep and long debacle that a congeries of wrongheaded government policies had caused during the 1930s .
This repudiation of Keynesianism by actual events should have sounded the death knell for the fatally flawed theory .
Yet Keynesianism instead continues to thrive , wreaking havoc upon yet another generation .
And the myth of wartime prosperity is simply part and parcel of this same theory that feeds further calls for large - scale government spending programs to “ stimulate ” the economy , “ create ” jobs , pursue bail - outs , or any other misdirection of resources from private to public hands .
As Ludwig von Mises observed , “ War prosperity is like the prosperity that an earthquake or a plague brings . ”
What will it take to get the message out ?
Android 's smartphone army is at least 20 phones strong , plus a ragtag rear guard of e-book readers , tablets and set - top boxes .
But those oddball devices bringing up the rear are running into an unexpected challenge : neglect by Google .
Android had been created by Google as an operating system for all mobile devices , not just smartphones .
The Open Handset Alliance , a consortium of companies that support Android , includes gadget makers that are not just focused on making smartphones .
Yet , the search giant has been treating other gadgets running Android as second - class citizens , denying them their own centralized app store and dragging its feet on putting in place a framework that would allow developers to easily create apps for these devices .
" Today Google is 100 percent focused on smartphones , " says Kevin Kitagawa , the director of strategic marketing for MIPS Technologies , whose processor architectures are used for home - entertainment and networking devices .
" Their compatibility tests only allow certification for these type of devices but we hope soon that Google will extend its support to other Android devices . "
Though Android is free and open source , Google exercises control over what devices can access the Android Market 's applications and receive extensive developer support .
And , currently , only smartphones running Android qualify .
That leaves other devices out in the cold .
Take Spring Design 's
Alex e-reader : The Alex runs Android and will start shipping next month , but the device has n't been certified by Google , and so it will have no access to the Android Market .
Spring CEO Priscilla
Lu says she 's confident Google will certify the Alex once the e-reader has gone through a few changes .
" We will get the certification as soon as the cellular connection is enabled , " says Lu . " The difficulty is in getting the cellular module approved by the FCC . "
" The Alex is really a smartphone with E Ink , " says Lu .
Not so fast .
Google requires " all hardware components have the same software APIs as defined in their SDK to be compatible , " says Kitagawa .
" This provides consistency to third - party developers that access these components , " he says .
That means devices always need to have some key components , such as touchscreens with a specified minimum resolution , a certain number of navigation keys , Wi -Fi , camera and accelerometer .
Devices such as the Alex e-reader or a digital picture frame do n't conform to these requirements .
" What Google has is a set of hardware requirements , down to the number of buttons and resolution of the screens , " says Al Sutton , who runs a company called FunkyAndroid that offers app stores for Android devices that are not supported by Google .
" Anyone can put Android on their device but at this point , if it 's not a smartphone they can't pass the certification test that will let them into the app store .
In late 2007 , Google unveiled the Android as a Linux - based , free , open source operating system for mobile devices that can be adopted by any hardware manufacturer .
The announcement opened the doors for many major electronics manufacturers that were looking to create new devices but wanted an operating system that would go beyond the traditional Linux or Windows .
Among those are Dell , whose upcoming tablet , the Mini 5 will run Android .
Separately , Google announced Chrome OS , another Linux - based operating system targeted at netbooks , PCs and other devices .
Both Android and Chrome OS would allow developers to create apps for the platform but Google has never made it clear what kind of devices should run which operating system , Chris Hazelton , research director , mobile and wireless with the 451 Group .
That means many consumer electronics makers rushed to put Android on their devices , largely because Android came out long before Chrome was even on the radar screen .
" At this point , I am not clear where Android ends and Chrome OS begins , " says Hazelton .
" I hope Google is having conversations with device vendors and they are mapping out where each OS has the advantage and how they are going to build an ecosystem of developers to create apps for both . "
MIPS and other companies say Google is trying to do that , but its attention has been divided and progress has been slow .
So far , Google has offered certification tests to ensure compatibility only for Android - based smartphones and Google 's Android Market app store remains limited to smartphones .
As a result , last year , a group of 40 companies , mostly manufacturers from Japan , created the Open Embedded Software Foundation .
The Foundation aims to create standardized development platforms for Android in consumer devices beyond the mobile phone , which would allow for proliferation of apps for set - top boxes and TVs .
" You are going to to see applications that are really tailored for the living room , " says Kitagawa .
" We are talking of apps that can be accessed through a remote control and optimized for large screens . "
A few app developers such as Home Jinni , an app for set - top boxes and TVs that run Android , are trying to pass Google 's compatibility tests , anyway .
Home Jinni is a media - center software based on open standards that collects content from different sources such as the web and peer - to - peer networks and offers support for voice applications .
Shidan Gouran , CEO of Home Jinni , says though the Android Market in its current form does n't have a place for his app , he is confident Google wo n't keep the doors shut on gadgets other than smartphones for too long .
For now , Gouran is inking deals individually with companies like MIPS to put the Home Jinni app on devices .
Meanwhile , he 's also created a version of the Home Jinni app for the Android Market so it can reach more users .
" The Android app store is not there yet for apps created for TVs , but I am pretty confident Google wants a piece of that market so it will make a place for us soon , " says Gouran .
Google declined to comment for this story .

( CNN ) -- Ireland 's top Catholic cardinal is using the " Nuremberg defense " in the face of public outrage at his role 35 years ago in investigating one of the country 's most notorious child - abusing priests , an activist said Tuesday .
Cardinal Sean Brady has been under fire over the investigation into the Rev. Brendan Smyth .
The latest scandal comes on the heels of a huge government - backed report that found the Archdiocese of Dublin and other Catholic Church authorities in Ireland covered up child abuse by priests from 1975 to 2004 .
Child sexual abuse was " widespread " then , the report found .
Brady 's office said Tuesday that the cardinal , then a priest and teacher with a doctorate in canon law , had been asked to investigate two complaints against Smyth in 1975 , but had no decision - making power .
He reported his findings to Bishop Francis McKiernan , his office said , and McKiernan recommended Smyth get psychiatric help .
But John Kelly , the founder of Irish Survivors of Child Abuse , said Brady should not have remained silent about what he learned in the course of investigating Smyth , who was later convicted of dozens of counts of child abuse in both Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic .
He died in prison .
" He 's basically using the Nuremberg defense , he was carrying out orders , " Kelly said , in reference to the justification many Nazis used in their war crimes trials after World War II .
There has been particular outrage over the revelation that two boys who filed complaints against Smyth were asked to sign confidentiality statements as part of Brady 's investigation .
The oaths of secrecy were " to avoid potential collusion " between the two boys as church officials investigated the case , Ireland 's Catholic Communications Office said Tuesday .
Despite his criticism of Brady , Kelly said it would not necessarily do any good for the cardinal to resign .
" He 's lost all moral authority to lead , but by replacing him , it wo n't resolve the problem , " he said , arguing that the Vatican would " just replace guys with other guys . "
The best solution , he said , would be for the Roman Catholic Church to let secular authorities deal with accusations of abuse , rather than trying to handle them itself .
" They have to accept secular authority , and they can get on with the business of religion , " Kelly said .
" It would be in the church 's own interest .
Resignations in themselves are n't the answer . "
Four Irish bishops tendered their resignations in the wake of the government - backed report , and Pope Benedict XVI is expected to make a formal statement , or pastoral letter , on the Irish abuse issue by Easter .
The pope himself has been under fire since it was revealed that a priest suspected of abusing children was allowed to move into his diocese when he was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger in Germany in 1980 .
The Archdiocese of Munich and Freising said in a statement Monday it must have been clear at the time that the priest , whom multiple sources identified to CNN as Peter Hullermann , was coming to get therapy for allegedly molesting children .
He was convicted of abuse in 1986 , after Ratzinger moved to Rome .
Hullermann was suspended on Monday .
Hundreds of allegations of sexual or physical abuse of children by Catholic clergy have come to light in Germany , Austria and the Netherlands this year .
CNN 's Frederik Pleitgen in Berlin , Germany , contributed to this report .
The deviously young McCain correctly noted that the overt racism expressed by old fogies like Tom Tancredo at the Tea Party convention , would likely repel those of her generation .
Beck 's reaction to this is downright psychotic as he damns a whole generation as commie dupes .
Beck : Lenin had a phrase for people like these .
They were called " useful idiots . "
I think a lot of our twenty - somethings are becoming useful idiots .
One of those useful idiots seems to be Meghan McCain .
She is John McCain 's like totally awesome like daughter .
Only Beck could find an association to Lenin in McCain 's words .
The sentence fragment that Beck extracted to vent his outrage was when McCain said that " revolutions start with young people . "
That sent Beck into a frenzy of mockery .
He slipped into his " stupid person " voice ( which is indistinguishable from his regular voice ) and grumbled sarcastically about what idiots old people are .
Of course McCain never came even close to implying that .
The whole of her commentary had to do with how the lack of young people in a " movement " like the Tea Crusades would doom it to failure .
After relentlessly deriding McCain for several wasted minutes , Beck eventually came up for air and admitted that she was right after all - revolutions do start with young people .
But in Beck 's interpretation it was the young who were exploited by elderly radicals .
Perhaps Beck , the historian and fan of Founding Fathers , is referring to doddering old revolutionaries like Thomas Jefferson ( 32 years old in 1775 ) , John Jay ( 30 ) , James Madison ( 24 ) , Alexander Hamilton ( 20 ) , Thomas Paine ( 38 ) , and that ancient eminence George Washington ( 43 ) .
The point of Beck 's breakdown seems to have been that Obama and the progressives are trying to turn kids against their parents and undermine the family unit - the foundation of American society .
It 's all tied into the battle for the sanctity of marriage and a kind of senior superiority .
He belittles the notion that there is anything that adults could learn from their kids .
Presumably Crosby , Stills , and Nash were in on this child endangerment plot 40 years ago when they recorded " Teach Your Children " which included a verse aimed at the kids to teach their parents as well .
How sad for Beck and his own kids .
I assume they never talk back to him or express ( or even form ) their own opinions .
He appears to advocate a philosophy of parenting that requires children to be obedient and silent .
He seems to believe that past generations never had any of the natural tension that accompanies growing up .
He regards children as appendages with no inherent value of their own .
At one point he reduces the youthful quest for knowledge to nothing more than a lustful obsession and uses himself as an example of how petty and narrow - minded young people are .
I 'm sure he 's right as regards himself , but he certainly does n't have any appreciation for the intellectual curiosity and experiential adventurism that makes youth such a vibrant and fulfilling chapter of life .
Beck played some videos he found on the Organizing for America web site ( a DNC project ) that showed young folks describing their efforts to get their parents interested in voting .
Beck characterized this an Obama affront to the biblical mandate to honor thy father and thy mother .
Those kids should keep their mouths shut and follow their parents ' example .
Any exhibition of individuality or free will must be nipped in the bud .
And any encouragement of such behavior is , in Beck 's demented eyes , a conspiracy to corrupt the young and produce a generation of socialist drones .
This is yet another Beckian sermon that elevates dogma over free thought .
In the name of familial harmony , what Beck is actually promoting is parental tyranny and abuse .
This might be a good time to review a bit of Beck 's biographical history .
His parents were divorced when he was quite young , thus despoiling the sanctity of his family .
He lived with his mother until she committed suicide when he was thirteen .
Now , what was that about following your parents example .

" In many theories , the Sun perturbs the values of the constants by a factor roughly proportional to the Sun 's Newtonian gravitational potential , which scales as the inverse of distance , r , between the Earth and the Sun .
Since r fluctuates annually , reaching a minimum at perihelion in early January and a maximum at aphelion in July , the values of the constants , as measured here on Earth , should also oscillate in a similar seasonal manner . "

Is n't 10E - 17 good enough precision ?
Well , maybe 10E - 23 is better , but the first is good enough to me .
In terms of where to seek change in alpha ; I 'd guess that it will be out of the planetary plane : one satellite did go there , but no anomalies were reported as far as I know .

Numbers seem to rule our identities — telephone numbers , social security numbers , bank account numbers .
The same is true for Nature , where the equations of physics rely on a set of precise digits , such as the speed of light or an electron ’s charge .
Nobody knows why Nature ’s numbers , known as the fundamental constants , take the values that they do , but we do know that a slightly altered set of fundamental constants would dial up a vastly different universe .
Now some physicists are questioning whether these constants are , well , constant after all , and what the implications of their variation would be .
Changing constants could signpost the existence of extra dimensions , or new fundamental forces , for instance .
In particular , physicists are scrutinizing the , or , which governs the strength of the electromagnetic force .
If alpha were just four percent larger , carbon would not have been produced in stars ; four percent smaller and we would n’t have oxygen .
In other words , tinker too much with alpha and life as we know it could not exist .
Physicists ’ faith in alpha ’s constancy was first shaken in 1999 , by a group of astronomers led by John Webb of the University of New South Wales ( UNSW ) , Australia .
Webb ’s team used the Keck telescope in Hawaii to study light from bright galaxies at the edge of the universe — called quasars — that had been absorbed by interstellar clouds .
The clouds absorb certain wavelengths of light from the quasars and produce spectral lines ; the spacing of these lines depends on the value of alpha .
The team ’s results suggested that alpha ’s value was one thousandth of a percent smaller 10 billion years ago .
That change may sound tiny , but the implications were huge .
" It was a paradigm shift , " says Dmitry Budker , of the University of California at Berkeley .
What ’s at stake is our handbook for how the universe works : alpha is one of 26 numbers in the Standard Model of particle physics , which describes all known particles , the electromagnetic force , the weak force that governs radioactivity , and the strong force that determines how subatomic particles are bound together within the nucleus .
" Seeing varying constants would be a smoking gun for new physics , " says physicist Doug Shaw at Queen Mary University in London , UK .
That " new physics " could take the form of the elusive theory of everything ( TOE ) that physicists hope will link together the Standard Model and gravity .
Some candidate TOEs , such as string theory , require the existence of tiny curled - up extra dimensions .
If these exist , then the constants we measure are just four - dimensional shadows of the true constants found in the higher dimensional fundamental theory .
The constants would vary as the size and shape of the extra dimensions evolve , explains Shaw .
" Varying constants would help eliminate competing theories to explain the origins of the universe , " he says .
Sounds good , but in the decade since Webb ’s team found that tantalizing evidence of a varying alpha , other astronomers have found contradictory quasar results .
The wrangling over alpha ’s ( in ) constancy continues .
Budker hopes to end the controversy by searching for evidence for a varying alpha in the lab , backed by two grants totaling $ 255,000 , from the Foundational Questions Institute .
His team have been measuring the frequency of radio waves absorbed by atoms of dysprosium — an element with energy levels that are exceptionally sensitive to changes in alpha — over a number of years .
If that radio frequency changes over time , then they know that alpha has changed .
The experiment is sensitive to changes of a few parts in ten million billion per year .
So far , Budker ’s team has not found any significant variation in alpha .
But they have set more stringent limits on its value , while others are joining the quest to pin down alpha in the lab .
The dysprosium atom essentially works as an , whose ’ ticks ’— set by different energy levels in the atom — are extremely sensitive to the value of alpha .
Other experimenters are exploiting the fact that energy transitions in different atomic clocks have different dependencies on alpha .
If two clocks , based on two different atoms are synchronized and left to run for a year , then any change in alpha will show up in a difference in the two clocks ’ time - keeping .
Calculations by various physicists , including Shaw and independently Victor Flambaum at UNSW , also show that alpha could be affected by the Sun ’s gravitational pull ( see , for example , arxiv.org/abs/1002.4528 ) .
Atomic clock experiments are already testing this idea by searching for seasonal variations in alpha due to the Earth ’s changing distance to the Sun .
"
The advances in the precision that they ’ve achieved in lab tests over the past few years is remarkable , " says Shaw .
The accuracy is now better than one part in one hundred million billion — one in 10 — and is still improving .
If there is a change in alpha it ’s smaller than this .
The lab experiments are now so precise that some people think they are closing in on the quasar data .
" The most recent lab results have gone below the level at which you ’d expect to see a variation if the quasar result is true , " says Shaw .
Flambaum , a co-author of the original quasar publication , says that this does not necessarily mean that the quasar results suggesting that alpha varies were wrong .
It may be that alpha varied in the past but is now constant .
"
You cannot compare the cosmological measurements with the laboratory measurements directly , as it depends on the interpretive model , " he says .
" Things have to be cleared up , " agrees Budker .
" There is serious evidence , and there is ongoing controversy .
" While alpha seems to have passed this round of atomic tests , things are about to get tougher .
The next generation of clocks — nuclear clocks — will make use of nuclear resonance frequencies to set the clock ticking at a faster rate than can be achieved in atomic clocks .
As a result they could be up to a million times more sensitive to changes in alpha , says Flambaum .
Cosmologists are also scouring the relic radiation of the big bang — the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) — for hints of a varying alpha in the early universe .
Studies of the latest CMB data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe also suggest that alpha is boringly constant .
However , new CMB data is being collected by the Planck satellite , and physicists still have a battery of other space tests for alpha .
So important is the task of uncovering whether the ’ constants ’ belie their name , it forms part of the European Space Agency ’s Cosmic Vision for 2015 - 2025 .
The planned STEP and MICROSCOPE satellite missions will take a less direct route for testing alpha along with another fundamental constant — the mass ratio of the electron to the proton .
Tests on board will investigate what might be causing the constants to vary — that is , any changes in the size and shape of extra dimensions — by searching for new forces that evolving extra dimensions may induce .
These forces may be small and would be masked on Earth by background vibrations , such as traffic on a nearby road .
In space , however , they could cause test masses to move .
If alpha is found to vary , it will open up many more questions about why nature seems so particular about its numbers , says Budker .
" If we discover that alpha varies , this will not be an answer , but it will take our understanding of the universe a huge leap forward .

It 's an immutable law of comedy — under no circumstances may a comic use another performer 's material .
Naturally , with so many comics making observations about the world around them , similarities are bound to exist between one guy 's airplane food joke and another's .
Allegations of joke lifting are common , with top - tier talent like Conan O'Brien and Amy Schumer often having accusations thrown their way ( Schumer , for her part , vehemently denies any thievery ) .
But throughout standup 's history , some similarities have been too close to ignore .
1. MILTON BERLE
The late , great star of stage , screen , radio and TV was once the nation 's most popular comedian , earning him a 30 - year television contract with NBC and the endearing nickname Uncle Miltie .
But to many of his fellow performers , Berle became known by the much less affectionate nickname " The Thief of Bad Gag "  for his legendary penchant for joke lifting .
Fellow legend and occasional enemy Bob Hope once remarked that Berle " never heard a joke he did n't steal . "
In another instance , Jack Benny defended his own practice of using Berle 's material by saying : " When you take a joke away from Milton Berle , it 's not stealing , it 's repossessing . "
Unlike many other accused bit - thieves , Berle never went out of his way to dispel the reputation , once joking to Larry King : " I do n't steal people 's jokes .
I just find them before they 're lost . " 
2. CARLOS MENCIA
The former star of Comedy Central 's Mind of Mencia has been accused of plagiarism by everyone from George Lopez — who once claimed he roughed - up Mencia over a supposedly stolen set — to South Park .
However , the most famous example was shared with the world thanks to a viral video posted by comedian Joe Rogan .
In the footage , Rogan is shown running onstage to confront Mencia during a 2007 performance at the Comedy Store in L.A.
Among other , more colorful names , Rogan refers to Mencia as " Men-Steal - ia . " 
3. DANE COOK
Dane Cook reached the pinnacle of stand - up comedy success in 2005 when his album Retaliation went all the way to # 4 on the Billboard chart .
Sold - out large - arena gigs , movie flops , and tabloid coverage quickly followed — and all served to fuel a rabid anti-Dane movement within the comedy world .
With that came an intense microscope on Cook 's material and , predictably , a rash of joke swiping charges .
The most well - known example includes a Cook bit that bears a suspicious resemblance to an earlier one by Louis C.K. — one of the most revered comics working today .
Although compilations seem to confirm that Cook has used at least three of his bits , Louis C.K. has mostly downplayed it — " I 'm not going to do anything about this .
I 'm not going to court over a bit called ' Itchy A * * hole , ' "  he once joked .
Just for good measure and consistency , Joe Rogan has also accused Cook of lifting jokes .
4. ROBIN WILLIAMS
Long before he was an Oscar winner , Robin Williams was known to comics as a major material thief .
He was even alleged to have used other comedians ' material on Johnny Carson 's Tonight Show .
One well - traveled anecdote claims that when fellow comics spotted Williams in the audience of a comedy club , they would immediately stop their act to prevent him from writing down their best jokes .
According to Richard Zoglin's book Comedy at the Edge , David Brenner once asked Williams ' agent to " Tell Robin if he ever takes one more line from me , I 'll rip his leg off and shove it up his [ bleep ] ! "
Williams discussed his younger days in comedy and of not understanding the consequences of borrowing material with Marc Maron in 2010 ; he once playfully referred to the practice as " joke sampling . " 
5. JAY MOHR

The former host of Last Comic Standing is an admitted comedy plagiarist .
In his 2004 book Gasping For Airtime , which recounts his tumultuous two - season stint on Saturday Night Live , Mohr details an infamous incident in which he took a New York comedian 's joke and turned it into a sketch .
NBC was forced to settle with the joke 's originator , but Mohr himself escaped any serious repercussions .
6. DENIS LEARY

The former star of Rescue Me has been accused of stealing not only some material but his entire stage persona from the late cult comic Bill Hicks .
He 's also been accused of lifting material from former stand - up and Hollywood heavyweight Judd Apatow and Louis C.K.
But Hicks himself , who was close friends with Leary , severed his friendship with him over the number of lifted jokes used on Leary 's No Cure for Cancer album .
" I have a scoop for you .
I stole his act , " Hicks joked with Austin Comedy News in 1993 .
" I camouflaged it with punchlines , and to really throw people off , I did it before he did . "
Hicks passed away from cancer the following year .

Who would hire the first legal male hooker in the country ?
A desperate spinster ?
A lonely divorcee ?
A New York Post reporter on undercover assignment ?
Answer :
All of the above .
This month , as Nevada anointed the country ’s first - ever legal male prostitute — in the form of “ Markus , ” a 25 - year - old beefy ex-Marine — it became incredibly clear that one thing had to happen immediately .
The Post had to have a go at this gigolo .
SEE THE PHOTOS
A $ 500 cash advance , an overnight flight to Vegas and a 2 1/2 - hour car ride later , I arrive at the brothel .
I ’m sweaty , stinky and pumped from listening to “ lite - romance ” radio .
Because truly : Nothing gets you in the mood for a legal male hooker like “ Wind Beneath My Wings . ”
At 3 p.m. , I arrive at the appropriately titled Shady Lady Ranch for my two - hour booking ( Prices : $ 200 for 40 minutes , $ 300 for one hour .
And sorry , ladies — he ca n’t go back to back “ because he puts so much into it ” ) .
The scene : mostly dust , sunlight and sadness .
That , and the occasional sign about the importance of using latex condoms .
“ Markus ” ( real name : Patrick ) greets me in glasses , a satin blue shirt and slacks , and leads me to a bedroom where we sit opposite each other as I fumble for the cash out of my “ Precious Moments ” pocketbook .
“ First thing we do is visual inspection , ” explains the dorky college dropout who later confesses I am only his second client , he has been with a total of six women in his life , and , to be perfectly honest , he lost his virginity at 23 .
“ So , ” Markus says after leaning over and kissing my knee , “ we ’re going to get undressed and then take a shower .
Then we can both inspect each other to make sure there are no discrepancies . ”
Minutes later , as we ’re standing naked in the shower , he ’s examining me like a second - rate gynecologist and nodding .
“ Yeah , ” he murmurs , cooing that I ’m “ practically ” an 8 or a 9 .
“ Everything looks great down there . ”
Oh . My. God .
Over the next two hours , Markus shares his personal bits , too .
Originally from Hatton , Ala. , he felt abandoned by his mother after his parents divorced at an early age .
( This is why , he says , he got into male prostitution , to find the intimacy that he lacked . )
In addition to comparing himself to civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks ( “ I ’m breaking through sexual segregation ” ) , he also identifies with Lady Gaga ( “ I ’m a performer ” ) , van Gogh ( “ I ’m an artist ” ) and Moby ( “ I ’m an eccentric ” ) .
Before becoming America ’s first legal “ prosti- dude , ” Markus dabbled in porn while he lived in Los Angeles but quit after just two scenes because he found it too degrading to women .
Also , he was homeless for a few months before he learned about this fantastic opportunity to become a sex - worker pioneer at Shady Lady .
To explain my visit , I tell him I do n’t have much luck with men , watch a lot of porn , want to learn more and would be delighted if he simply “ put on a show ” for me .
Now , to answer the question on your mind : No . I did not sleep with him .
It was like a bad second date .
That cost $ 500 .
“ You have a beautiful body , ” he tells me .
He kisses my back .
“ You even taste good , ” he says .
Then he brings out his little “ trick box , ” as he calls it , but such is his luck today , he ca n’t find the lubricant he says is crackerjack for making women climax .
Not so fast , Markus .
“ Why do n’t you give me a massage ? ” I say .
He says he ’s never had an STD and does n’t worry about getting women pregnant ( “ because you can feel it when a condom breaks ” ) .
He repeatedly asks to show me his abilities and flicks out his scarily Gene Simmons - esque tongue which totally turns me off .
Who wants a man this eager ?
“ I ’m not a hooker , ” he says repeatedly .
“ I ’m a surrogate lover . ”
While Merril Bainbridge ’s “ When I Kiss Your Mouth ” plays embarrassingly in the background ( I did not make out with him ) , we ’re interrupted by the sound of an occasional honk from a peacock roaming outside and , from the lobby , the intermittent sounds of giggling female hookers .
His recently shaved body is quite fit ( he works out daily at the brothel , where he lives ) and covered in tattoos , including a Chinese character meaning “ to seek . ”
He is 5 - foot - 9 , and , um , very well - endowed .
I have so many questions .
“ Do you use Viagra ? ”
“ No Viagra , ” he says .
“ No Enzyte . ”
And he says he does n’t date outside of work .
“ I wo n’t be able to perform . ”
When I ask Markus why he waited so long to have sex ( remember : he lost it at 23 ) , he says it ’s because “ no one wanted me . ”
How funny , I observe , that he became a male prostitute .
“ I think there was a definite plan , ” he says .
“ Like . . . ? ” I ask .
Yes , he says .
Like a divine plan .
Destiny .
In case it ever comes up , Markus says he ’s learned much of his sexual technique from the “ Karma Sutra , ” and the reason he ’s such a good lover is because he was “ sensory deprived ” by his mother .
“ I ’ve healed people , ” he says of his lovemaking ability , which most recently included his first client — a 45 - year - old woman who had n’t been laid in two years and in Markus ’ words “ was wild as a bug . ”
He also loves cooking French cuisine .
Favorite meal : chicken cordon bleu .
“ I love being caressed , ” he says .
“ You know that Chris Rock joke , ” I ask him , “ about how all a father wants to do is keep his daughter off the pole ?
You ’re like the male equivalent .
All a mom wants to do is keep her kid from becoming a gigolo . ”
He laughs .
He reveals his fantasy that he would love to be roughed up by a lady cop with her baton .
In the hot tub , he says he likes to be spanked and told he ’s a bad little boy .
At some point , for comedic effect , I say , “ Come to mama . ”
“ I do n’t believe in therapy , ” he says as he holds my hand in the red heart - shaped whirlpool while he lights the vanilla candles around us .
“ I think this is therapy . ”
I ask him again about the Viagra .
Because . . . surely ?
“ No , ” he says .
“ I just have to have attention , you know .
“ Touch me all you want , ” he continues .
“ You ’re not getting the full experience , I ’m telling you . ”
As romantic as that sounds , I tell him how much it turns me on to hear about something romantic .
He looks genuinely befuddled .
“ Let me think , ” he says .
“ Like what , like being on a horse ranch ? ”
He tells me that if you can “ pronunciate ” words well , it means you are great at pleasuring a woman .
He ’s half Irish , a quarter Native American , a quarter Scandinavian and all lover .
Favorite book : “ 1984 . ” Favorite movie : “ Braveheart . ”
Actor he ’s like : “ Steve - O . ” Musician he ’s like : “ Moby , ” or — wait for it — “ Choppin ” ( meaning Chopin ) .
“ The concept of beauty has changed over the years , ” he continues .
“ It ’s like the cave paintings .
Venus de Milo .
It used to be the voluptuous woman , ” he says as he eyes me up and down .
Hold up , hold up .
“ Did you just call me fat ? ” I ask .
Then he asks me to spank him .
“ Maybe you should go to a dominatrix psychologist ? ” I helpfully suggest .
“ No , ” he says .
“ I ’m in paradise . ”
After a long talk , a massage and his repeated pleadings to caress him , the two hours are up ( he went 10 minutes over but still wanted to give me another massage so I had to call time ) and the session ends .
As he escorts me outside , he just wants to know : Did he satisfy me ?
“ Uh , ” I say , “ yeah .
Sure . ”
Markus starts to walk me to my car and an older man — Jim Davis , the madam ’s husband — stops him .
“ You got your stuff to do , ” he reminds him .
Markus has taught me so much .
About what a gigolo should never , ever , ever do .
“ Women do n’t want sex so much as companionship , ” he concludes .
“ Women can be a prostitute .
But not men . ”
Sure , Markus .

As per the latest upcoming from the China Daily , the largest illegal hacker training and recruitment portal in China has been shut down by police .
The operation was planned , executed by a team size of 50 .
In the action , 3 people have been taken into custody along with million dollars worth assets .
The allegations were that the group ran a site called Black Hawk Safety
Net which offered various exploits , DDoS , readymade software .
Along with them were bundled viruses , trojans that could cause havocs in minutes .
It is said that Black Hawk had around 200,000 members running on 9 servers , 5 PCs all of which are now shutdown .
The business had been running over the span of 5 years , and the owners managed to collect more than $ 1 million as membership fees .
Apart form distributing all the malware , paid members were even taught on how to write programs designed to steal all kinds of accounts for profit .
“ I could download trojan programs from the site which allowed me to control other people ’s computers .
I did this just for fun but I also know that many other members could make a fortune by attacking other people ’s accounts , ” said a 23 - year - old member of Black Hawk Safety Net in Nanjing of East China ’s Jiangsu province , who asked to remain anonymous .
“ It is not very difficult to do simple hacker tasks .
Some hacker members are teenagers who dropped out of school and make money by stealing accounts , ” he said .
A 20 - year - old college student who registered with three different hacker training sites said a hacker training course costs from 100 to 2,000 yuan .
“ Basically students were told how to steal accounts and use trojan programs .
Sometimes trainers show us how to write programs , ” he said .
“ But now it ’s very difficult to become a registered member .
Some well - known hacker training sites have not been accessible since November , ” he said .
As per a report , the hacker industry in China caused losses of 7.6 billion yuan in 2009 alone .
On the other side , It is predicted that same hackers could have been involved in the Google hacking case .
For what we know , Aurora was pretty advanced attack .
It wo n’t be a surprise even if that kind of attack was done by a script kiddie .
It ’s evident that Hacking as a Service ( HaaS ) is accelerating faster than what we have seen in the past .
At least for now Chinese government seems to be getting serious over the issue .

Last week Jeremy Clark from Adobe and I unveiled the first glimpse of the Wired Reader at TED .
Above , you ’ll see a video , narrated by Jeremy and Wired Creative Director Scott Dadich , who led our tablet team , that shows more .
It explains why the tablet is such a groundbreaking opportunity for magazines such as ours .
What Jeremy and I showed was not a CGI demo or concept — it was running live code with real copy .
The content was created in Adobe InDesign , as is the case for the print magazine , with the same designers adding interactive elements , from photo galleries and video to animations , along with adapting the designs so it looks great in both portrait and landscape orientation .
This is a departure from the usual web model , where a different team repurposes magazine content into HTML , unavoidably losing much of the visual context in the process .
Wired.com is not a re-purposed version of the magazine , but rather an separately - produced news service .
Although the Wired Reader starts as an AIR app , Adobe has created tools that allow us to easily convert it for major tablet and mobile platforms .
In Barcelona this week , Adobe announced that AIR would run on Android , and Adobe has already announced its Packager for iPhone tool that will allow Flash apps ( including AIR ) to run on Apple mobile platforms .
And AIR already runs natively on Mac , Windows and Linux operating systems .
But enough of the technical details .
The point here is that we are entering a new era of media , where we finally have a digital platform that allows us to retain all the rich visual features of high - gloss print , from lavish design to glorious photography , while augmenting it with video , animations , additional content and full interactivity .
We ’re one of the first magazines to go beyond the concept stage with this , and the demo we showed at TED and in the above video reflects months of real tablet production as we prepare to go live this summer .
Much is still to be answered about magazines and other media on this emerging class of devices , from the business and distribution models to the consumer response .
But what is already clear is that they offer the opportunity to be beautiful , highly engaging and immersive , going beyond what ’s available on the web .
I think tablets are going to sell like hotcakes , in part because they offer such an intimate , rich media experience .
We ’re betting big on them , as you can see , but this is just a taste .
Stay tuned for a full release this summer .

A chilly , sluggish chameleon can still deliver a good tongue - lashing .
High - speed video images show the lizards can catch prey with their rubber band - like tongues equally well whether their body temperature is a cool 15 °C or a warmer 35 °C .
Cold - blooded animals are typically less active – with a corresponding decline in hunting performance – when temperatures drop .
Not so for chameleons .
Chris Anderson and Stephen Deban of the University of South Florida in Tampa filmed veiled chameleons ( Chamaeleo calyptratus , pictured ) catching prey at different temperatures .
They found the muscles that coil the tongue into a spring - loaded structure were slower to contract at low temperatures .
But once loaded , the tongue uncoils equally fast in warm and cool climes .
“ This allows chameleons to take advantage of feeding opportunities early in the morning when they have not yet been able to elevate their core body temperature , ” says Anderson .

The projectile tongue ’s secret is coiled collagen .
Muscle spring - loads the collagen , which , unlike muscle , is not slowed by cooler temperatures .
“ So while a cold chameleon can catch prey just as fast as a warm one , it takes a lot longer to deliver this meal to the mouth , ” says Ulrike Müller of California State University in Fresno .

A Los Angeles jury concluded Monday that Anthem Blue Cross should cover the cost of an out - of - state liver transplant that a California man paid for after the insurer balked .
In addition , the jury ordered Blue Cross to pay plaintiff Ephram Nehme ’s legal expenses , which could dwarf the $ 206,000 cost of the transplant .
Blue Cross approved Nehme ’s liver transplant in late 2006 , and he was on the waiting list at UCLA Medical Center .
But the company refused to pay when Nehme , gravely ill and fearing for his life , decided to have the operation in Indiana , where wait times are far shorter than in California .
The jury , which included at least three members with Blue Cross medical coverage , voted 10 to 2 that the company breached its contract with Nehme .
It voted 9 to 3 that the health insurer acted in bad faith by refusing to pay for the out - of - state operation .
The panel deliberated for less than two days .
“ The message here is that you ca n’t take people ’s money , promise to protect them , and then leave them to die in their time of need , ” said Nehme ’s lawyer , Scott Glovsky .
At a hearing set for next week , Glovsky said he would seek to broaden the jury ’s verdict under the state ’s unfair competition law .
He will ask Superior Court Judge Kenneth Freeman to order Blue Cross to allow its California members to pursue organ transplants at hospitals nationwide that do business with its parent , Indianapolis - based WellPoint Inc. , the nation ’s largest health insurer .
In a statement , Blue Cross acknowledged “ the jury ’s determination that Mr. Nehme ’s transplant should have been approved by Anthem Blue Cross despite the fact that Mr. Nehme ’s Anthem Blue Cross contract states that transplants must be performed only at California Centers of Excellence . ”
“ While we disagree with the jury ’s coverage determination , we are pleased that the jury did not award punitive damages and unanimously concluded that Anthem Blue Cross did not act with any malice toward Mr. Nehme , ” the company said .
A spokeswoman said the company had not decided whether it would appeal .
Blue Cross also said it offered to settle the case with Nehme several months ago for more money than the jury awarded .
“ It is unfortunate that the time spent by the jury and the considerable costs of this trial could have been avoided , ” the company said in its statement .
Nehme , a 62 - year - old produce merchant and grandfather , said the case was not about money .
Before the trial began he pledged to donate any winnings to liver research .
Nehme said he saw the suit as a way to pressure Blue Cross to stop denying out - of - state transplants , adding that he was particularly concerned about patients who could not afford to pay out of pocket .
“ I ’m trying to save lives , ” Nehme said when the trial began Feb. 22 .
“ There are a lot of people who need liver transplants , and they should be able to get them wherever they need them . ”
Nehme ’s liver began to fail in 2006 , and he was placed in line for a transplant at UCLA .
Blue Cross readily approved the procedure at the hospital , which is part of its contracted network .
But Nehme ’s condition rapidly deteriorated , and his UCLA physician urged him to go to the Clarian Transplant Center in Indianapolis , where he had sent other patients .
At the time , the median wait time for livers at UCLA was more than two years .
At Clarian , an Indiana University - affiliated hospital , the wait time was about six weeks .
When Blue Cross refused to pay , Nehme went anyway and picked up the cost of the January 2007 operation .
He recovered and returned to work as the owner of produce markets in the Simi and San Fernando valleys .
His suit contended that Blue Cross denied the Indiana transplant to save money .
The verdict arrives as President Obama , stumping for healthcare reform , has been railing against insurance company denials of medical treatment , recalling his mother ’s fights with an insurer when she had cancer .
It also comes amid growing outrage over premium increases imposed by Blue Cross and other insurers .
Nehme ’s premium , for example , increased 50 % March 1 to $ 1,500 a month .

' You 're going on a f****** diet ' :
What surgeon told obese woman who said she preferred the word ' lifestyle '
The surgeon was reprimanded for his foul language ( file picture )
A New Zealand surgeon has been reprimanded for telling a severely obese patient she was ‘ going on a f*** ing diet ’ .
The surgeon , known as ‘ Dr B ’ , used the work ‘ f ***’ at least three times after the woman told him she did not like the word ‘ diet ’ .
She preferred the term ‘ lifestyle ’ , the New Zealand Herald reported .
After she complained about his language , he wrote to her , claiming they no longer had a ‘ therapeutic relationship ’ .
He then punished her by removing her from his waiting list for gastric bypass surgery .
The doctor admitted using bad language and was asked to attend a communication skills course by New Zealand ’s Health and Disability Commissioner , Ron Paterson .
He added the surgeon ’s conduct had been insulting and unprofessional .
The 44 - year - old Maori woman , who works full - time and reportedly swims three times a week had repeatedly failed at dieting , quickly regaining weight after relapsing .
In her letter of complaint she wrote : ‘[ The doctor ] said if I could n’t handle the word diet then he challenged my motivation and stated that I would never survive surgery because I was still b******** ing myself and therefore my thinking was still f***ed . ’
 This is Big Brother at its worst .  ~ Congressman Ted Poe ( R - TX )
Over the past several years , I have been barraged with emails from Americans expressing their dismay over the American Community Survey , the latest census form to hit randomly selected households on a continuous basis .
Unlike the traditional census , which collects data every ten years and is now underway , the American Community Survey is taken every year at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars .
And at 28 pages ( with an additional 16 - page instruction packet ) , it contains some of the most detailed and intrusive questions ever put forth in a census questionnaire .
These concern matters that the government simply has no business knowing , including a persons job , income , physical and emotional health , family status , place of residence and intimate personal and private habits .
As one frustrated survey recipient , Beth , shared with me :
When we first read through the American Community Survey , we thought it was an ID theft scam .
I showed it to a lawyer friend of mine .
She had never heard of the survey and warned it could be a scam .
She said if shed received this , she would call her congressman and senator to find out if scams such as this were happening to warn others .
So I called Washington DC .
They in turn told me to call our senators office in my state  which I did .
I was referred to the Justice Department , who then referred me to my county representative .
When I called my county representative , my call was shifted to a Census Bureau employee placed in their offices to field questions about the survey .
The Census Bureau representative told me the survey was not a scam .
She could not tell me whether or not to fill it out , but said if we chose not to , there could be hefty fines and jail time associated with not doing so .
She was no help at all and was evasive in answering my questions .
As Beth found out , the survey is not voluntary .
Answering the questions is not a polite request from the Census Bureau .
You are legally obligated to answer .
If you refuse , the fines are staggering .
For every question not answered , there is a $ 100 fine .
And for every intentionally false response to a question , the fine is $ 500 .
Therefore , if a person representing a two - person household refused to fill out any questions or simply answered nonsensically , the total fines could range from upwards of $ 10,000 and $ 50,000 for noncompliance .
While the penalties for not answering are outrageous , the questions , as Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) has said , are both ludicrous and insulting .
For example , the survey asks how many persons live in your home , along with their names and detailed information about them such as their relationship to you , marital status , race and their physical , mental and emotional problems , etc .
The survey also asks how many bedrooms and bathrooms you have in your house , along with the kind of fuel used to heat your home , the cost of electricity , what type of mortgage you have , the amount of your monthly mortgage payments , property taxes and so on .
This questionnaire also requires you to detail how many days you were sick last year , how many automobiles you own , whether you have trouble getting up the stairs and , amazingly , what time you leave for work every morning and how long it takes you to get there .
When faced with the prospect that government agents could covertly enter your home and rifle through your personal belongings , do you really want the government knowing exactly when you re away from home ?
As if the surveys asinine questions and highly detailed inquiries into your financial affairs werent bad enough , you re also expected to violate the privacy of others by supplying the names and addresses of your friends , relatives and employer .
And the questionnaire stipulates that you provide such information on the people in your home as their educational levels , how many years of schooling they completed , what languages they speak and when they last worked at a job , among other things .

Americans being ordered by the government to inform and spy on your family and friends ?
It s not too far off from the scenario George Orwell envisioned in his futuristic novel Nineteen Eighty - Four .
 The family ,  writes Orwell , had become in effect an extension of the Thought Police .
It was a device by means of which everyone could be surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately . 
Granted , some of the questions in the American Community Survey may appear fairly routine .
However , the danger rests in not knowing exactly how the government plans to use this vast amount of highly personal information .
For instance , if the financial information you provide on the survey does not jive with your tax returns , whether such a discrepancy was intentional or not , could you be flagged for an IRS audit ?
Given the increasing amount of collusion taking place between government agencies in recent years , I wouldnt rule it out .
Another concern with this intrusive questionnaire is that it signifies yet another inroad into the establishment of a permanent surveillance state .
Everywhere we look these days , we are either being watched , taxed or some bureaucrat is placing another bit of information in our government files .
Now with the American Community Survey , the federal bureaucracy is thrusting its expansive tentacles toward us in an attempt to invade every aspect of our lives .
This survey also hints at a dangerous wedding of governmental and corporate interests  a merger that inevitably results in personal data collected on hundreds of millions of Americans being shared with private corporations .
Needless to say , with the Obama administration poised to hire an additional one million census workers , data collecting on American citizens will be intensified over the next several years .
Clearly , this is not what the Founders intended .
As Article I of the U. S. Constitution makes plain , the census is to be taken every ten years for the sole purpose of congressional redistricting .
The Founders envisioned a simple head count of the number of people living in a given area so that numerically equal congressional districts could be maintained .
There is no way that the Founders would have authorized the federal government to continuously demand , under penalty of law , such detailed information from the American people .
However , the Founders did not anticipate the massive and meddlesome federal bureaucracy we have today or the daily onslaught of media images and governmental scare tactics designed to keep the modern American distracted and submissive .
Sadly , most Americans do not seem to care that their freedoms are being whittled away or they see no point in resistance .
Either way , the reaction is the same : they submit to virtually every government demand , including the highly intrusive and patently unconstitutional American Community Survey .
Thankfully , there are still some Americans out there who value freedom and recognize that it is time to stand up and fight back using whatever peaceful , nonviolent means are available to them .
As Beth concludes in her email to me :
As an American loyal to my country , we have no choice but to stand against this unethical intrusion into our lives .
I have called and written to many people .
No response .
No one seems to be listening .
No one seems to care .
I intend to vote for those who do care .

The Best of John W. Whitehead
Skin cancer is by far the most prevalent form of cancer found in the United States , with over one million new cases diagnosed per year .
A whopping 40 - 50 % of Americans who live to age 65 will experience skin cancer in their lifetime ( American Cancer Society ) .
Skin cancer often presents without any overt symptoms , therefore it is vital for everyone to perform self skin inspections in order to detect any cancerous lesions .
One of the easiest ways to identify cancerous lesions on the skin is to follow the ABCDE rules of mole inspection .
“ A ” stands for “ asymmetrical ” .
When inspecting a mole , it should usually appear to be round or oval / oblong shaped .
Any mole that is not symmetrical and / or appears to be an irregular shape should be discussed with your doctor .
“ B ” stands for ” border ” .
Inspect the borders ( edges ) of your mole .
Are the edges well defined ?
Or are the edges somewhat jagged ?
Is it difficult to tell where the mole ends and the skin begins ?
Any mole with jagged edges should be discussed with your doctor .
“ C ” stands for “ color ” .
Each mole should only be one color .
For example , most moles contain only one shade of brown .
Cancerous or precancerous moles can contain multiple colors .
You may see flecks of dark brown , light brown , red , black , and even blue in a mole that is cancerous .
If you have a mole that is more than one color it should be discussed with your doctor .
“ D ” stands for “ diameter ” .
Because cancer is characterized by an uncontrolled proliferation of cells , an unusually large mole may be a sign of cancer .
In general , a mole should be no larger than a pencil eraser .
The generally accepted maximum diameter for a mole is 6 mm ( 1/4 in ) .
If you have a mole that exceeds this diameter it should be discussed with your doctor .
“ E ” stands for “ elevated ” .
Many moles lie relatively flush ( flat ) on the skin .
However , some moles may form a “ bump ” on the skin .
A mole that is elevated off of the surface of the skin should be discussed with your doctor .
It is important to know that every mole that exhibits one or more of these signs is NOT cancerous .
Some moles that fall into these categories are precancerous , and some are benign .
It is important , however , to discuss any abnormal findings with your physician .
Additionally , it is crucial to know yourself , and to know your own skin .
Any new moles that you have not noticed before may be cause for concern .
You should also note changes in any current moles .
For example , if you notice that a mole appears to be growing or changing color over time , it should be discussed with your doctor .
Skin inspections should be performed regularly so that you can easily track any changes over time .
Just remember your ABCDE 's of mole inspection and you can help keep your skin healthy for a lifetime !
A new species of prehistoric croc has been unearthed in Colombia — and the ancient reptile was likely prey for the largest known snake ever to have slithered the Earth , a new study says .
But if you 're hoping for a prehistoric clash of the titans , you 're out of luck :
The 7 - foot - long ( 2.1 - meter - long ) crocodile relative — called Cerrejonisuchus improcerus — would n't have stood a fighting chance against the 45 - foot - long ( 13.7 - meter-long ) Titanoboa cerrejonesis , researchers say .
( See pictures of Titanoboa , the biggest snake in history . )
There would have been " no competition whatsoever , " said study leader Alex Hastings , a University of Florida graduate student in vertebrate paleontology who works with the school 's the Florida Museum of Natural History .
" Even the smallest Titanoboa ... would have no problem downing even the largest of the new crocodilyforms we found . "
Crocodilyforms are reptiles that belong to the order Crocodilia , which includes , crocodiles , alligators , caimans ( picture ) , and gavials , among other species .
Fossils of the snake and the newfound crocodile relative were found next to each other between 2004 and 2007 in an open - pit coal mine in northeastern Colombia — a " remarkable " fossil site , Hastings said .
Both reptiles lived in South America 60 million years ago , when the local environment was on the cusp of transitioning into the continent 's well - known modern rain forests .
The fossil site is " one of the first glimpses of the beginning of the ecosystem that we have today , " Hastings said .
( Related : " World 's Biggest Snake Lived in First ' Modern ' Rain Forest . " )
Titanoboa 's Big Squeeze
In addition to finding the creatures side by side , the case for snake vs. crocodyliform battles is strengthened by the behavior of the animals ' modern descendants , according to the study , published January 28 in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology .
For instance , modern anacondas in the Amazon — including the current titleholder for world 's biggest snake , the green anaconda — often eat living members of the croc family , such as caimans .
Like these snakes , Titanoboa probably waited by the water 's edge to catch C. improcerus off guard before squeezing the " little guy " to death , Hastings said .
" It was not a good end for the poor crocodyliform . "
When it managed to avoid Titanoboa 's grasp , C. improcerus likely munched on tiny snakes , frogs , lizards , and mammals .
The crocodile relative was the smallest of its family , the dyrosaurids , and had an unusually short snout , seemingly adapted to nabbing critters that would have been ignored by bigger crocodyliforms .
Note :
This started as a comment on a thread at RealClimate about the Guardian ’s investigation of the CRU emails fiasco .
The Guardian has , until recently , had an outstandingly good record on it ’s climate change reporting .
It commissioned Fred Pearce to do a detailed investigation into the emails , and he published his results in a 12 - part series .
While some parts of it are excellent , other parts demonstrate a complete misunderstanding of how science works , especially the sections dealing with the peer - review process .
These were just hopelessly wrong , as demonstrated by Ben Santer ’s rebuttal of the specific allegations .
In parallel , George Monbiot , who I normally respect as one of the few journalists who really understands the science , has been arguing for Phil Jones to resign as head of the CRU at East Anglia , on the basis that his handling of the FOI requests was unprofessional .
Monbiot has repeated this more recently , as can be seen in this BBC clip , where he is hopelessly ineffective in combating Delingpole ’s nonsense , because he ’s unwilling to defend the CRU scientists adequately .
The problem with both Pearce ’s investigation , and Monbiot ’s criticisms of Prof Jones is that neither has any idea of what academic research looks like from the inside , nor how scientists normally talk to one another .
The following is my attempt to explain this context , and in particular why scientists talking freely among themselves might seem to rude or worse .
Enough people liked my comment at RC that I decided to edit it a little and post it here ( the original has already been reposted at ClimateSight and Prof Mandia ’s blog ) .
I should add one disclaimer : I do n’t mean to suggest here that scientists are not nice people – the climate scientists I ’ve gotten to know over the past few years are some of the nicest people you could ever ask to meet .
It ’s just that scientists are extremely passionate about the integrity of their work , and do n’t take kindly to people pissing them around .
Okay , now read on …
Once we ’ve gotten past the quote - mining and distortion , the worst that can be said about the CRU emails is that the scientists sometimes come across as rude or dismissive , and say things in the emails that really are n’t very nice .
However , the personal email messages between senior academics in any field are frequently not very nice .
We tend to be very blunt about what appears to us as ignorance , and intolerant of anything that wastes our time , or distracts us from our work .
And when we think ( rightly or wrongly ) that the peer review process has let another crap paper through , we certainly do n’t hold back in expressing our opinions to one another .
Which is of course completely different to how we behave when we meet one another .
Most scientists distinguish clearly between the intellectual cut and thrust ( in which we ’re sometimes very rude about one another ’s ideas ) and our social interactions ( in which we all get together over a beer and bitch about the downsides of academic life ) .
Occasionally , there ’s someone who is unable to separate the two , and takes the intellectual jabs personally , but such people are rare enough in most scientific fields that the rest of us know exactly who they are , and try to avoid them at conferences .
Part of this is due to the nature of academic research .
Most career academics have large egos and very thick skins .
I think the tenure process and the peer review process filter out those who do n’t .
We ’re all jostling to get our work published and recognised , often by pointing out how flawed everyone else ’s work is .
But we also care deeply about intellectual rigor , and preserving the integrity of the published body of knowledge .
And we also know that many key career milestones are dependent on being respected ( and preferably liked ) by others in the field : for example , the more senior people who might get asked to write recommendation letters for us , for tenure and promotion and honors , or the scientists with competing theories who will get asked to peer review our papers .
Which means in public ( e.g. in conference talks and published papers ) our criticisms of others are usually carefully coded to appear polite and respectful .
A published paper might talk about making “ an improvement on the methodology of Bloggs et al ” .
Meanwhile , in private , when talking to our colleagues , we ’re more likely to say that Bloggs ’ work is complete rubbish , and should never have been published in the first place , and anyway everyone knows Bloggs did n’t do any of the work himself , and the only decent bits are due to his poor , underpaid postdoc , who never gets any credit for her efforts .
( Yes , academics like to gossip about one another just as regular people do ) .
This kind of blunt rudeness is common in private emails , especially when we ’re discussing other scientists behind their backs with likeminded colleagues .
Do n’t be fooled by the more measured politeness in public : when we think an idea is wrong , we ’ll tear it to shreds .
Now , in climate science , all our conventions are being broken .
Private email exchanges are being made public .
People who have no scientific training and / or no prior exposure to the scientific culture are attempting to engage in a discourse with scientists , and neither side understands the other .
People are misquoting scientists , and trying to trip them up with loaded questions .
And , occasionally , resorting to death threats .
Outside of the scientific community , most people just do n’t understand how science works , and so do n’t know how to make sense of what ’s going on .
And scientists do n’t really know how to engage with these strange outsiders .
Scientists normally only interact with other scientists .
We live rather sheltered lives ; they do n’t call it the ivory tower for nothing .
When scientists are attacked for political reasons , we mistake it for an intellectual discussion over brandy in the senior common room .
Scientists have no training for political battles , and so our responses often look rude or dismissive to outsiders .
Which in turn gets interpreted as unprofessional behaviour by those who do n’t understand how scientists talk .
And unlike commercial organisations and politicians , universities do n’t engage professional PR firms to make us look good , and we academics would be horrified if they did : horrified at the expense , and horrified by the idea that our research might need to be communicated on anything other than its scientific merits .
Journalists like Monbiot , despite all his brilliant work in keeping up with the science and trying to explain it to the masses , just have n’t ever experienced academic culture from the inside .
Hence his call , which he keeps repeating , for Phil Jones to resign , on the basis that Phil reacted unprofessionally to FOI requests .
But if you keep provoking a scientist with nonsense , you ’ll get a hostile response .
Any fool knows you do n’t get data from a scientist by using FOI requests , you do it by stroking their ego a little , or by engaging them with a compelling research idea that you need the data to pursue .
And in the rare cases where this does n’t work , you do some extra work yourself to reconstruct the data you need using other sources , or you test your hypothesis using a different approach ( because it ’s the research result we care about , not any particular dataset ) .
So to a scientist , anyone stupid enough to try to get scientific data through repeated FOI requests quite clearly deserves our utter contempt .
Jones was merely expressing ( in private ) a sentiment that most scientists would share – and extreme frustration with people who clearly do n’t get it .
The same misunderstandings occur when outsiders look at how we talk about the peer - review process .
Outsiders tend to think that all published papers are somehow equal in merit , and that peer - review is a magical process that only lets the truth through ( hint : we refer to it more often as a crap - shoot ) .
Scientists know that while some papers are accepted because they are brilliant , others are accepted because its hard to tell whether they are any good , and publication might provoke other scientists to do the necessary followup work .
We know some published papers are worth reading , and some should be ignored .
So , we ’re natural skeptics – we tend to think that most new published results are likely to be wrong , and we tend to accept them only once they ’ve been repeatedly tested and refined .
We ’re used to having our own papers rejected from time to time , and we learn how to deal with it – quite clearly the reviewers were stupid , and we ’ll show them by getting it published elsewhere ( remember , big ego , thick skin ) .
We ’re also used to seeing the occasional crap paper get accepted ( even into our most prized journals ) , and again we understand that the reviewers were stupid , and the journal editors incompetent , and we waste no time in expressing that .
And if there ’s a particularly egregious example , everyone in the community will know about it , everyone will agree it ’s bad , and some of us will start complaining loudly about the idiot editor who let it through .
Yet at the same time , we ’re all reviewers , and some of us are editors , so it ’s understood that the people we ’re calling stupid and incompetent are our colleagues .
And a big part of calling them stupid or incompetent is to get them to be more rigorous next time round , and it works because no honest scientist wants to be seen as lacking rigor .
What looks to the outsider like a bunch of scientists trying to subvert some gold standard of scientific truth is really just scientists trying to goad one another into doing a better job in what we all know is a messy , noisy process .
The bottom line is that scientists will always tend to be rude to ignorant and lazy people , because we expect to see in one another a driving desire to master complex ideas and to work damn hard at it .
Unfortunately the outside world ( and many journalists ) interpret that rudeness as unprofessional conduct .
And because they do n’t see it every day ( like we do ! ) they ’re horrified .
Some people have suggested that scientists need to wise up , and learn how to present themselves better on the public stage .
Indeed , the Guardian published an editorial calling for the emergence of new leaders from the scientific community who can explain the science .
This is naive and irresponsible .
It completely ignores the nature of the current wave of attacks on scientists , and what motivates those attacks .
No scientist can be an effective communicator in a world where people with vested interests will do everything they can to destroy his or her reputation .
The scientific community does n’t have the resources to defend itself in this situation , and quite frankly it should n’t have to .
What we really need is for newspaper editors , politicians , and business leaders to start acting responsibly , make the effort to understand what the science is saying , make the effort to understand what is really driving these swiftboat - style attacks on scientists , and then shift the discourse from endless dissection of scientists ’ emails onto useful , substantive discussions of the policy choices we ’re faced with .
[ Update : Joe Romm has reposted this at ClimateProgress , and it ’s generated some very interesting discussion , including a response from George Monbiot that ’s worth reading ]
[ Update 2 : 31/3/2010
The UK Parliament released its findings last night , and completely exonerates Prof. Jones and the CRU .
It does , however , suggest that the UEA should bear responsibility for any mistakes that were made over how the FoI requests were handled , and it makes a very strong call for more openness with data and software from the climate science community ]

Ready for anything : Chuck Izzo has enough supplies for two months
By Madeleine Morris
BBC News , Greenville
If there was ever a major disaster in northern Virginia , Chuck Izzo 's house is Greenville is where you would want to be .
Tucked away in his pantry are enough tinned food and water to last for two months .
In the basement an inverter hums quietly , charging batteries that could easily power most of his three - storey home 's lights and appliances for nine hours .
And for when that runs out , he has a wood - burning stove with a two - month supply of fuel pellets so he can cook and heat the whole house .
Mr Izzo is a " prepper " , one of a growing number of Americans who are preparing their homes and families to survive a major disaster they believe could arrive at any time .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement " We realise the frailty of infrastructure so if it fails , we 're prepared to deal with a crisis like that , " he explains .
" It could be electricity , it could be a medical emergency .
It could be something caused by a man -made disaster or a natural disaster . "
I do n't think it 's paranoia .
I think it 's just a degree of readiness .
Chuck Izzo
While there have always been people who have anticipated and prepared for disaster , " prepping " as a discernable movement has emerged only in the last 18 months , with the growth of online prepper networks and blogs .
Since its inception just 15 months ago , the American Preppers Network and its associated state networks now get more than 5,000 hits a day .
Preppers debate issues like whether to " bug - in " or " bug- out " ( to evacuate or stay when disaster strikes ) and more mundane matters like gardening tips .
Blogs such as The Survival Mom and Suburban Prepper give tips on preserving and growing food , discuss the pros and cons of having a gun , and offer advice on ham radio .
I think it 's something more people my age should think about
Matt Jarvis
Prepper , 22 " There are a lot of people out there who feel the same way as I do , but do n't know that there 's others out there like them , so it 's the prepper networks that provide that online community for people to come together online and talk with each other , " says Matt Jarvis , the man behind The Prepper Podcast .
From his bedroom in rural Kentucky , Mr Jarvis records and posts his weekly conversations with other preppers and survival experts .
Mr Jarvis is 22 and still lives with his parents , yet he has put aside three months ' worth of food and water , plus other supplies , in case disaster strikes .
He is most worried about hurricanes after one destroyed many of the houses on his street two years ago , but economic collapse and terrorism are also concerns .
He acknowledges it is unusual for someone of his age to be thinking so much about potential disasters , and putting hard - earned money into preparing for something that may never come .
" But I think it 's something more people my age should think about , " he says .
Survivalists v preppers Preppers are keen not to be seen as survivalists - the stereotypically anti-government , wood - dwelling , gun-toting hermits of past decades .
Rather than isolating themselves in preparation for Armageddon , preppers tend to have normal jobs , mingle with their communities and take a more relaxed view about looming disasters .
Tom Martin , who began the American Preppers Network makes the distinction .
" A survivalist is more a specific term , " he says .
" For me , a survivalist is someone who can go into any type of situation and live off the land .
Me , I 'm not like that .
" People call themselves survivalists because they 've got guns and MREs ( military ready - to - eat meals ) .
A prepper is a more generalised term . " Preppers prepare with tinned goods , not living off the land
While most preppers tend to be politically to the right , or even libertarian in their views , their back - to - basics approach to food cultivation and preparation , as well as use of alternative energy sources , paradoxically means they have much in common with left - of - centre environmentalists .
But according to Professor Michael K Lindell , editor of the International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Director of the Hazard Reduction and Recovery Centre at Texas A&M University , the recent growth in prepping is a sign of uncertain times .
" There is a general feeling of greater personal responsibility that we 've seen in a number of different surveys , " says Professor Lindell .
" Plus , people have the money and knowledge to invest in these different types of survival resources , as well as the feeling that they really are at risk .
" It 's all these different trends that are coming together that are leading to this kind of behaviour . "
Many preppers cite the American government 's bungled response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 as a key motivator behind their approach to survival .
The economic crisis of the past two years is also frequently mentioned .
So are preppers paranoid ?
Chuck Izzo says not .
" Having a couple of months ' worth of food , some first aid training , potentially if you can afford it having a back - up power system to maintain the electrical systems in your house I do n't think that 's paranoia , " he says .
" I think that 's just a degree of readiness .
I think it improves our confidence and our quality of life . "

1 ) Careful with heavy objects , paintings or mirrors .
If there ’s an earthquake , do you have any such object next to your beds where they could fall and injure people ?
2 ) Have a plan for when the earthquake strikes .
A location out in the open where everyone will run to as soon as it starts , instead of staying stunned and scared .
Keep in mind the best route for a quick and safest exit , door portals and corners are generally more resistant , do n’t walk across the center of the room but avoid walls with bookshelves and other objects that may fall .
Heavy desks or tables made out of solid wood can provide some cover if there ’s not another floor over the one you are in .
3 ) Have a second location to where to go in case the family lost contact with one another and ca n’t get home .
4 ) Have a bug out bag ( a backpack ) per family member ready with the following supplies : A) 2 liters of water per person .
B ) A firearm and 50 rounds of ammunition , along withtwo spare magazines , a gun belt and holster ( adult ’s bag ) C ) Cooking pot and stoveD ) Plastic cups , dishes , spoons and forksE ) Fuel for the stove .
F ) Ready to eat food .
Lentils .
Dried pasta .
Candy .
Powdered milk .
Sugar .
Canned meat .
At least a week worth of food since that seems to be the average time for help to be organized in disaster areas .
2 weeks would be better but keep at least a week in the pack .
Lentils and dried pasta usually give you the best bang per buck in terms of nutrition per volume .
G) Tent and sleeping bags .
H)
An extra change of clothes and shoes in a large ziplock bag .
( you may have to run out in the middle of the night only in your underwear ) I ) LED flashlight that uses a single battery and at least 10 spare batteries .
You can add specialty or “ tactical ” flashlights , but the emergency flashlight must use commonly available AA or AAA batteries .
J ) Radio that uses those same batteries .
K ) Multitool ( Leatherman Wave or Charge highly recommended ) L ) Lighters and storm proof matches in a waterproof container .
M) Gloves .N) Alcohol hand sanitizer .
O ) Baby wipes for cleaning up ( jumbo pack ) P ) First aid kit .
Q ) Medicine for medical conditions .
R) Diapers , powdered formula , spare bottle if there ’s a baby .
S ) Emergency cash , spare credit card and ATM for emergencies .
Scanned copies of important documents in a waterproof memory stick .
T) Pre paid cell phone ( solar and crank operated charger recommended too ) U ) Spare set of keys , house and car .
v ) Water filterOther items recommended : 5 ) More water would be recommended , but the bug out bag must be small and light enough to grab and go in just a matter of seconds .
More bottles of water in a shed or other secondary location is a good idea .
5 ) Two extra gas tanks worth of fuel in jerry cans will allow you leave the disaster area in most cases .
Check for leaks and the fuel every 6 months .
Replace containers that leak , bulge or deform .
6 ) You may want to keep a rifle per adults with the bags as well , with a small bag or bandolier with ammo or loaded magazines .
Remember .
It must be light so as to grab and go in just a couple seconds .
That may be the difference between making it out of the building alive or not .
The earthquake means loosing your everyday items , you homes , clothes , no power and no water for a nice bath .
Your bag should allow you to deal with all this .
As many Chilean survivors noted , the worst may come AFTER the earthquake itself , in the form of lawlessness and looters , so plan on organizing watches with your neighbors to watch after one another .
I 've added the links with prices to several of the items mentioned .
Many of us already have all or most of these around the house .
Its just a matter of getting busy and putting it all together in a backpack , filling in the holes you many have .
Comments and suggestions welcomed guys .

Lars Vilks ' drawing appeared after the notorious Danish cartoons row Seven people have been arrested in the Irish Republic over an alleged plot to kill a Swedish cartoonist for depicting the Prophet Muhammad , police say .
The four men and three women are all Muslim immigrants , according to media reports , though a police statement did not confirm this .
Cartoonist Lars Vilks had depicted the Prophet Muhammad with the body of a dog in the Nerikes Allehanda newspaper .
Islamic militants put a $ 100,000 ( £ 67,000 ) bounty on his head .
Mr Vilks was quoted as saying he was unfazed by the arrests , which he said he thought could be linked to two death threats he had received by telephone in January .
' Slaughter ' bonus Irish police said the seven suspects were arrested after an investigation into a " conspiracy to murder an individual in another jurisdiction " , a probe that also involved police in the US and other European countries .
I have an axe here in case someone should manage to get in through the window
Lars Vilks
The suspects ranged in age from their mid-20s to late - 40s .
Ireland 's RTE news network reported that five were detained in Waterford and two others in Cork .
RTE said those in custody were originally refugees from Morocco and Yemen , but had gained asylum and were in the Republic of Ireland legally .
Mr Vilks has been under police protection in Sweden since threats were made against his life .
" I 'm not shaking with fear , exactly , " he told Swedish news agency TT after Tuesday 's arrests .
" I have prepared in different ways and I have an axe here in case someone should manage to get in through the window . "
In 2007 a group linked to al - Qaeda in Iraq offered a $ 100,000 reward for killing Mr Vilks , and a 50 % bonus if he was " slaughtered like a lamb " by having his throat cut .
It offered another $ 50,000 for the murder of Ulf Johansson , editor - in - chief of the regional newspaper , Nerikes Allehanda .
' Now it 's your turn '
The Vilks controversy arose in 2007 , when his entry in an arts project was published by the newspaper .
It pictured a dog with the head of a bearded man in a turban .
Several Muslim countries protested against the picture .
At the time , Swedish officials expressed regret at any hurt caused to Muslims ' feelings , but said the government could not prevent the publication of such drawings because of media freedom rules .
The case came about a year and a half after a series of depictions of Muhammad in Denmark 's Jyllands - Posten paper caused an uproar in early 2006 .
Those cartoons sparked protests from Muslims around the world .
Dozens of people were killed in riots .
Muslims regard any image of the Prophet Muhammad as blasphemy .
In January , one of the cartoonists whose drawing appeared in Jyllands - Posten , the Dane Kurt Westergaard , was targeted in his own home , allegedly by a Somali radical Muslim with an axe .
Mr Westergaard , who escaped unharmed , had depicted the Prophet Muhammad with a bomb in his turban .
Mr Vilks told The Associated Press news agency that the telephone threats in January had come from " a Swedish - speaking Somali .
He reminded me about what had happened to Westergaard and threatened with a follow - up and that ' now it 's your turn ' . "

The Matchup : The New York Rangers ( 29 - 28 - 9 ) face off against the New Jersey Devils ( 38 - 23 - 3 ) .
This is the fifth meeting of the teams this season .
Currently , the season series is tied , 2 - 2 .
The Last Rangers Game : The Rangers lost to Buffalo , 2 - 1 , on Sunday night at Madison Square Garden .
Patrick Kaleta scored the overtime winner , and Ryan Miller made 35 saves for the win .
The Last Devils Game :
This was certainly one to forget , as the Devils were shutout by Edmonton , 2 - 0 , Sunday night .
The team barely made goalie Jeff Deslauriers work , and he recorded 22 saves for his second career victory over the Devils .
The Last Rangers – Devils Game :
In the last meeting , the Rangers defeated the Devils , 3 - 1 , at Madison Square Garden February 6 .
The Rangers scored three goals in the second period to take a 3 - 0 lead .
Dainius Zubrus scored a goal in the third , but the Devils could n’t mount a comeback .
Henrik Lundqvist stopped 41 shots for the victory .
Tonight ’s Game : The Devils have n’t looked good at all since the break .
While we as fans ( and even the team ) thought the Devils would turn it around , they ’ve continued to play terribly in the second period and come out with a lackluster effort .
They were shutout by the Edmonton Oilers !
Clearly , the Devils need to turn it around .
And they seem to step in the right direction yesterday after practice .
The players finally admitted they have n’t played well and that they believed everything would go away after the break .
Patrik Elias admitted people have sat back and watched Ilya Kovalchuk at times .
Zach Parise admitted this slump is unacceptable and that the team needs to pick it up .
Finally , the players said what we all wanted them to say for the past few weeks .
But words are n’t going to be enough to turn around this streak .
If the Devils want to change their play , they need to do it on the ice .
What a better opportunity then going against the hated Rangers .
They come into the game sitting outside the playoff picture , and the Rangers have only scored 170 goals this year .
But Lundqvist is a Devils killer , compiling a 17 - 6 - 5 record in his career over the Devils .
The Rangers also bring Marian Gaborik to town , who is n’t 100 % but recorded 69 points so far this season ( 35 goals , 34 assists ) .
The Rangers are n’t a great team by any means , and the Devils need to impose their will on them .
I want to see Lemaire use an aggressive forecheck to try and get some early turnovers .
Not only that , but the Devils need to be patient in the offensive zone .
The team errantly threw passes to the slot and did n’t possess the puck in Edmonton , allowing the Oilers to gain possession and clear the puck .
The team needs to set up and cycle in the zone .
The only way to create offense is to skate in the zone and find open areas .
The Devils have n’t done that lately , instead letting players try and take on the entire defense .
If they can get back to cycling the puck and getting to the dirty areas , this team will have success on the offensive end .
On the defensive side of the puck , Mike Mottau or Colin White need to be benched .
I know it wo n’t happen , but Mark Fraser played very well in the minutes he played .
He ’s looked better than both Mottau and White , whose weaknesses were exposed with their increased playing time this season .
Fraser seems to handle the pressures of the league well , and he ’s already scored three goals on the season ( including two against Pittsburgh ) .
He does n’t back down from physical play , either .
The rookie deserves to start this game , and either Mottau or White need to sit this one out .
Finally , as tough as it will be , the Devils need to ignore Sean Avery .
The Rangers pesky forward seems to always find a way to get under the skin of the Devils .
I ’m sure everyone on the team wants to hit him , and Kovalchuk actually did in their last matchup :
But Avery succeeds when he takes people off of their game .
To be effective , the Devils need to ignore Avery and be physical and aggressive .
Let Avery do his thing and , when he needs it , give him a good shove or put him into the boards .
But the team should n’t go out of its way to beat up Avery .
The best way to shut him up is to win the game .
Game time is at 7:00 p.m. Join The Devils ’
Den for a live game blog , beginning 15 minutes before the drop of the puck .

Advertisement The BBC News series on British computer pioneers and pioneering British computers continues with the story of the Ace computer , which brought together a team who would go on to design the technology that underpins the internet .
Towards the end of the war , Alan Turing - the father of the computing age - had hid himself away in a hut at Hanslope Park in rural Buckinghamshire where , he told his assistant , he was " building a brain " .
At the end of fighting , Turing took his plans with him to his new post at the National Physical Laboratory ( NPL ) in Teddington .
In March 1946 he handed over a report ( which went unpublished during his lifetime ) which contained detailed plans , including circuit diagrams , for the Automatic Computing Engine ( Ace ) .
But when the engineers and scientists at NPL saw the plans they blanched at its complicated design .
Instead of building the whole thing , they decided to put together a smaller pilot machine .
By this time , Turing had left NPL for a sabbatical at Cambridge and it fell to Jim Wilkinson , Harry Huskey and , later on , Donald Davies to get on with the construction .
The machine ran for the first time on 10 May 1950 .
By modern standards it was sluggish but in its day was the fastest in the world .
Error correction Turing 's vision for Ace was that it would complete entire calculations for scientists and researchers , rather than do the bits and bobs of mathematical jobs that computers typically did before Ace came along .
This made programming
Ace a formidable task .
And , whilst investigating how it could be used , the team uncovered another problem that looked set to dog greater use of computers - how accurate were they ?
" When you put decimal numbers in a computer they have to be converted to binary , " said Professor Maurice Cox , who worked with Jim Wilkinson .
" The conversion is not exact . "
Binary is method of representing numbers using only the digits 0 and 1 , used by all modern computers .
PILOT ACE
Tech specs : 800 valves , 2816 bit memory , 15 instructions First operation : 10 May 1950 Creators : Alan Turing , Jim Wilkinson , Harry Huskey " Errors in various stages of the calculation due to imperfections in the data can build up , " said Professor Cox .
" Those errors can explode if you have an unstable method of calculation . "
Jim Wilkinson took on and defeated that uncertainty .
Remembered with affection by everyone that worked with him , his work has been overshadowed by Turing .
" He was brilliant in his own right , " said Clive Hall , a former colleague of Mr Wilkinson and who oversees some of the computer archives at NPL .
" The problem was that he came to NPL when Alan Turing was there . "
Wilkinson produced algorithms that could demonstrate the accuracy of computer calculations .
" It is work that became vital to all engineering and scientific calculation , " said Prof Cox .
It still is through the Numerical Algorithms Group , which produces libraries of algorithms used in used in diverse applications across the globe .
Network man Another NPL pioneer , Donald Davies , also cut his teeth on the Ace .
He joined NPL at the same time as Jim Wilkinson and was , for a while , Turing 's assistant .
Much later , when he was head of the computer section at NPL , he did ground - breaking work on the best way to organise computer networks .
At the time making a phone call meant literally creating an electrical circuit between the two people in the conversation .
That tied up the entire line for the length of that chat , even though for most of the time the connection will go unused because of the silences and gaps that punctuate conversation .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Advertisement Rather than mimic this and tie up computer links for a long time as data was sent back and forth , Mr Davies realised that the spaces could be used .
By splitting data into packets and threading them on the same line , the carrying capacity of that link could be boosted and the whole network made more powerful .
Roger Scantlebury , who worked with Dr Davies , presented the ideas about " packet switching " to a conference in the US , where they were picked up by the creators of the nascent Arpanet , the fledgling internet .
Does that mean Britain invented the internet ?
" Yes and no , " said Mr Scantlebury .
" Certainly the underlying technology of the internet , which is packet switching , we did invent . "
The NPL network ran at multi-megabit speeds in the late 1960s , faster than any network at the time .
The network was not just an academic toy either .
Real work was done across it .
Like many contemporary machines , the full - size Ace filled rooms David Yates was project manager of a program called Scrapbook which rolled together word processing , e-mail and hypertext - a system that anticipated many elements of the World Wide Web .
Scrapbook went live on in mid-1971 and became something of a " minor cult " among its growing user base , said Dr Yates .
" We had a community of bright people that were interested in new things , " said DMr Yates .
" They were good fodder for a system like Scrapbook . "
Scrapbook helped people across the 28 acres of the NPL campus and beyond collaborate on projects without having to sit next to each other .
" When we had more than one Scrapbook system , hyperlinks could go across the network without the user knowing what was happening , " he said .
" I can not make claims for precedence for it , " said Dr Yates .
" But it is certainly the first system I know of to combine screen - based word processing , hypertext and e-mail as a service over a general - purpose computer network . "
Whilst it is stretching the truth to say that Britain did invent the internet , there is no doubt that the history of the network is more complex than anyone ever thought .

My management team was bickering .
Two managers in particular : Leo and Vincent .
Both of their projects were fine .
Both of their teams were producing , but in any meeting where they were both representing their teams , they just started pushing each other ’s buttons .
Every meeting on some trivial topic :
Leo : “ Vincent , are you on track to ship the tool on Wednesday ? ”
Vincent : “ We ’re on schedule . ”
Leo : “ For Wednesday ? ”
Vincent : “ We ’ll hit our schedule . ”
Leo : “ Wednesday ? ”
Endless passive aggressive verbal warfare .
Two type A personalities who absolutely hated to be told what to do .
My 1:1s with each of them were productive meetings and when I brought up the last Leo ’n ’ Vincent battle of the wills , they immediately started pointing at their counterpart : “ I really do n’t know what his problem is . ”
I do .
They did n’t trust each other .
On the Topic of Trust
There ’s a question out there regarding how close you want to get with your co-workers in your job .
There ’s a camp out there that employs a policy of “ professional distance ” .
This camp believes it is appropriate to keep those they work with at arm ’s length .
The managerial reason here is more concrete than the individual reasoning .
Managers are representatives or officers of the company and , as such , may be asked to randomly enforce the will of the business .
Who gets laid off ?
Why does n’t this person get a raise ?
How much more does this person get ?
Profession distance or not , these responsibilities will always give managers an air of otherness .
Here ’s my question : do you or do you not want to be the person someone trusts when they need help ?
Manager or not , do you see the act of someone trusting you as fitting with who you are ?
Yes , there ’s a line that needs to be drawn between you and your co-workers , but artificially distancing yourself from the people you spend all day every day with seems like a good way to put artificial barriers between yourself the people you need to get your job done .
Is that who you are or who you want to work for ?
The topic of trust is where I draw a line in both my personal and management philosophy .
My belief is that a team built on trust and respect is vastly more productive and efficient than the one where managers are distant supervisors and co-workers are 9 - to - 5 people you occasionally see in meetings .
You ’re not striving to be everyone ’s pal ; that ’s not the goal .
The goal is a set of relationships where there is a mutual belief in each other ’s reliability , truth , ability , and strengths .
It ’s awesome .
And it ’s something you can build with a card game .
BAB
It ’s pronounced how you think .
Rhymes with crab .
It ’s an acronym for a game which , with practice , will knit your team together in unexpected ways .
It ’s Back Alley Bridge .
Here are the rules , but before I explain why this game is a great team building exercise , you need to understand a few of the rules .
BAB is n’t bridge .
The game does have a few important similarities .
First , it ’s a game for four players , involving two teams — the folks facing each other are on the same team and share their score .
Second , it ’s a trick - based game where the goal is for each team to get as many tricks as possible .
A trick is won when each player turns up a card and the highest wins , unless someone plays a trump suit , which , in the case of BAB , is always spades .
Bidding .
Also like bridge , BAB has bidding , meaning each team bids how many tricks they think they ’re going to get after the cards have been dealt .
Scoring is optimized to reward teams who get the number of tricks they bid and heavily punishes those who do n’t get their bid .
Bidding is a blind team effort — you have no idea what your teammate has in their hand other than what you can infer from their bid .
Decreasing hand count .
Unlike bridge , the number of cards each player gets decreases with each hand .
Each player gets 13 cards in the first hand , 12 in the second , and so on .
Play continues down to a single card and then heads back up to 13 .
A work - friendly modification I ’ve made is to only play every other hand ( 13 - 11 - 9 , etc . )
This number of hands fits nicely into a lunch hour .
Hail Mary .
There are two special bids : Board and Boston .
A bid of Board indicates the team is going to take every single trick .
A board of Boston indicates the team intends to take the first six .
Achieving a Board or Boston can be an impressive feat and is rewarded handsomely from a scoring perspective .
Failure results in a scoring beat - down .
Both of these special bids allow for wild variances in the score , which can be handy for teams who are falling behind .
Scoring , game play , and other information are in the complete rules .
Now , let me explain why I picked this game as a recurring weekly lunch meeting .
In BAB , you talk shit .
I ’ve landed BAB in three different teams now and in each case , the amount of trash talking that showed up once players became comfortable with the game was impressive .
This is a function of my personality , but it ’s also a byproduct of any healthy competition amongst bright people .
It ’s also a sign of a healthy team .
I ’ll explain .
Trash talking is improvisational critical thinking — it ’s the art of building comedy in the moment with only the immediate materials provided .
As I ’m looking for candidates for my next BAB game , I ’m looking for two things : who will be able to talk trash and who needs to receive it ?
The art in talking trash is the careful exploration of the edges of truth .
When someone effectively lays it down , they say something honest and slightly uncomfortable .
The ever - present risk with trash talking is when that line is crossed .
It ’s that one thing that is said that goes too far and offends , but it ’s the presence of that line which makes talking trash so much fun .
It ’s these honest and dangerous observations that form the basis of trust .
When a co-worker makes a big observation about you and shares it with the other players , you take note – someone is watching .
It sounds problematic , but remember , we ’re just sitting here playing cards .
It ’s safe .
In a new BAB game , it takes players time to get used to the trash talking , especially in a situation like Leo and Vincent ’s .
Adversarial co-workers playing on the same team need to learn to ditch the business for the game .
They need to understand there is a relationship outside of the daily work and there ’s nothing like a comedic verbal beat - down to remind them to lighten up .
In BAB , you learn things unintentionally .
Once you ’ve got an established game with regular players who all know the rules , you ’ll learn two things : people get better at trash talking with practice , and information travels in unpredictable ways in groups of people .
It goes like this :
Player # 1 : “ I bid 3 . ”
Player # 2 : “ I bid 1 . ”
Player # 3 : “ Pass . ”
Player # 4 : “ Kevin ’s quitting .
I ’m sure of it . ”
Player # 1 : “ Yeah , I know . ”
Player # 2 : “ Sucks to be you . ”
Out of nowhere , in the middle of the game , you ’re suddenly assessing the departure of a co-worker .
I see this as a sign of a thriving , healthy BAB game because the team has begun to trust each other more .
In the safety of the game , they ’re letting the worries of the moment spill onto the table for all to see , which is impressive , since everyone knows that anything on the table at BAB is fair game for talking shit .
In BAB , you ’re having work experiences without the work .
Relationships need time to bake .
Trust does n’t magically appear ; it ’s cautiously built over time via shared experience .
The majority of these experiences are created during the regular work day and I ’m certain there are a great many healthy professional relationships that are defined and maintained in this manner , but I want my teams closer .
I ’m not suggesting group hugs and voices united singing Kumbaya .
I ’m looking for each team member to have the opportunity to understand each other slightly more than what they see when they ’re at work .
The more you understand how your co-workers tick , the better you ’re able to work with them .
You ’ll stop seeing them as the role , the title , or the keeper of a particular political agenda .
They are just …
Phillip .
And you know what I know about Phillip ?
He ’s the manager who used to wait too long to speak in a meeting .
He had plenty to say that mattered , but he used to be too shy to say it .
Two months of trash talking over BAB showed me his reservations , so I learned to pull Phillip into the meeting conversations as quickly as possible .
After a few pulls , he started to do it himself .
After a few weeks , you could n’t get him to shut up .
The Second Staff Meeting
The inspiration for the game came from a regularly scheduled bridge game at Netscape , and there ’s nothing special about BAB that makes it the perfect lunchtime game .
I chose BAB because a team - based game that fits nicely in a lunch hour .
You bet I maneuvered Leo and Vincent onto the same team for weeks on end .
There was no magical moment during one game where they suddenly understood each other .
Leo and Vincent continued to bicker in meetings , but over time the tone changed from the passive aggressive to the playful talking of trash .
They turned competition into something healthy and fun .
In the safe competition that is BAB , you learn not only how to work better together by understanding that winning does n’t always mean hitting your dates , getting paid , or receiving a promotion .
Winning can be a simple , playful thing , “ We were awesome as we kicked your ass . ”
More importantly , BAB is a regular forum for experiencing that relationships are not defined just by the work we do together , but who we become with each other when we are n’t looking .

Sen . Mike Johanns AP file A U.S. senator said Tuesday that the U.S. should consider banning Japanese - made cars until Japan 's government guarantees the vehicles have no defects .
That would be no different than Japan 's multi- year ban on U.S. beef because of fears American cattle might be infected with deadly BSE , commonly called mad cow disease , said Sen .
Mike Johanns , R - Neb. , who was U.S. Agriculture Secretary during the dispute with Japan .
His comment about banning Japanese - made vehicles came during a Senate committee hearing on recent Toyota safety recalls and the government 's response .
It was the third time in eight days that Toyota officials were called to Capitol Hill to explain why the company did n't move faster to recall vehicles that now are linked by the government to 52 deaths in 43 fatal crashes involving unintended acceleration .
POLL : 55 % say Toyota too slow to act on safety concerns SAFETY : U.S. may require brakes that override gas pedals Most of the 8 million Toyotas and Lexuses recalled for several problems that might cause unintended acceleration were manufactured in the U.S.
Asserting that the Japanese government has a role in insuring products shipped from its nation are safe , Johanns asked rhetorically , what if : " Until the Japanese government can assure us that all of the defects are out of these vehicles , we 're just not going to accept any vehicles from Japan . "
Referring to restrictions on U.S. beef , he said , " That 's what they did with one of our industries . "
Later during the hearing , Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said the issue " needs to be raised " and promised to bring it up with the Japanese ambassador and in a trip to Japan .
" I 'm as free - trade as anybody here , but I can tell you the American consumer is getting tired of this thing if we are getting substandard products , " Johanns said .
The Japanese Embassy in Washington said via email : " Toyota is stating that it will take appropriate measures promptly , " and " we will follow this very closely . "
Toyota recalled 2.4 million vehicles Jan. 21 because gas pedals might stick part - way open .
All those were made in the U.S. using pedal assemblies designed by Toyota and made by Indiana - based CTS at a Canadian plant .
Separately it has recalled 5.6 million vehicles because ill - fitting floor mats could jam open poorly designed gas pedals .
Most of those also were U.S. - made .
In the 1970s the U.S. threatened to tax Japanese cars sent to the U.S. Japanese makers agreed to voluntarily limit auto exports to America to avoid tariffs .
The resulting shortages encouraged Japanese automakers to move upscale and make the same profits on smaller numbers of vehicles sold .
Johanns ' suggestion " seems like such an extreme proposal that it 's not likely to be taken seriously .
But such a proposal , given serious consideration , could lead to important repercussions on trade , to the detriment of the U.S. , " says James Sullivan , associate professor of economics at Notre Dame .
The Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation let Johanns ' provocative comments lie without reaction .
Committee members were more intent on identifying what they said were problems at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
NHTSA should not have taken so long to spot a deadly trend toward unintended acceleration in Toyotas , committee members said , because complaints from motorists increased quickly the past few years .
They also prodded LaHood and NHTSA administrator David Strickler to look harder at other automakers for unintended acceleration and pay more attention to the possible involvement of electronic glitches .
Listing data from NHTSA back to 2000 , Daniel Inouye , D - Hawaii , noted that Toyota had few recalls some years .
" It is not a Toyota problem , it is an industry problem .
One gets the impression it is a Ford , Chrysler or General Motors problem , " he said .
LaHood and Strickland , noted that previous problems predate them , but promised aggressive follow - up and investigation of all complaints of unintended acceleration .
Other developments , outside the Senate committee hearing : • Toyota said it hired former U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater to head the automaker 's Quality Advisory Panel .
Slater is to have direct access to company president Akio Toyoda , the automaker said .
The panel is an outgrowth of government criticism of the car company for emphasizing growth and profits over safety .
• General Motors told NHTSA
Monday night that it is recalling 1.3 million 2005 to 2010 Chevrolet Cobalt and 2007 to 2010 Pontiac G5 small cars , including some 2005 and 2006 cars sold in Canada as the Pontiac Pursuit and in Mexico as the Pontiac G4 , because their electric steering might lose power assistance , making the vehicles hard to steer .
NHTSA had opened an investigation because of more than 1,100 complaints against the Cobalt .
NHTSA also opened an investigation into power - steering complaints against the Toyota Corolla after fewer than 200 complaints .
Some committee members used the discrepancy in complaints as evidence that the government was being too tough on Toyota .
The U.S. owns about 60 % of GM as a result of the big automaker 's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization and government loans .

1. Amtrak's " Julie "
Believe it or not , the famous Amtrak Julie , who debuted in 2001 , is actually named Julie ... Julie Stinneford of Boston , MA , that is , who won the role after an extensive audition process .
She 's so lifelike , oftentimes riders say they did n't immediately realize Amtrak 's Julie is a computer program .
All those informal expressions , like when she says , " Great ! " or " Got it ! " -- those were recorded on purpose after Amtrak conducted a survey and learned that most people prefer their automated operators on the colloquial side ( as opposed to live operators , who people seem to prefer on the formal side ... go figure ) .
In handling about a quarter of Amtrak 's annual call volume Julie has saved railroad tens of millions .
Julie has become such a hit that NPR once set her up on a computerized Valentines date with Tom , Mr. Customer Service for United Airlines .
Sadly , the romantic conversation derailed when the real voices behind the computer personalities started arguing which was the best mode of transportation : plane or train .
Here 's an impromptu recording I made of Julie .
While the voice - recognition is mostly there , she still had a hard time figuring out my juvenile sense of humor .
2. The London Underground 's " Mind The Gap " Lady
" Mind the gap " has become as iconic to London as double - decker buses or the London Bridge .
For those who are n't familiar with it , the gap is the space between the subway car and the platform .
Emma Clarke , one of the more famous voices of the Tube , as it's sometimes called , recorded her first announcements for the Underground in 1999 .
Clarke , of Altrincham , Cheshire , was born in 1970 and is a married mother of two .
Besides her freelance voiceover work , she 's also an accomplished writer who has penned shows for the BBC .
She 's also a regular contributor to BBC 's 5 Live .
Mind the Sack !
It 's widely believed that Clarke was terminated from a job at the London Underground in 2007 after posting spoof messages on her Web site .
But that is n't what happened .
Clarke was misquoted in the press as saying she never used the London Underground and hated tube trains ; as a result a spokesman from LU told reporters that Ms. Clarke 's contract was experiencing " severe delays . "
Cue global media frenzy .
Today , Clarke 's voice is still used on the London Underground and she continues to work as a freelance voiceover , writer and broadcaster .
She has never been an employee of London Underground .
Ever .
And she does use and love tube trains .
Fact .
3. Ms. " AT&T "
The phrase " AT&T "  has made Pat Fleet 's voice one of the most famous and recognizable in the country .
Since 1981 , she 's recorded tens of thousands of phone messages for various phone companies including AT&T , Verizon , and Bell Systems .
Born Patricia Curry on September 11 , 1943 in Dayton , Ohio , Fleet first recorded messages for the Bell System 's Automated Coin Toll System .
In the late " ˜80s , customer surveys showed that of all AT&T 's voices , Fleet 's was the one people preferred most , so she landed the gig recording her most famous phrase , " AT&T , " which is the company 's signature sound .
4. Mr. " In a world where " ¦ " 
He had nicknames like V.O.G. ( Voice of God ) and " Thunder Throat . "
He projected the image of a giant man , despite being only 5 ' 8 Â½ .
His voice was one of the most recognizable and beloved movie trailer voices of all - time ... the one everyone else still imitates ...
Don LaFontaine was born in Duluth , Minnesota on August 26 , 1940 .
" The King of Voiceovers "  was famous for trailers that began " In a world where " ¦. " 
So famous , he spoofed himself on a Geico commercial shortly before his death a couple years ago .
He provided voiceovers for more than 5,000 movie and videogame trailers , commercials and promotions during his 33 - year career .
At his peak , he was doing as many as 60 promotions per week , and sometimes as many as 35 in a single day right out of his own home recording studio .
5. Ms. GPS
Though first a singer , Karen Jacobsen is known best for giving driving directions .
She is the voice of GPS .
Born in Mackay , Australia , she now resides in New York .
When the Global Positioning System needed a voice in 2005 , they decided the most desirable candidate would be an Australian now living in the Northeastern United States .
Jacobsen won the audition and her voice guides drivers the world over .
To create the computerized speech system , Jacobsen had to record 50 hours of script to get every possible combination of syllables .
Then , the behind - the - scenes tech wizards cut it all up to work in their computer program .
6. Mr. Moviephone
Russ Leatherman was born in 1962 and helped to found Moviephone in 1989 .
A decade later , in 1999 , Moviephone was purchased by AOL .
Leatherman 's voice has become famous and his reviews are featured weekly on CNN , MSNBC , and Fox News Channel as well as radio staions coast to coast .
Being a pop icon always leads to parody ; as the saying goes , imitation is the highest form of flattery , and Russ Leatherman should surely be flattered .
His iconic " Hello and welcome to Moviephone ! "  has been parodied on shows such as Saturday Night Live , The Simpsons , and who can forget the classic " Why do n't you just tell me what movie you want to see ? " from Seinfeld .
7. Mr. BT Speaking Clock
Brian Cobby , who began his career as a telephone exchange worker , was selected from more than 5,000 British Telephone employees to be the voice of BT 's famous speaking clock .
He went on to beat out the other 11 finalist who were all female , to become the first and , to date , only male voice of the BT speaking clock .
In case you 're not familiar with the service , in the United Kingdom , the speaking clock can be reached by dialing 123 on a BT phone line .
It 's automated , of course , but back in the day there were actual people sitting in windowless rooms answering the phone and relaying the time .
Cobby was born on October 12 , 1929 .
He was the voice of the clock for more than 22 years , before finally being replaced in 2007 by Sara Mendes da Costa .
8. Mr. " You 've Got Mail ! "
During the reign of AOL , " You 've Got Mail ! "  - the three words that revolutionized e-mail and even inspired a movie , was heard more than 27 million times a day ( more than 18,000 times a minute ) .
Though AOL eventually went on to get famous folk to record the catch - phrase , the original was voiced by Elwood Edwards , who also did AOL's " Welcome , " " File 's done , " and " Goodbye . "
But how did he land the job in the first place ?
Well , in 1989 , his wife was working in customer service for Quantum Computer Services .
Quantum had an online service called Q - Link .
One day , she overheard the company 's CEO , Steve Case -- yes , the guy who went on to launch AOL -- telling someone how he wanted to incorporate a real person 's voice into the service .
She barked , " Hey , you ought to try Elwood . "
It made sense , seeing as her husband had spent his long career in local radio and TV .
So he spoke those original four phrases into a cassette tape and was soon on his way to becoming a disembodied voice legend .
In an interview , his wife once remarked : " A few times , when he 's been taking a nap , I 've logged onto AOL - and he 's woken himself up ! "
9. Ms. BT
Pat Whymark , the voice of BT Telephone services ( as well as the NHS Swine Flu Hotline ) , began her career studying acting at Royal Welsh Collage of Music and Drama .
In addition to providing voiceovers for numerous commercials , films , and BBC documentaries , Whymark helped to found the Eastern Angels Theatre Company where she composed music for several plays .
Whymark now works solely as a voiceover artist for Voice - Prompt .
10 . Ms. Voicemail
On top of being a best selling - author , consultant , and media personality , Dr. Joan Kenley is also known as the " voice of voicemail . " 
She has recorded voicemail messages for Nortel , Pacific Bell , Verizon , and Sprint voicemail systems .
She 's a talk show host and a psychologist , and involved in all sorts of squishy New Age sounding things :
She 's a core member of The Millionth Circle , an international , grass - roots , volunteer movement comprised of women who believe that gathering in circles is a powerful way to create positive change in world consciousness .
D'oh !
yeah : she 's also the " telephone lady "  on a few episodes of The Simpsons .
Foreign - owned firms today seized the lion 's share of the development contracts to kickstart a wind revolution in offshore Britain that ministers say will eventually match the glory days of the North Sea oil industry .
But Gordon Brown said he was still confident that UK supply firms could win many of the £ 75 bn - worth of contracts needed to build enough clean power to generate 25 % of the country 's electricity .
Nine wind power consortiums have signed agreements with the Crown Estate , which has responsibility for renewable power in UK waters , to take their proposals through the planning stage .
Only five of the nine have British companies involved in the partnerships – two of those with minority stakes – and the pace was largely set by Germany with E.ON , RWE and Siemens , who were all substantial winners .
Centrica , the parent group of British Gas , was the only British group with a majority holding in any of the winning consortiums , but Scottish Power and SSE Renewables took a stake in development areas such as the Dogger Bank and Firth of Forth .
The proposed windfarms will be further away from the coast and in deeper waters than any existing offshore project , and therefore more difficult to build .
But they will also be far less likely to be held up by planning objections that have blighted the development of onshore wind power .
Britain already leads the world in the deployment of offshore wind and has more projects installed , in planning or in construction than any other country .
But the issue of British jobs has become politically sensitive since E.ON awarded 90 % of the £ 2 bn - worth of supply contracts for the world 's biggest windfarm – the London Array off Kent – to German and other overseas firms .
Brown said the new round of wind licences provided a substantial platform for investing in local industrial capacity .
" The offshore wind industry is at the heart of the UK economy 's shift to low carbon and could be worth £ 75bn and support up to 70,000 jobs by 2020 , " he said , adding : " I am definitely going to do everything I can to bring these jobs to Britain . "
The business secretary , Lord Mandelson , and the energy and climate change secretary , Ed Miliband , were similarly upbeat , saying there were already engineering and other companies around the UK gearing up to win a slice of the action .
Miliband said it would damage British companies ' exports if the government at home insisted developers used UK suppliers .
Many of the developers represented at the contract awards in London expressed their own optimism that UK firms could rise to the challenge , but made clear they would press on regardless .
Eddie O'Connor , chief executive of Mainstream Renewable Power , a partner of Siemens on the Hornsea zone , said : " We have to buy the cheapest wherever you can get it . "
The new windfarms announced should produce as much power as eight Drax coal - fired stations .
Today 's were welcomed by Greenpeace , which said the technological challenge should be relished .
" Throughout its history Britain has shown the determination and ingenuity to tackle the great industrial challenges of each era .
In the 21st century these qualities are being called on once again , to enable the transition from fossil fuels to clean , renewable sources of energy .
Our country is home to some of the best engineers , mechanics and construction professionals in the world .
Their expertise will be crucial if we are to harness the massive potential that new technologies like offshore wind have to offer , " said Greenpeace executive director John Sauven .
But while ministers and the developers were excited about the prospects of making a substantial difference to Britain 's security of supply as North Sea oil and gas run out , as well as helping beat UK climate change targets , they also acknowledged the scale of the difficulties .
The Crown Estate said it hoped to see 32 GW of new wind power come on stream , but set no minimum , and its director of marine estate , Rob Hastings , admitted that " it depends on what we encounter " on the way .
O'Connor said there were potentially " millions of problems " but he was confident that none was insuperable .
He singled out skills shortages and the need for a supergrid linking power networks around the North Sea to make up for the intermittent nature of wind .
Wind developers say research and development breakthroughs were also vital if the economics of wind were to improve sufficiently offshore .
The government has spent £ 170 m on grants for R&D but is still struggling to convince a major wind turbine developer such as Siemens or Mitsubishi to establish a blade manufacturing plant in the UK .
The £ 75 bn challenge
The vision of building 6,500 turbines in deep waters around Britain that will generate enough power to provide 25 % of the country 's electricity is an exciting prospect , but a tough challenge .
Many developers admit it will only make financial sense – even with big government subsidies – if technological breakthroughs are made to drive down the £ 75 bn - £ 100 bn estimated cost .
That could involve designing gigantic new blades or using new floating platforms on which seven or eight turbines could be erected , as is being pioneered by Swedish firm Hexicon .
Mainstream Renewable Energy , one of the development licensing winners , argues that the goal of producing 32 gigawatts of power offshore will also only be credible if a supergrid is built .
That could cost up to £ 15 bn to link Britain with Norway and the continent using giant electrical cables through which power could be imported or exported depending on whether the wind was blowing , and which firm needed power at any one time .
­ Denmark 's offshore wind sector already produces too much power during some parts of the day and exports it to other countries .
I wonder why they show the backstage live on TVANY THOUGHTS ?
As a boy , he walked into Keele University – and never left .
And he counts bishops , sportsmen and politicians among his friends .
So just who is Neil Baldwin ?
Last weekend , Keele University celebrated Neil Baldwin's 50th anniversary there .
It was a splendid two - day affair , with speeches from distinguished alumni , a dinner , a testimonial football match , and a service of thanksgiving for his work conducted by the Bishop of Lichfield , a Keele graduate .
But Baldwin has never worked at Keele in any capacity , or been a student there , or had any formal connection with the place .
He walked into the students ' union in 1960 , an engaging schoolboy with learning difficulties from the local town of Newcastle - under - Lyme , and became a fixture .
" I liked the campus and the chapel and the people , " he tells me on the phone .
When , four years later , Malcolm Clarke walked nervously into the students ' union on his first day at university , this stout , jovial young man ambled towards him and said : " Welcome to Keele . I'm Neil Baldwin . "
Clarke says today : " I appreciated his warm welcome , but who exactly was he ?
As always with Neil , his exact status was unclear . "
Most Anglican bishops have met Baldwin at least once .
A keen churchgoer , he turns up at their homes for tea like an old friend , and , though a little puzzled , that 's how they treat him .
At a thanksgiving in the Keele chapel a few years ago for Baldwin 's work there , the visiting vicar recounted how he had first met Baldwin 20 years before , while at theological college in London .
" He seemed to know all the bishops , " he said .
Clarke became the student union president in the turbulent year of 1968 , when Keele students occupied the registry .
Clarke opposed the action and resigned as president over it , but not before proposing Baldwin for honorary life membership of the student union .
For that , at least , he got unanimous support .
I too was there in the late 60s and remember Baldwin as a solid if enigmatic figure .
I 'm pretty sure we first met in the union bar , late at night .
In 1974 , Clarke became mayor of Newcastle - under - Lyme , and on the day of his inauguration , Baldwin sat beside him in the back of the mayoral Daimler , waving regally at puzzled bystanders .
As the 70s closed , Keele appointed a new vice - chancellor and Baldwin phoned Clarke , by then living in Manchester , to give him the news .
" It 's Professor David Harrison of Cambridge , " he said , " and 'e 's a very nice man . "
" A very nice man " is one of Baldwin 's most frequently imitated phrases ; he says it emphatically , and as though there 's a D in the middle of " very " .
" Do you know him then ? " asked Clarke .
" I 've just had tea with him and his wife in Cambridge , " replied Baldwin .
Clarke now says , rather carefully : " I think Professor Harrison may have been under the impression Neil was the Anglican chaplain . "
Baldwin's
Keele student friends thought he was fantasising when he talked about his friendships with Kevin Keegan , Gordon Banks , Graham Taylor and other famous footballers , until one day a well - known member of the Stoke City squad dropped him off at the student union , having given him a lift home from an away game .
When Clarke met the players , they told him they knew Baldwin well – but had doubted his stories of his friendship with the mayor of Newcastle .
Eventually , Baldwin became a regular fixture on the Stoke City team coach for away matches .
He makes it sound terribly simple .
" I met Lou Macari [ Stoke manager in the 1990s and a former Scottish international ] outside the ground and we got talking .
He made me the team 's kit man . "
It sounds as though it can't be true , but it 's confirmed in Macari 's autobiography , Football , My Life , which has seven pages about Baldwin .
Macari treated him as a kind of mascot , getting him to dress up and sit on the touchline for the amusement and morale of his squad – once in a chicken suit , another time in full white tie and tails .
Macari , like Clarke , grew to love him .
He and Baldwin were often seen together in Stoke , walking Macari 's dog .
And one day in 1993 , during a friendly against Aston Villa at Villa Park , Baldwin 's old friends among the Stoke supporters saw him , in full Stoke kit , warming up on the touchline .
With five minutes to go in the match , Macari actually sent this rather overweight man of nearly 50 on to the pitch .
The players on both sides and the referee must have been in on the plan , because Macari then had 12 players on the pitch – and the players passed the ball to Baldwin , who almost got a shot at goal .
In his autobiography Macari calls him " my best - ever signing " .
Baldwin 's unselfconscious remarks were a constant source of amusement for the players , and did wonders for morale .
They never paid him properly as kit man , but have now given him free entrance to Stoke games for life .
Baldwin says Macari is " a very nice man " .
The late John Golding MP used to tell a story about how he walked into the House of Commons restaurant one night and saw Tony Benn , then energy secretary , at a table with Baldwin .
Golding was a Keele graduate and MP for Newcastle - under - Lyme , so he knew him well .
Golding was also the Labour right wing 's chief fixer , and he loathed Benn with a passion , so he left swiftly before either of them saw him .
He never worked out how Baldwin had got the energy secretary to invite him to dinner .
It was quite simple .
Baldwin had come to the House of Commons and put in a card for Benn saying , " Neil Baldwin from Keele – friend of Steve's . "
" Steve " was Tony Benn 's son Stephen , and Baldwin was not making it up .
Like many Keele graduates , Stephen Benn keeps in touch with Baldwin to this day .
Stories about Baldwin abound , and they are almost always true .
He once sold a Keele rag magazine to then prime minister Harold Wilson and buttonholed the Duke of Edinburgh for a chat about world problems .
He wrote on spec to an American oarsman who was in the Cambridge boat race crew one year , and got himself on board the official launch that followed the race and into the boat - race ball afterwards .
" Neil 's complete lack of self - consciousness has made him many genuine friendships with the famous , " says Clarke .
" People say he 's a fantasist , but he is n't – he turns his fantasies into reality . "
As a young man he had an unskilled job in the pottery industry in Stoke , and in the 80s he travelled as Nello the Clown in Sir Robert Fossett 's circus .
His other travels were aided by his habit of putting on a clerical collar before hitching lifts .
His mother , Mary , used to worry about how he would cope after her death and sensibly made him move into his own flat ; she died a few years ago , and Baldwin is managing .
People are always willing to help him , because , says Clarke " there 's not an ounce of malice in him " .
Every generation of Keele students for 50 years has looked after Baldwin , and he in turn has enriched their lives with his extraordinary adventures .
Generations of Keele students , including Stephen Benn , have played in the Neil Baldwin Football Club , of which he is the manager and captain , and in which he wins Player of the Year every year .
Clarke calls it " a motley collection of students of the day , managed , coached , captained and kit- managed by Neil " .
Now his footballing days are probably over .
He is 64 this month and will go into hospital this year to have two new hips .
He may continue to train his team , though .
" I 've always been grateful to the people at Keele , " Baldwin says in his calm , gravelly voice with its strong Potteries accent .
" The students have always been wonderful , they are still good friends to me . "
Baldwin's old friend Malcolm Clarke now chairs the Football Supporters Federation and is the supporters ' representative on the Football Association council .
The two meet regularly at Stoke City matches .
Clarke and Keele alumni officer John Easom want the university to give Baldwin an honorary degree , as do many Keele graduates , including me .
" He has contributed a lot more to the university than most people who get honorary degrees , " says Clarke .
For the moment the university establishment is resisting .
Clarke has even bigger ambitions : he wants Baldwin to have an honour .
He plans to petition Gordon Brown .
It might just work .
There could be votes in it .
And it can only be a matter of time before I hear Baldwin say that " he 's a very nice man " .
A dentist demonstrates a training procedure , using the new humanoid robot named Hanako which was developed by local engineers at universities and a robot maker to aim at training experience to simulate real dental work for student dentists , at Showa University in Tokyo Thursday , March 25 , 2010 .
Hanako is equipped with the set of teeth made of hard plastic and lifelike mouth cavity which can bleeds and flows saliva just as human reflects against stimuli .
It also has voice recognition and speech capability so that trainees can just not only improve treatment skill but also learn to hold conversation with the patients to relax them .

Back in 2004 I was living in New York and commuting between New York and Washington , DC on the Acela .
I was working in a fairly rural part of Virginia and was lucky enough to accidentally experience a once in 17 years event : the emergence of Magicicada Brood X ( Picture from Wikipedia Now I realize that most people probably do n't think that being in a place where millions of large winged insects appear from the ground and make a deafening noise in search of a mate is fun .
But Magicicada is so cool that it 's hard to miss their emergence .
And Magicicada loves prime numbers .
For that reason , Magicicada Brood X ( which lives along the Eastern coast of the US ) is place number 127 in The Geek Atlas .
Your next chance to meet the little beastie is 2021 .
This particular brood spends 17 years underground living off the sap inside the roots of trees .
Once ready to become an adult it burrows upwards and climbs its tree .
Then when high up in the tree it molts and spreads its wings .
Once ready to fly it makes a humming sound which , given that millions emerge all at the same time , fills the air with an incredible din .
The female cicadas make a clicking sound and between the humming and clicking the males and females find each other and mate .
They live only a few weeks above ground and new baby cicadas fall to the grown and burrow to the roots to start another 17 year wait .
To get a feeling for what it 's like to be around when Magicicada makes its appearance , here 's Sir David Attenborough :
There are other cicadas that live on a 7 and 13 year cycle .
All these cycles are based around a prime number of years .
The hypothesis is that the cicada uses a combination of emergence en masse and a prime numbered cycle to avoid predators .
A prime numbered cycle means that the cicada rarely meets a predator and mass emergence would overwhelm any predator around .
A prime numbered cycle avoids predators because it does n't have any factors .
Suppose that the cicada had an 18 year cycle , any predator that peaked every 2 , 3 , 6 or 9 years could synchronize with the cicada and always meet it and eat it .
By having a prime numbered cycle the cicada rarely meets a predator and predators have a hard time synchronizing with it .
For a more detailed look at the prime numbered cycle , you can read the paper Prime Number Selection of Cycles in a Predator - Prey Model PS

When future historians scan through the winter of 2009 - 2010 at the big pop cultural touchstones , two completely independent projects will stick out to them : James Cameron ’s love song to nature Avatar , and MTV ’s slam dunk of a reality show Jersey Shore .
While the two projects could n’t look any differently – one cost $ 250 million dollars to produce over a period of almost 20 years , while the other cost MTV maybe a few barrels of Axe Body Spray , at the most – when one looks a little closer you can see that , not surprising especially considered the title of this article , the two projects are exactly the same thing !
Let ’s break it down :
Both introduce an entirely new language James Cameron famously sat down with a linguist and developed an entire new language for his alien Na’vi race , coming up with about 1000 completely new vocabulary words .
In an even more amazing way , Jersey Shore introduced us to a hidden sub-category of our own English language , a much more difficult feat .
For example , instead of a girl asking a guy if he kissed some other girl , in GuidoSpeak the correct phrasing is “ Did you put your lips to her ? ”
That kind of poetry ca n’t be created no matter how many linguists you employ .
Both contain allegories about racial segregation Avatar is a not - so - subtle allegory about race – hint : the blue people are really supposed to be a bit more red , as in , Washington Redskins red – but Jersey Shore also features its own GoldenGlobesBait message about the horrors of racial segregation .
Specifically , orange people .
Just look at every scene that takes place in one of the shore ’s nearly empty dance clubs .
For no good reason , all of Jersey completely vacates the premises whenever our Guido Eight dance the night away at Karma .
And while some may point to the fact that Karma looks like one of the lamest clubs in the world , one that would n’t be able to even draw PETA protestors if they held nightly cock - fights , those people are just being glib .
Clearly , others on the shore are racist against orange - colored people .
Soon , they ’ll be asking for the institution of separate drinking fountains which , all joking aside , might be a smart idea since fake tan spray can wash off and is probably toxic .
Both necessitate the use of support groups
It takes a potent movie to cause the emergence of support groups that console each other over the fact that the world in the movie is n’t real .
But that ’s what has happened with Avatar .
Groups are popping up all over the Internet helping people cope with A.D.S. ( Avatar Depression Syndrome ) .
Some people are actually considering suicide because they ca n’t visit Pandora in real life .
Less reported is the fact that support groups populated with thousands of men in their 20s and 30s have formed organically , all helping each other come to terms with the fact that they ’ll never have abs like “ The Situation ” .
Both are in three dimensions James Cameron ’s labor of love has been designated a “ game changer ” in the annals of cinema mostly because of its innovative use of 3 - D technology , blasting the world of Pandora into the depths of your eyeballs whether you like it or not , bitches .
In Jersey Shore though , the story goes much deeper than simply the screen .
Even if you did n’t want to watch Snooki , JWOWW , DJ Paulie D or any of their friends , your own TV would n’t let you .
Turn on a hockey game , flip over to a late night comedy show , or cycle through your favorite comedy video website , you just could n’t get away from references to the cast members .
They are ubiquitous .
And that ’s the kind of all - invasive proctological - and - penile - exam - at - the - same - exact - time - with - electric - probes James Cameron was hoping to achieve with his fancy cameras .
Instead , Jersey
Shore did it in good old fashioned regular 2 - D and a cast of douchebags .
As images of the hotly anticipated new Google phone bombard the blogosphere , revelations that it will be named Nexus One have dismayed the family of a famous science - fiction writer .
Isa Dick Hackett , daughter of author Philip K . Dick who wrote the novel that inspired the Blade Runner movie , said in an interview that she was “ shocked and dismayed ” by reports that the company had named its new smartphone Nexus One .
An image of the ' Google phone ' published by a Google employee on Twitter .
The new Google - branded phone will run on Google 's own Android operating system , and is expected to be a strong rival to the iPhone .
As president of the arm of Dick 's estate that handles film adaptations and the licensing of materials , Hackett told she believed the name had “ a very obvious connection ” to her father 's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep , which centres on a generation of rogue Nexus - 6 robots .
SAN DIEGO – One way to get noticed as a scientist is to tackle a really difficult problem .
Physicist Sean Carroll has become a bit of a rock star in geek circles by attempting to answer an age - old question no scientist has been able to fully explain :
What is time ?
Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist at Caltech where he focuses on theories of cosmology , field theory and gravitation by studying the evolution of the universe .
Carroll 's latest book , From Eternity to Here : The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time , * is an attempt to bring his theory of time and the universe to physicists and nonphysicists alike .*
Here at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , where he gave a presentation on the arrow of time , scientists stopped him in the hallway to tell him what big fans they were of his work .
Carroll sat down with Wired.com on Feb. 19 at AAAS to explain his theories and why Marty McFly ’s adventure could never exist in the real world , where time only goes forward and never back .
Wired.com : Can you explain your theory of time in layman ’s terms ?
Sean Carroll : I 'm trying to understand how time works .
And that 's a huge question that has lots of different aspects to it .
A lot of them go back to Einstein and spacetime and how we measure time using clocks .
But the particular aspect of time that I 'm interested in is the arrow of time : the fact that the past is different from the future .
We remember the past but we do n't remember the future .
There are irreversible processes .
There are things that happen , like you turn an egg into an omelet , but you ca n’t turn an omelet into an egg .
And we sort of understand that halfway .
The arrow of time is based on ideas that go back to Ludwig Boltzmann , an Austrian physicist in the 1870s .
He figured out this thing called entropy .
Entropy is just a measure of how disorderly things are .
And it tends to grow .
That 's the second law of thermodynamics : Entropy goes up with time , things become more disorderly .
So , if you neatly stack papers on your desk , and you walk away , you 're not surprised they turn into a mess .
You'd be very surprised if a mess turned into neatly stacked papers .
That 's entropy and the arrow of time .
Entropy goes up as it becomes messier .
So , Boltzmann understood that and he explained how entropy is related to the arrow of time .
But there 's a missing piece to his explanation , which is , why was the entropy ever low to begin with ?
Why were the papers neatly stacked in the universe ?
Basically , our observable universe begins around 13.7 billion years ago in a state of exquisite order , exquisitely low entropy .
It 's like the universe is a wind - up toy that has been sort of puttering along for the last 13.7 billion years and will eventually wind down to nothing .
But why was it ever wound up in the first place ?
Why was it in such a weird low - entropy unusual state ?
That is what I 'm trying to tackle .
I ’m trying to understand cosmology , why the Big Bang had the properties it did .
And it 's interesting to think that connects directly to our kitchens and how we can make eggs , how we can remember one direction of time , why causes precede effects , why we are born young and grow older .
It 's all because of entropy increasing .
It 's all because of conditions of the Big Bang .
Wired.com : So the Big Bang starts it all .
But you theorize that there 's something before the Big Bang .
Something that makes it happen .
What 's that ?
Carroll :
If you find an egg in your refrigerator , you 're not surprised .
You do n't say , " Wow , that 's a low - entropy configuration .
That 's unusual , " because you know that the egg is not alone in the universe .
It came out of a chicken , which is part of a farm , which is part of the biosphere , etc. , etc .
But with the universe , we do n't have that appeal to make .
We ca n’t say that the universe is part of something else .
But that 's exactly what I 'm saying .
I 'm fitting in with a line of thought in modern cosmology that says that the observable universe is not all there is .
It 's part of a bigger multiverse .
The Big Bang was not the beginning .
And if that 's true , it changes the question you 're trying to ask .
It 's not , " Why did the universe begin with low entropy ? "
It 's , " Why did part of the universe go through a phase with low entropy ? "
And that might be easier to answer .
Wired.com :
In this multiverse theory , you have a static universe in the middle .
From that , smaller universes pop off and travel in different directions , or arrows of time .
So does that mean that the universe at the center has no time ?
Carroll :
So that 's a distinction that is worth drawing .
There 's different moments in the history of the universe and time tells you which moment you 're talking about .
And then there 's the arrow of time , which give us the feeling of progress , the feeling of flowing or moving through time .
So that static universe in the middle has time as a coordinate but there 's no arrow of time .
There 's no future versus past , everything is equal to each other .
Wired.com :
So it ’s a time that we do n't understand and can't perceive ?
Carroll :
We can measure it , but you would n't feel it .
You would n't experience it .
Because objects like us would n't exist in that environment .
Because we depend on the arrow of time just for our existence .
Wired.com :
So then , what is time in that universe ?
Carroll : Even in empty space , time and space still exist .
Physicists have no problem answering the question of “ If a tree falls in the woods and no one 's there to hear it , does it make a sound ? ”
They say , “ Yes !
Of course it makes a sound ! ”
Likewise , if time flows without entropy and there 's no one there to experience it , is there still time ?
Yes .
There 's still time .
It 's still part of the fundamental laws of nature even in that part of the universe .
It 's just that events that happen in that empty universe do n't have causality , do n't have memory , do n't have progress and do n't have aging or metabolism or anything like that .
It 's just random fluctuations .
Wired.com :
So if this universe in the middle is just sitting and nothing 's happening there , then how exactly are these universes with arrows of time popping off of it ?
Because that seems like a measurable event .
Carroll : Right .
That 's an excellent point .
And the answer is , almost nothing happens there .
So the whole point of this idea that I 'm trying to develop is that the answer to the question , “ Why do we see the universe around us changing ? ” is that there is no way for the universe to truly be static once and for all .
There is no state the universe could be in that would just stay put for ever and ever and ever .
If there were , we should settle into that state and sit there forever .
It 's like a ball rolling down the hill , but there 's no bottom to the hill .
The ball will always be rolling both in the future and in the past .
So , that center part is locally static – that little region there where there seems to be nothing happening .
But , according to quantum mechanics , things can happen occasionally .
Things can fluctuate into existence .
There 's a probability of change occurring .
So , what I 'm thinking of is the universe is kind of like an atomic nucleus .
It 's not completely stable .
It has a half - life .
It will decay .
If you look at it , it looks perfectly stable , there 's nothing happening … there 's nothing happening … and then , boom !
Suddenly there 's an alpha particle coming out of it , except the alpha particle is another universe .
Wired.com :
So inside those new universes , which move forward with the arrow of time , there are places where the laws of physics are different – anomalies in spacetime .
Does the arrow of time still exist there ?
Carroll :
It could .
The weird thing about the arrow of time is that it 's not to be found in the underlying laws of physics .
It 's not there .
So it 's a feature of the universe we see , but not a feature of the laws of the individual particles .
So the arrow of time is built on top of whatever local laws of physics apply .
Wired.com :
So if the arrow of time is based on our consciousness and our ability to perceive it , then do people like you who understand it more fully experience time differently then the rest of us ?
Carroll : Not really .
The way it works is that the perception comes first and then the understanding comes later .
So the understanding does n't change the perception , it just helps you put that perception into a wider context .
It ’s a famous quote that 's in my book from St. Augustine , where he says something along the lines of , " I know what time is until you ask me for a definition about it , and then I can't give it to you . "
So I think we all perceive the passage of time in very similar ways .
But then trying to understand it does n’t change our perceptions .
Wired.com :
So what happens to the arrow in places like a black hole or at high speeds where our perception of it changes ?
Carroll :
This goes back to relativity and Einstein .
For anyone moving through spacetime , them and the clocks they bring along with them – including their biological clocks like their heart and their mental perceptions – no one ever feels time to be passing more quickly or more slowly .
Or , at least , if you have accurate clocks with you , your clock always ticks one second per second .
That 's true if you 're inside a black hole , here on Earth , in the middle of nowhere , it does n't matter .
But what Einstein tells us is that path you take through space and time can dramatically affect the time that you feel elapsing .
The arrow of time is about a direction , but it 's not about a speed .
The important thing is that there 's a consistent direction .
That everywhere through space and time , this is the past and this is the future .
Wired.com :
So you would tell Michael J. Fox that it 's impossible for him to go back to the past and save his family ?
Carroll :
The simplest way out of the puzzle of time travel is to say that it can't be done .
That 's very likely the right answer .
However , we do n't know for sure .
We 're not absolutely proving that it can't be done .
Wired.com :
At the very least , you can't go back .
Carroll : Yeah , no .
You can easily go to the future , that 's not a problem .
Wired.com :
We 're going there right now !
Carroll : Yesterday , I went to the future and here I am !
One of things I point out in the book is that if we do imagine that it was possible , hypothetically , to go into the past , all the paradoxes that tend to arise are ultimately traced to the fact that you can't define a consistent arrow of time if you can go into the past .
Because what you think of as your future is in the universe 's past .
So it can't be one in the same everywhere .
And that 's not incompatible with the laws of physics , but it 's very incompatible with our everyday experience , where we can make choices that affect the future , but we cannot make choices that affect the past .
Wired.com :
So , one part of the multiverse theory is that eventually our own universe will become empty and static .
Does that mean we 'll eventually pop out another universe of our own ?
Carroll :
The arrow of time does n't move forward forever .
There 's a phase in the history of the universe where you go from low entropy to high entropy .
But then once you reach the locally maximum entropy you can get to , there 's no more arrow of time .
It 's just like this room .
If you take all the air in this room and put it in the corner , that 's low entropy .
And then you let it go and it eventually fills the room and then it stops .
And then the air 's not doing anything .
In that time when it 's changing , there 's an arrow of time , but once you reach equilibrium , then the arrow ceases to exist .
And then , in theory , new universes pop off .
Wired.com :
So there 's an infinite number of universes behind us and an infinite number of universes coming ahead of us .
Does that mean we can go forward to visit those universes ahead of us ?
Carroll : I suspect not , but I do n't know .
In fact , I have a postdoc at Caltech who 's very interested in the possibility of universes bumping into each other .
Now , we call them universes .
But really , to be honest , they are regions of space with different local conditions .
It 's not like they 're metaphysically distinct from each other .
They 're just far away .
It 's possible that you could imagine universes bumping into each other and leaving traces , observable effects .
It 's also possible that that 's not going to happen .
That if they 're there , there 's not going to be any sign of them there .
If that 's true , the only way this picture makes sense is if you think of the multiverse not as a theory , but as a prediction of a theory .
If you think you understand the rules of gravity and quantum mechanics really , really well , you can say , “ According to the rules , universes pop into existence .
Even if I can't observe them , that 's a prediction of my theory , and I 've tested that theory using other methods . ”
We 're not even there yet .
We do n't know how to have a good theory , and we do n't know how to test it .
But the project that one envisions is coming up with a good theory in quantum gravity , testing it here in our universe , and then taking the predictions seriously for things we do n't observe elsewhere .
