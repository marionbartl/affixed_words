It must be the season of apologies in presidential politics .
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton apologized personally to Senator Barack Obama on Thursday for a top adviser ’s public suggestion that Republicans would go after Mr. Obama for his youthful drug use .
This came a day after Mike Huckabee apologized to Mitt Romney , a Mormon , for remarks that suggested Mormons believe that Jesus and Satan are brothers .
But in the aftermath of the apologies , both the Clinton and Huckabee campaigns kept the original slurs alive through a series of interviews , raising questions about the sincerity of their apologies , especially in the heat of a wide - open campaign with the first voting less than three weeks away .
At the same time , as the news media report on the apologies , they , too , become complicit in regurgitating the original comments .
Reporters have the choice of either helping keep the accusations in circulation or keeping readers or viewers in the dark .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Gold prices will test a record $ 1,000 an ounce this year , boosted by growing investment interest , safe - haven demand and strong market fundamentals , a Citigroup metals analyst said .
“ We believe gold has entered a new investment - driven phase , in a much more hospitable macro setting .
Catalysts are rotating from safe - haven demand , to currencies , to the re-flation trade , as new buyers enter the market , ” John Hill , director , metals research , at Citigroup in San Francisco , told clients in a note dated Sunday .
However , Hill also said he believed the broader investor base was not yet involved .
Hill kept his gold forecasts unchanged at $ 750 for 2008 , $ 800 for 2009 and $ 820 for 2010 .
“ Within these ranges , we fully expect a test of $ 1,000 ounce in 2008 , ” Hill said .
Hill also raised the price targets for shares of Barrick Gold Corp ABX.N , the world 's largest gold producer , to $ 62 from his previous estimate of $ 48 , and to $ 67 from $ 54 for No. 2 Newmont Mining Corp NEM.N .
Gold ’s appeal as a safe - haven investment has increased due to worries of further write - downs among major financial institutions and credit market meltdown in the United States , the world ’s biggest economy .
In just three weeks , spot gold has jumped nearly $ 120 to Monday ’s peak of $ 914.00 from a bottom of $ 795.30 on December 21 .
Lifting With “ Light Weights ” to Gain Strength & Definition ?
Pin 675 675 Shares
Muscle size and muscle strength are not always directly related .
I used to think there was a direct correlation between muscle size and muscle strength , believing that the if gained strength in a muscle the bigger that muscle would get .
" Visual Impact Kettlebells " - Home Workout Course
A kettlebell course we filmed on the beach in Costa Rica , aimed at helping you get slim and lean without adding bulk .
If you think that this is the case you are mistaken .
Do n’t get me wrong , bodybuilders do strive to gain strength to get bigger , but they are gaining strength in a rep range of 6 - 12 and trying to “ tear down the muscles ” in the process .
They also employ methods like “ forced reps ” , “ negatives ” , and “ supersets ” .
They rest and allow the muscles to repair … striving for the muscles to come back slightly larger and slightly stronger in the process ( this is obviously a simplified explanation ) .
Let me ask you to think about this …
What If You Gained Strength Without Damaging the Muscles in the Process ?
Seriously , if damage to the muscle is minimized , the potential for growth is limited as well .
One of the big reasons I ’m against forced reps and negatives is that they are very effective at inducing damage to the target muscle .
This is effective for bodybuilding , but not for the slim and toned “ Hollywood ” look .
Another problem with gaining size at the same rate that you gain strength is that you never develop good “ muscle density ” .
An example of an athlete that displays good muscle density is an Olympic Gymnast .
They need to get stronger without getting bigger , to be effective at what they do .
This is what I am talking about .
The opposite of this would be professional wrestlers , their muscles have a really smooth and puffy look to them because they strive for size and strength .
How is It Possible To Get Stronger Without Getting Bigger ?
I did n’t understand true strength training until I stopped reading mainstream bodybuilding and workout magazines .
I became a student of martial arts philosophies , high level sports , as well as military training ( from former soviet special forces trainer Pavel Tsatsouline ) .
After much research I discovered that strength was basically based on your ability to send neurological impulses from your brain to your muscles .
So basically the better you get at contracting a muscle hard , the more strength you will display in that muscle .
How Does A Muscle Contract Hard ?
There is a principle you need to know about called the “ All or None Principle ” .
Each individual muscle is made up of many many muscle fibers .
When a muscle contracts , you brain is basically sending an electrical charge to that muscle .
To keep this simple , let ’s say that your bicep is made up of 100 individual muscle fibers .
Each individual fiber is either contracted or relaxed .
When you lift a light weight , maybe only 5 - 10 fibers will “ fire off ” while the other 90 fibers are completely inactive .
When you lift a heavier weight , your brain may send an electrical impulse to “ fire off ” 15 - 20 fibers , while the other 80 or so muscle fibers are inactive .
So muscle contraction is based upon what percentage of muscle fibers are “ firing off ” … and how many are inactive .
So the muscle fiber is either all the way activated or not at all …
” All or None ” .
A harder contraction would indicate that your brain is sending stronger electrical impulses to the muscle , recruiting more muscle fibers in the process .
So Strength is More Nerve Based than Muscle Based
Gaining strength is largely based upon your skill to recruit a larger percentage of fibers in a specific muscle .
Think of your brain as a power source .
Between the power source and the muscle is wiring ( neurons ) .
The better the wiring to the muscle , the more electrical current that can get delivered to the muscle .
The stronger the electrical current , the larger percentage of fibers you can activate in that muscle .
This is what I ’m referring to when I talk about the “ mind to muscle link ” .
Increasing the neural pathways ( mind to muscle link ) is really the way to route to strong contractions and muscle strength .
Turn That Stream Into a River of Electricity !
I think that it helps to visualize a bit when you are tying to gain strength .
It makes sense because strength originates from your brain .
Have you ever seen a black belt in karate take his fist and put it through a stack of bricks ?
Then you will see a beginner try the same thing and fail miserably ?
The experienced black belt has developed a serious neurological pathway between his brain and the muscles involved in that movement .
The beginner has a small pathway between his brain and muscles involved in that movement .
The beginner has a small electrical stream going to his muscles and the experienced black belt has a massive river of electricity flooding his muscles to fire off a larger percentage of muscle fibers !
How to Build Your Neural Pathways With Light Weights
This may blow you away and challenge everything you thought about gaining strength .
You do n’t have to lift heavy weights all the time to get stronger !
To be honest , if you have joint problems you could get stronger while never lifting heavy weights !
To get stronger all you need to do is practice the skill of generating hard contractions in a certain lift .
If you developed the ability to contract your muscles hard , like you were lifting a heavier weight … you would experience many of the same benefits of lifting that heavier weight .
Your muscles do n’t know how much weight you are lifting .
Lift light weights like they are heavy , to get stronger with light weights .
There Are Some Limitations to This Way of Lifting
To get extremely strong , your tendons need to feel a heavy load to get stronger as well .
The way I like to lift light is to mix up light days and heavy days .
I may use 75 % of the weight I normally use and lift it for the same amount of reps ( 5 or less ) at the same tempo ( slow and steady ) .
Also , even if I am going to lift heavy , I perform my warmup sets like they are super heavy .
For instance on the incline dumbbell bench I would do 50 for 5 reps and pretend like it is extremely heavy and lift it slowly while contracting my arms and upper chest hard … even though I could lift it easily , many more times than that .
Then I would do the same thing with 60 pounds before moving on to my work sets .
You will find that your work sets feel lighter after doing this , it is really strange !
Tips to “ Increase Your Skill ” at Generating Strong Contractions
The easiest way to increase your mind - to - muscle link is to just practice contracting that muscle as hard as possible while lifting regardless of how light the weight is .
Do n’t ever lift a weight again without taking advantage of this opportunity to gain strength .
You have to lift the weight slowly to generate a lot of tension in the muscle .
The way I like to visualize it is this :
Let ’s say I ’m benching .
On the way down I ’m squeezing harder and harder and my brain is charging up my muscles to the max , this takes about 2 - 3 seconds .
At the bottom of the lift I easily push the weight back up , because my muscles are charged with electricity .
At the top I rest for one second to let my brain charge up again before it gets ready to send voltage to the muscle again .
Borrow Electricity from Surrounding Muscles
This is a great tip that will help you get stronger immediately .
It will also help you get toned over every inch of your body , when you master this skill !
All of your muscles have a certain amount of electrical current in them at all times .
When you flex a muscle near the muscle being worked you can add a bit of voltage to that muscle and generate a stronger contraction .
Here is a quick exercise I want you to try .
Flex your pecs without flexing any other body part .
Now flex your pecs but this time make a fist and squeeze it as tight as possible make the fist tighter and tighter over 2 - 3 seconds while flexing your pecs harder and harder .
Did you feel a difference ?
Want to gain strength on a lift your next workout ?
Next time you do any sort of bench press or barbell curl , squeeze the heck out of the bar .
Eventually you will got so good at this technique that you will flex a muscle groups that are n’t even close to the muscle group being worked and it will aid in the lift .
Believe it or not , contracting your abs can help with almost every lift , plus you will quickly get amazing abs , since you are increasing the mind to muscle link in this muscle every time you do a lift for a different body part .
But Wo n’t Strength Gains Stop at Some Point ?
I was worried that once I developed the ability to “ fire off ” 100 % of my muscle fibers in a given muscle that I would n’t gain any additional strength .
What I found was very interesting .
Most of us are only using a very small percentage of our muscle fibers .
The only way you would come close to firing off 100 % of your muscle fibers is if you got electrocuted .
There is certainly a point where you will quit gaining strength , but a lot of that is tendon strength and skeletal structure , etc .
At that point you would want to just concentrate an generating strong contractions with that same weight instead of lifting heavier .
This will increase muscle density and muscle tone .
Some Things To Avoid When Aiming For Strength
A big thing to avoid is lifting the weights at a fast pace .
This is great way to workout your tendons and temporarily get stronger , but it is also a great way to get injured .
Also , you want to avoid damaging the muscles .
Your brain will not send a full electrical impulse to a damaged muscle !
Ever try to flex a muscle that was really sore ?
It is next to impossible .
A great way to avoid muscle damage is to keep the your workout volume low .
Just do a total of 8 - 10 sets per body part … and stick to around 5 reps ( remember you can lift light weights for 5 reps as well ) .
The reason you keep the reps low is that it is hard to focus on generating strong contractions on each rep if you have to do 8 - 12 .
Strength Training Is Actually The Best Route To Permanent Muscle Tone
I ’m a big fan of getting stronger without getting bigger .
This is a great way to look really well defined .
Again , think of an Olympic Gymnast or a Welterweight Boxer .
These are athletes with strong muscles that are n’t big .
Efficient muscles are defined muscles .
That “ high rep ” way of getting defined muscles is caused by creating a temporary “ pump ” in the muscles .
They will look great while working out , but this muscle tone is temporary .

Obviously , to see all of this muscle tone , you will need to make sure your body fat is under control .
The Origin of Speeches : Wrathful Dispersion for real ?
Following up on " The comparative theology of linguistic diversity " ( 12/31/2007 ) , Tracy Walsh has written to draw my attention to Isaac E. Mozeson , " The Origin of Speeches : Intelligent Design in Language " .
This book is apparently not a joke .
The description on amazon.com 's web site reads :
The Origin of Speeches begins by recapping the history of our views about the source of language .
It then debunks the errors that infuse your dictionary , like those about how words in " unrelated " languages could only have identical sound and sense by " coincidence . "
It does so with both quality and quantity of data .
The next chapters give anyone the skills to sleuth out the Edenic origin of any human word .
One learns about letters that shift in sound and location , and letters that drop in and drop out .
We discover how Edenics works much like other natural sciences , such as chemistry and physics .
Like - sounding opposite words were certainly programmed , not pragmatically evolved .
According to the review by Richard D. Wilkins , " Examples are provided here in copious detail ; many hundreds more English words and foreign cognates can be explored in the companion E - Word CD Dictionary . "
There 's an Edenics website :
Here you will discover that ALL human words contain forms of the Edenic roots within them .
These proto-Semitic or early Biblical Hebrew words were programmed into our common ancestors , Adam and Eve , before the language dispersion , or babble at the Tower of Babel -- which kickstarted multi-national human history .
In the Edenics FAQ , Mozeson claims ( improbably ) that " Since the 1990s M.I.T. Professor Noam Chomsky was behind attacks on The Word in academic journals , and even forced the editor of a chain of Midwest Jewish newspapers , The National Jewish Post & Opinion , to drop an Edenics column .
Amazingly , this world - class linguist and anarchist had to write a negative review for Amazon.com where he put absurd words in my mouth . "
Mozeson is also the author of " The Word : The Dictionary that Reveals the Hebrew Sources of English " .
His theory seems to be that God was a sort of weak cryptographer , who did n't actually create any new languages after Babel , but simply mixed up the old ones ( " letters that shift in sound and location , and letters that drop in and out " ) in ways that Mozeson has figured out how to decrypt .
This strikes me as crank etymology with a religious overlay , rather than a serious attempt at rationalizing the linguistic aspects of Genesis .
[ Update -- Rosie Redfield writes :
The biological equivalent of Edenics is Baraminology - phylogenetic analysis of the evolution that 's assumed to have happened since Noah 's Ark.
Wikipedia has the details .
It seems to me that Baraminology is closer to this . ]
[ Update # 2 -- John Brewer writes :
no discussion of the intersection between historical linguistics and Biblical study should be considered complete without a mention of the legendary 17th century or thereabouts scholar who determined that Eden was at least tri-lingual , with God speaking Swedish , Adam speaking Danish , and the serpent speaking French .
Googling seems to attribute this to someone named Andreas Kemke .
( I remember the theory , but not the name of the theorist , from my undergraduate days in the pre-Google 80's . )
LL seems not to have referred to it previously ( assuming I 'm working the search feature correctly ) , but Sally Thomason discussed the Kemke Hypothesis in a 1994 post to something called Darwin - L. I am particularly intrigued by the Wrathful Dispersion
Theory because the scriptural account of Babel seems to be pretty much the only thing in Genesis prior to the birth of Abraham which does not appear to be in irreconcilable tension with the consensus of modern secular science ( at least if you do n't get hung up on the dating of the event , which of course may vary depending on which textual tradition for Genesis you think is authoritative ) .
Not that the plain - of - Shinar account has been confirmed ; rather the ultimate relationship , if any , between Proto - Indo - European and , say , Proto - Na - Dene remains at least as unexplained as the origin of language in the first place .
It 's not clear whether this is because historical linguistics has n't achieved very much compared to geology , biology , astronomy etc etc etc or because its practitioners are more modest and thus more willing to 'fess up that they do n't have sufficient data to answer certain very interesting questions and may never get to the point of being able to answer them .
By the way , there is a certain Christian tradition of understanding the gift of tongues recorded in Acts as a specific reversal of the unfortunate results of Wrathful Dispersion , which can be seen in some of the Eastern Orthodox hymns used on Pentecost Sunday , such as the konkation which begins ( in one English translation ) " When the Most High came down and confused the tongues , He divided the nations , but when He distributed the tongues of fire , He called all to unity . "
Happy New Year !
And Faith Jones writes :
Isaac Mozeson reminds me of Izzy Cohen .
This guy shows up on all kinds of listservs promoting the idea that idioms are based on mis-hearings of the Hebrew Bible , a string of Hebrew words , or in a pinch Aramaic ones .
Who exactly is supposed to have mis-heard someone speaking Biblical Hebrew and assimilated these expressions into modern English -- presumably a time - traveller of some kind -- is not explained .
Here are some places where he expounds his theory .
Google " Izzy Cohen idioms " to get lots more .
Very good for a laugh .
http://www.musicalenglishlessons.org/contributors/izzycohen-idioms.htm
http://anned.tblog.com/post/24511
I worked for a number of years as a Judaica librarian , and it was my observation that many people felt the need to promote Hebrew and / or Aramaic as a source for pretty much any language .
This mania was certainly found among the highly religious , but many moderately observant Jews latched on to the language issue as well .
It seemed to me at times the religious fervour they could n't work up for the theology they invested instead in linguistics .
This perhaps made them feel that the basis of their belief was scientific rather than superstitious .
In the event it seems to amount to the same thing .

ISSE condemns police assault on University of Florida student
By International Students for Social Equality ( US )
19 September 2007
The International Students for Social Equality condemns Monday ’s brutal attack on a student at the University of Florida as an outrageous violation of democratic rights and free speech .
The journalism student was tackled , handcuffed , assaulted with a Taser stun gun and arrested by university police during a forum held by Democratic senator and 2004 presidential candidate John Kerry .
The assault on the student , Andrew Meyer , a 21 - year - old senior in the College of Journalism and Communications , occurred after Meyer pointedly questioned Kerry on the refusal of himself and the Democratic Party to pursue charges of voter fraud in the 2004 elections , seek to impeach President Bush , or oppose preparations for war against Iran .
Kerry said nothing while six police officers grabbed the student in the midst of his questioning of the senator and proceeded to shock him at least once with a Taser gun .
On Tuesday , Kerry refused to condemn the actions of the police .
“ The police must have had a reason to make their decision , ” Kerry said , adding that the attack on the student was “ a law enforcement issue . ”
The incident began when Meyer approached an open floor microphone during a question - and - answer session .
Citing a book by journalist Greg Palast , who documented voting irregularities in the 2004 elections , Meyer said , “ [ Palast ] said you won the 2004 election — is n’t that amazing ?
There were multiple reports of disenfranchising of black voters on the day of the election in 2004 in Florida and Ohio . ”
Kerry quickly interrupted , “ So what ’s the question , what ’s the question ? ”
One of a group of campus police and officials standing directly behind Meyer approached him and told him to leave the microphone .
Speaking to the campus police , Meyer said , “ He ’s been talking for two hours — I think I can have two minutes , thank you very much . ”
He then asked the senator , with so many outstanding instances of fraud already being reported during voting , “ How could you concede on the day ? ”
Meyer next asked Kerry , “ If you ’re so against [ invading ]
Iran , how come you ’re not saying , ‘ Let ’s impeach Bush now ’ ?
Impeach Bush now before he can invade Iran ! ”
Meyer pointed out that a Republican - controlled Congress had impeached Clinton on completely frivolous grounds .
He then asked , “ Were you a member of Skull and Bones in college with Bush ? ”
At that point , the microphone was cut off and police grabbed Meyer by the arms and began to pull him out of the auditorium .
Meyer protested , shouting , “ I have n’t done anything !
They ’re arresting me !
I have n’t done anything ! ”
After being dragged to the back of the auditorium , Meyer briefly pulled his arms free before being grabbed around the neck and tackled by the police officers .
They proceeded to shock him with a Taser gun , pull him out of the auditorium , and arrest him .
The police attack , captured in numerous video recordings , prompted gasps , shouts and protestations from the audience .
In contrast , Kerry was utterly indifferent .
As Meyer lay on the floor crying out for help , Kerry quipped , “ After they take him out of here I ’ll answer his question .
Unfortunately , he ’s not available to come up here and swear me in as president . ”
Outside the auditorium , the campus police told Meyer he was under arrest for “ inciting a riot . ”
He was taken to Alachua County jail and booked on charges of resisting arrest with violence , a felony , disturbing the peace and interfering with school administrative functions , a misdemeanor .
The charges carry up to five years in prison .
This Gestapo - like assault on a student who was simply exercising his right of free speech and in no way threatening the senator or disrupting the meeting is symptomatic of an effort to create a climate of fear , intimidation and repression on college campuses around the country .
In recent months , a number of professors have been fired or forced to resign after campaigns by right - wing organizations .
Norman Finkelstein , a highly respected scholar and critic of Zionism , was denied tenure at DePaul University because of his views .
University of Colorado professor Ward Churchill was fired in July on the specious grounds that his dissident interpretations of US history constituted historical falsification .
The University of California at Irvine last week rescinded a deanship offer to prominent law professor and critic of the Bush administration Erwin Chemerinsky , before reinstating the offer after a public uproar .
These are only the most prominent episodes of a more general campaign .
Organizations such as CampusWatch are witch - hunting academics who hold left - wing views and are critical of the militarist and anti-democratic policies of the government .
They are doing so under conditions where growing sections of students and youth are moving into opposition to the entire political establishment .
The questions raised by Meyer reflect the sentiments of broad sections of the population .
His arrest provoked a protest of several hundred students at the University of Florida on Tuesday .
Every student should ask himself or herself :
If this is how the authorities react to one student asking questions at a public forum , what will be the reaction to the development of mass protests ?
The treatment of Meyer is a warning to students all across the country .
Behind the attack on democratic rights lies the growing social polarization in America — a country where students are forced to take on huge debts , record numbers of working families are thrown out of their homes , and millions are driven into poverty as a result of corporate downsizing , while hedge fund managers rake in billions of dollars a year .
The indifference of Kerry to the treatment of Meyer reflects the real attitude of the politicians of both parties — many of them millionaires like Kerry — to the people .
As opposition to the war in Iraq and future wars escalates , combined with social anger over growing inequality and economic insecurity , the response of the political establishment will be repression .
The apparatus has already been set up , with the support of both parties , in the vast expansion of domestic spying and the buildup of the police powers of the government .
The ISSE demands that all charges be dropped against Andrew Meyer .
We further call for a criminal investigation into the conduct of the University of Florida police .
This is not the first incident involving the use of a Taser gun against an unarmed student .
In November 2006 , University of California Los Angeles ( UCLA ) police used a Taser gun against an unarmed student as he was leaving the library .
The ISSE , the student organization of the Socialist Equality Party , has launched a campaign to build chapters all across the country .
We are fighting for the development of an international movement against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the growing threat of war against Iran that is based on a break with the Democratic Party and all of the parties of the corporate ruling elite .
We say that these wars cannot be ended by appeals to Congress or the Democratic Party .
They can be ended only through the independent mobilization of working people , students and youth in a struggle against the capitalist system that is the root cause of war .
We call on students at the University of Florida and around the world to build the International Students for Social Equality and join the fight for international socialism .
Videos of the incident are in wide circulation on the Internet .

Everyone knows rock and roll is about thrills and excess — we just did n't realize that spirit was supposed to extend to the greenroom buffet .
The following are seven very pampered acts that made sure their laundry list of demands got tacked onto their contracts .
1. Van Halen and the Whole M&M's Thing
Van Halen first gained notoriety for their stipulation that , at every gig , their dressing room was to contain a large bowl of M&M's , but with all the brown ones removed .
And while this has often been cited as proof of the band members ' towering egos , it was actually included by tour promoters as an easy way of seeing if the concert venues had read the contract thoroughly ( particularly the parts about technical requirements ) .
But sneaky M&M tactics aside , Van Halen 's riders are also notorious for the sheer volume of alcohol they stipulate .
One rider specified that their dressing room was to contain a case of beer , a pint of Jack Daniel 's , a pint of Absolut , a 750 ml bottle of Bacardi AÃ±ejo rum , three bottles of wine , small bottles of Cointreau and Grand Marnier , and a 750 ml bottle of one of five specific premium tequilas .
Do n't forget six limes , margarita salt , shot glasses , ingredients for Bloody Marys , and a blender .
Sure , there are only four dudes in the band , but should n't you expect this sort of behavior from a group whose bassist plays a guitar shaped like a bottle of Jack ?
2. J - Lo's Trailer from the Park
There are divas , there are superdivas , and then there 's Jennifer Lopez .
That 's right , the same sultry soulstress who preaches the " keep it real "  street mantra also happens to require a trailer at least 40 feet in length , in which everything is white .
That means drapes , couches , candles , tablecloths , lilies , and roses ( she also requires yellow roses with red trim thrown in as well ) .
And if you 're hoping to keep a prolonged smile on " Jenny from the Block 's "  pretty mug , you can't forget the selection of current CDs she requires , chosen from a list of 43 artists , or her three favorite scented candles from Diptyque — Tuberose , Figuier , and Heliotrope .
And that 's just from her contract for a charity song benefiting AIDS victims in Africa !
Oh , and did we mention Jenny was only at the event for a total of 90 minutes ?
It 's almost as if her ego's as big as her . . . nope , too easy .
3. Guns N' ( Long - Stemmed ) Roses
Cher 's wig room , Weird Al 's weird water demand and the star who needs 24 - pieces of chicken and a pack of condoms before every show , all after the break .
They were one of the biggest bands of the 1980s and '90s .
Just ask them .
And in a band of big egos , the very biggest was lead singer Axl Rose .
He had his own dressing room , stocked with plenty of the things a vocal professional needs : hot water and honey ( Sue Bee brand only ) ; a rib - eye steak dinner ; a large pepperoni pizza ; a deli tray with a heavy emphasis on lean roast beef , ham , and turkey ; and a bottle of Dom Perignon .
His bandmates had much simpler tastes .
Their dressing room was to contain lots of chips , nuts , exotic fruits , and cheese .
Of course , they went a little less simple on the drinks .
Aside from a few cases of soda , the band also required four cases of beer , two fifths of Jack Daniel 's , two fifths of Stolichnaya vodka , two bottles of Chardonnay , and a bottle of JÃ¤germeister .
Oh , and do n't forget to throw in a couple bottles of . . . carrot juice ?
Clearly , it 's the cornerstone behind every successful rock act .
As are the four cartons of cigarettes and the assortment of adult magazines you 'll need to provide .
4. Meat Loaf ( Just a Little Overdone )
Yes , that Meat Loaf .
The man who brought us Bat Out of Hell obviously requires quite a bit in return .
His rider states that the promoters are to recognize that they are dealing with an international " superstar "  and therefore all provisions must be first class , as befits a " superstar . " 
And that 's two words : Meat .
Loaf .
Sheesh !
His dressing room spread must include , among many other things , a loaf of 100 % multigrain bread ( preferably Vogel 's Flaxseed & Soy ) , two bags of potato chips , a package of low - fat chicken or turkey wieners , four Gala apples ( specifically , hard and crunchy ones ) , four low - fat fresh - baked muffins from a bakery , steamed broccoli and green beans amandine ( not too soggy ) , a sliced roast pork tenderloin , a sliced roast beef tenderloin , and two baked potatoes .
And this is supposed to feed two people .
We 're guessing they 're both for the Loaf .
5. Poison's Poison
Pretty standard for a rock band , really .
Deli trays , condiments , lots of booze , etc .
But what
was Poison 's poison ?
Apparently , pyrotechnics .
Their contract also required that all the venue 's smoke and fire detectors be switched off due to the band 's flair for flares .
So how do we think the concertgoers would feel knowing that little tidbit ?
Also very odd , Poison 's rider stipulates that an American Sign Language interpreter must be made available on request for the band 's deaf fans .
And the band will need 24 hours ' notice if the ASL interpreter needs the lyrics beforehand .
Of course , some critics claim that most of the band 's fan base was deaf ( records sold being proof ) .
6 . The Village People 's Payment Plan
You might think that a bunch of guys as past their prime as The Village People would just be glad to get a gig .
Nope .
They still draw a crowd , so therefore they still have demands in their rider .
The front page of their rider contains one stipulation : that all balances to The Village People be paid in " CASH "  ( yes , it 's in all caps ) .
It goes on to say that they can only be photographed in costume , that they wo n't fly in prop planes , and that they prefer certain seats in the plane ( as specific as " aisle , rear right side of plane "  for the Navy guy ) and certain airports of origin .
Disco may be dead , but ego certainly seems to be staying alive .
7. Various Spoiled Artists
Oh , there are just so many .
Celine Dion requires a children 's choir with 20 to 24 children of all races .
Pavarotti used to demand that there be no noise backstage or distinct smells anywhere near him ; but he did want a golf cart .
Cher can't perform without a wig room , cable TV that gets Turner Classic Movies , and a room for her massage therapist .
" Weird Al "  Yankovic is a strict vegan and forbids Dasani water .
Elton John demands that his dressing room be kept at 60 Â° in summer and 70 Â° in winter .
And Busta Rhymes insists that there be no pork or beef anywhere near his dressing room ; but he does want a 24 - piece bucket of KFC and a box of Rough Riders condoms ( ribbed ) .

Falwell follower arrested with bombs .
Update :
Lynchburg News and Advocate
The Age
One of Jerry Falwell 's followers , a student at Falwell 's Liberty University , has been arrested .
Mark Uhl , 19 , was apprehended with six explosive devices .
Police say he told his family he had made the bombs and that he planned to attend Falwell 's funeral .
But the police insist that the funeral was not a target for disruption by Uhl .
The police also say there are indications that others were involved with Uhl in the bomb making and investigations continue .
ABC
News reports that the targets for the bombs were anti-Falwell protesters .
ABC says
Uhl " reportedly told authorities that he was making the bombs to stop protesters from disrupting the funeral service . "
Three other suspects are currently being sought by police .
Jerry Falwell was n't a big fan of free speech either .
And the Right tries to tell us that American Fundamentalists do n't use bombs !
Uhl is n't the first either .
I have to wonder if Alberto Gonzales is going to recommend that Bush authorize the use of torture on Uhl in order to secure more information about the bomb plot .
I suspected as much and news accounts now confirm that the protesters who would have been the object of Uhl 's bombs were the cult members from the odious Westboro Baptist Church -- a truly sad lot of people .
It is also revealed that Uhl and the three other suspects who are being sought were all together in an ROTC program ( Reserved Office Training Corps ) which the military sets up in schools to recruit kids into the military .
One of the suspects is currently in the military .
Uhl was also a member of the ROTC program at Falwell 's school and was planning to become a military chaplain .
The military has been a prime target of fundamentalists in recent years causing numerous problems .
The Air Force Academy had a major investigation because fundamentalists had apparently taken over and used their positions there inappropriately to recruit people into their churches .
At a VA Hospital another fundamentalist chaplain is lying low after a Jewish soldier complained of constant harassment .
The orthodox Jew was also denied kosher food and staff refused to call his rabbi for him to bring kosher food privately .
What is shocking is how many on line news stories have headlines implying that there was a bomb plot against the funeral of Falwell .
This is false .
Actually it is dishonest .
AOL News says : " Bomb Plot Thwarted at Falwell 's Funeral " ; says : " Arrest made in Falwell funeral threat .
Australia : " Falwell funeral bomb plot " .
True , the articles do mention the bomber was a student from Falwell 's own school but many people never read past headlines .

Wall Street losses prompted a broad sell - off in Asian markets
The UK's FTSE 100 index ended 1.1 % lower at 6,459 while Germany 's Dax lost 1.2 % , and France 's Cac shed 1.4 % .
However on Wall Street , shares reversed earlier losses to close ahead - clawing back a little of Friday 's heavy falls .
Investors fear that uncertainty over the level of some companies ' exposure to credit woes is denting the US economy and firms ' profits .
There are also concerns that that the full effects of the US housing slowdown have not yet been seen , analysts say .
Caterpillar warning
The Dow Jones , the main US share index , fell 367 points on Friday , the 20th anniversary of the Black Monday stock market crash .
But it ended 45 points , 0.3 % ahead , at 13,567 while the tech - heavy Nasdaq index closed was 1.1 % ahead .
Earlier , Tokyo's Nikkei index closed 2.2 % lower as markets across Asia suffered fresh jitters .
Our economy is slowing down , and I do n't think we 're going to be able to make it all up in profits overseas
Victor Pugliese , a trader with First Albany
Q&A : What 's troubling the markets ?
Last Friday 's slump started when the building equipment firm Caterpillar cut its profit forecast , blaming the state of the economy .
Caterpillar added that the US economy would be " near to , or even in , recession " next year .
' Sentiment driven '
" Our economy is slowing down , and I do n't think we 're going to be able to make it all up ( in profits ) overseas .
So I think we have a little bit more downside , " said Victor Pugliese , a trader with First Albany in San Francisco .
" You would think you 'd have some follow - through from Friday , and that we still have a way to go down . "
On Black Monday in 1987 , the Dow Jones fell 23 % , which nowadays would mean a drop of more than 3,000 points .
The fall on the FTSE 100 comes after it had recovered from the panic that gripped markets in August in the wake of the global credit squeeze .
Last month the US Federal Reserve slashed interest rates from 5.25 % to 4.75 % , making borrowing cheaper , in a bid to encourage more consumer spending and corporate activity .
And some believe that policy makers will reduce rates again when they meet next week .
“ Zero Tolerance ” Rules and Laws Require Severe Punishment Not Only for Possessing Drugs or Guns , but Also Any Item Which “ Looks Like ” a Prohibited Item .
Is This Tiny Toy a “ Weapon ” ?
When I write True each week , there are sometimes patterns to the stories .
There are certain recurring themes : Darwinism ( in both the “ survival ” and “ social ” senses ) , stupid criminals , and — sadly — “ Zero Tolerance ” stories .
Mostly I ’m amused by the foibles of teeming humanity .
But the “ ZT ” stories tend to make me mad , and I ’ve been talking about them here and there in the author ’s note in the online edition of This is True for many years .
Here are three early stories , to give you the idea — the first , by far not the first in the series , is one I thought was the most outrageous possible .
As you ’ll see below , it ’s nowhere near the worst .
Candy , Little Boy ?
( November 1997 ) A Colorado Springs , Colo. , school district says it did the right thing when it suspended 6 - year - old Seamus Morris under the school ’s zero - tolerance drug policy .
The drug ?
Lemon drops .
Taylor Elementary School administrators called an ambulance after a teacher saw the boy give another student some candy , which was a brand teachers did n’t recognize .
“ It was not something you would purchase in a grocery store , ” a district spokesman said .
“ It was from a health - food store . ” A spokesman for St. Claire ’s Lemon Tarts , however , noted that the candy is indeed sold in Colorado ’s largest grocery store chain .
School officials were not impressed , and not only upheld the half - day suspension , but told the boy ’s mother that a child who brings candy to school is comparable to a teen who takes a gun to school .
( UPI ) … Maybe it ’s time for a “ zero - tolerance policy ” toward idiotic school administrators .
Rocket Scientist ( March 1999 ) David Silverstein , 13 , was inspired to build a model rocket after seeing the movie “ October Sky ” , a biography of NASA rocket scientist Homer Hickam .
The boy took his rocket , made out of a potato chip canister and fueled with three match heads , to his Glendale , Ariz . , school , where it was found in a search of his locker .
School officials classified the toy as a “ weapon ” and suspended him for the rest of the year based on its “ zero - tolerance ” weapons policy .
The police were also called , and the case is being referred to juvenile authorities .
( Arizona Republic ) … How the U.S. lost its leadership in technological innovation — one in a long series .
Bang - Bang ,
You ’re Brain - Dead ( April 1999 ) Administrators saw three students at the Union Colony Charter School in Greeley , Colo. , playing with a water gun .
According to the school ’s interpretation of the state ’s “ zero tolerance ” weapons law — which mandates suspension of students who “ carry , bring , use or possess a firearm or firearm facsimile at school ” — the unnamed boys have been suspended .
According to standard practice in “ weapons ” cases , the boys must now face expulsion hearings .
( UPI ) … Zero Tolerance : the politically correct term for zero thought , zero common sense .
A Few Readers Didn’t Understand the Story
The story was not “ about ” water guns .
It was “ about ” the “ Zero - Tolerance ” trend in schools .
There are obviously problems in schools from such things as drugs and violence .
But terrorizing children with inflexible rules is not the answer .
School principals have always had the responsibility to make and enforce rules , and punish accordingly when those rules are broken .
“ Zero - Tolerance ” laws take that responsibility away .
They mandate certain responses that can be way out of proportion to the rule violation in question .
That is what these stories are “ about . ”
This is True has reported on a fair number of these knee - jerk reactions to non-events .
Children are put into the position of being treated as felons by being suspended and / or expelled over obvious toys — the very same thing that would happen if they brought real guns to school .
Unthinking Overreaction
What happened to the punishment fitting the “ crime ” ?
What happened to justice ?
What happened to the education of these children ?
All of that is being ignored in the name of “ Zero - Tolerance ” .
Sure , in many cases the kids broke a rule , and those rules have a purpose ( e.g. , to avoid tragic shootings by police who think the guns are real ) .
Most cases call for , at most , a stern talk in the principal ’s office — not suspension , expulsion , police involvement or press conferences .
It seems to me that if we feel a need to expel kids over water guns , there must not be many real problems our society needs to deal with .
Not All of the Reader Mail , However , was Supportive .
That ’s fine : I never mind honest , thoughtful , disagreement with things I say .
But one woman kept coming back again and again , arguing “ What if those squirt guns were loaded with bleach ?
Would you let them go ?
What about a rapist that is impotent ?
Would you let him go ? ”
Huh ?
And she was serious !
She thought she was debating real points !
And , in case she ’s reading this , I ’ll say it again : I ’m not arguing that everyone should be set free ; I said punishments should fit crimes .
Real crimes call for real punishment .
Non-crimes do not call for real punishment !
Pretty simple concept ?
Apparently not .
And Then Came Columbine
Because then came the shooting spree by two students at Columbine High School in Littleton , Colorado , and several people who really missed the point got pretty high and mighty and yelled “ See ? ! ” at me .
For instance :
“ If one of your children ( or nieces or nephews or grandchildren ) were one of the many killed in the recent Colorado shooting , would you be such a cavalier critic of the Zero Tolerance ‘ trend ’ ? ”
– Diane , somewhere in The South
Absolutely Yes , though my position is not “ cavalier ” but rather well thought out , which is why one event , as bad as it was , does n’t change my mind .
And remember : I live in Colorado .
Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died in wars to protect our freedoms .
I have no interest in trading them away for the false security these silly rules provide .
Colorado is one of the leading states in “ Zero Tolerance ” — about half of the early stories about it in True are in fact based in Colorado !
Yet that sure did n’t help the kids in Littleton , did it ?
It Does n’t Address the Actual Problem
As if I have n’t said this enough already , such rules do little to solve the real problems of drugs and violence in the schools , and in fact may make it worse .
Lee , a reader in Texas , knows that such rules do get out of hand :
In Garland , Texas , about a year or so ago , a boy was suspended from school under a similar ‘ zero tolerance ’ policy — for forming his hand in the shape of a pistol .
The Gestapo , er uh , police said that he was ‘ engaging in terrorist activity . ’
This incident did n’t make the papers , but it ’s no less ludicrous than your [ recent ] story .
And the kid is going to be able to get a job as an adult with a police record that says that … how ?
“ Zero Tolerance ” means little more than “ Zero Thought , ” and means “ Zero Discretion ” is given to the teachers and principals who we hired to educate our kids .
Let me illustrate with two more stories so we do n’t get too bogged down in the emotions of the Colorado shooting ; I have a real point to all of this .
Candy , Little Boy ?
II ( November 1997 — the next story after “ Candy , Little Boy ? ” above ) A 10 - year - old girl at McElwain Elementary in Thornton , Colo. , was one of a group of girls who “ repeatedly ” asked a certain boy on the playground if he liked them .
The boy complained to a teacher , so school administrators , citing the district ’s “ zero - tolerance sexual harassment policy ” , decided to suspend her .
After an outcry from outraged parents , the school changed its mind .
A district spokeswoman said school officials “ probably ” overreacted , but “ it ’s all in how you look at it . ” ( UPI ) … Same apple , different worms .
Blimey ( January , 1998 ) An 11 - year - old British schoolboy met an Australian classmate and greeted him by saying , “ G’day , sport . ”
The boy , who was not named , was “ caught ” by a teacher , the school said in a statement , and while “ there was no maliciousness or intent ” on the boy ’s part , he was charged with racism for his greeting .
“ The boy was counseled , … dialogue has taken place with parents , ” and the boy was made to write “ I must not use racist remarks ” 60 times , said the statement by Beverley Grammar School in Yorkshire .
Tony Brett Young of the Australian High Commission was concerned it was a case of political correctness gone overboard .
“ ‘ G’day sport ’ is part of our vernacular , ” he said .
“ It ’s just a traditional and friendly manner of speaking . ” ( Reuters ) … Tony , you must remember that the self - appointed paternalistic PC snobs do n’t care what you think as they ’re more “ culturally sensitive ” of your nationality than you .
Now , the several issues these stories hint of are serious .
Sexual harassment nearly brought down the President of the United States .
It ’s a terribly unfair power issue , and where is there a greater power difference between the president and a lowly , unpaid White House intern ?
Drugs interrupt or end thousands of lives every day , not just among the people that choose to use them and ca n’t manage to do it in reasonable moderation .
People die in car crashes , drug users thrust their families into poverty , and the cost of their habits drive them to crime .
And racism is surely a disgusting remnant of less enlightened eras .
But What Are the Stories Above ?
The little girl was n’t sexually harassing a little boy , she was being a little girl , trying to learn how to deal with the opposite sex — a trial - and - error process ( do n’t you remember ? ) where the errors should n’t be treated as a felony .
The six - year - old boy was n’t using or selling drugs , he was sharing candy .
Sharing candy !
And the British lad was n’t making light of a fellow white boy ’s ancestry , he was trying to greet a potential friend in a way that was familiar to him .
Calling every botched encounter between genders “ sexual harassment ” tells true victims of that crime that their experience was similar to a schoolyard crush .
Calling sharing “ drug use ” tells children that there ’s no difference between giving a friend a lemon drop and selling him heroin cut with rat poison .
And calling the use of vernacular “ racism ” demeans people that suffer from horrible crimes : the denial of their ability to live and make a living based solely on their race .
And it tells the people that are not involved in these issues that really , these things are just trivial things , nothing to worry about .
This racism stuff is not a problem , drugs are n’t a scourge , and sexual harassment is just consenting adults with unequal paychecks .
Are these the lessons legislators intend when they pass zero - tolerance laws — and when bureaucrats enforce them ?
Because that ’s what the kids are learning .
And , worse , the ZT trend gives a false sense of security .
People want to know that things like school shootings can be stopped .
But Colorado is at the forefront of the ZT movement !
Here , ZT is n’t a rule , it ’s the law .
Did that help the students in Littleton ?
Of course not .
Passing an inflexible law does not stop murder — which is already quite illegal .
Terrorizing a little kid for sharing candy — and justifying it afterward when an outraged parent complains — does n’t stop drug use .
And it never will .
As far as I can tell , Zero Tolerance has only negative effects .
It must be stopped : it ’s nothing more than institutionalized Zero Intelligence .
Update : ZT is spreading to the “ real world ” !
If you think ZT is only an issue of concern to schoolchildren , think again !

とか言ってたけどその前に、 僕は Firebug だけじゃなくて、 だいたいの 拡張機能 で、簡単 に 「 チョコチョコいじれる化」というのをしてるのでそれを書いてみます。
jar ファイルを解凍しておいてすぐ書き換えられるようにしとくこと。
「 チョコチョコいじれる化」しとくと気付いたときにちょっと
JS や XML や CSS を追加するだけで、いろいろ改造できて楽しい。 「 でも、 Firefox が壊れる可能性があるじゃん＞＜」って？ チッチッチ、ナンセンスだよメーン そんなの 拡張機能 の ディレクト リを削除しちゃえば元通り さ
ということで、 「 チョコいじ化」手順
1. Firefox のプロファイルディレクトリに行く 環境 プロファイルディレクトリ WinVista C: \Users\[ユーザ名 ] \AppData\Roaming \Mozilla \Firefox \Profiles \ [ ランダムな文字 ]. default\
WinXP C: \Documents and Settings \[ ユーザ名 ] \Application Data\Mozilla \Firefox \Profiles \ [ ランダムな文字 ]. default \ Mac ~/ Library / Application Support / Firefox / Profiles / [ ランダムな文字 ] . default / Unix系 ~/.mozilla/firefox/[ランダムな文字 ].
default /
2. 拡張機能の入ってるディレクトリにいく extensions ディレクトリに拡張機能が入っていますので、そこに移動してください。
そのディレクトリ内に入ってる一個一個のディレクトリが拡張機能です。
もし、この時点でガクブルな人はこのディレクトリの一個を消してみましょう。
そうして Firefox を再起動すると拡張機能が一個消えてると思います。
拡張機能なんてただそれだけのことなんです＞＜
3. いじりたい拡張機能のディレクトリを探す 大抵、拡張機能のディレクトリ直下に install.rdf というファイルがあるので、それを開いてみると拡張機能の名前が書いてあります。
4. 拡張機能ディレクトリの chrome ディレクトリを開く 拡張機能ディレクトリ内に chrome というディレクトリがあるので開きます 。
ディレクトリの中に jar ファイルがなくて JS とかが入っている場合は 、
その拡張機能は 「チョコいじ化」出来てるので、すぐに改造できます。
試しに、そこに置いてある JS に alert ( ' hoge ' ) とか追記してみましょう 。
まあ、大抵の場合は jar ファイルが一個だけ置いてあったりします 。
5. jar ファイルをその場に zip で解凍します。 すると chrome / hoge . jar がこうなると思います。 chrome / hoge . jar chrome / content /.. chrome / content /.. chrome / content /.. chrome / skin /.. chrome / skin /.. まあ、拡張機能によって違いますが、、、
6. 次に chrome .
manifest をいじる 次に、chrome ディレクトリから一個上に移動して chrome .
manifest を開きます。
そうすると content hoge jar : chrome /hoge.jar!/ content/ skin hoge jar : chrome/hoge.jar!/skin/ となっていて、 hoge.jar の中を見るようになっています。
ですので、こんな感じで書き換えちゃ行ってください。 content hoge chrome / content / skin hoge chrome / skin / そうすると、解凍されたほうを見に行くようになります。
7. はい、完成 これで、 拡張機能内の JS とかを書き換えられまくります ！
これなんてフリーダム！
ウホ！いい感じ ！
動かなくなったら chrome.manifest を元に戻せばいいんです＞＜
As most of my Destructoid compatriots know , I await RPGs with intriguing storylines more than any other type of game .
I enjoy nothing more than to sink myself into a rich plot , get to know the characters , and most of all , experience some form of emotional fulfillment at the end of the story for the work I 've put into playing it .
To my surprise , the last few I have looked forward to I 've gotten fifty to sixty hours into and then simply never picked up again .
Why this sudden transformation from game committment to total disinterest ?
Hit the jump to spiral deeper within my addled psyche .
I clearly remember finishing a lot of the games I played for the NES , and I can't blame it on scarcity of product .
Between friends that generously shared large cartridge collections and the game rental store down the street ( Performance Hobby !
I salute you ) , I played hundreds of games released for the system during its lifespan .
Since I started playing often when I was about ten or so , I know I had the free time to complete them , but it seems to me something more was at work as to why I finished those games .
In the case of the games I was most driven to complete , I was so absorbed in them that I thought about them even when I was n't playing them .
Other new releases did n't get in the way because I was n't interested in them until I completed the one I was playing .
Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy X were great examples .
I held them akin to reading a great book - by reading other books at the same time , you distilled the purity of the experience of the story .
In the current state of gaming , releases come out so frequently that we constantly have new " stories " to choose from .
The biggest catalyst of " Endgame Syndrome " is definitely this factor .
Since production values and budgets have risen to new heights , most games are gorgeous to look at .
Some argue that one must wade in a sea of pretty games to try to find the ones that are worthwhile , so consumers are constantly sifting through large amounts of content and do n't have the patience to spend on completing a game .
Another major factor seems to be length .
BioShock was completely engaging , yet presented the story in a shorter timeframe .
The more time you have in which to tell a story , the more challenges one faces to keep a gamer engaged .
Considering the average attention span is twenty minutes , it 's no small feat to create a game that can remain interesting to a player after 40 hours of play .
Structural variance is also a key --
If you 're doing more or less the same actions for the majority of the game , are they fun to do ?
Most difficult of all is the experience of playing an enjoyable game and then abandoning it after committing many hours to the storyline .
Eternal Sonata , I 'm sad to say , fell into this category .
I was pleased with the story , but I did n't think about it when it was n't in front of me .
It leaves you feeling disappointed when Endgame Syndrome kicks in in these instances .
I did want to see the ending , but the drive to do so just evaporated , leaving me as confused as waking up naked with an otter .
( I need to stop drinking at those Zoo - To - Do events . )
Is it that games are n't what they used to be , or is it that gamer attention spans have shortened over time ?
I fear that some of both are present , although I am always hoping to be pleasantly surprised .
The shape of the industry that creates these games has dramatically changed .
In 1985 , few people would have dreamed that games would one day rival the film industry .
As a result , more experimental projects may have turned into playable results , which at the very least promoted creativity .
Whatever the secret formula is , recent feedback proves even RPG giant Square - Enix can't always hit the nail on the head anymore .
Avoiding Endgame Syndrome is simply a matter of being choosy about what titles you take home -- and even then , there 's no ensuring you 'll feel the spark .
For me , those unforgettable stories that are worth finishing are worth the search , no matter how many duds I have to sort through to get there .
[ Thank you , Dtoid team ! ]

Da Vinci changed his mind about the position of two fingers on her left hand , her face was originally wider and her smile more expressive , he added .
Mr Cotte exhibited his findings at the Metreon complex in San Francisco .
He said he spent 3,000 hours analysing data from scans he made of the painting in the Louvre 's laboratory three years ago .
Mr Cotte , a French engineer , used infrared and ultraviolet sensors during the process .
His 22 - gigabyte digital photo was made using 13 different colour filters rather than the three or four found in standard digital cameras .

The scan showed that the merchant 's wife in the painting holds a blanket that has all but faded from view today , he said .
Mr Cotte also said his analysis revealed what he believed were the painting 's original colours - light blues and whites , compared with its current heavy greens , yellows and browns .
" To communicate our cultural heritage to our kids , we need to provide the maximum of information , " Mr Cotte said .
" With just one photo you go deeper into the construction of the painting and understand that Leonardo was a genius . "
Mr Cotte has made high - resolution scans of more than 500 paintings , including works by Van Gogh , Brueghel , Courbet and other European masters .
Microsoft plans to release the first beta of the next version of Internet Explorer in the first half of 2008 , and said that IE 8 has passed a key Web standards test that ensures the browser wo n’t “ break ” the Web.
IE8 has passed the “ Acid2 Browser Test ” from the Web Standards Project , which shows whether a browser renders a Web site in a certain way .
If the browser renders the site correctly , it means the browser supports certain accepted Web standards .
Microsoft developed IE before some Web standards such as CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets ) and RSS ( Really Simple Syndication ) were developed , and so older versions do n’t support some current standards .
With the release and subsequent popularity of open - source browser Mozilla Firefox three years ago , a browser ’s need to stay current with Web standards once again moved to the forefront .
When Microsoft developed IE7 , released in October 2006 , the company had good intentions and decided to improved support of Web standards with the new release .
However , Web sites that were created for older versions of IE did n’t work properly on IE7 .
Microsoft hopes to remedy this problem so the situation is not repeated with IE8 , according to an IE Blog posting attributed to Dean Hachamovitch , a Microsoft general manager on the IE team .
“ With respect to standards and interoperability , our goal in developing Internet Explorer 8 is to support the right set of standards with excellent implementations and do so without breaking the existing Web , ” according to the blog posting .
Microsoft said the final release of IE8 depends upon feedback received from the beta process .

It ’s surprisingly disappointing just how little progress we ’ve made on certain basic questions about torture .
Senior judges from North America and Europe were in the midst of a panel discussion about torture and terrorism law , when a Canadian judge ’s passing remark - “ Thankfully , security agencies in all our countries do not subscribe to the mantra ‘ What would Jack Bauer do ? ’ ” - got the legal bulldog in [ Justice Antonin Scalia ] barking .
The conservative jurist stuck up for Agent Bauer , arguing that fictional or not , federal agents require latitude in times of great crisis .
“ Jack Bauer saved Los Angeles . …
He saved hundreds of thousands of lives , ” Judge Scalia said .
Then , recalling Season 2 , where the agent ’s rough interrogation tactics saved California from a terrorist nuke , the Supreme Court judge etched a line in the sand .
“ Are you going to convict Jack Bauer ? ” Judge Scalia challenged his fellow judges .
“ Say that criminal law is against him ?
‘ You have the right to a jury trial ? ’
Is any jury going to convict Jack Bauer ?
I do n’t think so . "
It ’s likely that Scalia was using a cultural reference to prove a broader point about torture and the rule of law , but I ’m not entirely sure what that point is .
It seems to have something to do with Scalia ’s apparent belief that those U.S. officials who commit torture deserve legal amnesty , just so long as the ends justify the means .
He could n't be more wrong .
Update : The CBC has a segment up on it with Avi Lewis ...
The CNN / YouTube debates add a new dimension to political infotainment .
Edwin Fotheringham
In the early moments of the CNN / YouTube Republican debate on November 28th — the follow - up to the CNN / YouTube Democratic debate last July — the often useful phrase “ the minutes seemed like hours ” suddenly felt inadequate .
The phrase lacked an essential active component , some indication that the universe had been violently disrupted and damage had been done .
Ever since I watched the musical video that was used to introduce the Presidential candidates , in which a bearded , baseball - cap - wearing fellow named Chris , from the state of Washington , sang a countryish song that provided thumbnail sketches of the men ( “ Ron Paul would end the F.D.A. , and that is just a start .
Fred has just begun to run but sure does look the part .
Hunter tells us what to do in foreign - policy debates .
Huckabee ’s compassionate and lost a lot of weight .
. . . ” ) , I ’ve been wondering , Can a minute last longer than sixty seconds ?
Can a minute , as it is elapsing , reach larcenously into the future and grab more than its designated sixty ticks , and thereby steal time from your personal allotment ?
Can time stand still and devour itself at the same time ?
Yes — in the ninety seconds that it took for Chris to sing his witless rhymes , I became a grandmother , and I do n’t even have children .
I was on the verge of becoming a great - grandmother by the time the song was finally over and Anderson Cooper , the debate ’s moderator , said , “ Enough of the singing , enough of the snowman .
Let ’s begin the debate . ”
The snowman , it should be said — a talking model snowman that appeared in a montage of videos that were rejected from among the more than five thousand submissions — almost prevented the debate from happening .
( For the YouTube debates , questions were generated not by the moderator or the live studio audience but by people all over the country who submitted them in short video form . )
The iceman first cameth in a video in the Democratic debate , when , speaking in a high voice that called up the old “ Mr. Bill ” shorts of “ Saturday Night Live , ” he asked a question about global warming .
It was humorous — not exactly funny , but humorous — and effective , but Mitt Romney thought the whole thing demeaning and used it as an excuse to bow out of the planned Republican debate ; eventually , he came around .
This time , the snowman ’s appearance was , of course , a joke on Romney , and Romney , to show that he could chillax and laugh at himself , made sure to smile — or to force his facial muscles to contract in such a way that viewers would perceive the result as a smile — when the little guy appeared on the screen .
The YouTube debates were a new thing this year , but they are n’t revolutionary .
Candidates are used to taking questions from “ regular people ” ; what must have been a little odd , though , was watching someone on a huge video monitor ( Circuit City , $ 12,000,000,000.00 ) ask a question from his living room and then disappear .
Where were the candidates supposed to look while responding ?
At the audience ?
At the moderator ?
And many of the videos , as YouTube videos usually are , were of poor quality , with the sound and the image out of synch .
CNN would have you think that these were “ the people ’s debates , ” but , with so many videos to choose from , the network actually had more control over the direction of the event than the usual format affords — though no control , evidently , over whether the questioners dressed for the occasion or straightened up their rooms .
These Q. & A.s — they ca n’t really be called debates — are mostly just a chance for the candidates to reënact their schoolyard days with taunts about their rivals ’ past policies or statements : “ You did this ” ; “ No , I did n’t ” ; “ Yes , you did ” ; “ Did not ” ; “ Did so . ”
The best example of this in the November debate came with the very first question , and it was something to see .
Ernie from Brooklyn addressed his question to Rudy Giuliani , asking him whether he would “ continue to aid and abet the flight of illegal aliens into this country . ”
This led to a back - and - forth in which Giuliani and Romney talked not to but over each other .
Giuliani is now richer and better - looking than he was when he was the mayor of New York , his comb - over having been replaced by a more distinguished combed - back look , complete with Paulie Walnuts - style Nike swooshes of white hair on the sides .
Romney , for his part , is freakishly , unreally handsome , though handsome is as handsome does , and the exchange did n’t exactly bring out any Presidential qualities in the pair .
( What it did bring out , the following week , was the truth of Gotcha Giuliani ’s accusation , when , smiling his mean smile , he said , “ You did .
You did .
You did have illegal immigrants working at your mansion , did n’t you ? ”
It came to light that Romney , unknowingly , still did .
Of course , it would be hard for Romney to know everything that ’s going on at his house : it ’s the size of Rhode Island . )
CNN must have been delighted .
Anyone who caught this unpleasant , crackling exchange , just minutes into the proceedings , would surely have stayed to watch the entire two - hour spectacle .
Nothing else matched this squabble , however — certainly not the candidates ’ own thirty - second promotional videos , created for the occasion .
Tom Tancredo ’s video featured the risible boast “ He took on Geraldo .
Now he ’s ready to take on Hillary . ”
( This is as good a place as any for me to ask , Could we please turn back the clock about twenty years and revert to calling people in public life by their last names ?
We ’d all feel , and possibly act , more grown - up . )
Some questions were posed in ways that were far more dramatic than would be acceptable in a live setting .
There was a man from California who did n’t do much to bring the country ’s gun lovers and gun-control advocates together when he asked the candidates to state their opinions on the subject .
A clear enthusiast ( “ I ’m from a small town , and , as in any small town , we like our big guns ” ) , he held a shotgun , and said , “ Do n’t worry , ” pulled on the forestock to make a lock - and - load noise , and then finished the sentence : “ You can answer however you like . ”
Many people laughed at what they may have taken to be the man ’s guts and cleverness .
It ’s too bad the debate did n’t occur the following week , when the candidates could all have given the appropriate answer to the question with one word : Omaha .
There were no questions about health care ( there were in the Democratic event ) , but not every subject can be covered in two hours , even if there are only three commercial interruptions .
It was , as they say , good TV .
What fun to see the candidates asked by a man from Texas holding up a Bible if they believed literally every word of it .
Giuliani answered first , and Mike Huckabee , in an approximately amusing , snide move , called across the stage to ask him , “ Do I need to help you out , Mayor , on this one ? ” Giuliani , it turned out , needed less help than Romney , who had a more jesuitical response , which did n’t precisely answer the very precise question .
Huckabee , the minister , managed to avoid answering a question concerning what Jesus would do about the death penalty with the Catskillian rejoinder “ Jesus was too smart to ever run for public office , ” and also ungallantly made the suggestion , in his soft , measured voice , that if the space program were to send a manned flight to Mars “ Hillary could be on the first rocket . ”
Mike , you card — you kill me !
One priceless exchange occurred between Romney and John McCain , on the subject of torture .
Romney , of the hard , piercing voice and evasive , crumbly words , refused to say whether he considered waterboarding to be torture , and as he did so the camera , moving close to McCain ’s face , captured his temporomandibular muscles pulsing with frustration and anger .
The CNN / YouTube debates were a great promotional device for YouTube , which does n’t mean that they were a gimmick .
They got good ratings , and it ’s safe to assume that they ’ll be repeated in four years ( unless YouTube has been supplanted by some other , unforeseen means of communication ) .
The debates do help you pick up on whether a candidate has a sense of the big picture , is a good listener , tells something like the truth , or is possibly unbalanced .
They can help you cull certain candidates , though they may not help you figure out which is the one for you .
I ’m not sure that the best candidate is n’t one who became famous on YouTube long before the debates .
He ’s someone who can hold his own on the screen for almost three minutes , and who behaves consistently , thoughtfully , and with resolve : Gizmo , the toilet - flushing cat . ♦

幸せな 「 エンジニア」ライフの理由
かずひこ
2007/12/17
自らのアイデンティティを 「オープンソースプログラマ」と定め、オープンソースと自分の可能性を追いかけるために海を渡って8カ月。現在は非常に幸せな日々を送っているというかずひこ氏。なぜ幸せな仕事ができているのか、これまでを振り返った。
今年の4月にフランスに渡り、Nexediというフランスの会社でオープンソースERP「ERP5」の開発に参加して、早くも8カ月がたちました。日本を発つ前は、どんな未来が待っているのか不安でいっぱいでしたが、いまはフランスでとても幸せなエンジニアライフを送っています。この幸せな状態があまりにも普通となっているので、普段は特に「自分が幸せだ」ということを意識しないのですが、なぜ私は幸せなのか、一度じっくり振り返ってみることにしました。
■ まっすぐオープンソースに向き合える
以前、 「アイデンティティはオープンソースプログラマ」という記事で書いたように、私はオープンソース・プログラマとして生きるべくNexediに転職しました。実際に働き始めると、オープンソース、そしてソフトウェアの自由に対して本当にまっすぐ向き合っている会社だと強く感じました。
例えば、CEOのJean-Paul Smetsは、フランスの官僚から転身してNexediを創業し、「ERP5」を生み出した人ですが、EUにおけるソフトウェア特許反対運動の主要メンバーとして実際に成果を挙げ、しかも世界で初めてオープンソースとビジネスに関する書籍を書きました。
CTO のおくじさんは、ブートローダの「 GNU GRUB 」の開発をはじめ、数多くのオープンソースソフトウェアの開発に長年携わっています。その活動を通じておくじさんと知り合ってNexediにやってきた社員もいます。私もその1人です。
先日入社したばかりの新人に「なぜこの会社を志望したの？」と聞くと、「自由なソフトウェアのために仕事ができるから」との答えが返ってきました。Nexediには、サムソンのオーディオプレーヤーを持っている社員が多いのですが、そのうちの1人に「どうしてサムソンにしたの？」と尋ねると、「
Ogg Vorbisに対応しているから」と即答しました。ちなみに私も同じ理由でサムソンのオーディオプレーヤーを愛用していますし、私の妻はiPodのファームウェアを「RockBox」というオープンソースのものに書き換えてOgg Vorbisで音楽を楽しんでいます（参考記事「 Ogg Vorbisのデータを再生するには」）。
さらには、社員が使うノートパソコンは購入後、ハードディスクの中身をすべてLinuxに書き換えるだけでなく、同梱されているWindowsのCD-ROMはメーカーに返送しています。最近はWindowsがバンドルされていないノートパソコンが少しずつ出てきましたが、早くこういった手間を掛けずに済む日が来ればいいなと思っています。
Nexediにとっては、オープンソースは単に「使って便利なもの」ではなく、会社の中心となるポリシーであり、社員同士で自然に共有している考え方です。そして、ソフトウェアの開発モデルとしてもビジネスモデルとしても、オープンソースはより優れているという考えの下に、ERP5をオープンソースのERPとして作り続けています。
皆さんの中には、日々の仕事はプロプライエタリだけれど、趣味の時間にオープンソースのコミュニティにかかわっているという人もたくさんいるでしょう。でも私は、自分の持てる限りの能力を、すべてオープンソースのために注ぎたいと思っています。このようにまっすぐにオープンソースと向き合える環境で働けるのはとても幸せなことです。
■ いいものを作って届けられる
2つ目の幸せの理由は、仕事そのものが技術的にとても興味深いことです。転職をした理由はいろいろありますが、ERP5に対する技術的な関心も大きな要因です。
ERP は、人やモノやお金など企業におけるさまざまなリソースを一元的に扱うシステムです。そのため、開発においては単に機能を満たすだけではなく、パフォーマンスやスケーラビリティ、可用性についても高いレベルが求められます。もともと私は、主にホームユースを想定したWebアプリケーションを中心にオープンソースでソフトウェア開発をしていました。しかし、2006年におくじさんと会ってお話をしたときに、ERP5がそれらの技術的課題にいかに取り組み、いかに実現しているかをいろいろ聞いて、その奥深さに強く引かれました。
Nexediには、日々の研究開発を通じてERP5をより良い製品にするベンダとしての役割と、ERP5をクライアントのビジネスに合わせて実装するシステムインテグレータ（SIer）としての役割の両方があります。システムインテグレーション（SI）の業務をすることによって、さまざまなビジネスにおけるクライアントのニーズを知っていますし、一方でベンダとして自社製品について深く知り尽くしています。
オープンソースであることは、ERP5の大きな特徴の1つですが、オープンソースであるかどうかに関係なく、純粋に最良のソリューションだと判断されてクライアントに採用されていることはエンジニア冥利（みょうり）に尽きます。
クライアント向けのプロジェクトの中に技術的な課題を見つけ、その課題を解決することで製品そのものの質が向上します。製品の質が向上すれば、そこからまた新しいビジネスの可能性が生まれてきます。そんなベンダとSIerとのいいとこ取りが、私の日々の仕事です。
そんな仕事をしていく中で、ベンダとしても、SIerとしても、高い技術力がないと本当にいいものは決して作れないということを強く実感しています。技術力が低い会社には逆立ちしてもできないことを私たちはやっている、そう思える仕事をしていることは大きな誇りです。
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Before you put much hope in forecasts for a 2008 rebound in the battered housing market , consider this : A year ago at this time many top economists were looking for that recovery to begin in 2007 .
Instead , the year saw historic declines in nearly every measure of housing strength and home building , and left a trail of predictions from some of the nation 's top economists that look - at best - foolish .
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and his successor Ben Bernanke , after reviewing home sales and mortgage rates in fall 2006 , were hopeful that the market had bottomed out .
" It may be too soon to say that it 's over .
It may not be too soon to say that the worst is over , " said Greenspan in an October 2006 speech in Richmond , according to press reports .
In a November 2006 speech , Bernanke said he saw some " encouraging " signs in recent housing reports .
" Although residential construction continues to sag , some indications suggest that the rate of home purchase may be stabilizing , perhaps in response to modest declines in mortgage interest rates over the past few months and lower prices in some markets , " Bernanke said .
But those signs of life were short - lived .
By Feb. 7 , HSBC ( HBC ) was warning that rising losses on mortgage - backed securities would cause it to take a $ 10.5 billion charge .
The phrase " subprime mortgage " was on its way to becoming the key global business term of 2007 .
And few would use the word " encouraging " in relation to housing again .
Rising mortgage delinquencies and defaults led to a meltdown in the mortgage market , cutting off credit to many homeowners and potential buyers and sparking record levels of foreclosures .
That only added to a record glut of both new and existing homes on the market .
Historic declines in both the pace and price of home sales soon followed .
Lisa Panasiti , a spokeswoman for Greenspan , said the former chairman was referring in his 2006 remarks to real estate 's drag on gross domestic product , and that housing 's hit on GDP has since eased .
Many other economists freely admit their year - ago forecasts missed the mark .
And while many of those economists are again hoping the year ahead will bring a modest recovery , they are far from certain .
" A lot can go wrong here , " said David Wyss , chief economist at Standard & Poor's .
" I thought we'd have problems , but I thought it'd be a smoother adjustment , " Wyss said about the problems that developed in mortgage - backed securities .
" The financial side was much worse than I thought it was going to be . "
A year ago Wyss was forecasting a 7 percent drop in home prices from peak levels .
Instead prices fell nearly 10 percent from the July 2006 record .
" Everyone thought I was nuts .
Now it turns out I was an optimist , " he said .
Wyss ' current forecast is that prices will fall another percent or two , but he added that there 's a risk of a worse fall - off .
His hopes for the start of a turnaround in housing in late 2008 depend on the broader economy not slipping into a recession and foreign investment in mortgage - backed securities continuing to flow .
Both of those are risky assumptions , he concedes .
" As foreigners get scared and stop sending money to us , that could send bond yields and mortgage rates up .
That 's the biggest worry , " said Wyss .
The National Association of Realtors made a forecast a year ago that was far more optimistic than those by Wyss and many other economists .
The Realtors expected only a 1 percent drop in the pace of existing home sales , and a 1 percent gain in median prices .
Instead , 2007 will likely end with a 12.5 percent plunge in the pace of sales , and nearly a 2 percent drop in prices , the first such decline on record .
The group 's current forecast for 2008 calls for a 0.5 percent increase in the pace of sales , and a 0.3 percent rebound in prices .
But Lawrence
Yun , chief economist for the trade group , said that making forecasts is even tougher this year than it was a year ago .
Yun forecasts essentially flat prices in 2008 .
Yet , he also believes there 's at least a one in four chance that prices will fall more than they did this year , and about the same chance that prices could rebound by 3 percent or more .
" I would not be surprised if home sales improves in 2008 , " he said .
" At the same time I can also foresee a circumstance where buyers continue to pull back , the inventory sitting on the market continues to build and it causes prices to go down further . "
Yun hopes that housing may get a lift if proposals are enacted to allow government - sponsored mortgage finance firms Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) to back mortgages of more than $ 417,000 in high - priced markets .
He also puts stock in proposed reform of the Federal Housing Administration that would help borrowers get loans .
Yun 's biggest fear is that Fannie and Freddie 's financial problems will worsen substantially in 2008 .
While he said he does n't believe that will happen , a financial crisis at one or both firms could shake the housing market enough to cause a recession .
" As long as global providers of capital feel comfortable with Fannie and Freddie , I do n't foresee a major crisis , " he said .
" But if Fannie or Freddie were to be wobbly , that could send mortgage rates to 7 to 8 percent and really choke off demand . "
Robert Shiller , a Yale economist who had argued for years that a bubble was forming in real estate prices , points out that one group was on target about where prices would go - investors in a real estate futures market that he helped set up on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange .
Starting in May 2006 , the CME set up futures contracts for 10 metropolitan real estate markets , allowing investors to bet whether prices would go up or down and by how much .
By the end of 2006 those futures were pointing to real estate price declines between 5 percent and 7 percent in those markets , Shiller said .
That ended up in line with the 6.7 percent annual decline in the October reading of S&P / Case - Shiller home price index , which was the largest drop recorded in that 20 - year - old price measure .
" I 'm not normally an advocate of market efficiency , but there 's something to be said when you 're putting money on the line with your prediction , rather than just talking , " he said .
Those futures today are far more bearish about future housing prices than most current economists - foreseeing an additional 4 percent to 14 percent drop in prices over the next year .
" I do n't have any reason to doubt those forecasts , " said Shiller , who does not make forecasts of his own because of his work on his price index and with the markets .
Other economists who had warned of a housing bubble still saw their late 2006 forecasts underestimate the problems that lay ahead .
" A year ago I thought a drop in prices was inevitable , but I did n't know if it would be a bubble bursting or the air leaking out of the balloon , " said Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research .
" At this point we 're seeing a quick meltdown . "
Baker 's forecast for the drop in existing home sales to 5.6 million homes was essentially spot on .
But he underestimated the drop in new housing starts :
He forecast 1.7 million and they are on pace to come in at between 1.3 million to 1.4 million .
The problems in subprime mortgages were foreseeable , Baker said .
He added that those problems are likely to spread to prime mortgages given to people with strong credit histories .
And that could mean that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , which have relatively little exposure to subprime mortgages , could need a bailout despite stock sales that executives say have raised the capital they need to weather the storm .
" People still have n't caught up with the fact that this is a larger issue for the mortgage market as a whole rather than just subprime , " said Baker .

Trackbacks Magistrate Judge Finds Fifth Amendment Right Not to Enter Encryption Passphrase :
First , the facts .
Boucher was crossing the border from Canada to Vermont when border agents began to suspect he had child pornography in the car .
They saw a laptop in the back of the car and opened it up .
It was not password - protected , an an agent began to look through it .
( By way of background , the Fourth Amendment has an exception at the border that makes this search legal . )
The agent came across several files with truly revolting titles that strongly suggested the files themselves were child pornography .
The files had been opened a few days earlier , but the agent found that he could not open the file when he tried to do so .
Agents asked Boucher if there was child pornography in the computer , and Boucher said he was n't sure ; he downloaded a lot of pornography on to his computer , he said , but he deleted child pornography when he came across it .
In response to the agents ' request , Boucher waived his Miranda rights and agreed to show the agents where the pornography on the computer was stored .
The agents gave the computer to Boucher , who navigated through the machine to a part of the hard drive named " drive Z. "
The agents then asked Boucher to step aside and started to look through the computer themselves .
They came across several videos and pictures of child pornography .
Boucher was then arrested , and the agents powered down the laptop .
Now here 's where it gets interesting .
Two weeks later a government forensic analyst started to analyze the machine .
He created a " mirror " copy of the hard drive and then looked at the mirror to see what it contained .
But it turned out that the part of the hard drive that was designated " drive Z " was encrypted with the popular software program
Judge Niedermeier ruled that Boucher did have such a privilege and quashed the subpoena .
According to Judge Niedermeier , entering in the password would be testimonial .
To read the rest of this post , click here .
Here 's the key passage : Entering a password into the computer implicitly communicates facts .
By entering the password Boucher would be disclosing the fact that he knows the password and has control over the files on drive Z .
The procedure is equivalent to asking Boucher , " Do you know the password to the laptop ? "
If Boucher does know the password , he would be faced with the forbidden trilemma ; incriminate himself , lie under oath , or find himself in contempt of court .
Id . at 212 .
The Supreme Court has held some acts of production are unprivileged such as providing fingerprints , blood samples , or voice recordings .
Id. at 210 .
Production of such evidence gives no indication of a person 's thoughts or knowledge because it is undeniable that a person possesses his own fingerprints , blood , and voice .
Id. at 210 - 11 .
Unlike the unprivileged production of such samples , it is not without question that Boucher possesses the password or has access to the files .
In distinguishing testimonial from non-testimonial acts , the Supreme Court has compared revealing the combination to a wall safe to surrendering the key to a strongbox .
See id. at 210 , n. 9 ; see also United States v. Hubbell , 530 U.S. 27 , 43 ( 2000 ) .
The combination conveys the contents of one 's mind ; the key does not and is therefore not testimonial .
Doe II , 487 U.S. at 210 , n. 9 .
A password , like a combination , is in the suspect 's mind , and is therefore testimonial and beyond the reach of the grand jury subpoena .
The government has offered to restrict the entering of the password so that no one views or records the password .
While this would prevent the government from knowing what the password is , it would not change the testimonial significance of the act of entering the password .
Boucher would still be implicitly indicating that he knows the password and that he has access to the files .
The contents of Boucher 's mind would still be displayed , and therefore the testimonial nature does not change merely because no one else will discover the password .
Judge Niedermeier also rejected the argument that the Fifth Amendment did n't apply because the testimonial fact was a " foregone conclusion " and thus not protected :
While the government has seen some of the files on drive Z , it has not viewed all or even most of them .
While the government may know of the existence and location of the files it has previously viewed , it does not know of the existence of other files on drive Z that may contain incriminating material .
By compelling entry of the password the government would be compelling production of all the files on drive Z , both known and unknown .
. . .
[ T ]he files the government has not seen could add much to the sum total of the government 's information .
Therefore , the foregone conclusion doctrine does not apply and the act of production privilege remains .
Since the government is trying to compel the production of the password itself , the foregone conclusion doctrine cannot apply .
The password is not a physical thing .
If Boucher knows the password , it only exists in his mind .
This information is unlike a document , to which the foregone conclusion doctrine usually applies , and unlike any physical evidence the government could already know of .
It is pure testimonial production rather than physical evidence having testimonial aspects .
Compelling Boucher to produce the password compels him to display the contents of his mind to incriminate himself .
Doe III did not deal with production of a suspect 's thoughts and memories but only previously created documents .
The foregone conclusion doctrine does not apply to the production of non-physical evidence , existing only in a suspect 's mind where the act of production can be used against him .
I do n't play in the sandbox of the Fifth Amendment as much as I do the Fourth , but my sense is that Judge Niedermeier is wrong .
True , being forced to enter in the password has a communicative aspect to it .
It says , " I know the password to drive Z on my laptop . "
But based on the specific facts of the case , do n't we already know that ?
Is n't it a " foregone conclusion " under the Fisher case ?
Boucher admitted that it was his laptop , and he described how he used it .
When he agreed to show the officers the files inside , he had no problem powering it up and bringing them to the contents of drive Z .
The subpoena is simply trying to get Boucher to take the officers back to where he had already taken them before : through the passphrase so they can access the files .
Judge Niedermier 's response is that this is true for the child pornography the agents saw but that there may be other files on the computer that are also incriminating .
Entering in the key will be akin to producing any other files that might exist , effectively saying , " these are files on my laptop . "
But I think that 's wrong .
As I see it , entering the passphrase does n't have any testimonial content as to Boucher 's knowledge or beliefs as to any other files in " drive Z " that may or may not exist .
Maybe there are other incriminating files in drive Z .
On the other hand , maybe there are n't .
But the answer to that is completely independent of what Boucher is being asked to do .
It may be that entering in the passphrase will help the police find more child pornography , but that is not the result of the communicative aspect of responding to the subpoena .
Boucher 's entering in the password wo n't amount to Boucher 's testimony about anything they do n't already know in the context of this case .
Its role is merely that it will let the police access whatever is on the hard drive , which may or may not relate to criminal activity and may or may not implicate Boucher .
Boucher wo n't be " bringing " the files to the police in response to an order to incriminating files ; he will merely be opening the door to the safe that we all know is his and that we seem to know he knows how to open .
Given that this post might be of interest to a non-lawyer crowd , I should add an important point that will be obvious to the lawyers but not obvious to the computer crowd :
This opinion does not really settle the legal issue .
It 's only an opinion by one judge , and that judge is n't even a " real " federal District Court judge .
The opinion is only the decision of one Magistrate Judge , who is sort of an assistant judge in the federal system .
If you want to make an analogy to science , this is like one professor 's hypothesis rather than an experimental or theoretical proof .
So while it 's the first case on the issue , it may be wrong ( as I tend to think it is ) and probably wo n't be the final word either way .
Anyway , this is an interesting and difficult issue , and that 's my tentative take on it .
I 'd be particularly interested in hearing from techies who have a sense of what probably happened on the tech side .
Finally , thanks to Robert W. Clark for bringing the case to my attention .
Here 's the key passage : Judge Niedermeier also rejected the argument that the Fifth Amendment did n't apply because the testimonial fact was a " foregone conclusion " and thus not protected : I do n't play in the sandbox of the Fifth Amendment as much as I do the Fourth , but my sense is that Judge Niedermeier is wrong .
True , being forced to enter in the password has a communicative aspect to it .
It says , " I know the password to drive Z on my laptop . "
But based on the specific facts of the case , do n't we already know that ?
Is n't it a " foregone conclusion " under thecase ?
Boucher admitted that it was his laptop , and he described how he used it .
When he agreed to show the officers the files inside , he had no problem powering it up and bringing them to the contents of drive Z .
The subpoena is simply trying to get Boucher to take the officers back to where he had already taken them before : through the passphrase so they can access the files .
Judge Niedermier 's response is that this is true for the child pornography the agents saw but that there may be other files on the computer that are also incriminating .
Entering in the key will be akin to producing any other files that might exist , effectively saying , " these are files on my laptop . "
But I think that 's wrong .
As I see it , entering the passphrase does n't have any testimonial content as to Boucher 's knowledge or beliefs as to any other files in " drive Z " that may or may not exist .
Maybe there are other incriminating files in drive Z .
On the other hand , maybe there are n't .
But the answer to that is completely independent of what Boucher is being asked to do .
It may be that entering in the passphrase will help the police find more child pornography , but that is not the result of the communicative aspect of responding to the subpoena .
Boucher 's entering in the password wo n't amount to Boucher 's testimony about anything they do n't already know in the context of this case .
Its role is merely that it will let the police access whatever is on the hard drive , which may or may not relate to criminal activity and may or may not implicate Boucher .

On November 29 , Magistrate Judge Jerome Niedermeier in Vermont handed down the first opinion to squarely address the issue :
In re Boucher .
Judge Niedermeier ruled that the defendant did have a Fifth Amendment privilege in such circumstances .
This is a hard issue , but I tend to think Judge Niedermeier was wrong given the specific facts of this case .
First , the facts .
Boucher was crossing the border from Canada to Vermont when border agents began to suspect he had child pornography in the car .
They saw a laptop in the back of the car and opened it up .
It was not password - protected , an an agent began to look through it .
( By way of background , the Fourth Amendment has an exception at the border that makes this search legal . )
The agent came across several files with truly revolting titles that strongly suggested the files themselves were child pornography .
The files had been opened a few days earlier , but the agent found that he could not open the file when he tried to do so .
Agents asked Boucher if there was child pornography in the computer , and Boucher said he was n't sure ; he downloaded a lot of pornography on to his computer , he said , but he deleted child pornography when he came across it .
In response to the agents ' request , Boucher waived hisrights and agreed to show the agents where the pornography on the computer was stored .
The agents gave the computer to Boucher , who navigated through the machine to a part of the hard drive named " drive Z. "
The agents then asked Boucher to step aside and started to look through the computer themselves .
They came across several videos and pictures of child pornography .
Boucher was then arrested , and the agents powered down the laptop .
Now here 's where it gets interesting .
Two weeks later a government forensic analyst started to analyze the machine .
He created a " mirror " copy of the hard drive and then looked at the mirror to see what it contained .
But it turned out that the part of the hard drive that was designated " drive Z " was encrypted with the popular software program PGP , and no one — no one , presumably , except for Boucher — knew the password .
The government tried to guess the password and failed , so the grand jury issued a subpoena to Boucher ordering him to disclose the password to drive Z. Boucher 's counsel them moved to block the subpoena , arguing that he had a Fifth Amendment privilege not to comply .
The government responded that it would be happy to just have Boucher enter in the password without the government ever seeing it .
The Court thus addressed only whether Boucher had a Fifth Amendment privilege not to enter in the password .
Judge Niedermeier ruled that Boucher did have such a privilege and quashed the subpoena .
According to Judge Niedermeier , entering in the password would be testimonial .
The Federal Communications Commission has officially opened a pair of rule - making proceedings over network management in the wake of the discovery that Comcast occasionally blocks some BitTorrent and other traffic ( Comcast calls it " delaying " ) .
The proceedings are not unexpected , seeing as how FCC Chairman Kevin Martin promised an investigation last week at the Consumer Electronics Show .
In November , a handful of net neutrality advocates called on the FCC to investigate Comcast 's traffic management practices to determine if they violated the FCC 's policies .
The proceedings initiated today by the FCC will do exactly that .
The FCC's Wireline Competition Bureau is looking for comment on a petition seeking a declaratory ruling that " the practice by broadband service providers of degrading peer - to - peer traffic violates the FCC's Internet Policy Statement " and that such practices fall outside of what the FCC calls " reasonable network management . "
The second proceeding is intended to determine what , exactly , constitutes reasonable network management by ISPs .
The petitioner , Vuze , Inc. , wants the FCC to rule that such management prohibits broadband providers from blocking , degrading , or " unreasonably " discriminating against " lawful Internet applications , content , or technologies . "
Under the FCC's 2005 Internet Policy Statement ( PDF ) , ISPs are allowed to engage in " reasonable network management . "
At the same time , subscribers are also allowed to access lawful content as well as run applications and services of their choice , and connect legal devices to the network .
Vuze argues that ISPs should be able to manage traffic , but any management needs to be targeted at specific network impact rather than a class of applications ( e.g. , BitTorrent ) and be completely transparent to end users .
Comcast and other ISPs are reluctant to divulge exactly what measures they take to shape traffic .
Comcast executive vice president David L. Cohen defended his company 's practices in a statement sent to Ars .
" We look forward to responding to the FCC inquiries regarding our broadband network management , " said Cohen .
" We believe our practices are in accordance with the FCC 's policy statement on the Internet where the Commission clearly recognized that reasonable network management is necessary for the good of all customers . "
Cohen also reiterated Comcast 's position that it does n't block traffic .
" Comcast does not , has not , and will not block any websites or online applications , including peer - to - peer services , " he said , pledging to work with the FCC to " bring more transparency for consumers regarding broadband network management . "
Free Press praised the FCC 's decision .
" Comcast blocking BitTorrent is the canary in the coal mine for corporations that seek to take over the Internet , " said policy director Ben Scott .
" The FCC should immediately stop Comcast from blocking Internet traffic and then proceed with this important investigation and public comment process .
It 's high time to involve the American public in this matter . "
If you 're interested in weighing in on the rule - making proceeding , you can use the FCC's Electronic Comment Filing System ( referencing WC Docket no. 07 -52 ) .
The deadline for submitting comments is February 13 , 2008 , and replies are due on February 28 .
When NASA labels something a " Death Star , " you can pretty much rest assured that it will be cool — at least in an astrophysical sense .
The recent discovery of a pair of neighboring galaxies , both with supermassive black holes at their centers , inspired the label after NASA researchers found that one galaxy was literally blasting the other with bursts of energy .
A galaxy with a supermassive black hole is n't terribly special — the Milky Way is believed to have one .
In the newly - discovered galaxies , however , one of these supermassive black holes has huge jets of energy emanating from it that are slamming right into the other galaxy .
" We 've seen many jets produced by black holes , but this is the first time we 've seen one punch into another galaxy like we 're seeing here , " said Dan Evans , a scientist at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the leader of the study .
" This jet could be causing all sorts of problems for the smaller galaxy it is pummeling . "
The Death Star galaxy , officially called 3C321 , was discovered from a combination of space and ground - based telescopes .
NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory , Hubble Space Telescope , Spitzer Space Telescope , the Very Large Array ( VLA ) , and Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network ( MERLIN ) telescopes were all in on the action in finding this astronomical phenomenon .

Evans et al. ; Optical / UV : NASA / STScI ;
Radio : NSF / VLA /CfA /D.Evans et al. , STFC / JBO / MERLIN )
The jets coming from the supermassive black hole consist of high energy particles traveling at nearly the speed of light , and they produce massive radiation in the forms of X - rays and gamma rays .
Jets like these can be seen all over the visible universe , but scientists barely understand them .
The new discovery provides a unique opportunity to study the effects of a jet interacting with other matter .
Images from MERLIN and the VLA show the energy jet striking the companion galaxy , and also show that the collision dissipates some of the jet 's energy .
Astronomers have concluded that the collision disrupts and deflects the jet .
Data from Chandra and the VLA shows that the interaction in 3C321 is relatively new , beginning only one million years ago , making this an even more unique opportunity for scientists .
While getting slammed from a supermassive black hole 's energy jet would seem to be the beginning of a tough day , scientists suggest that it may not be all bad news .
The large amount of energy and mass being injected into the target galaxy could precipitate the formation of new stars and planets after the initial destruction subsides .

PARIS 
In an unusual ruling on Friday at the World Trade Organization , the Caribbean nation of Antigua won the right to violate copyright protections on goods like films and music from the United States  an award worth up to $ 21 million  as part of a dispute between the countries over online gambling .
The award follows a W.T.O. ruling that Washington had wrongly blocked online gambling operators on the island from the American market at the same time it allowed online wagering on horse racing .
Antigua and Barbuda had claimed damages of $ 3.44 billion a year .
That makes the relatively small amount awarded Friday , $ 21 million , something of a setback for Antigua , which had been struggling to preserve its gambling industry .
The United States argued that its behavior had caused $ 500,000 damage .
Yet the ruling is significant in that it grants a rare form of compensation : the right of one country , in this case Antigua , to violate intellectual property laws of another  the United States  by allowing it to distribute copies of American music , movie and software products .
In a lot of ways , she is probably the right candidate to get my vote .
I do n't like the dynastic tendency , however .
This would be four in a row from two families ; at least the Adamses , Harrisons , and Roosevelts had the decency to spread it over several generations .
But the main objection I have is , I am willing to see her as president , but not after George W. Bush .
He has been one of those presidents who pumped up executive branch powers and authority till it literally tore through its clothes like the Hulk .
He did it for particular reasons and used it to particular ends , but right now the federal government is very top - heavy and very strong .
Hillary would not give back an ounce of that , no matter what she says .
She , too , has the authoritarian tendency and not only is she comfortable with power , she would be looking to augment it .
We 've had presidents like Bush before , who so extended the executive reach they alarmed even their own partisans .
Jackson , Polk ( the first 20th century president and still not appreciated ) , Lincoln , Wilson .
And we 've followed them with weak or hemmed - in men who had to let go of much of that overreach .
Call it God 's blessing on us or the wisdom of crowds or sheer blind luck .
After Jackson , Van Buren , crafty but not potent , and whittled down by the titans in Congress ; after Polk a series of feckless one - termers ; after Lincoln , Andy Johnson and Grant who frittered ; after Wilson , a series of non-entities ; after the dynamic Roosevelt , the weak , sick , old Roosevelt , then Truman , who had to learn it all from scratch .
After Nixon , Ford .
Two in a row might be more than we could stand .

The Rosette Nebula
( also see Stellar Birthplaces and Stellar Formation )
In the animation at the right ( created from images by Richard Crisp at apod050214 and narrowbandimaging.com ) , the H - alpha ( Hα ) radiation of neutral hydrogen atoms is used to bring out the primary detail in the nebula , while radiation by doubly ionized oxygen atoms and singly ionized sulfur atoms is used to establish a range of colors for an " artistic " rendering of the nebula 's supposed color .
This color is completely false , since objects so faint , even if visible to our eyes would appear to be only a pale gray or greenish - gray ; but the color makes the image far more interesting than if presented only in black and white ( as can be seen by the alternation of the color image with the black - and - white Hα image ) .
The spectacular image below ( Image credit & © : Jean - Charles Cuillandre ( CFHT ) & Giovanni Anselmi ( Coelum ) , MegaPrime Camera ; used by permission ) shows the hot bright stars in the center of the cloud heating the gas surrounding them from 100 Kelvins to 10000 Kelvins ( * see note below ) , increasing the pressure of the gas by more than a hundred times , causing it to push against the surrounding clouds of gas , simultaneously eating away at them and compressing them to small , dark compact regions which will become a newer generation of stars .
Most of the bright stars visible in the central cluster were formed over a period of a few million years , but some may have formed within the last few thousands of years , since star formation is still ongoing in the region .
* Note : Although most of the gas pushing against the surrounding clouds has a temperature of 10 thousand Kelvins , observations with the Chandra X - ray observatory have revealed that in the central part of the nebula , collisional shock waves from stellar winds blowing in opposite directions ( from exceptionally hot young stars in the center of the cluster ) have heated the gas to 6 million Kelvins .
The Rosette Nebula is a cloud of gas and dust about 130 light years in diameter , lying approximately 5000 light years from our Solar System in the direction of the constellation of Monoceros .
The mass of the nebula is estimated at 10 thousand Solar masses , even though it is just a small part of a much larger region of gas and dust spanning the entire constellation .
The Rosette would appear as large as the full Moon if it were visible to the eye , but it is so faint that visual observation is difficult even with telescopes .
The hot bright stars in its center are easily visible , being point sources of light ; but the diffuse light of the nebula requires photography with filters which block out all of the light of the night sky save for wavelengths emitted by gases in the nebula as they absorb the ultraviolet radiation pouring out of the stars which illuminate the nebula .

Det er også sitert som den beste lavt priset , high - end Android smartphonet som er tilgjengelig i markedet .
2. Samsung Galaxy S4
Samsung Galaxy S4 er den mest heftig etterlengtede smarttelefon noensinne fra koreansk merke , og med en overflod av topp avanserte funksjoner , er det den mest kraftfulle og ønskelig enhet Samsung har laget ennå .
En av de mest imponerende ting om telefonen er det faktum at størrelsen ikke har endret seg fra forgjengeren – Galaxy S4 kommer inn på 136,6 x 69,8 x 7.9 mm ( 5,38 x 2,75 x 0,31 inches ) , noe som betyr at det er ingen ekstra heft å prøve å jobbe med i håndflaten .
Andre bemerkelsesverdige tillegg til den utforming av Galaxy S4 er den infrarøde blaster på toppen av telefonen .
Dette gjør at du kan styre TV , satellitt boks , DVD - spiller , forsterker og selv klimaanlegget .
Igjen , dette er ikke en ny funksjon , men det fungerer godt i praksis , og til tross for å være liten er kraftig nok faktisk .
Prisen på telefonen er bare å spille rundt $ 500 – en rimelig pris for en slik imponerende apparat .
3. Samsung Galaxy Note
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 , Samsungs splitter ny 5,7 - tommers phablet , er også en av de beste Android - smarttelefoner på markedet takket være unik programvare , dens medfølgende S Pen , og en høy kvalitet på .

January 14th , 2008 | Published in CORBA , design , distributed systems , REST , WS -* | 7 Comments | Bookmark on Pinboard .in
I have to say that I agree with Ryan Tomayko on this one .
Among other things , Ryan touches on one of the favorite assertions of the REST detractors , which is that REST ca n’t be effective without an interface / service / resource definition language .
After all , without such a language , how can you generate code , which in turn will ease the development of the distributed system by making it all look like a local system ?
Not surprisingly , the first comment on Ryan ’s blog entry is exactly along these lines .
As I ’ve been saying for years , trying to reverse - map your programming language classes into distributed services , such as via Special Object Annotations , is an attempt to turn local design artifacts into distributed ones , which we learned long ago is just plain wrong .
You often end up paying for such shortcuts in areas such as reliability , flexibility , extensibility , versioning , reusability , and especially scalability .
Back in the halcyon days of CORBA , we generated code from OMG IDL , but IDL is not a local design artifact .
OMG IDL was designed from Day One to define distributed systems ( though we did add the “ local ” keyword to IDL sometime around 1999 or so to allow for easier local call optimizations ) .
Note also that unlike the usual approach to defining WSDL , we never reverse - generated IDL from C++ , Java , or any other programming language ( though a questionable group eventually did come along and , trying to ride the Java popularity wave , define an OMG standard reverse IDL mapping for Java , despite strenuous objections from a number of us , including me ) .
IDL also allowed for generating code in different programming languages for different parts of the same system .
But the RPC roots of CORBA , its interface specialization requirements , and the inflexibility of the generated code , especially with respect to versioning , ultimately limited CORBA ’s possibilities when it came to medium - to large - scale systems .
Proponents of definition languages seem to assert that such languages help with understandability .
Such languages , they say , are required because they alone tell you how to invoke the service , what to pass to it , and what to expect in return .
The problem with the way they make this assertion , though , is they make it sound like the application figures all that stuff out on its own with no human involvement .
What happens in reality is that an actual human programmer sits down , reads the interface definition , more than likely reads some comments in the definition or a whole separate document that describes the interface in more detail , and perhaps even talks to the person who wrote the interface definition in the first place .
Based on the knowledge gained , he then writes the application to call that interface .
Similarly , with REST , you read the documentation and you write your applications appropriately , but of course the focus is different because the interface is uniform .
Depending on the system , and assuming REST as implemented by HTTP , you might also be able to interact with it via your browser to help understand how it works , which I ’ve found extremely valuable in practice ( and yes , this works for application - to - application systems that are not designed primarily for browsers or human consumption ) .
But ultimately , there ’s no magic , regardless of whether or not you have a definition language .
What the proponents of definition languages seem to miss is that such languages are primarily geared towards generating tedious interface - specific code , which is required only because the underlying system forces you to specialize your interfaces in the first place .
Keep in mind that specialized interfaces represent specialized protocols , and IDL was developed oh so long ago to generate the nontrivial code required to have RPC applications efficiently interact over such protocols , since back then computers and networks were far slower and less reliable than they are today , and getting that code right was really hard .
When you have a uniform interface , though , the need to generate interface - specific interaction code basically goes away .
( BTW , the first IDL I ever saw was at Apollo , where it was used not only for RPC in the Apollo Network Computing System ( NCS ) but also to define Domain / OS header files once and generate them into their C and Domain Pascal equivalents , rather than writing and maintaining them twice , once for each language . )
Some REST proponents like WADL .
I ’ve looked at it but have n’t used it , so I ca n’t really comment on it .
I ’ve never felt the need to seek out a resource definition language of any kind for my REST work , at least to date .
YMMV .
BTW , on a somewhat related note , I still use CORBA , contrary to what some jackasses out there would like you to believe .
In some industries , certain CORBA interfaces are standardized and even legally enforced .
In others , leading players have defined CORBA interfaces for 3rd - party integration .
These interfaces work , so those companies and industries have no intention of changing them to another technology anytime soon , and in fact they simply have no need to change them at all .
I ’ve had to work within some of these CORBA scenarios lately , and I have to say I ’ve found it to be fun , like meeting up with an old friend you have n’t seen in awhile .
I ’m sure many of these interfaces could be done better with REST , but they work as is , and there ’s just no need to throw them out .
Coincidentally Ryan spoke of CORBA when he responded to the commenter mentioned above .
All in all , I remain proud of my CORBA work over the years , as we did a lot of good stuff back then , even if since then we ’ve found simpler ways of doing a few things .
A White House official said a major part of the plan would entail stationing inspectors in foreign countries to examine drugs , food and other potentially dangerous products before they were shipped to American shores .
The official said that with $ 2 trillion in imports annually , inspections at the ports had become ineffective .
The official said the plan would give the agencies the authority to certify the safety of products and to list certified products on a Web site that could be viewed by consumers .
By adopting a system of government - sponsored certifications and relying on various industries to police themselves , the official said , the plan would enable inspectors to focus on particular companies and industries with particularly dangerous products or checkered safety records .
The plan would give the drug and consumer protection agencies stronger authority to issue mandatory recalls and would propose steeper penalties on importers of goods that violated American safety laws .
Officials said that the plan would require significant budget increases for the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Food and Drug Administration .
No new budget figures will be presented Tuesday , the officials said , but they are likely to be made later this year after the plan is refined .
The officials refused to be identified because they did not want to upstage the formal announcement of the plan Tuesday by President Bush .
どうもIT系の世界ではCOBOLは悪者にされやすい。たとえば、
2000 億行もの負の遺産― ―COBOLコードの近代化はどのように進めるべきか
とか。
悪者にしたい気持ちもわからないではないが、「それはCOBOLのせいじゃないだろう」なことまでCOBOLのせいにされてしまっているのが気の毒だ。「COBOLのせい」にされているもののうち、何割かはCOBOLのせいじゃないし、それはCOBOLのせいじゃないが故に、他の言語やプラットフォームも陥る危険がある。その辺を正しく切り分けておかないと、「今時流行りのもの」もいずれ「○○は悪者」
「○○は古い」になってしまう。
忘れちゃならないのが、今は 「古いもの」の代名詞となっているCOBOLであっても、出た当初は最先端のバリバリだったということ。つまり、「今」最先端でバリバリだと思われているものであっても、何10年かすると「過去の遺物」とされる危険があるということだ。
という話をすると、す ぐ「 LispはCOBOLと同じくらい古いけど、過去の遺物じゃない」という反例を挙げる人がいる。それは確かにそうなんだけど、Lispは「汎用言語」としての過去を持っていない。それゆえ使う人が少ない。そういった「一部の人達」にウケているだけだから、「Lispは古くならない」というのはまずちょっと割り引く必要がある。と共に、世の中の言語は2つに分けられる。それは、
Lispかそうでないか
だ。今使われてい るLispは、40年前のLispとは別のLispだ。現代のLispとどれくらい違うかと言えば、アセンブラとRubyくらい違う。Lispは「括弧つけてる」というただそれだけの特徴でLispであって、その背景に括弧以外に確固たるものがあるわけじゃない。格好は同じでも、まるっきり別の言語になっていると言ってもいい。だから、「Lispは古くならない」なんてのは、「どの言語にも代入文があるから同じ言語だ」というくらい乱暴なのだ。そんなわけでLispの話は除外だ。
実はCOBOLも似たような側面がある。40年前のCOBOLと今のCOBOLでは、アセンブラとRubyくらい違う。まるっきり違う言語と言っても良いくらい違う。でもCOBOLとLispが違うのは、そういった「40年前のCOBOL」で書かれたソースであっても、現代のCOBOL(ISO 2002 ) で問題なくコンパイル出来てしまい、問題なく走ってしまうことだ。Lispはいろいろ異なる言語になって発展したのだが、COBOLはそうじゃない。全く同一の言語に機能を加除したことによって現在の言語仕様がある。除かれるのは仕様にあっても実装されなかったり、(ほとんど)使われなかったりしたものだけだ。つまり、常に完全な上位互換性があったわけだ。
言語に完全な上位互換性があって、永年使われて来ると何が起きるかと言えば、
新しい言語仕様を学習しない
ということが起きる(*1)。新しい機能が実装されるのは、言語仕様が発表されてから数年かかるし、古い処理系では新しい機能は使えないということもあって、なかなか新しい言語仕様が定着しない。すると何が起きるかと言えば、
スキルの停 滞
が起きるのだ。つまり、プログラマが新しい機能 — それは時代の流れに合わせて追加されている — について学習しようとしなくなる。また新しい機能にはバグがあることが少なくないから、そういった意味でも「新しいもの」を使わないし、それは「良いこと」とされてしまう。つまり、プログラマの知識が古いままで固定されてしまうことが起きてしまうわけだ。
その結果、今ではごく常識でしかない、動的な諸々とか、OOPや構造化、あるいはモジュール化といったことを、プログラマが学ばない。つまり、古い技術で仕事をしてしまうわけだ。だから、「COBOLのせい」とされていることの、何割かはそういった「古いタイプのプログラマ」が「古い技術」を使い続けてしまった結果だ。件の記事に、
プログラム開発者というものは最先端テクノロジを好むものであり、プログラミング言語、開発環境、開発ツールなどはいずれも最新のものを使いたがる傾向にある。実際、プログラミング関係の参考書やコンファレンスはどれも、Java、Ruby on Rails、C#、Ajaxなどのタイトルで目白押しだ。
なんてことが書いてあるのだが、これは「嘘」だ。確かにその傾向を持った人は大量にいるし、そういった人達が「新しいテクノロジ」を支えているのは確かであるが、世の中のプログラマはそんな人ばかりじゃない。
いや、実 は 「最先端テクノロジを好むプログラマ」だって、「普段使いのもの」はそうじゃない。だって、いまだに「普段使いの言語」で何でもやりたがるし、そういった「何でも出来る言語」が大好きな人は多い。エディタは「ここ20年ばかりEmacs」な人は大勢いる。「新しいもの」に飛びつくのは、それまでのものに不足があったからであって、「それまでのものに満足」していれば、そんなことはしないのが普通の人だ。もしプログラマが最先端テクノロジを好むだけの人達であれば、エディタにEmacsを使い続けているのはおかしい。
「 COBOLの問題」というのも実は同根で、COBOLのプログラマ達が「それまでのものに満足」している結果、新しいものに手を出さない。だから、いつまでたっても古いテクノロジが使い続けられてしまって、新しいテクノロジから見ると「時代遅れ」になってしまっている。たったそれだけのことがほとんどだ。そして残りの何割かは、「マトモなドキュメントがない」ということが原因だ。そうして調べ挙げれば、
COBOL という言語の問題ではない
ことがわかるはずだ 。
COBOL にどっぷり漬かると、プログラマライフは結構快適だ。COBOLさえあれば、たいていのことが出来てしまう。私がかつてCOBOLしか使えない環境にいた時は、COBOLで簡易言語の処理系まで書いていた。つまり、その程度には汎用言語なのだ。友達がstdio的な処理に使える入出力ライブラリを作ってくれたのがあったので、ツールはホイホイそれで作れた。
幸いなことに私は他の言語がもっと快適であることを知っていたし、本当に「新しいもの好き」だったから、心の底までCOBOLに染まることはなかったけれど、「プログラムは仕事」と割り切った人なら、十分に染まり切ったことだろう。
そうやっ て 「古いもの」に縛られた結果が「COBOLが負の遺産」ということになってしまったわけだ。つまり、悪いのはCOBOLという言語そのものじゃなくて、「COBOLサイコー」とばかりにCOBOLにしがみついていた、
真性COBOLerの働き
の結果なのだ。 「 設計に柔軟性がない」というのも、COBOL以外の環境や、今使っているプラットーム以外のことを考えもしなかった結果だ。ウォータフォールに固執する開発体制も、エンジニア達が「それ以外」に目を向けなかった結果だ。
COBOLであってもOOD は出来るし、アジャイル開発だって出来る。GUIバリバリのアプリケーションも書けるし、webアプリだって書ける。RDBだってRDBらしく書ける。さらに今時だと本物のOOPだって出来る。そういった点を見れば「現代の他の言語」と何らひけを取ることはない。まぁ「簡潔に書きにくい」という問題はよく指摘されるのだが、その辺はCOBOLという言語のコンセプト的な部分でもあるから、責めるべきことじゃない。
ということを見れば 、COBOL の「負の遺産」というのは、たいていのプログラム言語とプログラマが陥りやすい罠に落ちた人がいる結果だということがわかると思う。つまり、同じことは他の言語や環境でも起こりうるのだ。つまり、
そこそこ便利で使いやすい
ものであれば、十分に起こりうる。
COBOLだって出た当初は最先端だったし、「新しい規格」はそれが出た時点では最先端を取り込んでいる。つまり、COBOLそれ自体が古かったわけでも古くなったわけでもない。問題は
使う人が進歩しなかった
ということで、それは 「そこそこ便利で使いやすい」ものであれば、どれにもある罠なのだ。そのことを反省しない限り、
負の遺産の再生 産
を繰り返すことにしかならない。
PS .
* 1 「 COBOLの中の人」の端っくれとしては、「新しい規格を使ってくれない」というのは非常に虚しい。「入れろ！」と提案される仕様は山盛りあるのだけど(諸伴の事情で最近は減ったが)、「そんなもんCOBOLerは使わんだろ」と言いたくなる。実際のところISO
2002を完全実装した処理系はまだないのだけど、OOPあたりくらいは実装したものがある。でも、それが使われているという話は、聞いたことがない。「酷いCOBOL」と呼ばれるコードは、実は85規格以前のものだったり…
PS.2
はてブのコメントに 「その論法だとたいていの言語が悪者でなくなる」という意味のことがあった。まぁ極論すれば「物」は「無為」なので、それを良くするかどうかなんてのは人の業…
ということにはなるのだけど、「PL/I」なんてのは言語それ自体が「負の遺産」になりつつあるよね。
PS.3
そう言えば 、「 COBOLの新機能」と同じような立場になるものに、「C++の新機能」ってのがあるよね。最新のC++の仕様を見ると随分と立派でちゃんとしてるけど、Cや古いC++から見るとわけわかだったり、習得している人が少なかったり。
Nicole predicted that O'Reilly would come after NBC after the Bill O'Reilly Puppet Theater earlier this week .
On Thursday , O'Reilly went one better and upped his long - standing obsession with NBC to their parent company , General Electric , by ranting about a former NBC correspondent 's allegations that G.E. has ties to the bin Laden family and is doing business with Iran ( I do n't know but would n't be surprised if the allegations are or were true .
So what 's that say about the Bush family , Rudy Giuliani , Mitt Romney or Haliburton ?
Or for that matter , what about Billo 's boss Rupert Murdoch 's doing business in Cuba among a ton of other questionable business practices ?
Glass houses much , Billo ? ) .

When GE CEO / Chairman Jeffrey Immelt did not respond to his show 's questions regarding the matter , Billo got his falafel in a bunch and did the same thing he has done so many times before and sent his goons out to ambush him .
This time , they caught their victim while he was seated at a table having dinner and the minions ( apparently taking lessons in bully journalism from Billo ) have to push and shove their way in past the restaurant staff so they can poke the mic and camera in his face .

A few weeks back , we wrote about the story of how 1970s one - hit - wonder The Knack had suddenly noticed that Run DMC had sampled their 1979 song " My Sharona " in Run DMC 's 1986 hit " It 's Tricky . "
So , even though this was twenty years after that had happened , they decided to sue for copyright infringement .
Perhaps the royalties on that one hit were finally starting to dwindle .
Of course , as we noted at the time , there is a statute of limitations to deal with : apparently it 's three years .
So , how do you get around that ?
Easy .
You just sue for every time the song was purchased in the past three years .
And , of course , why stop at suing just Run DMC ?
Why not sue the online retailers who sold the song in the past three years .
Stephen Bryant has looked deeper into the lawsuit and found that Yahoo , Apple and Amazon are also charged with copyright infringement in the case , for having the gall to sell a popular music hit from 1986 that The Knack just noticed sampled a portion of its song .
If you 're wondering why it 's only the online retailers that are being sued ( I certainly am ) , the reasoning from the lawyer involved is that : " because they copied and sold the infringing work . "
This , of course , makes no sense .
They copied and sold the song because the labels that believed they had the right to it , gave it to them to do so .
That 's the exact same way that those labels gave brick - and - mortar stores , such as Wal - Mart ( who is not being sued ) the song in CD format .
They " copied " the song onto the CD and then " sold " it .
The more you read about this case , the more it sounds like a desperate attempt to get some extra publicity for a band well past its prime .
A cocaine boom in Europe and the continent 's strong currency have combined to fuel a thriving industry : euro laundering .
With the euro approaching $ 1.50 and soaring demand for cocaine in countries like Spain and Italy , Europe has become a far more lucrative place to do business for Latin American drug cartels than in previous years .

The concepts - based approach for teaching programming
Scientific foundation
The two approaches most similar to the kernel language approach are the foundational calculus and the virtual machine .
We explain how the kernel language approach differs from these approaches .
A foundational calculus , like the lambda - calculus or pi-calculus , reduces programming to a minimal number of primitive concepts .
This is especially useful for the theoretical study of computation .
A virtual machine defines a language in terms of an implementation on an idealized machine .
This is especially useful for language implementors and compiler writers .
The problem with both approaches is that any realistic program written in them will be cluttered with technical details about language mechanisms .
The kernel language approach avoids this clutter by choosing concepts wisely .
The kernel languages are designed for programmers .
How concepts lead to multiparadigm programming
General models covered include declarative programming ( functional and logic ) , imperative programming ( component - based and object - oriented ) , and concurrent programming ( both synchronous and asynchronous , including dataflow , streams , lazy execution , message passing , and shared state ) .
Specialized models covered include graphical user interface programming , distributed programming , and constraint programming .
All models are fully implemented for practical programming and incorporate many of the latest research ideas .
The current trend in computer science education is to restrict the student to one or two models .
The most extreme case is where a single rather complex model and language , namely object - oriented programming in Java , is used as a general - purpose approach with which all problems should be solved .
This trend is driven by market forces and has no scientific basis .
One goal of the book is to be a counterweight to this trend , to situate object - oriented programming in a more general context .
In addition to giving the student a deep insight , this has immediate practical benefits .
Many problems that are hard to solve in Java become simple when viewed in the proper computation model .
For example , both concurrent programming and graphical user interface design are difficult in Java .
The book shows how these two areas can be much simplified .

Doctors have split a teenage girl 's brain in two to stop the spread of a rare brain disease .
Janine Leach , 15 , from Sunderland , has a disorder known as Rasmussen s Encephalitis , that eats away at her brain .
The youngster was diagnosed with the condition when she was 11 .
She could have up to 100 seizures a day as surges of electricity in her brain made her nervous system misfire .
Scroll down for more ...
Janine 's mum , Tracey Podd said : " Sometimes the fits were only a minute apart .
I used to sit at the hospital and watch every seizure she had .
It was awful . "
Janine made the tough decision this year to have radical brain surgery after doctors told her the disease would continue to spread and leave her handicapped .
Doctors cut away the diseased half of her brain but left it inside her skull to prevent an increased risk of blood cots .
The surgery left Janine paralysed on the left hand side of her body but doctors hope with physiotherapy she will eventually walk .
Scroll down for more ...
Janine has not had a seizure since the operation .
The high school pupil said : " I have had a very big operation , it was scary , but I am happy I had it .
I hated the seizures . "
Her parents Tracey and Keith , a TNT delivery man , are hopeful that the worst is behind them .
" She is more cheery and much more Janine like , " Tracey told the Sunderland Echo .
" We have seen a dramatic change in her since the operation . "
Haskellは、純粋数学的な単純さを求めて副作用を取り除いた関数型プログラミング言語である。関数型言語でプログラミングを行うことは、標準的な命令型の手法に慣れた開発者にとっては多少の挑戦であるかもしれない。しかし心配は無用。今回は、Haskellの簡単なクイックスタートを提供しよう。
関数型言語では、 （Java、C、それらから派生した言語のような）昔ながらの命令型スタイルとは多少異なるプログラミングスタイルを用いる。関数型言語では、「レシピ」のようにそれぞれのステップを実行して欲しい順番に全て書き出して並べるのではなく、パーツを用いて一本の式を構成することによってプログラムを記述するのである。
関数型のパラダイムをベースにした言語は、プログラミングの世界では現在ホットな話題となっている。関数型言語のファンは、関数型のコードはずっと短く、理解するのも容易で、エラーを引き起こしにくいと主張している。しかし一方で関数型言語に懐疑的な人は、関数型のコードは簡潔すぎるし動作も遅く、内部で何が起こっているのか理解するのも困難だと主張している。
なぜHaskellを使うのか ？
フリーであ る
Haskellはオープンソースの技術なので、無料でダウンロードして使用できるコンパイラやインタプリタが多数存在する。
活発に開発が続けられている
Haskellはアカデミックな世界で非常に好まれており、Haskellの動作速度を向上させたり、コードを読みやすくしたり、またはより強力なものにしたりといったテーマで多数の博士論文や修士論文が執筆されている。このように関数型言語の最適化に関する研究が行われた結果、Haskellはここ5年で単なるアカデミックな遊び道具から、高性能アプリケーションを開発する際の重要な選択肢の一つとなった。
十分に速 い
遅延評価
値は必要になった時点で初めて計算されるため、Haskellでは要素を無限に含むリストを自由に生成して使用することができる。このときコンパイラでは、使用される分についてのみコンパイルが行われる。この評価方法のトレードオフは、どの程度のメモリが使用されているのかを見極めるのが難しい場合があるということだ。
高階関数
関数型言語では、関数は常にファーストクラスオブジェクトである。実際にHaskellでは、簡単かつ明快なコードを書くためには、変数ではなく関数を用いるのが最もよい選択肢である場合がしばしばある。
エラーが起こりにく い
Haskellのコンパイラは型に関して厳格であり、しかも関数には副作用が含まれていないのが普通なので、一度コンパイルさえ通ってしまえば、メモリ関係のバグは含まれていないと考えてもよい。Haskellのウェブサイトではこのことを「コアダンプがない」と宣伝しているが、実際にはもっと強力で、原因を突き止めるのが困難な多くの種類のメモリ関連のバグが除去される。
コンパイラもインタプリタも使用可能
Haskellのコードは実行速度を優先するためにネイティブのマシン語にコンパイルすることも可能であるし、インタプリタを用いてインタラクティブな環境で実行することもできる。それらは、状況に応じて自由に選択できる。Haskellはコンパイラとインタプリタ両方が利用可能な数少ない言語の一つである。
Researchers from Google and a well - known security firm have documented serious vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash content which leave tens of thousands of websites susceptible to attacks that steal the personal details of visitors .
The security bugs reside in Flash applets , the ubiquitous building blocks for movies and graphics that animate sites across the web .
Also known as SWF files , they are vulnerable to attacks in which malicious strings are injected into the legitimate code through a technique known as cross - site scripting , or XSS .
Currently there are no patches for the vulnerabilities , which are found in sites operated by financial institutions , government agencies and other organizations .
The vulnerabilities are laid out in the book Hacking Exposed Web 2.0 : Web 2.0 Security Secrets and Solutions .
It is due to hit store shelves soon , but is already in the hands of many security professionals .
The book 's authors , who work for penetration testing firm iSEC Partners as well as for Google , say a web search reveals more than 500,000 vulnerable applets on major corporate , government and media sites .
" Lots of people are vulnerable , and right now there are no protections available other than to remove those SWFs and wait for the authoring tools and / or Flash player to be updated , " says Alex Stamos , one of the book 's authors .
" In the mean time , people will have to think : ' What kind of flash am I using on my site , ' and manually test for vulnerabilities . "
Flash flood
That could be a mammoth task , because a half - dozen of the most popular Flash authoring programs automatically generate the buggy content .
What 's more , the people who crank out graphics frequently work separately from a site 's security team .
Removing the vulnerable content will require combing through website directories for SWF files and then testing them one by one .
Updates in the Adobe software that renders SWF files in browsers are also expected , but they probably would n't quell the threat completely , according to Stamos .
The authors have been working since the summer with Adobe , the developer of Flash , and the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team to coordinate a remedy .
An Adobe representative said patches should be released in the next few weeks .
In the meantime , end users can employ the Firefox plug - in NoScript or use other methods to block Flash on sensitive websites .
Flash content creators can also utilize the data validation libraries found here , as well as follow the guidelines of this Adobe whitepaper .
A security update Adobe released this week for its Flash player does n't fix the vulnerabilities , Stamos said .
Attack scenarios work something like this : A bank website hosts marketing graphics in the form of a vulnerable Flash applet .
Attackers who trick a customer into clicking on a malicious link are able to execute the SWF file but inject malicious code variables that cause the customer 's authentication cookies or login credentials to be sent to the attacker .
" There are definitely lots of people who are vulnerable , " Stamos said .
" Tens of thousands is very conservative .
Realistically , it 's probably in the hundreds ( of thousands ) . "
Shockwave to the system
One reason for the sheer volume of vulnerable applets : SWF files generated by six of the more popular content development tools automatically contain the bugs , according to the book .
Those programs include DreamWeaver , Connect , Breeze - which are sold by Adobe - and TechSmith Camtasia , InfoSoft FusionCharts and software from Autodemo .
Stamos said Adobe is likely to update its Flash Player so it does a better job of vetting code variables before executing SWF files .
But he said interaction with third - party code is such a core part of the way Flash works that updates to the player would likely provide only a partial fix .
Eradicating the problem will require updates for all of the graphics authoring tools so they no longer generate buggy Flash content .
Even then , security pros will have to analyze all of a website 's SWF files and recompile any found to be vulnerable .
The book was authored by Rich Cannings , a senior information security engineer at Google , and Himanshu Dwivedi , Zane Lackey , Chris Clark and Stamos of iSEC .

As I warnedÂ duringÂ last year ’sÂ incident with the British sailors and the Iranians in the Gulf , an indeterminate border between Iraq and Iran in that area is eventually bound to lead to more incidents , and now it ’s happening :
“ Iranian Revolutionary Guard gunboats harassed three U.S. Navy warships in the Strait of Hormuz Sunday , in what the U.S. military considers a ‘ significant provocative act . ’
Military officials told NBC News that two U.S. Navy destroyers and one frigate were heading into the Persian Gulf through the international waters of the Strait of Hormuz when five armed ‘ fast boats ’ of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard approached a high speed , darting in and out of the formation .
Â
At one point a radio message from one of the Iranian boats warned , ‘ You are going to blow up within minutes . ' ”
The hopes of many that the National Intelligence Estimate on Iran ’s alleged nuclear weapons program — i.e. there is no such program– may have averted war , are , as I predicted , a bit too optimistic .
The War Party ’s slogan , when it comes to Iran , is “ Where there ’s a will , there ’s a way . ”
As long as we ’re in the Middle East , and specifically in Iraq , the prospects for war with TehranÂ proliferae by the day .

Kucinich , MSNBC await the ruling
It ’s three hours before tonight ’s scheduled Democratic debate on MSNBC , yet it remains unclear whether long - shot Dennis Kucinich will be allowed to participate .
A decision is expected from the seven - member state Supreme Court by 6 p.m. , the chief justice said at the close of a hastily arranged hearing this afternoon .
Four justices were based at the Regional Justice Center in Las Vegas , where Kucinich was in attendance but did not speak ; the three other justices participated via a video feed from Carson City .
In District Court on Monday , Kucinich ’s attorney alleged NBC Universal had breached a contract by withdrawing an invitation to the Ohio Congressman , which was backed by a judge .
NBC appealed the decision this morning , prompting this afternoon ’s hearing .
Last week , NBC – through a political consultant – invited the Ohio Congressman by e-mail to participate tonight , yet on Friday withdrew it after changing the participation criteria .
NBC
News now plans to only include the three front - runners in tonight ’s debate : Hillary Clinton , John Edwards and Barack Obama .
In a brief interview with reporters after Tuesday ’s hearing , Las Vegas attorney Donald Campbell , representing NBC Universal , said he is “ not equipped ” to address whether its cable network has a fourth candidate station in the event the Supreme Court uphold the decision by the District Court .
In court Tuesday , Campbell contended denying NBC News the right to modify its criteria would infringe on the company ’s First Amendment rights .
“ Simply because you allege breach of contract does n’t lessen the burden of the First Amendment , ” he said .
He later said abridging First Amendment rights would amount to prior restraint .
“ It ’s clear and it ’s unequivocal … and it ’s also unconstitutional , ” Campbell said .
Kucinich ’s attorney , William McGaha , told the court the contract was “ serious ” and denying the representative the stage tonight “ would be detrimental to voters . ”
“ Is it an important public interest ? ” he asked .
HINSDALE , Illinois ( Reuters ) - A house in this wealthy Chicago suburb is far beyond the reach of most Americans .
Dave Hanna , managing partner of Prudential Preferred CRE , shows off a 6,500 square feet ( 604 square metres ) home in Burr Ridge , a suburb of Hinsdale , Illinois , in this undated photo .
With a picturesque little downtown area and large , expensive houses -- according to the Headrick - Wagner Consulting Group , the average home sale price here in the 12 months to September 30 , 2007 , was around $ 1.15 million --
Hinsdale seems a world away from the housing slowdown that may have brought the U.S. economy to the brink of a recession .
But even here , far from the housing crisis ' epicenter , high earners with good credit may be heading for trouble as their adjustable rate mortgages ( ARMs ) adjust beyond their means , local real estate agents and others say .
In a normal housing market they'd be able to sell , but now they are stuck .

Unfortunately , Hinsdale may also now be too expensive for some of the people who already live here .
“ There is a section of the population here that over - extended themselves to buy here and then keep up the facade of wealth , ” said Sharon Sodikoff , a broker associate at local real estate agency Prudential Homelife Realty .
“ In the next year or so they ’ll be forced out in dribs and drabs . ”

“ The next wave of problems will come from prime borrowers who bought too much house or borrowed too much against it , ” said Michael van Zalingen , director of home ownership services at Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago .
A “ prime ” borrower is one with good credit .
Real estate agents warn that some high - income borrowers have already been forced to sell or leave their homes and more will follow .
Especially those who used their homes as ATMs , withdrawing cash via home equity loans .
“ For those who utilized home equity loans for five to ten years to finance their lifestyle , the chickens are coming home to roost , ” said Chicago - based real estate agent Marki Lemons .
There are also signs some lenders are warily eyeing “ prime ” borrowers .
Tom Kelly , spokesman for Chase Home Lending , a unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co , said the company raised its reserves for possible home equity loan loss for subprime and prime borrowers by $ 635 million in the second and third quarters last year .
“ The concern is people who have borrowed a large percentage of the equity ( in their homes ) , ” Kelly said .
“ Now the value of their homes is falling and they ca n’t refinance . ”
“ Some just stop paying and walk away , ” he added .
SHORT SALE
Getting into property during the boom was easy , with mortgages freely available for no money down .
Then came the subprime crisis and the credit crunch , slowing the market , pushing prices down and home inventories up .
In Hinsdale , for instance , the supply of homes on the market rose to more than 17 months in early October from less than 6 months in January 2006 .
While it ’s apparently a buyers ’ market , Lawrence Yun , chief economist at trade group the National Association of REALTORS , says high - end borrowers are put off by the high interest rates now applied to so - called “ jumbo ” mortgages , those for $ 417,000 or more .
“ Potential buyers say ‘ no way am I buying at that price , ’ ” Yun said .
“ If people ca n’t enter the market , this slows everything down and puts pressure on foreclosures . ”
If some borrowers ca n’t get into the market , there are others who ca n’t sell to get out .
Home owners who bought recently with no money down are the ones most likely to abandon a property when they fall behind on the mortgage .
“ I ’ve seen people who bought less than a year ago and have no equity in their homes simply walking away with no regard for the consequences , ” said Genie Birch , a real estate agent at Chicago - based Koenig & Strey GMAC who covers the city ’s wealthier districts .
Real estate agents say speculative investors who bought to make a profit are also walking away as the rents they charge fall behind the mortgage payments as their adjustable - rate mortgages readjust .
The home owners who find it harder to walk away are those who took out large home equity loans before prices started falling and now owe far more than their home is worth .
“ It ’s difficult for home owners in that situation to sell as they ’ll still be left owing money , ” said Dave Hanna , managing partner of Prudential Preferred CRE , which owns Prudential Homelife Realty in Hindsale .
Unlike subprime borrowers , however , wealthy home owners are more likely to try to cut a deal with their lender , rather than end up in foreclosure .
The alternative solution available to them is to opt for a short sale .
Under a short sale agreement , the borrower sells below the mortgage value and the lender writes off the difference .
The lender gets less than originally anticipated , but is not stuck with a foreclosed property .
The borrower ’s credit rating is damaged , but not as badly as if they had lost the home .
“ You wo n’t see many foreclosed homes here because that would involve public embarrassment , ” Prudential Homelife Realty ’s Sodikoff said .
“ But they will call their realtor and get them to quietly broker a deal to get out of their homes . ”
Waxman to Atty Gen : Stop ignoring my requests for Plame info Nick Juliano

Print This Email This Recently appointed Attorney General Michael Mukasey seems not to be living up to his pledge to remain independent from White House meddling , and he apparently is ignoring a long - standing request for Justice Department documents regarding former CIA operative Valerie Plame 's outing by former Bush administration figures , according to a top congressional Democrat .
House Oversight Committee Chairman Henry Waxman on Tuesday reiterated his previous appeal to Mukasey for documents from Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald 's investigation of the Plame leak .
Waxman said that the attorney general has no reason to obstruct his committee 's investigation , as Mukasey did last week with a congressional inquiry into the destruction of CIA interrogation tapes .
Waxman noted that I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby -- the former aide to Vice President Dick Cheney who was convicted after Fitzgerald 's investigation -- has dropped his appeal , and the Justice Department is not conducting any further investigations .
Therefore , the California Democrat says , Mukasey has no excuse to continue withholding the documents .
" Thus , " he wrote in a letter to Mukasey , " I request that you provide the Committee by January 3 , 2008 , with the documents requested in the Committees July 16 letter to Mr. Fitzgerald , including the reports of interviews with President Bush , Vice President Cheney , and other White House officials . "
Responding to congressional requests for information on the CIA 's destruction of videotapes showing harsh methods being used on waterboarding , Mukasey told lawmakers , essentially : Back off , we 've got this one .
The AG argued that attempts at congressional oversight could inhibit investigations being carried out within the CIA and Department of Justice .
" In the Plame matter , there is no pending Justice Department investigation and no pending Justice Department litigation , " Waxman reminded him .
" Whatever the merits of the position you are taking in the CIA tapes inquiry , those considerations do not apply here . "
Libby was convicted of four felonies -- including obstruction of justice and perjury -- for his role in outing Plame then lying to investigators about how her name came to be funneled to several Washington journalists from within the Bush administration .
President Bush commuted Libby 's 30 - month sentence before the former high - profile White House aide was shipped off to prison , and Libby has decided to stop appealing the conviction .
Waxman 's committee wants to know whether Libby was acting at the president 's or vice president 's behest when he outed Plame , whose name first appeared in a July 2003 Robert Novak column .
The conservative columnist said he received the information from former undersecretary of state Richard Armitage and former White House political adviser Karl Rove .
Several other journalists also said they learned the identity of Plame , whose husband Joseph Wilson was then criticizing the administration 's false pre-war contention that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction .
Libby was the only official convicted of criminal charges , and none were fired from their administration posts as a result of the leak .

For those who have doubts about miracles , a double one occurred today .
An honest National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on Iran ’s nuclear program has been issued , and its “ Key Judgments ” were made public .
With redraft after redraft , it was what the Germans call eine schwere Geburt  a difficult birth , 10 months in gestation .
I do not know how often Vice President Dick Cheney visited CIA headquarters during the gestation period , but I am told he voiced his displeasure as soon as he saw the first sonogram / draft very early this year and is so displeased with what issued that he has refused to be the godfather .
This time Cheney and his neocon colleagues were unable to abort the process .
And after delivery to the press , this child is going to be very hard to explain  the more so since it is legitimate .
The main points of the NIE :
“ We judge that in fall 2003 , Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program
“ We assess with moderate confidence Tehran has not restarted its nuclear weapons program as of mid-2007 .
“ We do not have sufficient intelligence to judge confidently whether Tehran is willing to maintain the halt of its nuclear weapons program indefinitely
“ We judge with moderate confidence Iran probably would be technically capable of producing enough highly enriched uranium sometime during the 2010 - 2015 time frame .
“ We judge with high confidence that Iran will not be technically capable of producing and reprocessing enough plutonium for a weapon before about 2015 . ”
Having reached these conclusions , it is not surprising that the NIE ’s authors make a point of saying up front ( in bold type ) , “ This NIE does not [ italics in original ] assume that Iran intends to acquire nuclear weapons . ”
This , of course , pulls out the rug from under Cheney ’s claim of a “ fairly robust new nuclear program ” in Iran and President Bush ’s inaccurate assertion that Iranian leaders have even admitted they are developing nuclear weapons .
Apparently , intelligence community analysts are no longer required to produce the faith - based intelligence that brought us the Oct. 1 , 2002 , NIE “ Iraq ’s Continuing Program for Weapons of Mass Destruction ”  the worst in the history of U.S. intelligence .
Truth be told , one of the Iran NIE ’s findings was written into its first draft , from which Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell drew in telling the Senate Armed Services Committee on Feb. 27 that Iran could possibly develop a nuclear weapon by early - to - mid - next decade .
McConnell said not a word , though , about Iran ’s having halted its nuclear weapons program in fall 2003 .
And in February , he was still adhering to the faith - based approach , saying , “ We assess that Iran seeks to develop a nuclear weapon . ”
At which point Sen. Lindsay Graham ( R - S.C. ) tried to sum up the proceedings with the disingenuous comment “ We all agree , then , that the Iranians are trying to get nuclear weapons . ”
Curiously , McConnell indicated recently that the key findings of NIEs would no longer be made public .
My guess is that the Pentagon , and especially Adm. William Fallon , commander of our forces in the Middle East , succeeded in persuading McConnell to go public .
Several months ago , Fallon was reliably reported to have said , “ We are not going to do Iran on my watch . ”
And it is an open secret that he and other senior military officers , except those of the Air Force , are strongly opposed to getting into a war with Iran for which the U.S. is so ill prepared .
Will President George W. Bush and our domesticated media succeed in dismissing this latest NIE as “ guesswork , ” as he has in the past ?
It is going to be highly interesting to see how the White House will try to spin this one .

The Bush administration intends to slash counterterrorism funding for police , firefighters and rescue departments across the country by more than half next year -- even as the president increases his pressure on congressional Democrats to approve new money to fund the war in Iraq " without strings and without delay " before leaving for the Christmas holidays -- according to budget documents obtained by The Associated Press .
The Homeland Security Department has given $ 23 billion to states and local communities to fight terrorism since the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington , but the administration is not convinced that the money has been well spent and thinks the nation ’s highest - risk cities have largely satisfied their security needs .
The department wanted to provide $ 3.2 billion to help states and cities protect against terrorist attacks in 2009 , but the White House said it would ask Congress for less than half — $ 1.4 billion , according to a November 26 document .
Bush has been pushing Congress to approve the war funding -- without a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops -- and finish its debate over rules for government eavesdropping within the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
He also wants lawmakers to pass annual government spending bills — but not in " one monstrous piece of legislation " filled with money for special interests .
And he wants Congress to send him legislation that keeps middle - class Americans from being hit by the alternative minimum tax .
" Members [ of Congress ] are coming back [ this week from their Thanksgiving recess ] to a lot of unfinished business , " Bush said Saturday in his weekly radio address .
" The clock will be ticking , because they have only a few weeks to get their work done before leaving again for Christmas . "
[ But the timing of Bush 's 2008 - 09 budget plan , coming amid a mounting clash between the White House and Congress over Iraq war funding , can be interpreted by critics of the war as the president resorting to " budgetary blackmail " -- an unsubtle threat to slash funding for domestic anti-terrorism programs if Congress does n't approve the war money .
[ That , in turn , could trigger a full - scale constitutional confrontation with congressional Democrats over who has the last word on controlling the federal purse -- which Article I of the Constitution gives exclusively to Congress .
[ The president has requested another $ 196 billion to fund the war for the current fiscal year , which began on October 1 .
But Democratic leaders in the House and Senate are taking an increasingly uncompromising hard line , adamantly insisting that any future Iraq war funding must be accompanied by a timetable for a troop withdrawal -- which Bush has vowed he will never accept .
]
The House had passed a $ 50 billion bill that would keep war operations afloat for several more months , but set a goal of bringing most troops home by December 2008 .
After Bush threatened to veto the measure , Senate Republicans blocked it with a filibuster -- which their Democratic counterparts lack the 60 votes required under Senate rules to overturn .
[ Democratic congressional leaders promptly retaliated by refusing to send to Bush any war spending bill this year at all -- sending an unmistakable , if as yet unspoken , message to the White House that they could ultimately invoke Congress ' constitutional power to control the federal purse by cutting off funding for the war altogether .
[ Now , it appears , by proposing to deeply slash funding for domestic anti-terror programs in the next fiscal year 's budget , the president is wielding a new weapon in his determined fight to secure more money for the war . ]
The plan , which must be submitted to Congress by mid-February , calls for the outright elimination of programs for port security , transit security , and local emergency management operations in the next budget year .
This is the president 's final budget , and Bush 's successor would be forced to live with the funding decisions between the time he or she takes office on January 20 , 2009 and the time the 2010 fiscal year begins the following October .
The Homeland Security Department and the White House Office of Management and Budget , which is in charge of the administration ’s spending plans , would not provide details about the funding cuts because nothing has been finalized .
“ It would be premature to speculate on any details that will or will not be a part of the next fiscal year budget , ” OMB spokesman Sean Kevelighan said , because negotiations between the White House and the Cabinet departments over the budget are not finished .
The proposal to drastically cut Homeland Security grants is at odds with some of the administration ’s own policies .
For example , the White House recently promised continued funding for state and regional intelligence “ fusion centers ” — information - sharing centers the administration deems critical to preventing another terrorist attack .
Cutting the grants would limit money available for the centers .
The White House ’s plan to eliminate the port , transit and other grants , which are popular with state and local officials , would not go into effect until next September 30 .
Congress is unlikely to support the cuts and will ultimately decide the fate of the programs and the funding levels when it hashes out the department ’s 2009 budget next year .
The White House routinely seeks to cut the budget requests of federal departments , but the cuts proposed for 2009 Homeland Security grants are far deeper than the norm .
Congress has yet to approve the department ’s 2008 plan .
“ This budget proposal is dead on arrival , ” said Senator Barbara Boxer ( D - California ) .
“ This administration runs around the country scaring people and then when it comes to putting their money where their mouth is , they say ’ sorry , the bank is closed . ” ’
California receives a large share of the counterrorism money each year , and could lose more than $ 200 million under the White House plan .
Boxer was particularly incensed about the proposal to end money for port security — a big concern on the West Coast .
“ California ’s ports carry over 47 percent of all goods imported into the United States , ” she said .
“ A terrorist attack at any of California ’s ports could shut down our nation ’s port system and result in a mind - boggling loss for our nation ’s economy .
” Pentagon officials said that if the additional money for the Iraq war is not approved soon , the military will have to take cost - cutting measures .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates has ordered the Army and Marine Corps to begin planning for a series of expected cutbacks , including civilian layoffs , termination of contracts and reduced operations at bases .
"
The funds include money to carry out combat operations against the enemy in Afghanistan and Iraq , " Bush said .
" They include money to train the Afghan and Iraqi security forces to take on more responsibility for the defense of their countries .
And they include money for intelligence operations to protect our troops on the battlefield .
"
In response , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nevada ) is holding a press conference today ( Monday ) to discuss Democrats ' efforts to change course in Iraq .
" Bush Republicans have indefinitely committed our military to a civil war that has taken a tremendous toll on our troops and our ability to respond to other very real threats around the world , " Reid said on Thursday .
For her part , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - California ) argued that while U.S. troops continue to be killed in Iraq , the Bush administration is not placing enough pressure on the Iraqi government to secure the nation and provide necessary services to its citizens .
"
In January , the president announced the so - called troop `surge ' to give Iraq 's government the `breathing space ' to achieve political reconciliation , " Pelosi said in a statement released Friday .
" Eleven months later , Iraqi politicians have failed by every measure to make the necessary political progress .
" Democrats are committed to a new direction in Iraq that holds the president accountable , provides real support to our men and women in uniform and will bring our troops home safely , honorably and soon .
" Meanwhile , there was at least a sign of a potential breakthrough .
Representative John Murtha ( D - Pennsylvania ) said Thursday that after talking with President Bush 's adviser on the Iraq war , he thinks Congress and the White House might be able to end the showdown on war funding .
After a phone conversation on Wednesday initiated by Lieutenant General Douglas Lute , Murtha said he 's " more optimistic that there 's a possibility now . "
Murtha , chairman of the defense appropriations subcommittee , said one possible area where he thinks Democratic leaders could compromise is on a date to end the war .
He said Democratic leaders want Bush to " sit down and work out a plan with the Congress so that we work this whole thing out .
" Bipartisan opposition to the proposed anti-terror cuts emerged from New York , another state that would be hard hit .
“ To zero out essential Homeland Security programs which have more to do with protecting Americans and fighting the war on terror than much of the money spent in Iraq shows how warped and out of touch this administration ’s priorities are , ” said Senator Charles Schumer ( D - New York ) .
The proposal “ goes totally in the wrong direction , ” said Representative Peter King ( R - New York ) .
“ This would be a very grave mistake , and I will do all I can to stop it . ” [ The plan also drew fire from at least one presidential candidate .
In remarks Sunday to NY1 , the city 's local 24 - hour cable news channel , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - New York ) called the plan " unconscionable , " and vowed that she and other New York leaders will " do everything possible to ensure that our first responders are provided with the funding and resources that are critical to their success on the frontline of our homeland security efforts . ” [ There was no immediate comment from Republican presidential candidate and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani on the proposed cuts .
[ But Giuliani's successor , Mayor Michael Bloomberg , was furious .
" It 's stunning that the federal government would consider cutting New York City 's homeland security funds from the already inadequate level that currently exists , ” the mayor said in a written statement . ]
This is n't the first time that cuts in funding for domestic anti-terror efforts have drawn controversy .
In 2005 , the Bush administration cut by 40 percent the counterterrorism funding to New York and Washington , D.C. , the two cities hit hardest on September 11 .
Then , as now , New York lawmakers vented bipartisan fury -- and the Homeland Security official in charge of the grants program eventually resigned .
Since then , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff has promised to apply more common sense and less “ bean - counting ” in grant decisions .
The White House plan calls for massive cuts in areas where Homeland Security officials had sought increases .
The department requested $ 900 million for grants to U.S. cities at greatest risk of attack .
But the White House only wants to provide $ 400 million for that program , to be divided among no more than 45 urban areas .
Earlier this year , Congress gave New York City $ 134 million — about a third of the total amount the White House would give to the highest risk areas in the country in 2009 .
While very popular in the states and among lawmakers who take credit for getting counterterrorism dollars to their districts , some of the Homeland Security grants have been criticized as wasteful or excessive : $ 345,000 for crashproof barriers and 60 closed - circuit cameras to monitor the University of Arkansas Razorback stadium , which local officials think could be a terrorist target .
$ 5 million for the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology to buy a nearly deserted town to use for counterterrorism training .
$ 70,000 for Huntsville , Ala . to create a fallout shelter in an abandoned mine where 20,000 people could take cover underground .
Several South Florida fire departments have used Homeland Security grants to beef up their gyms .
Pompano Beach , Fla. , spent $ 220,000 on fitness equipment for a wellness program , training and physical exams .
While the White House would eliminate at least seven current Homeland Security grant programs , it would create two new grants : Targeted investment grants , which would fund administration priorities such as the requirement that states create more secure driver ’s licenses , secure credentials for transportation employees and state and local planning for catastrophic disasters .
The White House would provide $ 450 million for that .
A $ 300 million discretionary grant program for terrorism preparedness , prevention and response , which would fund specific projects instead of sending a set amount to each state .
These grants have long been debated in Congress , particularly whether a certain amount should be guaranteed to each state regardless of its risk of being attacked by terrorists .
Rural lawmakers have not wanted the money to be distributed based on risk alone because it would mean their states and districts would see cuts .
In a joint statement , Senators Joseph Lieberman ( I - Connecticut ) , and Susan Collins ( R - Maine ) , the chairman and ranking Republican , respectively , of the Senate Homeland Security Committee , said they “ urge the administration to reconsider this wrong - headed strategy .
” On the intelligence legislation , Bush has been pushing Congress to finish its debate over rules for government eavesdropping within the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and pass an extension of the 1978 law .
Lawmakers hastily changed the FISA law last summer to allow the government to eavesdrop inside the United States without court permission , so long as one end of the conversation was reasonably believed to be located outside the U.S.
The original law required a court order for any surveillance conducted on U.S. soil , to protect Americans ' privacy .
The White House argued that the law was obstructing intelligence gathering because , as technology has changed , a growing amount of foreign communications passes through U.S. - based channels .
" This new law expires on February 1 while the threat from our terrorist enemies does not , " Bush said .
The most contentious issue is whether to shield telecommunications companies from civil lawsuits for allegedly giving the government access to people 's private e-mails and phone calls without a FISA court order between 2001 and 2007 .
[ Civil libertarians have warned lawmakers that granting the companies immunity would violate their customers '
Fourth Amendment guarantee against unreasonable government searches and seizures by allowing the telcos to get away with failing to require the government to obtain court orders to gain access to their customers records .
[ Such a requirement is mandated by the FISA statute and by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1988 , as well as a unanimous 1972 Supreme Court ruling -- backed up by a 1975 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , the nation 's second - highest court -- that the Fourth Amendment itself requires such court warrants . ]
Gravel 's got mad game in new Web vid
Former Alaska Senator and quixotic Democratic candidate Mike Gravel has n't been very visible on the campaign trail lately , as the media virtually ignores his foundering campaign and excludes him from debates .
A newly released Web parody reveals how Gravel may have been spending his time -- fragging opponents in Halo 3 .
The white - haired onetime lawmaker made a cameo in a short episode of Elevator , produced by the online comedy troupe Runaway Box .
In the episode , a character complains about how he was " owned ... all night " by an Xbox Live player with the gamertag " giveemhellGravel . "
Gravel shows up in the elevator where the scene is set and admits his prowess in the popular first - person shooter .
" I had the energy sword , what did he expect ? "
Gravel says , referencing a powerful weapon available to players in Halo 3 .
Gavel 's Xbox gamertag , if real , would look something like this :
Whether the cameo -- which had nearly 10,000 views on YouTube early Friday -- will help Gravel 's campaign remains to be seen , but he 's apparently won at least one convert .
" After watching this , I 'd vote for the guy ! " writes Louis Wu on a Halo fan site .
Gravel 's appearance is n't the first intersection of Halo and politics .
Last month , as RAW STORY reported , a group of college students played 12 - hour Halo marathons for a week to raise money for Republican candidate Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , whose explosive online popularity has translated to impressive fundraising and respectable poll numbers in early primary states .
Gravel enjoyed a similar surge of online support early in his campaign , but his popularity has waned in recent months .
Whether Xbox players become the next sought - after voting bloc remains to be seen .
The following video was posted on YouTube Thursday :
WASHINGTON  A week after American intelligence agencies reported that Iran halted work on a covert nuclear weapons program in 2003 , the Bush administration expressed confidence on Tuesday that it had rallied international support to intensify diplomatic and economic pressure on Iran ’s government .
On a day that Iran ’s president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , called last week ’s assessment “ a step forward , ” President Bush responded by demanding that Iran disclose its weapons program to international inspectors and end its continuing uranium - enrichment program .
Iran has denied it ever had a military program , and has insisted that it is enriching uranium for civilian energy use .
“ We believe Iran had a secret military weapons program , ” Mr. Bush said at the White House .
“ And Iran must explain to the world why they had a program . ”
After a week of conflicting statements , senior administration officials now increasingly express chagrin that last week ’s National Intelligence Estimate , a document representing the consensus views of 16 intelligence agencies , incorrectly focused on the suspension of a secret weapons program and not on the accelerated effort to enrich uranium .
That undercut the administration ’s main rationale for confronting Iran , and left the administration seeking to regain the diplomatic initiative for continued sanctions .
Buenos Aires residents came out on the streets to see the snow
Temperatures plunged to - 22C ( - 8 F ) in parts of Argentina 's province of Rio Negro , while snow fell on Buenos Aires for several hours on Monday .
Two deaths from exposure were reported in Argentina and one in Chile .
In Bolivia , heavy snowfall blocked the nation 's main motorway and forced the closure of several airports .
In Argentina , several provinces in the Andes have been placed under a storm alert , according to the national weather centre .
But thousands of people cheered in the streets of Buenos Aires at the sight of the capital 's first snowfall since 1918 .
" Despite all my years , this is the first time I 've ever seen snow in Buenos Aires , " 82 - year - old Juana Benitez was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency .
Energy strain
In Chile , temperatures dropped to - 18C ( 0 F ) in parts of Araucania region in the south .
Bitterly cold weather in May caused some 20 deaths and forced the Argentine authorities to ration supplies as the country 's energy system came under strain .
Monday 's snowstorm struck on a national holiday in Argentina .
The authorities are watching the demands on the power grid as the country gets back to work on Tuesday .
However , ministers have already appealed to consumers to save energy where they can .
Correspondents say although Argentina 's economy has been growing strongly in recent years , there has not been sufficient investment in infrastructure .
Argentine meteorologists are predicting more cold and even freezing weather over the next few days .
One of Hugh Montgomery 's first patients , when he started working as an intensive - care doctor in 1989 , was a 94 - year - old woman who had suffered a heart attack while ballroom dancing .
" She was a terrific , feisty old dear and we got on really well , " recalls Montgomery .
" But she ended up getting complications and falling unconscious .
It was just a matter of time before she died .
" Every morning when I came into work , I would ask the nurses if she 'd died , and they would say no .
Then the thought crossed my mind that maybe she was hanging on for me .
" So I drew the curtains and said to her : ' I do n't know if you can hear me , but if you 're hanging on for me , you do n't have to . '
She stopped breathing right then .
Maybe it was a coincidence , but I do n't think so . "
Montgomery relates the story because he is convinced that there is such a thing as the will to live and , by extension , a will to die .
" I 've seen this kind of thing happen so much in my work over the years that I do n't believe it is a coincidence . "
He tells the story of a church organist he treated .
" She had a condition which meant she had to be on a drip , but she kept pulling it out .
She told me : ' I do n't want a drip any more . '
I said : ' Your chances of surviving are very low if you do n't keep it . '
But she told me that Jesus was waiting on the other side and was calling her .
She was with her husband and so I said : ' If you 're both comfortable with that , do that .
I can give you pain relief . '
As I got up to go she said : ' Are n't you going to kiss me goodbye ? ' and so I gave her a kiss and left .
Moments later she was dead .
" What I have found again and again is that dying patients hold on for a loved one to arrive - say for a son to get the visa to fly to London and see mother in hospital for one last time .
My father , who was unconscious in hospital for the last couple of days of his life , died at the rare moment when we - my mother , sisters and me - were in the room at the same time . "
Montgomery - a scuba diver , skydiver , high - altitude mountaineer , intensive care doctor , genetics researcher and director of the Institute for Human Health and Performance at University College London - is to give this year 's Royal Institution Christmas science lectures about extraordinary cases of survival .
What is it about certain people , he asks , that enables them to survive starvation , extreme cold , extreme heat or lack of oxygen ?
He suggests that genes , environment and luck all play a part .
All five lectures feature guests who recount their own feats of survival - such as Jamie Andrew , who lost both hands and feet when caught in a five - day storm in the French Alps in 1999 , during which a fellow mountaineer died .
But what Montgomery was not able to tackle in the lectures is the question of the will to live in medical situations .
" I hope at some point to do a book about it because it is important to realise that psychology affects survival .
It 's a fascinating question . "
But it is also a controversial one .
Is Montgomery suggesting that some people who succumb to fatal illnesses may just lack the will to survive ?
" No .
It 's important not to generalise - otherwise you end up insulting the dead and upsetting the bereaved . "
Nor is his suggestion faith - based : " When I talk about the will to live , which very few people do , I 'm not talking about intervention with prayer .
I 'm talking about behavioural psychology .
What I am saying is that one 's mental attitude or emotional state can cause fatal illnesses or help one survive .
There 's a lot of data to suggest this is the case . "
He cites the so - called Whitehall study by Sir Michael Marmot , professor of epidemiology and public health at University College London , which concluded that life expectancy and susceptibility to fatal disease can be influenced by social status .
Marmot surveyed civil servants and found that , of those who suffer coronary heart disease , what was important was n't just diet or whether a person smoked , but sense of status .
" Middle management were in the worst position in terms of stress , because they had low status , " says Montgomery .
" The higher - ranking people were OK because they would say : ' Make it so , ' and walk away .
They did n't have the stress of putting something into practice .
The middle managers did and they were stressed as a result .
" The point is one 's emotional condition - stress - can cause coronary disease .
The St John Ambulance see this a lot - people who have heart attacks at football matches . "
All Montgomery 's examples are to do with coronary disease .
Does he not think that his theory applies to , say , cancer patients too ?
" Well , I think they can certainly exhibit in some circumstances the will to live .
I just do n't work with them as much as with the kind of case I 've mentioned . "
In his lectures , Montgomery focuses on cases of survivors in more dramatic life - or - death situations - fitting , perhaps , for a doctor who is himself familiar with extreme activities .
Montgomery once jumped out of a plane at 14,000 feet with no clothes on , he has twice run a 100 km ultra- marathon , and reportedly holds the world record for underwater piano playing ( 110 hours ) .
He also once stayed awake for eight days in a row at work .
Extreme situations clearly intrigue Montgomery .
He is fascinated by the fact that survivors often mentally rehearse how they would behave in life - or - death situations , and connects such behaviour to his notion of the will to live .
The yachtsman Tony Bullimore , after his yacht capsized in 1997 , managed to survive for five days in the upside - down boat , having lost his food supplies .
" He had , as it were , a survival kit and knew how to use it . "
After his ordeal , Bullimore said he had survived on " a little chocolate , water and sheer determination " .
A high level of mental activity can make the difference between surviving and perishing too , he argues .
Montgomery mentions Edward Brudno , an American pilot who spent seven and a half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam .
During that time , he learned French and mentally designed a dream house down to the last floor joist .
He also composed and memorised a diary of his imprisonment in verse .
When he was released in 1973 , Brudno asked for a tape recorder so he could record the poem .
" It took him 45 minutes ! " says Montgomery .
" He had really kept his mind occupied , which was probably important to his survival . "
Montgomery also talks about Joe Simpson , the mountaineer whose book Touching the Void ( later a film ) detailed his 3,000 ft solo descent from the Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes with a broken leg in 1985 .
" A lot of survivors in these situations survive because they break what they have to do down into little tasks .
If I was told I had to climb the north face of the Eiger to survive , I might just think , ' Forget it .
I can't do it .
I 'll just die . '
Or I might break it down into little tasks , each one of which I would accomplish before moving to the next . "
Montgomery concedes that more work is needed on the notion of the will to live .
" But when you come - as I often do - across two patients who seem to be in a similar condition and have the same strengths and weaknesses , but one dies and one lives , I 'm convinced there is a will to live and that it's important in deciding who survives "

Oh , the fax machines at Grover Norquist 's office are whirring again .
And leave it to Bill O'Reilly to spin their talking points in his ( surprise ! surprise ! )
Talking Points Memo segment .
Naturally , the only people who have problems with waterboardings are the far left , the media ( are n't they one and the same ? ) and some Republicans .
I do n't know about you , but that sounds like a majority of Americans to me .
And the whole Jack Bauer scenario kind of falls apart when you realize that the great information the CIA got from Zubaydeh came a day later than the actual waterboarding ... ticking time bomb indeed .
Do they actually mean to say that there were no other ways -- ones that conformed to basic human rights and the Geneva Conventions -- to obtain that information ?
If so , then that makes the CIA look pretty ineffectual , does n't it ?
So tell me , why is Falafel Man so eager to endorse an act that the majority of Americans are against and that is illegal by both domestic and international standards ?
Does he hate America that much ?

After decades of military dictatorship , the people of Burma are rising – and they need our help .
Marches begun by monks and nuns snowballed , bringing hundreds of thousands to the streets .
Now the crackdown has begun , but the protests are spreading ...
When the Burmese last marched in 1988 , the military massacred thousands .
If the world stands up and supports their struggle , this time they could win .
We 're in a race against time -- targeting the dictatorship 's main backer China in a global advertising campaign , delivering the petition to the UN secretary - general and sending the Burmese our support via radio--
Mozilla COO
John Lilly has revealed statistical data that provides insight into Firefox adoption levels and growth rate .
Based on statistics collected internally by Mozilla from the Firefox application update service , Lilly estimates that Firefox is used by over 125 million people around the world .
Firefox market share statistics often attract the interest of technology enthusiasts and market analysts , but they do n't always paint a clear picture .
Many Firefox market share studies are based on traffic data collected from a broad selection of sites .
Lilly comments that studies of that nature can present skewed results depending on the kinds of sites that are incorporated into the research .
Sites that are geared towards technology enthusiasts and early adopters , for instance , often have a higher percentage of Firefox users .
Lilly also notes that European web sites tend to see more Firefox traffic than sites from the United States , and virtually all of the studies , he argues , undercount browser usage in Asia , South America , and Africa .
" [ T ] here 's no way to really represent the complexity and the dynamism of the global Web — it 's just too big , with too many things changing too rapidly , " says Lilly .
" [ A]ll of these studies are extremely useful and help understand what 's happening around the world .
I 'm just asserting that it 's very important to understand the limits of particular studies and the assumptions that are baked in . "
Lilly also points out that most of the browser market share statistics available from third parties are based mainly on measuring page views rather than users , which he thinks could potentially overstate the extent of Firefox market share .
" [ M] ost of these measures are in page views , not users , " says Lilly in reference to oft - cited third - party browser statistics .
" As hard as it is to get an accurate read on worldwide traffic numbers for Firefox , it 's even harder to figure out the relationship between page views and users .
We have some intuitions here , supported by anecdotal evidence , that Firefox users look at more pages and do more searches than typical users , but nothing that I 'd actually call science . "
Lilly arrives at the 125 million user estimate by leveraging the statistical data collected by the Firefox application update service .
The Firefox web browser sends an anonymous request to the update servers every single day to check for new versions .
Counting the total number of pings makes it possible for Mozilla to guess roughly how many instances of Firefox are running on any given day , a metric that Mozilla refers to as Active Daily Users ( ADU ) .
This number has climbed from 23 million in October 2006 to 48 million at the high point in November , Lilly says .
The ADU number obviously does n't come close to accounting for the total number of Firefox users , but it serves as the basis for the computation .
There are many other factors in play here .
Not every Firefox user is using Firefox every single day .
Proxy usage and corporate firewalls could also potentially be preventing a large number of running Firefox instances from communicating with the update server .
It 's also worth keeping in mind that the vast majority of Linux distributions ship Firefox with the browser 's built - in update mechanism disabled because the browser gets updated by the distribution 's package manager .
This is where Mozilla 's math starts to get fuzzy .
To arrive at the 125 million user estimate , Lilly multiplies the ADU by 3 .
" This is a conservative multiplier ( we think it could be more like 3.5 ) that we 've gotten to by doing some of our own experiments , piecing together data we 've received from sites who have done their own calculations , and then really testing them against the best common sense top - down tests we can , " says Lilly .
One of the tests Lilly describes for evaluating the accuracy of the multiplier is to divide the estimate by the total number of Internet users in the world and see how that compares to standard market share statistics .
Lilly points out that when you divide 125 million by 1.2 billion ( the total number of Internet users as estimated by Internet World Stats ) you get roughly 10.5 percent , which is actually lower than the global market share attributed to Firefox by most third - party studies .
With that in mind , it seems safe to assume that there are at least 125 million Firefox users .
Although I do n't think that Mozilla 's computations based on ADU are significantly more accurate than other browser market share studies , the ADU statistics provide unique insight into several aspects of Firefox usage patterns .
The fact that the ADU has doubled since the release of Firefox 2 is a sure sign that Firefox market share is growing rapidly .
Although Microsoft is making a strong effort to regain market share , we can probably expect to see a surge in favor of Firefox when Firefox 3 is released next year .
Prism
if ( do_name ( ) != ' Home ' ) : ?> endif ?>
Examples : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
The colors algorithm ( workname Prism ) matches a color palette to any given subject .
It retrieves colors for apple ( which would result in soft greens , yellows and reds ) with the same ease as retrieving colors for jealousy ( which would result in bright yellows and sickly greens ) .
Because Prism is a computer program , it makes no difference between both concepts : the two of them are just words it runs through its filters .
It does n't even understand the words .
This works entirely different with humans : humans know apples are green and red , obviously , because we can see them .
More importantly , we have bound apples to countless of well - known associations like Snowwhite and Little - Red- Ridinghood , or nature .
Stupid intelligence
We tend to rule out the less obvious options , like yellow apples .
A computer program has no direct knowledge of Snowwhite , or that the fairytale is related to apples - therefore it tends to think out of the box , examining all possible options with equal interest .
Pink apples have an equal chance of winning than do green apples .
This often results in illogical results , like a pink panther instead of a black panther .
Color theory is however not rocket science , but a connotative process of binding the right colors to all concepts that surround a given subject , not just the object by itself .
Therefore , illogical results are allowed , and can be viewed as creative solutions .
A computer program coming up with a panther being pink is actually picking up on the memes and trying to be creative and witty , which is a positive side - effect .
Google as a commonsense knowledgebase
Prism has no fixed database of words linked to colors , but rather uses the internet as its data mine .
It builds on Google ( using the NodeBox code package with the same name ) and regards the internet as an infinite database of fuzzy and subjective knowledge , filled with information that is very hard to grasp for any computer algorithm .
Prism does n't actually understand what it 's doing when it cross-indexes green to apple on the internet - again , these are just words .
Rather , it puts its trust in the collective effort of millions of people around the world all filling the internet with data .
It is my assumption that any large or infinite system of data tends to evolve to natural order and entropy .
Bluntly stated : there will likely be more webpage texts on the internet that contain the words green and apple close together , than there will be webpages with the words pink and apple close together .
Therefore , humans most likely think of apples being green .
Therefore , Prism assumes that apples must be green .
Language to hsb values
A second problem Prism tackles is the question of exactly what shade of a color to apply .
There is dark green , and there is light green .
For this , Prism has a language to HSB library called Shades that matches formal parameters like dark and bright to hue / saturation / brightness color values .
Blooming diagrams
The prism codeset has two visualisation modes : one fancy ( see above ) and one useful .
The fancy one blooms like flowers , the useful one simply dumps a color palette .

A revolution in the way organs are donated for transplant is called for today by the government 's chief medical officer as concern grows over the acute shortage of donors and the rise in unnecessary deaths .
An expert report to be published this week says that every major hospital in Britain must have an organ donor specialist skilled in persuading grieving families that the hearts , lungs , kidneys and other vital organs of their deceased relatives should be used to save the lives of others .
Sir Liam Donaldson , England 's chief medical officer , will back the findings of the government 's taskforce on organ donation , but wants to go further and introduce a new system of donation because the shortage of organs is so severe .
Three people a day are dying while on the waiting list for a transplant as the demand for a new organ is rapidly outstripping their supply .
Donaldson is advocating a system of ' presumed consent ' , where everyone in Britain would be presumed to be a donor unless they had specifically opted out , or unless their families had objections .
' We have one of the lowest rates [ of organ donation ] in Europe , far lower than Spain , ' he told The Observer .
' We have one thousand or more patients dying on the waiting list each year , and there is a lot of suppressed demand , with doctors not even referring patients on to the list because there is no hope for them .
That is a lot of patients dying .
' I think at the moment people often do n't know whether their relative would have wanted to be a donor .
Families are being approached when they are in a very distressed condition and , faced with uncertainty , their default position is to refuse consent .
Often the quality of their dealing with clinical staff is not as good as it should be - the dialogue could be better .
It does require considerable skill to handle such sensitive situations . '
Today we reveal the heartbreak of those who are waiting for organs and the uplifting stories of families who have consented to donate , and launch a campaign for the UK to move to the new system of presumed consent so that hundreds more lives can be saved .
The taskforce , set up by Health Secretary Alan Johnson to look at how to improve donation rates , is now considering the proposals for presumed consent .
Their report out this week will say that the first step must be for the NHS to provide highly skilled organ co-ordinators who would be able to talk with sensitivity to relatives at the bedside of their loved ones .
They believe that there could be a 50 per cent increase in donated organs if hospitals became better at dealing with the highly sensitive conversations that take place when a patient has been confirmed braindead .
At present , around one - third of families refuse to give consent for organ retrieval , and even when a patient carries a donor card , many families still refuse .
Last night the Prime Minister threw his weight behind the campaign to change the system .
He said : ' I fully support the campaign The Observer has launched on this issue . '
And in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph , Gordon Brown said : ' A system of this kind seems to have the potential to close the aching gap between the potential benefits of transplant surgery in the UK and the limits imposed by our current system of consent . '
Ministers will embark shortly on a review of the existing system , but want a nationwide debate on the issue .
But patients ' groups made it clear that they did not want to see too much political interference in the matter .
Katherine Murphy , of the Patients ' Association , said : ' We do n't think a private decision , which is a matter of individual conscience , should be taken by the state .
If people want to give the gift of life , that is their right , but it must be something that is a voluntary matter . '
Under the opt - out system , doctors would automatically have the right to take organs from patients unless the patient had registered their refusal during their lifetime , and as long as the family were in agreement .
There are 9,600 people waiting for an organ , but last year only 3,100 operations were carried out .
Some people are flying abroad to have kidney transplants , but this leaves them at risk of picking up infections .
The report will call for a UK - wide organ donation body to be placed within the NHS .
The body would manage a new group of more than 250 transplant co-ordinators who would be given a much bigger role in talking to relatives at an early stage , explaining the clinical guidelines and addressing their fears .
Once the relatives had agreed that the patient 's organs could be taken , the co-ordinator would oversee all the arrangements .
The taskforce , headed by Elisabeth Buggins , chairwoman of the Birmingham strategic health authority , will also recommend that specialist ' retrieval teams ' should be run by the new agency .
They would be sent out to ' harvest ' organs from a patient , rather than relying on local teams .
Donaldson does acknowledge that some people will never want their organs , or their relatives ' organs , to be given .
He said if they moved to the new presumed consent system ' it would be made clear that they have an inalienable right to opt out . '

An experimental drug that attacks cancer in an entirely new way has shown promise in treating advanced melanoma , delaying progression of the disease and prolonging the lives of patients .
New research presented September 26 at the European Cancer Conference in Barcelona found that giving the new drug in addition to chemotherapy more than doubled the amount of time patients survived without progression of their cancer .
The study , according to Dr Anthony Williams , vice president of clinical research at Synta Pharmaceuticals Corp. in Lexington , Massachusetts , USA , included 81 patients with metastatic melanoma .
Of those , 28 received treatment with the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel alone and 53 received paclitaxel plus the new drug , STA - 4783 .
“ The median progression free survival was 1.8 months in the group who got chemotherapy alone , but 3.7 months in the group who got the combination , ” Williams said .
“ This doubling in progression free survival is impressive for this cancer , and the result was achieved without substantial additional toxicity . ”
He added : “ Progression - free survival was linked to improvements in overall survival .
Patients on the experimental combination survived on average for 12 months after being diagnosed , while those getting only paclitaxel survived on average 7.8 months .
This is the first time an improvement in survival has been seen in a randomised , double - blind , multi- centre controlled trial for metastatic melanoma . ”
The drug is the first in a new class called oxidative stress inducers .
It works by increasing the amount of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide , in cells .
When the level exceeds the antioxidant capacity of cells , the cells are in a state of oxidative stress .
All cells have some low level of ROS , but cancer cells naturally operate with a higher level of ROS and oxidative stress relative to normal cells .
However , too much oxidative stress for too long results in cell death .
STA - 4783 kills only tumour cells because the additional stress introduced pushes cancer cells , but not healthy cells , over the critical threshold .
Melanoma is one of several cancer types that are known to operate at a higher level of oxidative stress .
The concept of cancer cells operating at a higher level of oxidative stress than normal cells has been around for many years .
However , it is only recently becoming a greater focus of attention in the oncology field .
Metastatic melanoma , where the skin cancer has spread to other parts of the body , is difficult to treat .
Current therapies either have limited power or are highly toxic .
The average survival of patients diagnosed with advanced melanoma is about six months .
The study also indicated that STA - 4783 might boost the efficiency of chemotherapy drugs that induce cell death , or apoptosis , because it appears to lower the hurdle for activating that process , Williams said .
“ These results are encouraging not only because of the findings in themselves but also because there are so few treatment options for patients .
We believe STA - 4783 has the potential to improve survival with a manageable side effect profile , ” he said .
“ We also believe there is nothing unique about metastatic melanoma and that oxidative stress has the potential to be an entirely new class of cancer treatment that could have applications in other types of cancer , ” Williams added .
A larger study of STA - 4783 in melanoma patients across Europe is now under way to further investigate the drug ’s potential .
Synta , the drug ’s developer , funded the study presented at ECCO .
Microsoft 's popular Xbox 360 game console can create a strong and strange signal on wireless LANs , according to IT staff at Morrisville State College .
It 's not clear whether the signal disrupts the college 's WLAN access points or students ' wireless notebooks .
There is some anecdotal evidence , however , that it at least affects other radios in the same 2.4GHz band .
Morrisville IT staff typically use Bluetooth headsets , which run in the 2.4GHz band , with their cell phones when they troubleshoot problems on the spacious campus .
" We had problems syncing our headsets to our phone where this signal was strong , " says Matt Barber , the college 's network administrator .
A phone user had to physically touch the headset to the cell phone to make the initial connection , he says .
There may be effects on the WLAN that the equipment itself , from Meru Networks , is circumventing , according to Barber .
Part of Meru's WLAN architecture employs software that gives the access points more control over wireless - client transmission behavior than does the software of some of Meru 's rivals .
An access point near a radiating Xbox may be compensating for interference by in effect guiding a wireless laptop to send and receive when open spectrum is available , essentially dodging around the Xbox signal .
Working with Meru , the small IT staff is planning to test soon the effect of multiple Xbox consoles in a dorm with a large number of active notebook clients .
Network World has asked Microsoft to comment on the Xbox signal phenomenon , but the company was not able to reply before this story was posted .
We 'll update this report as soon Microsoft provides information .
The latest version of the Xbox , the Xbox 360 Elite , went on sale earlier this year with a 120G - byte hard disk and a high - definition video interface .
Morrisville is a small college in rural New York state , taking its name from a nearby town .
In summer 2007 , the college deployed a campuswide 802.11a/b/g WLAN based on equipment from Meru . .
The plan was to replace those access points with Meru 's new , two - radio devices that added support for Draft 2 of 802.11n , the IEEE standard that boosts throughput from 22 M to 25 M bps to at least 150 M to180 Mbps .
That replacement was just completed , creating the first large - scale deployment .
During the fall , Morrisville IT staff , working with Meru engineers and IBM , the network integrator , detected an unusual signal in the 2.4GHz band .
" We wanted to look at the [ radio frequency ] environment in our dorms , " Barber says .
" We always thought we 'd run into some strange stuff [ there ] in the 2.4 range . "
The signal was discovered using Cognio Spectrum Expert , from Cognio ( recently bought by Cisco ) .
Spectrum Expert is RF - analysis software packaged with a WLAN adapter card that slots into any laptop PC .
( See our April 2007 Clear Choice Test of four WLAN protocol analyzers . )
Among other capabilities , Spectrum Expert identifies sources of radio energy in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz WLAN bands , and identifies the cause , such as a brand of access point or a microwave oven .
" The signal really stood out , " Barber says .
" In some places it was so strong we thought it might be affecting the air [ that is , the radio environment ] around it . "
The Cognio software , however , was baffled by this new signal : " Unknown emitter " was the classification .
The signal shows up in the Cognio display as a kind of green - blizzard effect , covering a large swath of the 2.4 band , Barber says .
That means the signal " is jumping all over the spectrum band , " he says .
In contrast , a nearby Meru access point shows up in the same scan as a strong , stable yellow - red glow , almost like a sun .
The green blizzard is shot through with red dashes , which show , Barber says , that the signal at moments nearly rivals the access point in strength .
The mystery signal baffled the IT staff and Meru until Barber had a brainstorm :
He brought in his own Xbox 360 and plugged it in , and turned on the Cognio spectrum analyzer .
Presto :
The same signal appeared .
Barber says the signal seems be created by the console 's embedded 2.4GHz radio , which is used to communicate with the handheld wireless controller -- the gizmo with the buttons that manipulate a game running on the console .
The Xbox also takes an optional Wi -Fi adapter , in the form of an USB dongle , to connect to a WLAN access point .
Barber says his " best guess " at this point is that the embedded radio , not the USB adapter , causes the signal .
The signal is created even if the Xbox console is shut off : Just plugging its AC adapter into an electrical outlet seems to trigger the radio to look for -- and keep looking for -- a companion wireless controller .
" It 's even worse when you have multiple Xboxes in an area , " Barber says .
At one point , IT staff wrapped the console in a static discharge bag , the material used , for example , to wrap and protect consumer electronics gear from static damage during shipment .
The same properties make it act like radio " blanket " to muffle a transmission .
Sure enough , the Cognio software showed a significant drop in the Xbox signal 's strength .
The next step is more systematic testing .
" We want to get several consoles together with a bunch of WLAN clients , to create a busy [ RF ] environment , and do some measurements , " Barber says .
" Are we seeing frames being dropped in the air , or people getting disconnected ? "
Answering that question may be a bit more urgent , with Christmas looming , and the likelihood of still more brand - new Xboxs and other wireless entertainment products turning up in January when students return .
This story , " Strange Xbox Signal Suspected of Jamming Wireless LANs " was originally published by Network World .
The National Motorists Association and its members know that engineering solutions are the real way to prevent red-light violations and accidents at problematic intersections .
In fact , we are willing to wager $ 10,000 to prove that engineering will work better than ticket cameras .
The revenue from ticket cameras serves as a reward to cities that fail to make motorists safer through proper signal timing , better signal design , and improved intersections .
This is an engineering problem , not an enforcement issue .
Today we say to the communities that employ ticket cameras , “ Let ’s put traffic engineering solutions to the test . ”
Here ’s our challenge :
Show us any camera - equipped intersection that still has high numbers of red - light violations and we will guarantee a minimum 50 - percent reduction in red - light violations through the application of engineering solutions .
If our recommendations fail to meet our minimum goal , we will pay the community $ 10,000 to be used on any traffic safety program or project it chooses .
However , if we succeed , the community must employ our engineering - based recommendations at other troublesome intersections and scrap its ticket - camera program .
What do you have to lose , other than your ticket - camera revenue ?
If you have any questions about this challenge or you believe your community would be interested in participating , please contact the NMA at ( 608 ) 849-6000 or via email at [ email protected ] .
New BitTorrent sites are launched every day , but only a few stand out or have something new to offer .
You Torrent is such a new site ; feature - wise it 's just a meta - search engine , but the design and user interface make it one of the best I 've seen .
YouTorrent is “ the world ’s first real - time torrent comparison search engine ” according to the site itself .
The site is a meta search engine , which means that it does n’t host any torrent files itself .
It currently searches 12 sources ; Mininova , The Pirate Bay , IsoHunt , MyBittorrent , NewTorrents , SuprNova , Monova , Vuze , BitTorrent , LegitTorrents , SeedPeer and BTjunkie .
This list of BitTorrent sites is not extensive , but it covers the three most popular torrent sites .
A search for the recently released second part of Steal This Film returns quite a few results which are presented in a clean way .
By default the results are ordered by popularity ( seeds / peers ) , but they can be further sorted by date , size , and search engine .
If you ca n’t find what you were looking for you have the option to check for related and popular searches in the sidebar .
At the moment the site has no ads and is pretty fast , but that might change in the future .
Overall , for people who like meta search engines , I think that YouTorrent is worth a visit .
More useful BitTorrent sites can be found in our roundup of the 10 most popular BitTorrent sites of 2007 .
Do you know any other BitTorrent sites with some innovative features that we have n’t covered yet here at TorrentFreak ?

The midday sun beats down on a phalanx of riot police facing thousands of jeering demonstrators , angry at proposals to put up their water bills by more than a third .
Moments later a uniformed officer astride a horse shouts an order and the police charge down the street to embark on a club - wielding melee that leaves dozens of bloodied protesters with broken limbs .
A film clip from the latest offering from Hollywood ?
Unfortunately not .
It 's a description of a real - life event in Cochabamba , Bolivia 's third largest city , where a subsidiary of Bechtel , the US engineering giant , took over the municipal water utility and increased bills to a level that the poorest could not afford .
Welcome to a new world , where war and civil strife loom in the wake of chronic water shortages caused by rising population , drought ( exacerbated by global warming ) and increased demand from the newly affluent middle classes in the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America .
At a City briefing by an international bank last week , a senior executive said : ' Today everyone is talking about global warming , but my prediction is that in two years water will move to the top of the geopolitical agenda . '
The question for countries as far apart as China and Argentina is whether to unleash market forces by allowing access to private European and American multinationals that have the technological know - how to help bring water to the masses - but at a price that many may be unable , or unwilling , to pay .
As Cochabamba illustrates , water is an explosive issue in developing countries , where people have traditionally received supplies for free from local wells and rivers .
But in the past 15 years rapid industrialisation , especially in places such as China , has led to widespread pollution and degradation of the local environment .
A report out today from accountancy giant Deloitte & Touche says humans seem to have a peculiar talent for making previously abundant resources scarce : ' this is especially the case with water , ' it observes .
According to the firm 's findings , more than 1 billion people will lack access to clean water by next year .
Paul Lee , research director at Deloitte , and one of the authors of the report , says : ' Demand for water is expected to be driven by economic growth and population increases .
India 's demand for water is expected to exceed supply by 2020 . '
The World Wildlife Fund has forecast that in the Himalayas , the retreat of glaciers could reduce summer water flows by up to two - thirds .
In the Ganges area , this would cause a water shortage for 500 million people .
Lee says : ' The lack of the most important form of liquid in the world is therefore a fundamental issue and one that the technology sector can play a major role in addressing . '
He and others , including the World Bank , believe that private industry can - sometimes - solve problems by taking water out of government hands and removing subsidies .
If water becomes more expensive , so this argument goes , people are more reluctant to waste it , although Taylor agrees that government needs to make certain that the poorest sections of society are protected , and that there is ' proper [ price ] regulation ' .
By allowing prices to rise to help meet the cost of supply , companies could upgrade infrastructure and , in many cases , build new systems from scratch .
Even in Britain it is recognised that efficiency is vital to avoid leaks .
In the developing world , leakage can account for the loss of up to 50 per cent of all clean water supplies in major cities .
But protecting the poor is not always easy .
Take the example of desalination .
Although it offers a solution for countries where demand exceeds supply , the technological process uses a huge amount of energy , making it ' too expensive for many African and Asian countries ' , says Lee .
Max Lawson , senior policy adviser for Oxfam , says : ' We are sceptical that private - sector involvement is the solution for very poor countries .
In fact , there is an argument that much greater public sector involvement and cash is needed to channel supplies to where they are most needed . '
But Abel Mejia at the World Bank in Washington says the organisation does not favour one form of investment over the other : ' We lend to private companies and governments , but we are not ideologically motivated .
Solutions may need a mix of private and public money . '
The World Development Movement lobby group has in the past criticised the World Bank 's enthusiasm for private firms controlling water projects ; it prefers public - private partnerships , run on a not - for - profit basis .
But it is in China - the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gas - that the water problem is most pronounced , as fears grow that the country is turning into an ecological disaster area .
The head of the country 's national development agency said recently that a quarter of the length of China 's seven main rivers was so poisoned that the water was harmful to the skin .
Moreover , water - related issues are sparking popular protests after the sanctioning of dams and irrigation projects that have displaced hundreds of thousands of people who have no recourse to compensation .
Beijing has passed legislation to punish companies that pollute supplies but , in China , such laws can be difficult to enforce .
So pressing are issues surrounding water that China has invited Western companies to run systems in many towns and cities .
One of the biggest is French - owned Veolia , once part of the Vivendi utilities empire .
In parts of China , water provided by Veolia no longer has to be boiled , but the cost to consumers has doubled .
For the middle class , the price is still relatively low - but most Chinese are not middle class .
Many say up to half their income is now being swallowed by water bills .
That leaves Beijing between a rock and a hard place because , like many emerging economies , it desperately needs Western know - how and technology to solve its water problems , but it is anxious to avoid the kind of civil unrest that the Bolivian government experienced in Cochabamba .
In the City of London , there is a growing realisation that investing in water technology companies offers opportunities for savvy shareholders , and possibly for ethical investors .
' There is also an appetite from institutions for water - related investments - they know it 's going to be big , ' says Julian Sevaux , managing partner at Stanhope Capital .
Olivia Bowen , an independent financial adviser at the Gaeia Partnership , says : ' New climate change funds have recently come to market ; some are well established , such as Impax 's Environmental Markets Fund . '
GE and Dow Chemical are among big US companies diversifying into water services , while the UK - based Thames Water is expanding overseas .
But the crux of the problem remains : according to a report from Credit Suisse , annual world water use has risen sixfold during the past century , more than double the rate of population growth .
By 2025 , almost two - thirds of the global population will live in countries where water will be a scarce commodity .
And that could lead to conflict , as United Nations secretary - general Ban Ki-moon warned last week .
Asia looks vulnerable , with China planning to syphon off Tibet 's water supply to make up for shortages in the parched north .
Elsewhere , the Israel - Palestine conflict is at least partly about securing supplies from the River Jordan ; similarly , water is a major feature of the strife in Sudan that has left Darfur devastated .
When it comes to this most basic of commodities , the stakes could hardly be higher .
THE Netherlands , Denmark , Norway and Sweden have the most effective policies to help poor countries , according to an annual report by the Center for Global Development , a think - tank .
The report grades 21 rich countries on how well they support development .
Each is assessed on seven areas including aid , trade , migration and the environment .
Denmark and Sweden rank highest on aid - giving .
Australia , Canada and America give less but are more open to trade with poor nations .
Austria and Switzerland are the most accessible to migrants from the developing world .
Greece and Japan languish at the bottom of the overall index .

MODERN biology has a lot of “ omes ” .
The genome — all the genes that go to make up an organism — is a familiar idea .
The proteome — all the different proteins — is becoming so .
But there are also the transcriptome ( RNA ) , the glycome ( sugars ) , the lipidome ( fats ) and the metabolome ( all the miscellaneous odds and ends not covered by the others ) .
And then there is the bibliome — all the mentions in research papers of known biomolecules .
There are now so many of these papers , and the databases linking them are so good , that it is possible to use scientific methods to investigate the bibliome in its own right , just as any of the other , wetter “ omes ” may be investigated .
Which is exactly what a group of researchers from Peking University , led by Wei Liping , have done to get at the biochemical heart of drug addiction .
Dr Wei and her colleagues wanted to answer three questions .
First , what are the genes and biochemical pathways in addiction ?
Second , does addiction to different substances involve the same core biochemical mechanisms ?
Third , does anything in those mechanisms explain why addiction is so hard to shake off ?
Many people , of course , have asked these questions before , and partial answers have emerged .
What Dr Wei hoped to do was to take these fragmentary answers and patch them together to make something approaching the whole truth .
And , in a paper just published in the Public Library of Science , she seems to have managed just that .
It looks good on paper
Dr Wei 's group looked at more than 1,000 studies of the biochemistry and genetics of drug addiction .
They were interested in the four sorts of drug reckoned most addictive : alcohol , cocaine , nicotine and opiates ( heroin , methadone and so on ) .
About 1,500 genes were implicated by one or more of the studies , but in only 396 cases was that implication backed by at least two independent lines of evidence .
It was on these confirmed cases that Dr Wei concentrated her fire .
Biochemistry is about pathways and networks of pathways .
A pathway is a series of enzymes ( each of which is encoded in a gene ) that perform a task in sequence , like workers on an assembly line .
Dr Wei therefore ran her 396 genes through a database of all known pathways to see which involved several enzymes encoded by those genes .
She found 18 that were involved in addiction to at least one type of drug .
Five , however , were common to all four types , and these five pathways therefore look as though they are at the core of the process of addiction .
Three of the five were already under suspicion .
Dr Wei 's result provided strong statistical evidence to back up what had just been hunches .
Two other pathways , however , had not previously been considered as being involved in addiction .
The existence of these five central pathways helps explain a lot about addiction .
First , it gives weight to the belief that some people are more susceptible to all sorts of addiction than others are .
That contrasts with the thought that addictions are substance - by - substance phenomena , though the two ideas are not mutually exclusive since changes in the 13 substance - specific pathways clearly also result in addiction .
Second , the particular pathways involved help to explain why addiction is so hard to reverse .
Several of them take part in strengthening the connections between nerve cells , which is the underlying basis of learning .
Unlearning something by breaking these connections is hard .
Third , Dr Wei was able to link the five central pathways together into a network , and show that this network has four positive - feedback loops in it .
Work on other species in other contexts suggests that the mixture of loops she found was one that often results in rapid and irreversible biological processes — which is exactly what is seen in addiction .
None of this , of course , directly helps the addict , though it reinforces the message that it is better not to start taking these drugs in the first place .
But working out how the addiction machine operates may point those looking for therapies in the right direction .
And this study also shows that the old cry “ more research is necessary ” is not always true .
Sometimes all you need to do is look at what you already have in a different way .

See if you can spot anything wrong with the following claim , a version of which seems to appear in a book , magazine , or newspaper every few weeks for as long as I 've been reading public commentary on economic matters :
The dominant idea guiding economic policy in the United States and much of the globe has been that the market is unfailingly wise … .
But lately , a striking unease with market forces has entered the conversation .
The world confronts problems of staggering complexity and consequence , from a shortage of credit following the mortgage meltdown , to the threat of global warming .
Regulation … is suddenly being demanded from unexpected places .
Now , a paragraph like this one printed in the New York Times opinion section on December 30 , 2007 — an article called " The Free Market : A False Idol After All ? " — makes anyone versed in economic history crazy with frustration .
Just about every word is misleading in several ways , and yet some version of this scenario appears as the basis of vast amounts of punditry .
The argument goes like this :
Until now we 've lived in a world of laissez - faire capitalism , with government and policy intellectuals convinced that the market should rule no matter what .
Recent events , however , have underscored the limitations of this dog - eat - dog system , and reveal that simplistic ideology is no match for a complex world .
Therefore , government , responding to public demand that something be done , has cautiously decided to reign in greed , force us all to grow up , and see the need for a mixed economy .
All three claims are wrong .
We live in the 100th year of a heavily regulated economy ; and even 50 years before that , the government was strongly involved in regulating trade .
The planning apparatus established for World War I set wages and prices , monopolized monetary policy in the Federal Reserve , presumed first ownership over all earnings through the income tax , presumed to know how vertically and horizontally integrated businesses ought to be , and prohibited the creation of intergenerational dynasties through the death tax .
That planning apparatus did not disappear but lay dormant temporarily , awaiting FDR , who turned that machinery to all - around planning during the 1930s , the upshot of which was to delay recovery from the 1929 crash until after the war .
Just how draconian the intervention is ebbs and flows from decade to decade , but the reality of the long - term trend is undeniable : more taxes , more regulation , more bureaucracies , more regimentation , more public ownership , and ever less autonomy for private decision - making .
The federal budget is nearly $ 3 trillion per year , which is three times what it was in Reagan 's second term .
Just since Bush has been in office , federal intervention in every area of our lives has exploded , from the nationalization of airline security to the heavy regulation of the medical sector to the centralized control of education .
With " free markets " like this , who needs socialism ?
So , the first assumption that we live in a free - market world is simply not true .
In fact , it is sheer fantasy .
How is it that journalists can continually get away with asserting that the fantasy is true ?
How can informed writers continue to fob off on us the idea that we live in a laissez - faire world that can only be improved by just a bit of public tinkering ?
The reason is that most of our daily experience in life is not with the Department of Labor or Interior or Education or Justice .
It is with Home Depot , McDonald 's , Kroger , and Pizza Hut .
Our lives are spent dealing with the commercial sector mostly , because it is visible and accessible , whereas the depredations of the state are mostly abstract , and its destructive effects mostly unseen .
We do n't see the inventions left on the shelf , the products not imported due to quotas , the people not working because of minimum wage laws , etc .
Because of this , we are tempted to believe the unbelievable , namely that government serves the function only of a night watchman .
And only by believing in such a fantasy can we possibly believe the second assumption , which is that the problems of our society are due the to the market economy , not to the government that has intervened in the market economy .
Consider the housing crisis .
The money machine called the Federal Reserve cranks out the credit as a subsidy to the banking business , the bond dealers , and the big - spending politicians who would prefer to borrow than tax .
It is this alchemic temple that distorts the reality that credit must be rationed in a way that accords with economic reality .
The Federal Reserve embarked on a wild credit ride in the late 1990s that has dumped some $ 4 trillion in new money via the credit markets , making expansion of the loan sector both inevitable and unsustainable .
At the same time , the federal bureaus that manage and guarantee the bulk of mortgages have ballooned beyond belief .
The popularity of subprime mortgages are the tip of a massive but buried debt mountain — all in the name of achieving the " American dream " of home ownership through massive government intervention .
Say what you want to about this system , but it is not the free market at work .
Indeed , the very existence of central banking is contrary to the capitalist ideal , in which money would be no different from any other good : produced and supplied by the market in accord with the moral law against theft and fraud .
For the government to authorize a counterfeiter - in - chief is a direct attack on the sound money system of a market economy .
Let 's move to the third assumption that government intervention can solve social and economic problems , with global warming at the top of the heap .
Let 's say that we remain agnostic on the question of whether there is global warming and what the cause really is ( there is no settled answer to either issue , despite what you hear ) .
The very idea that putting the government in charge of changing the weather of the next 100 years is another notion from fantasy land .
The point about complexity counts against government intervention , not for it .
The major contribution of F.A.
Hayek to social theory is to point out that the social order — which extends to the whole of the world — is far too complicated to be managed by bureaus , but rather depends on the decentralized knowledge and decisions of billions of market actors .
In other words , he gave new credibility to the insight of the classical liberals that the social order is self - managing and can only be distorted by attempts to centrally plan .
Planning , ironically , leads to social chaos .
You do n't have to be a social scientist to understand this .
Anyone who has experience with public - sector bureaucracies knows that they cannot do anything as well as markets , and however imperfect free markets are , they are vastly more efficient and humane in the long run than the public sector .
That is because free markets trust the idea of freedom generally , whereas other systems imagine that the men in charge are as omniscient as gods .
In one respect , the New York Times is right : there is always a demand for economic intervention .
The government never minds having more power , and is always prepared to paper over the problems it creates .
An economy not bludgeoned by powerful elites is the ideal we should seek , even if it has a name that is wildly unpopular : capitalism .
Europe is Europe 's last remaining realistic political utopia .
But Europe remains to be understood and conceptualised .
This historically unique form of international community cannot be explained in terms of the traditional concepts of politics and the state , which remain trapped in the straitjacket of methodological nationalism .
If we are to understand cosmopolitan Europe , we must radically rethink the conventional categories of social and political analysis .
Just as the Peace of Westphalia brought the religious civil wars of the 17th century to an end through the separation of church and state , so too the separation of state and nation represents the appropriate response to the horrors of the 20th century .
And just as the secular state makes the exercise of different religions possible , so too must cosmopolitan Europe guarantee the coexistence of different ethnic , religious and political forms of life across national borders based on the principle of cosmopolitan tolerance .
The question has often been asked : if Britain is so discontented , why does n't it resign from the EU ?
Because Britain follows its own national interests .
Imagine for a moment that Britain acted on its anti-European rhetoric and turned its back on the EU .
What would happen ?
Europe would be relieved .
And Britain would be a lost island in the rising sea .
So the Eurosceptics in Britain and elsewhere have got it entirely the wrong way round .
They are trapped in the contradictions arising from EU member nations misunderstanding their place in the world .
Cosmopolitan Europe was consciously conceived and launched after the second world war as the political antithesis to a nationalistic Europe and the physical and moral devastation that had emerged from it .
It was in this spirit that Winston Churchill , standing amid the ruins of a destroyed continent in 1946 , claimed : " If Europe were once united ... there would be no limit to the happiness , to the prosperity and the glory which its four hundred million people would enjoy . "
The founding set of documents of European cosmopolitanism , written when the war was still all too fresh in the mind , were those of the Nuremberg trials .
The court created both legal categories and a trial procedure that went far beyond the sovereignty of the nation state .
What was being introduced here was not new laws , or a even a new legal principle , but rather a new legal logic that broke with the previous nation - state logic of international law .
The concept of crimes against humanity is an revolutionary one .
Here is its definition in article 6 c : " Crimes against humanity : namely , murder , extermination , enslavement , deportation and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population , before or during the war ; or persecutions on political , racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the tribunal , whether or not in violation of domestic law of the country where perpetrated . "
The first key formulation is " before and during the war " .
This is what distinguishes crimes against humanity from war crimes : there may be no war .
And the second is that such crimes exist " whether or not in violation of domestic law of the country where perpetrated " .
These enormous breaks with nationally based legal concepts were necessary because the persecution of the Jews was legal according to the laws of Nazi Germany , and happened before the war took place .
But taken together , the two formulations change everything .
They posit an individual responsibility for all perpetrators that is based outside the national legal context , in the community of nations .
So if the state is a criminal one , the individual who serves it must still reckon with being charged and sentenced for his or her deeds before an international court of law .
The traditions from which colonial , nationalist and genocidal horror originated were clearly European .
But so were the new legal standards against which these acts were condemned and convicted in the spotlight of world publicity .
At this formative moment in its history , Europe mobilised its traditions to produce something historically new .
It took the idea of recognition of the humanity of the Other and made it the foundation of a historically new counter - logic .
It specifically designed this logic to counteract the ethnic perversion of the European tradition to which the nation - based form of European modernity had just shown itself so horribly liable .
It was an attempt to distil a European antidote to Europe .
National categories of thought make the thought of Europe impossible .
The national point of view sees two ways and two ways only of reading contemporary European politics and integration .
It sees it either as federalism , leading to a federal super - state , or as inter - governmentalism , leading to a federation of states .
Both models are empirically inadequate .
They fail to grasp essential things both about present - day Europe and about the nations that make it up .
But they are also , in a deep - structural sense , anti-European .
They deny the goal most worth attaining : a Europe of diversity , a Europe that helps diversity to flourish .
Both the federation of states and the federal super - state describe the same zero - sum game from different angles .
Either there is one single state of Europe ( federalism ) , in which case there are no national member states ; or else the national member states remain Europe 's rulers , in which case there is no Europe ( inter - governmentalism ) .
Within this framework of thought , whatever Europe gains , the individual nations lose .
And this is true whether one is for a given option or against it .
Caught up in the false alternatives of the national gaze , we are given the choice between no Europe or no Europe .
The decline of the nation - state is really a decline of the specifically national content of the state and an opportunity to create a cosmopolitan state system that is better able to deal with the problems that all nations face in the world today .
Economic globalisation , transnational terrorism , global warming : the litany is familiar and daunting .
There are a host of problems that are clearly beyond the power of the old order of nation - states to cope with .
The answer to global problems that are gathering ominously all around and that refuse to yield to nation - state solutions is for politics to take a quantum leap from the nation - state system to the cosmopolitan state system .
Politics needs to regain credibility in order to craft real solutions .
More than anywhere else in the world , Europe shows that this step is possible .
Europe teaches the modern world that the political evolution of states and state systems is by no means at an end .
National realpolitik is becoming unreal , not only in Europe , but throughout the world .
It is turning into a lose - lose game .
Europeanisation means creating a new politics .
It means entering as a player into the meta - power game , into the struggle to form the rules of a global order .
The catchphrase for the future might be : move over America , Europe is back .

Consider this , if you can bear to .
Jenny Bush , a young Arizona woman just graduated from college , walks into her home at the end of a workday and encounters an armed serial rapist , James Allen Selby .
Selby , who had entered through a first - floor window , uses duct tape to gag and bind her , and then rapes her at knifepoint before fleeing .
After freeing herself , Bush has the courage to report the crime to police -- and the conviction to pursue legal justice .
Following a nationwide manhunt , Selby is apprehended and accused of attacking Bush ( who , with three other victims , took the stand at his trial ) and at least 10 others , including a 9 - year - old girl .
In October 2004 , Selby is convicted on 27 counts , including armed robbery , rape , kidnapping and attempted murder ( for slitting the throat of one of his victims ) .
But hours before facing sentencing , he hangs himself in a Tucson jail .
For Selby ’s victims and their families , it may have been tempting to believe a certain accountability remained operative :
His suicide put a fine point on how little he had left to live for in the wake of his conviction .
But his death also granted this serial rapist a moral reprieve that the civilian legal system could n’t .
Selby was a Persian Gulf
War veteran and so , in accordance with Pentagon policy , was buried with full military honors at Ft. Sill National Cemetery in Oklahoma .
The military policy of allowing honors burials for veterans convicted of rape sends a chilling message to victims :
Even the most heinous sexual violence does not trump prior military service .
It is a position that is as ethically indefensible as it is inconsistent .
In 1997 , after Army veteran Timothy McVeigh was sentenced to death for his role in the Oklahoma City bombings , Congress barred veterans convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death or life in prison from being buried with full military honors .
Veterans convicted of rape or any other violent crime , however , encounter no such restrictions .

“ By honoring those that do not deserve it , we dishonor those who do , ” Rep. Spencer Bachus ( R - Ala . ) said during 1997 hearings on the policy .
McVeigh , he said , “ was worthy of honor at one time , but he is no longer worthy of honor . ”
Surely the same can be said of Selby .
Jenny Bush ’s father , Steve Bush , thinks so .
Along with several victims ’ rights organizations , including my own , he has been lobbying to prevent those convicted of the most serious sex crimes from receiving military honors at burial .
Rep. John Shadegg ( R - Ariz . ) , who represents Jenny Bush ’s district , will introduce “ Jenny ’s Law ” in the coming weeks , and Democrat Barbara Boxer of California plans to introduce a companion bill in the Senate .
To be clear , changing the military burials policy would be a largely symbolic act .
The Department of Justice conservatively estimates that fewer than 40 % of all rapes are reported to authorities , demonstrating how infrequently sexual predators are held accountable .
The military in particular has a long history of downplaying or decriminalizing the violence against women committed by men in its ranks .
A 2003 Veterans Administration report on military sexual trauma estimated that 60 % of women in the Reserves and National Guard experienced rape , sexual assault or sexual harassment while on active duty .
Defense Department figures show that there were nearly 3,000 accusations of sexual assault in the military in 2006 , up 24 % from 2005 .
The Miles Foundation , a public policy institute specializing in interpersonal violence associated with the armed forces , estimates that only 2 % to 3 % of offenders receive disciplinary action as serious as court - martial .
More commonly , punishment is of the administrative variety , such as extra duty or a letter of reprimand .

It is tempting , and far too easy , to maintain that the military exists in a realm separate from the civilian world .
We tell ourselves that the moral ambiguities demonstrated by soldiers who have gone to battle on our behalf cannot be understood by , or be subject to the laws that govern , the rest of us .
But the policies our military establishes to respond to violence against women are not merely abstractions .
They are expressions of the military ’s values , and our own .
In the wake of mass violation of women and girls during the conflicts in Kosovo and Rwanda , rape and sexual violence were for the first time codified as distinct crimes under international law .
How telling then , and how troubling , that our country ’s policy on military burials is at odds with international standards the United States worked to establish .
A spot of tea was in order , with a view of the grand Reading Room a story below .
I put away a pot of tea , two perfect scones with jam and clotted cream , and four cucumber - and - cream - cheese sandwiches with a bit of cress and mint , all for about $ 17 .
Compared with the cost of tea at Brown 's Hotel ( about $ 64 ) , the Ritz ( $ 71 ) or the Dorchester ( $ 58 ) , I got off easy .
Still , to justify the cost ( and stay within budget ) , I considered this meal not an indulgent snack but a late lunch .
( Sadly , the view of the Reading Room is now less than stellar as the " First Emperor : China 's Terracotta Army " exhibition prepares to open in September . )
OUR annual national snacking binge is almost here .
It would take a very large bowl indeed to hold all the guacamole mashed from the more than 100 million avocados that are consumed on Super Bowl Sunday .
( My rough calculation gives a hemisphere bowl 20 yards in diameter and 3 times the height of the goal post crossbars . )
And guacamole is just one of many dips that will be shared around the TV .
Just in time , a scientific report has some new findings that may cause football fans to take a second look at that communal bowl of dip .
The study , to be published later this year in the Journal of Food Safety , is the only one I ’ve ever seen to proclaim that it was inspired by an episode of “ Seinfeld . ”
It was conducted as part of a Clemson University program designed to get undergraduate students involved in scientific research .
Prof. Paul L. Dawson , a food microbiologist , proposed it after he saw a rerun of a 1993 “ Seinfeld ” show in which George Costanza is confronted at a funeral reception by Timmy , his girlfriend ’s brother , after dipping the same chip twice .
“ Did , did you just double dip that chip ? ”
Timmy asks incredulously , later objecting , “ That ’s like putting your whole mouth right in the dip ! ” Finally George retorts , “ You dip the way you want to dip , I ’ll dip the way I want to dip , ” and aims another used chip at the bowl .
Timmy tries to take it away , and the scene ends as they wrestle for it .
Does this ever happen to you ?
You did something wrong .
You feel like a schmuck .
But you do n’t know how to fix it !
Maybe you yelled at your child because they were n’t moving fast enough , but the real problem was that you were late because of your lack of planning .
You took your frustration on your child and that was n’t fair .
Maybe you let your emotions get the best of you in a business setting and you ’ve said some things that you now regret .
Or maybe you still feel they were right , but just not appropriate to say out loud .
Maybe you turned a small annoyance into a full blown fight with your spouse right before dinner because you are really frustrated about some bigger issue that may or may not have to do with him or her .
Maybe you dropped the ball on something important because you did n’t plan well .
First inclination ?
Is there someone or something else to blame ?
Ever done that ?
In each of these cases , you know you should apologize but you either do n’t know how or you ca n’t bring yourself to do it .
This happens to all of us .
Sometimes you ’re feeling so hot under the collar or maybe so shameful , it ’s hard to say the words .
What to do ?
How to Say You ’re Sorry
1. Space .
Give yourself some space and time from the situation .
Wait until some of that hot emotion , whether anger or shame , has cooled a bit .
When you ’ve cooled a bit , try to think about things from an outsider ’s perspective .
Maybe others share some blame , maybe circumstances made things difficult , but ultimately take a look at your part .
What could you have done better ?
2. Listen .
There ’s a quiet calm voice in your head that is telling what the right thing to do is .
You can even hear it while another voice is raging .
You know what I ’m talking about .
Here ’s how it might sound :
“ You know you exploded on that person because you ’re frustrated about something else . ”
“ I do n’t care !
I ’m so angry I could bust ! ”
“ You know that was n’t right .
You would n’t want to be treated that way either . ”
“ But I ’m sooo angry .
And now I made such a fool of myself .
This is a big unfixable mess now ! ”
“ You can fix it .
When you ’re ready , say you ’re sorry .
You can do it . ”
“ You ’re right little voice .
Arg .
Why wo n’t you just go away ! ”
“ Because you know you ’ll feel better if you do the right thing and apologize . ”
So listen to that little voice .
As your emotion cools you ’ll be able to say sorry .
3. Say It .
Here ’s the simple part .
When you ’re ready , just humble yourself and say you ’re sorry .
Do n’t wait until you feel really good about it because that never happens .
It ’s kind of like jumping into a cold pool .
You just have to jump in .
At first the water is cold , but then you get used to it and you ’re glad you did it .
Why do n’t we say sorry when we should ?
Because it smarts .
It feels like you ’re admitting failure .
Instead take the “ learning experience ” approach .
You ’re apologizing and learning .
4. Make It a Habit .
The more you train yourself to swallow your pride , be vulnerable , and give a genuine apology when appropriate , the easier it will get .
Just do it !
5. Learn .
While you ’re at it , try to examine whether you see some patterns in your life that you need to apologize for over and over .
See if you can figure out a way to fail - proof that from happening again in the future .
When was the last time you needed to say you were sorry ?
What happened and how did you feel ?
We ’d love to hear your story !

WHEN Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was deposed as Pakistan 's prime minister in 1977 , his 24 - year - old daughter , Benazir , looked on the bright side .
She expected General Zia ul - Haq , the coup leader , to hold elections in a few months .
“ Do n't be an idiot , Pinkie , ” said her father , using the nickname inspired by her rosy complexion as an infant , “ Armies do not take over power to relinquish it . ”
Benazir idolised her father , who was executed by the military regime two years later .
She inherited the leadership of his Pakistan People 's Party — still the country 's biggest — and some of his attributes : the curious , potent blend of idealism and cynicism , of wilful blindness and breathtaking courage , of populist charisma and elitist arrogance .
Yet she seems never fully to have absorbed that piece of paternal wisdom .
She devoted the last years of her life to trying to topple — or share power with — another coup leader , Pervez Musharraf , Pakistan 's president .
Benazir straddled three very different worlds .
One was a feudal fief : her family 's land in Sindh province .
As a child , she loved to hear the story of how Charles Napier , the British conqueror of Sindh , had in 1843 marvelled at the extent of the Bhutto holdings .
After her father 's death , she found herself on the ancestral turf adjudicating over marital disputes among local villagers as if they were her serfs .
When she married , it was an arranged match , with a Sindhi bigwig , Asif Ali Zardari , whom she described in her autobiography as “ the heir to the chiefdom of the 100,000 - strong Zardari tribe ” .
When they met in London , he wooed her with crates of mangoes from Fortnum & Mason , and marrons glacés .
They had three children , and she was fiercely loyal to him , even after friends as well as foes came to regard him as sleazy and corrupt .
Benazir also belonged to the world of the international elite .
She was educated at a convent in Karachi , and then at Harvard and Oxford .
A photograph of her at college in America in the early 1970s , in T - shirt and jeans , against a dormitory wall bedecked with psychedelic posters , bears out her recollection that she resembled Joan Baez , a folk - singer .
At Oxford , she would famously drive to London for American ice - cream in her yellow sports convertible .
After her death her many friends recalled her little passions — for slushy novels , for lingerie from Victoria 's Secret .
Yet she had learned by then no longer to let her dupatta slip in public to leave her head uncovered .
At Oxford , she impressed her father — also an alumnus — by becoming president of the Union , a debating society with a line in leaden sophomoric wit .
In one debate , an opponent described her father as “ a tradesman of some description .
A butcher , I gather . ”
Benazir looked as if she had been slapped in the face .
Her father earned this sobriquet from the slaughter in East Pakistan as Bangladesh struggled to be born .
She remembered watching television in disgust as a Pakistani general surrendered , with a hug , to an Indian .
Benazir thought he should have shot himself instead .
That was her third world : Pakistani patriot , centre - left populist , democrat and ruthless politician .
Like India 's Indira Gandhi , Bangladesh 's Sheikh Hasina Wajed , and Myanmar 's Aung San Suu Kyi , she risked and suffered much to fulfil her father 's legacy .
She endured grim years in detention after her father 's death .
Both her brothers died unnaturally — the younger one in a mysterious poisoning in France , the elder in a murder in Pakistan for which her husband Asif was charged ( and exonerated ) but some family members still blame her .
Freed , Benazir went into exile in London , then returned home to a tumultuous welcome in 1986 .
Two years later , after Zia ul - Haq was killed when his plane dropped out of the sky , she was elected to power .
For a while , it seemed that the country could put its many troubled years of military rule behind it , and look forward to a democratic future .
But the hopes Benazir had aroused were swiftly disappointed .
Her regime was marked by human - rights abuses , incompetence and massive corruption .
Mr Zardari became known as Mr 10 % .
Ousted in 1990 and re-elected in 1993 , she was again dismissed in 1996 by the president .
Mr Zardari was jailed and she retreated back into exile to escape corruption charges .
From there she watched her successor and nemesis , Nawaz Sharif , fall to the Musharraf coup in 1999 , and saw Mr Musharraf become an important American ally after September 11th 2001 .
There was , however , still a role for Benazir .
America saw her as the best way of putting a democratic face on a military dictatorship , so it helped broker the agreement that saw her return to Pakistan in October to fight elections due in January .
Islamist militants threatened to kill her .
Scores died in a suicide - bombing on the day of her homecoming .
Yet she kept campaigning .
Vain , selfish and perhaps foolish , Benazir was also very , very brave .
After her assassination , a handwritten will was produced .
Foreseeing her own untimely end , it bequeathed her party , like the dynastic heirloom it has become , to her husband , who said he would pass leadership to their 19 - year - old son .
For a woman who claimed to be driven by a burning desire to bring democracy to Pakistan , it was a curious legacy .

RICHMOND , Va. --
More than football , Michael Vick 's freedom
is the question now .
With three associates prepared to testify that he brutally
executed dogs and bankrolled gambling , the NFL star agreed Monday
to " accept full responsibility " for his role in a dogfighting
ring and plead guilty to federal conspiracy charges .
Worries about playing time will have to wait while Vick faces
prison time -- from one to five years .
The maximum term is five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine ,
although federal sentencing guidelines likely would call for less .
Defense attorneys would not divulge details of the plea agreement
or how much time Vick can expect to serve .
However , a source close to the situation told ESPN's Kelly Naqi that prosecutors will recommend a sentence of 12 to 18 months .
The official said such a sentence would be more than what is
usually recommended for first - time offenders , reflecting the
government 's attempt to show that animal abusers will receive more
than a slap on the wrist .
U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson is not
bound by prosecutors ' recommendations or the sentencing guidelines
and will have the final say .
Twenty - five days after he declared that he looked forward to
clearing his name , Vick said through defense lawyer Billy Martin
that he will plead guilty .
A hearing is scheduled for Aug. 27 .
" Mr. Vick has agreed to enter a plea of guilty to those charges
and to accept full responsibility for his actions and the mistakes
he has made , " Martin said in a statement .
" Michael wishes to
apologize again to everyone who has been hurt by this matter . "
The NFL noted in a statement that the Atlanta Falcons
quarterback 's admission was n't in line with what he told
commissioner Roger Goodell shortly after being charged .
League sources told ESPN's Chris Mortensen that Goodell likely will suspend Vick indefinitely and that a final decision on Vick 's suspension will be made after his legal case is resolved .
" We totally condemn the conduct outlined in the charges , which
is inconsistent with what Michael Vick previously told both our
office and the Falcons , " the NFL said .
The league , which barred Vick from training camp , said it has
asked the Falcons to withhold further action while the NFL's own
investigation wraps up .
" The commissioner has not decided on a specific timetable on Michael Vick 's status , " league spokesman Greg Aiello told The Associated Press on Tuesday .
The Falcons said they were " certainly troubled " by news of the
plea , but would withhold further comment in compliance with
Goodell 's request .
If the league suspends Vick , the Falcons could then seek to recoup part of his signing bonus of approximately $ 22 million , because if suspended , then Vick would be in default of his contract , team officials told ESPN's Sal Paolantonio .
The team already was prepared to eat Vick 's $ 8.5 million salary
cap hit this season , though the NFL is expected to grant a roster
exemption .
Additionally , the Falcons would be liable for about $ 15 million on
next year 's cap .
Gene Upshaw , executive director of the NFL Players Association ,
said in a statement :
" We believe the criminal conduct to which Mr. Vick has pled
guilty today cannot be condoned under any circumstances .
Speaking
personally , as I have previously stated , the practice of dogfighting is offensive and completely unacceptable .
I can only hope
that Mr. Vick , who is a young man , will learn from this awful
experience . "
In a telephone interview with the AP , Martin said Vick is paying
a high price for allowing old friends to influence his behavior ,
but he emphasized that his client takes full responsibility .
" There were some judgment issues in terms of people he was
associating with , " Martin said .
" He realized this is very
serious , and he decided to plead so he can begin the healing
process . "
The lawyer said salvaging Vick 's NFL career was never part of
the discussions .
" Football is not the most important thing in Michael Vick's
life , " Martin said .
" He wants to get his life back on track . "
Another defense attorney , James D. " Butch " Williams Jr. ,
alluded to the harsh public backlash against Vick since the July 17
indictment detailed the abuse of dogs on Vick 's property in Surry
County , Va .
" Michael is a father , he 's a son , he 's a human being -- people
oftentimes forget that , " he said , adding that Vick is " very
remorseful . "
" Nobody 's been rougher on Mike than Mike 's been on himself , "
Williams said .
Animal - rights activists said they hoped the high - profile case
would increase public awareness and help bring down other
dogfighting rings .
" The only good that can come from this case is that the
American people dedicate themselves to the task of rooting out
dogfighting in every infected area where it thrives , " said Wayne
Pacelle , president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United
States .
The plea deal was announced just as a new grand jury began
meeting .
Prosecutors had said that a superseding indictment was in
the works , but Vick 's plea most likely means he will not face new
charges on top of the original : conspiracy to travel in interstate
commerce in aid of unlawful activities and conspiracy to sponsor a
dog in an animal fighting venture .
Three of Vick 's original co-defendants already had pleaded
guilty and agreed to testify against him if the case went to trial .
Quanis Phillips of Atlanta and Purnell Peace of Virginia Beach
signed statements saying Vick participated in executing at least
eight underperforming dogs by various means , including drowning and
hanging .
Phillips , Peace and Tony Taylor , who pleaded guilty last month ,
also said Vick provided virtually all of the gambling and operating
funds for his " Bad Newz Kennels " operation in rural Virginia , not
far from Vick 's hometown of Newport News .
" I , like all people who know and care about Michael Vick , was very disappointed and saddened by the news , " Frank Beamer , who coached Vick at Virginia Tech , said in a statement .
" Although all the details are not known at this time , I am greatly concerned that Michael has put himself in this position . "
The gambling allegations alone could trigger a lifetime ban
under the NFL 's personal conduct policy .
Vick 's Atlanta attorney , Daniel Meachum , told the AP that Vick
is taking a chance with his guilty plea as far as his career is
concerned because there have been no discussions with the league in
recent days .
" There 's no promise or even a request of the league to make a
promise , " Meachum said .
He said the plea deal involves only the federal case and that he
did n't know if there had been any discussions about resolving state
charges that may still be filed .
The case began April 25 when investigators conducting a drug
search at a massive home Vick built in Surry County found 66 dogs ,
some of them injured , and items typically used in dogfighting .
They
included a " rape stand " that holds aggressive dogs in place for
mating and a " breakstick " used to pry open a dog 's mouth .
Vick contended he knew nothing about a dogfighting operation at
the home , where one of his cousins lived , and said he rarely
visited .
The former Virginia
Tech star also blamed friends and
family members for taking advantage of his generosity and pledged
to be more scrupulous .
The July 17 indictment said dogs that lost fights or fared
poorly in test fights were sometimes executed by hanging ,
electrocution or other brutal means .
The grisly details fueled
public protests against Vick and cost him some of his lucrative
endorsement deals .
About a dozen bright red Vick jerseys have been donated -- often
accompanied by financial contributions -- to the Atlanta Humane
Society since he was indicted last month .
The shelter uses them for
dog blankets , and to clean up after the animals .
" Kind of appropriate , " Pacelle said .
In a statement issued Monday , People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals called on the league to incorporate cruelty to animals into its personal conduct policy .
" This case has clearly shown that NFL fans are just as outraged by cruelty to animals as any of the other antisocial behaviors outlined in the policy , " PETA 's statement read .
In a separate legal run-in , The Atlanta Journal - Constitution reported Vick was cited for not wearing a seat belt during a traffic stop in Virginia on Thursday .
The car Vick was riding in was pulled over because the tint on the windows was too dark .

What is a PTR record ?
A PTR record is also known as a pointer record or a reverse DNS record .
It is the opposite of the A record .
PTR record points one IP address to a hostname .
The purpose of it is the verification of the IP address .
The mail servers do a so - called reverse DNS lookup to check if the IPs of the incoming mails are related to the host .
If there are no existing PTR records , the incoming emails will land in spam and will never be read .
To be sure your outgoing emails are sent correctly , you must include PTR records in a reverse DNS zone .
With them , you show that you can be trusted .
How to create a PTR record ?
We start by creating a Reverse DNS zone .
Inside it , we can place PTR records .
One PTR record per each IP , this is the rule .
If you create more , you will get errors .

This is actually the diploid phase of the life cycle , which is very restricted in mosses .

One of the simplest plants on the planet could help scientists create crops to survive the ravages of drought .
The moss Physcomitrella patens is a primitive plant , similar to the first plants which began to grow on land around 450 million years ago .
Just one cell thick , these early plants had to adapt to withstand cold , heat and drought without roots or complex leaves .
The ability of mosses to survive severe dehydration and then regrow when watered could be of enormous use in crops grown in drought - stricken areas of the developing world .
Scientists from the University of Leeds , with colleagues from Germany , Japan and the USA , have sequenced the genome for Physcomitrella – the first non-flowering or ‘ lower ’ plant to be sequenced – and their findings are published in the latest issue of the journal Science .
Now that they have sequenced the moss ’s DNA , scientists will be able to identify which genes control these survival tactics and adapt crops to do the same .
The study of Physcomitrella was started at the University of Leeds over 20 years ago by Professor David Cove .
Dr Andy Cuming has continued Professor Cove ’s work , supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council , and is part of the international team working on the genome .
“ Physcomitrella is a really useful plant to study , ” explains Dr Cuming .
“ In addition to being the link between water - based algae and land plants , it also has many important characteristics which make it special .
By sequencing the genome , we can start to identify their genetic basis and use the knowledge for crop improvement . ”
Physcomitrella has a single ‘ haploid ’ genome – rather than a double genome from male and female parents – which makes it easier to identify which characteristics link to which gene .
The moss is also able to integrate new DNA into a defined target in the genome – unlike most plants which integrate new DNA randomly .
This means that modification of the moss genome is far more controlled than with other plants and allows the moss to be adapted as a ‘ green factory ’ to produce pharmaceutical products .
“ If we can discover what mechanisms cause the Physcomitrella genome to integrate DNA in this way – we may be able to transfer those to other plants , to allow more controlled modification of their genomes , ” said Dr Cuming .
“ However , we also believe many of the useful genes in Physcomitrella are probably still present in ‘ higher ’ crop plants , but are no longer active in the same way .
So rather than adding new DNA – we ’ll just be activating what ’s already there to create the properties we want . ”
The sequencing has been carried out at the Joint Genome Institute in Berkeley , California , which invites scientists around the world to compete each year to use their sequencing facilities for a particular genome .
Physcomitrella patens ‘ won ’ the competition in 2005 .
The work has been coordinated by the University of Leeds , the University of Freiburg in Germany , the National Institute for Basic Biology in Japan , Washington University at St Louis , Missouri and the University of California at Berkeley .
“ Until now , only a handful of flowering plant genomes have been sequenced , compared with a large number of diverse animal genomes , ” says Dr Cuming .
“ But knowledge of a range of genomes is really important for scientific study .
To help in understanding the human genome , scientists use the DNA of fruit flies , nematode worms and mice , to name only a few .
We need that range in plant sciences too – and Physcomitrella patens is a fantastic one to add to the list . ”

Bush adviser says waterboarding ' is legal , ' wo n't say if it 's used David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday October 31 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Bush adviser defends AG nominee 's stance on interrogation tactic Despite Attorney General nominee Michael Mukasey 's apparent inability to give a firm yes - or - no answer on the legality of subjecting detainees to simulated drowning , a prominent White House aide insisted the program is " legal , " although the government wo n't say whether it uses the technique .
White House counselor Ed Gillespie said it was unfair for critics to expect Mukasey to give a forthright opinion on a classified program on which he has not been fully briefed .
Democrats and some Republicans in the Senate have expressed new reservations about Mukasey 's bid to become the top US law enforcement officer after he gave what some saw as overly parsed answers to the Senate Judiciary Committee when its members have asked if he believes waterboarding constitutes torture .
CNN host John King asked Gillespie directly , " Is waterboarding legal ? "
" The fact is that those who have been briefed on the program in the US Senate , those on the Intelligence Committee , and others who are familiar with the program have said that it is legal , " Gillespie said .
" And those are the ones who have a basis to know .
But the fact is the government does n't confirm techniques regardless of whether they 're used or not used . "
Gillespie 's assertion is undercut by the chairman of the Intelligence Committee , who complained earlier this month about the administration 's ongoing refusal to turn over all of its documents on the CIA 's interrogation methods to congressional overseers .
 The reality is , the Administration refused to disclose the program to the full Committee for five years , and they have refused to turn over key legal documents since day one , " Sen .
John D. Rockefeller said after new revelations earlier this month revealed the Justice Department had secretly authorized an array of controversial techniques .
 As I have said from the beginning , Congress has a constitutional responsibility to determine whether the program is the best means for obtaining reliable information , whether it is fully supported by the law , and whether it is in the best interest of the United States . 
An Intelligence committee spokesperson did not immediately return a call seeking comment .
In a four - page letter sent to Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy Tuesday , Mukasey said he found the process described as waterboarding " over the line " and " repugnant , " but he refused to issue a legal opinion based on " hypotheticals . "
Waterboarding involves tying down a detainee , covering his face with a cloth and pouring water over his mouth and nose to simulate drowning .
Leahy was dissatisfied with Mukasey 's response , but he has scheduled a committee vote on Mukasey 's nomination for next week .
By that time he hopes committee members have " an opportunity to consider the recently received written responses from the nominee , " the Vermont Democrat said in a statement Wednesday .
All four Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate have said they would vote against Mukasey , and the ranking Republican on Judiciary , Sen. Arlen Specter , also has voiced concerns about the nomination .
Mukasey was expected to be confirmed easily when his nomination was announced , but his parsing on the definition of torture has thrown some roadblocks in his path , the Washington Post reported , and some activists are wary about his honesty .
Caroline Fredrickson , Washington legislative director for the American Civil Liberties Union , told the paper that Mukasey does not need a classified briefing to answer the question on waterboarding as he has claimed .
" He seems like he 's just an artful hairsplitter , " Fredrickson declared .
The following video is from CNN's American Morning , broadcast on October 31 , 2007 .
PARTIAL RUSH TRANSCRIPT ROBERTS :
The question today :
Are you going to lose this nomination ?
GILLESPIE : No . Judge Mukasey is well respected and well regarded across the aisle .
In consultations with Senators before coming forward , Judge Mukasey 's name was raised by Democrat and Republican alike , and he has been known for his independent nature , for his thorough and careful review of the law , and we see that in the letter he sent to the Judiciary Committee in response to their question about waterboarding yesterday .
ROBERTS : I guess what you see depends on your perspective because yesterday the Democrats saw what they thought was evasion .
It 's on this critical issue of waterboarding .
Mukasey said he thought it was ' over the line ' and ' repugnant ' but got a little gray on the legal aspects .
...
The democrats were looking for a clear disavowal here .
Why could n't he be absolutely clear on this issue ?
GILLESPIE : Let 's understand this technique .
We do n't know that it 's been used by the government or ... confirmed by the US government .
The program that it involves is a classified program .
Now , members of the United States senate have been briefed on the program and they have said that it is -- it complies with all laws but Judge Mukasey has not .
As a nominee he does not have the ability to be briefed on a classified program as members of the Senate do .
His point was , ' If confirmed I will review this program and review the underpinnings in terms of the legality of it and come back to you with a judgment .
Here is how I would look at it . '
And it 's unfair to ask him to render a legal opinion on something .
He offered his personal opinion but he can't render a legal opinion on something he has not been briefed on .
By the way , the members of the Senate asking the judge to do something in this nomination process which the Senate has n't done .
Less than a year ago there was a vote on the floor of the Senate as to whether or not to apply the Army field manual regulations that applied to the Department of Defense and military detainees across the government .
And it was rejected by the Senate 53 - 46 .
Now they 're asking him to make a determination that the Senate itself did n't make less than a year .
It 's not really fair to ask him to render a legal opinion without sufficient information .
ROBERTS : Ed , you said a second ago that you can't confirm or deny whether waterboarding has been used .
It 's widely held waterboarding is what broke Khalid Sheikh Muhammad to get him to divulge all of the information he had .
What is your sense ?
is waterboarding legal ?
GILLESPIE :
The fact is that those who have been briefed on the program in the United States Senate , members of the Intelligence Committee , and others who are familiar with the program have said that it is legal .
And those are the ones who have a basis to know .
The fact is the government does n't confirm techniques regardless of whether they 're used or not used .
No rule in or out because the idea is not to help terrorists who mean to do us harm .

: My post appeared on Reddit 's programming feed .
Thank you !
Also , my post 's title should 've been " Point - free programming style first encounter " , but I 'm too lazy to change it ^_^I was really busy lately so no post around for a while .
Surprisingly , I was n't busy wrinting code but actually thinking about the problem : this is feasible in Haskell as the code is more concise and the typing system keeps you from doing stupid design mistakes ( or at least make them appear earlier than in other programming language ) .
Now , done with the ritual Haskell - awe prologue , here my post for today .
Lately , I 've been working to a program manipulating objects which turned out to be monomials , which I represented as a pair of ( Double , [ Int ] ) , i.e. :( 4.0 , [ 1,2, -1, -2 ] ) -> 4.0 x ( 1,1 ) x( 2,2 ) x( 3 , - 1 ) x ( 4 , - 2 ) where x ( i , j ) are unknowns indexed by a pair .
Since I assume that the first component of the unknowns ' pairs will be the sequence 1,2,3 , ... I only need to specify the second component .
I know , it 's kinda weird , but it has to do with my domain problem which is related to finite difference operators for PDE .
Now I want to define a " product " operator which works like this : ( k , [ b , c , d ] ) * ( h , [e , f , g ] ) = ( k*h , [ a+e , c+f , d+ g ] ) I can define this like follows : prod ( k, ll ) ( h, rl ) = ( k*h , zipWith (+ ) ll rl ) This is perfectly correct and good as it's very expressive .
Now , I want to apply the same function monadically to list arguments , i.e.: prod :: [ ( Double , [ Int ] ) ] ->
[ ( Double , [( Double , [ Int ] ) ] -> [ ( Double , [ Int ] ) ]
To do this , I 'll use lift M2 which take a function of two arguments and applies it to every pair formed taking an element from the first list and an element from the second .
So : prodM = lift M2 prodBut I 'll never use prod by itself , so let 's put this in a lambda abstraction and rename prodM to prod : prod = lift M2 $ \ ( k, ll ) ( h,rl ) -> ( k*h , zipWith (+ ) ll rl ) Again , this is correct but my Haskell soul is becoming more strict and such a formulation sounds bad to me ( I could 've felt perfectly right with some month ago ) .
I do n't like lambdas when used this way , I see as an intrusive element in the perfect world of function combinators / operators ( and lift M2 is such a combinator ) .
More , I had to specify that prod requires two tuples while it'd be neat if the compiler could infere this automatically : I see this as code replication issue .
The solution to this dilemma is using point - free style programming .
I 'll abuse arrow combinators a bit .
Specifically , there 's the ( ***) operator which takes two function f and g and applies them to a tuple : ( f *** g ) ( a , b ) = ( f a , g b ) What if I need to combine two tuples using two separate binary operators ?
I.e. :( f ***' g ) ( a , b ) ( c , d ) = ( f a c , g b d ) Arrows module does n't provides such a combinator but we could build one .
First , if we combine f and g using ( ***) , we get a pair of two functions as f and g are partially evaluated .
What we need now is to interpose ( ***) between these two functions .
How to do this ?
Simple , we just need to uncurry ( ***) .
So , now : ( f ***' g ) = uncurry ( ***) . ( f *** g) and we 're done as f ***' g returns a function taking two tuples and apply f and g separately to each component .
This is good as we can rewrite prod as : prod = lift M2 $ uncurry ( ***) . ( (* ) *** ( zipWith (+ ) ) ) which is essentially a smart combination of functions .
Notice that no arguments of prod has been specified : this is where point - free programming style really lies .
Changing the way prod is written will change the type of its arguments , in single place , without requiring you to rewrite them in two places ( i.e. the argument list ) .
For the last four years people have been downloading the latest albums of their favorite artists , blissfully unaware that they have been modified .
From The Pirate Bay to OiNK , downloaders have been getting unique versions , unavailable in the shops , all thanks to The Overdub Tampering Committee .
Almost everyone in the file - sharing community understands the concept and menace of fake files .
Movies with adware or spyware attached or even music tracks that turn out to be completely blank .
Fake files are always nothing but a menace – until now that is .
A group of musicians calling themselves ‘ The Overdub Tampering Committee ’ ( TOTC ) have just made a rather unusual announcement .
For the last 3 years TOTC have been downloading newly - leaked albums from the internet and using them to create new versions of the tracks .
They added their own instruments , and used additional production techniques in the style of the original recording , to create a subtle remix of the original .
Within hours , they then re-released the slightly modified albums back onto file - sharing networks and BitTorrent sites such as OiNK and The Pirate Bay .
“ If you illegally download music on the internet the chances that our work is in your collection is very , very likely !
In fact , you might have a whole lot of us ! ” , they claim .
In fact , ‘ Polluting ’ P2P networks with this music did n’t end the spread .
TOTC have seen their works spread as far as radio stations .
No prizes for guessing where they got it from .
It all started around 4 years ago , a member of TOTC downloaded an album only to hear that someone had tampered with it in the middle .
This got them thinking : “ What if this problem got more insidious , subtle , and widespread ?
What if there was a network of musicians who got a hold of albums right as they leaked , added subtle yet very much additional overdubs all over the album , and then re-leaked it to the internet ? ”
That ’s exactly what they have been doing for the past few years .
Even though the group seem to want to ‘ pollute ’ P2P networks with these ‘ remixes ’ , they also dislike the music industry :
Attempting to police and punish “ illegal downloaders ” with lawsuits and fines is misguided and , in our opinion , a waste of time .
This model treats the music fans as criminals .
That ’s an insane business model .
But we expect nothing less than insanity from large , crumbling corporations .
We do not know how the music industry will change in the next few years and we do n’t know how a method will arise to ensure that musicians are properly paid for their recorded work .
We have no solutions .
TOTC , who are all members of other active bands , say they have even released tampered versions of their own songs , and uploaded them to the Internet .
“ That was particularly fun for us . ” they said .
But what is the group ’s opinion on file - sharing itself ?
They say they do n’t think it ’s wrong and download stuff themselves to test before buying on physical media .
So what was their motivation to do this ?
“ All we wanted to do was fuck with the treasure everyone ’s hunting for to realign everyone ’s perspective . ”
We contacted TOTC for some additional information , but they have n’t replied so far .

View all ( The burden of proof should fall to the homosexual lobby to change the historical and traditional idea of marriage .
The author defends restricting gay marriages . )
We are bombarded by questions pouring from television commentators , gay activists , politicians , and liberal - minded publications :
Do n’t gay and lesbians deserve equal rights under the law ?
Why should we care what happens between consenting adults ?
If it does n’t take anything away from others , why not allow for gay marriages ?
For some reason we never hear answers from those who conclude that homosexual unions should not be given the sacred stamp of marriage .
Many are ambivalent or fashionably tolerant for fear of being labeled “ ultra - conservative . ”
Let me attempt to answer those questions .
First , gay and lesbians already possess rights equally protected under the law .
They have the exact rights that I have today .
They can marry a member of the opposite sex if they so choose , just like I have done .
I can't marry a member of my own sex , even if I wanted to .
So , we have the exact same rights .
What is being suggested by the gay agenda is not " equal rights " but " extra rights . "
They want to be allowed to reap the benefits of marriage without actually marrying in its traditional sense .
There are many wonderful people who choose to remain single for myriad reasons , and these people are not clamoring for the rights granted to couples who marry .
Why should those who refuse traditional marriage be granted such rights simply because they prefer sex with someone whose anatomy resembles their own ?
In fact , most of the so - called “ rights ” married couples have can be obtained through a lawyer ’s legal maneuvers .
What if they achieve this marital status ?
Does anyone really believe that it will stop there ?
Any heterosexual buddies could take the opportunity to garner for themselves incentives and privileges intended to support the traditional family structure by which our society survives .
Make no mistake ; there is a deeper agenda at work here , even if all gay and lesbians are not aware of it .
Secondly , consenting adults can do many things , but there are some actions restricted even to consenting adults .
Concerning marriage , we conclude as a society that incest is harmful and thus refuse to allow family members to intermarry .
Also , we conclude that polygamy is harmful and restrict Mormons and Muslims from marrying more than one consenting adult at a time .
We have age requirements on marriages as well .
There are reasons we place restrictions on marriage .
Homosexuals have never received marital status in the history of mankind until recently .
There is a reason for that .
It is not productive to continue to shred the fabric of our society .
The burden of proof for changing history ’s traditional marriage should fall upon the supporters of the homosexual agenda .
I have heard of no compelling reasons that suggest homosexual marriages are necessary to the well - being of our society .
Finally , the agenda pushed by the gay lobby encourages behavior deemed unacceptable by every major religion , by the vast majority of our society , and by nature ’s evolutionary track itself .
They already have the right to participate in aberrant behavior , but that is n’t enough .
They want us to validate something we consider wicked .
Where are the defenders of the law who claimed Alabama ’s Chief Justice Roy Moore must be fired for defying the law through civil disobedience when he placed a monument to the Ten Commandments in the courthouse ?
Where is the uproar for the firing of San Francisco ’s Mayor Gavin Newsom for defying the law by granting marriage certificates to homosexual couples ?
There wo n’t be one .
The double standard against Christianity in the public square will be ignored by most , but we should not succumb to those who mock our faith .
If homosexuals win this issue politically , the victory will be hollow for them and harmful to our society .
The truth of the matter is marriage is a sacred union ordained by God , and nothing man does can ever really change that .
( The current debate , spawned by President Obama 's support of gay marriagse , continues to miss the point :
We all have equal rights already .
The gay lobby desires " extra " rights that will open the door for many unintended consequences within our society at large .
To equate gay marriage with " civil rights " is an insult to a people who were discriminated against on every single level of their lives for centuries in this country .
Gay couples need to seek validation outside the realm of religion , which has historically spoken on this issue .
Civil unions are already available , affording gay couples rights of which honest heterosexuals do n't avail themselves .
The burden of proof concerning why we should change our society to accomodate gay marriages falls upon the homosexual community .
Until now , there is no compelling proof our society would benefit . )

Your argument is flawed in many ways .
LGBTs do not want extra rights ; they want the equal right to marry the person they love , and the 1,100 legal benefits that come with marriage .
While it is true LGBTs cannot procreate , it is equally true that infertile and older heterosexual couples cannot procreate , yet we do not deny them the right to marry .
It therefore seems to me that love is the true basis for marriage , not procreation .
And love is a gift from God .
He ( or she ) encourages it ; he does not condemn or forbid it .
God also created us all , yes , even our sexual orientations .
Judge his judgment at your own risk !
Better to honor
God by honoring love , and by showing your acceptance toward others with tolerance and understanding .
There is not too much , rather , too little love in this world .
Love is surely the bond that holds society together .
Distrust , hate , greed , tyranny , jealousy , and a few other flaws pull us apart .
We dishonor God when we harbor and resort to our flaws ; we honor ourselves and our God with love for all .

Awesome argument .
Reviewed by random lickspittle ( Reader ) John Gonzales , what you are saying is absolute rubbish , you are encouraging our children to oppose diversity and anything outside what they have been taught with disdain and scorn .
Humanity thrives on diversity , if all people held the exact same oppinions , then humanity would be nothing more than unthinking drones , set in their belikefs with no purpose in being there .
It would be a bland unfulfilling life .
I also must ask one thing , what damage has homosexuality actually done , name me onesittuation where it has had horrible consuquences .
Reviewed by Paul Eccleston ( Reader ) I will offer a non-US perspective , as the points of view expressed have generally ( almost exlusively from what I have read ) been focussed on the laws and sensibilities there .
We do have some similarities with the US , in regards to separation of Church and State , though our legal system owes more to the UK than the US .
In Australia , we have also had many debates ( arguments ) on the proposal of same sex marriage .
Many of the arguments against gay marriage come back to religion .
Because the Bible / Torah / Qu'ran state that homosexuality is an abomination ( at least there 's one thing they can all agree on ) , then it must be so .
Being part of a largely secular society means that if we were to follow all of the strictures of whichever religious text happened to be supported by the majority , then there would be very few who would not be breaking the law in one way or another .
Addressing a number of the claims made in this article .
First , that gay and lesbian people have equal rights .
They do , if they choose to ignore their preferences and marry someone of the opposite sex .
If however , they want to acknowledge that their partnership is more than a couple of people living together , they do not have that right .
They do not have the right to a share of their partners estate in the event of a death .
They do not have the right to intervene in their partners affairs should that partner become incapable of managing them themselves .
They do not have the right to claim against their partner if their relationship should fail , leaving one of them financially disadvantaged , or having to support children .
The final portion of the argument , that it " will not stop there " , is as poor an argument as can be made .
Stating that just because x , then y will happen next ( eg. " just because the Democrats are in power , now they 'll destroy America with their lefty , pinko policies " ) is frankly nothing more than scare tactics .
Nowhere has anyone advocating same sex marriage ever advocated polygamy , incest or underage marriage .
Claiming that there is a hidden agenda , but it 's so hidden that the people advocating same sex marriage are n't even aware of it is patently ludicrous .
On the second point , that it is not traditional .
Traditions change .
It 's traditional in some countries following Sharia law that a woman who has had sex outside of marriage ( even if she is raped ) must be stoned to death .
It is also not traditional to have divorce ( Henry VIII had to create a whole new religion in order to do that ) , but it is now so commonplace that I am sure many Catholic couples avail themselves of the practice .
According to tradition , contraception should never be used .
But even the Catholic Church can change it 's stance on traditional views in the face of new information and changing societal values .
The final point again is not about how the law views the relationship .
but how religion views the relationship .
In most countries , including the US and Australia , it is not illegal to have a homosexual relationship .
The " traditional " marriage may be a sacred union ordained by God , but marriage is no longer restricted to those who enter it through a religious institution .
I was married in a civil ceremony .
My relationship is officially recognised under my country 's laws .
The advocates of same sex marriage are not asking to be married in Church .
They are asking for the same sort of ceremony I had , one that will be recognised under the laws ( not religions ) of their country .
For a country , founded on the rights of the individual , and set up by people fleeing from religious intolerance , I find it surprising that it is unprepared to acknowledge the rights of these individuals , and will target them with their own religious intolerance .
I 'd suggest a re-read of Animal Farm .
Reviewed by Kyle Bullen ( Reader ) Maybe God created a perfectly harmonious system and within that system he knew people might over - populate the world he created an thus destroy it .
So he added to his masterplan the process of homosexuality , whereby couples pair together so that they can truely love ( which is the purpose of our existence ) but do not contibute to the rapid growth of our population .
In fact , he has also given rise to the opportunity for healthy couples to adopt abandoned children .
Its morals like these that support the continuation of our existance because the child left starving in the street or improperly nutured in the orphange did n't grow up , or grew up with a gun in his or her hand .
So ask yourself , what threat does gay marriage pose against your personal existance ?
Will you continue to reproduce ?
How can it actually hold our existance back ?
If it seems to occur naturally and not by choice , which 99 % of homosexuals claim , is it possible it is part of our perfectly harmonious natural existence created perfectly by God who does in fact have a master plan trying to effectively work ?

The unfortunate result of proposing an argument based upon a belief system is that the argument stands or fall upon the veracity of that belief system .
It is therefore a dangerous manouvre .
" marriage is a sacred union ordained by God , and nothing man does can ever really change that " .
Suppose the ' sitter on the fence ' replies , ' Fair enough , but I am an atheist , I do not accept the intellectual premise of a deity , so why have you based your whole argument upon something I cannot believe ?'
There are better arguments , most of the species of this world display some form of homosexual activity as seen in common seals and even post adolescent lions .
Critically the overwhelming status of all species is an heterosexual one and the homosexual element , as heterosexual mating opportunities are presented , tend to revert to normality .
The crux of this being that no species makes provision for its " gay " members , the whole evolutionary structure depends upon propagation of all species ( hermaphrodites etc excluded ) via heterosexual union .
Queen Victoria is reputed to have said of homosexuality , " Well , as long as it does not frighten the horses . "
Although her mind was so fixed that when legislation was proposed against homosexual , she would not believe that females would indulge in such things and therefore throughout its life , legislation in England only ever referred to male homosexuals .

I understand that you are frustrated by this article .
However , I do not see where you come up with your information .
Why do you think the Bible contradicts itself ?
In response to your theory about the world being created through incest , when the world was created , it was created as perfect .
Also , after sin entered the world , it was purely a cultural thing .
God said multiply and fill the earth .
This was the only way possible at the time .
I do n't know if I exactly believe that homosexuals are asking for extra laws , but I do believe gay marriage is wrong .
The Bible states in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 that homosexuals will not inherit the Kingdom of God .
Therefore , gay marriage is wrong because it promotes homosexuality .
If homosexuality was right , then God would n't keep homosexuals from entering the Kingdom of God .
The Bible is not contradictory .
If you need more references , you can check out Romans 1:26 - 28 , Leviticus 18:22 , or Leviticus 20:13 .
I think that the reason people say it is gross is because it is not what they are accustomed to .
In regards to your insights on how we , christians i mean , live our lives , all people are sinners .
It is in our nature .
Jesus is the only person capable of being perfect .
So we try to live by the Bible , and to please God , but we are only human and we do make mistakes .
When we do , we ask for forgiveness .
For some it may be so they do n't feel guilty , but that is not the original intent .

Marriage is a recognition of binding , mutual love ; at least when undertaken by spiritually inclined people .
As such , it comprises a declaration to the community at large that two ( or sometimes more ) persons have committed themselves physically and spiritually , each to the other .
The need for such open and binding commitment is NOT restricted to those of heterosexual persuasion , but arises in all persons who deeply love another (s ) .
To deny these very human needs seems cold and inhuman to me .
Within a secular society , the rites ( and rights ) of marriage may assume a non-religious form under the aegis of the state , so the religious argument is irrelevant , and the rights ( and rites ) of the churches remain unaffected .
( I do think that those who disagree with the stance of the church on gay marriage should not seek to change that insitution , but rather utilise the services of the state , which should be readily forthcoming . )
With respect to the restrictions on polygamy that you endorse , I again cordially disagree .
The community has no right whatsoever to infringe on the rights of consenting individuals in their aspirations to whatever form of marriage they might wish - it 's simply no other person 's business .
As for the prohibition of incest , it 's a rather obvious necessity given the genetic problems that arise with inbreeding - even most primitive societies have worked this out .
I do not mock your faith , but I do consider myself above it , and I feel strongly compelled to stand up for the human dignity of those who differ from the collective mindsets that drive today 's rather brutal societies .
Incidentally , and for your reference , I am a very happily married monogamous male .
But that does NOT give me the right to proscribe ( or prescribe ) the rights and aspirations of others .
It is inhumanity of this type that keeps me away from conventional religion and generates fear and revulsion in caring human beings .

Nicki Reviewed by MILLER GREEN ( Reader ) Marriage is a promise between freely consenting adults who are devoted to maintaining a loving , supportive relationship .
It is meant to foster lifelong commitment , emotional bonding , and sexual purity , among other things .
Defining marriage this way takes sexual orientation out of the equation and puts the emphasis on what is truly important in building healthy marriages which can contribute to a successful society .
This definition would help relieve the pressure that many gay people feel to fit into the heterosexual mold and enter into an untrue marriage .
Yes , gay people have the right to marry someone of the opposite sex , but that would be a marriage based on a lie which I 'm sure that most people agree , is not to the benefit of our society .
Religious organizations will still have the right to permit marriages based on their own definitions .
Saying that something is traditional does not make it right .
Fortunately many traditions in this country have been abolished because they were not right and the world is a better place thanks to the courageous people who stood up for what is right .
Fears that our society would crumble when other antiquated traditions ended were unfounded and the same will be said about this issue in the future if we would just realize what is truly important in a marriage and work toward that goal for all people .

( dont worry , you will be given the credit you deserve )
As i was reading the comments i came across one that i have adored for a while now , " separation of church and state . "
I love refuting this .
Frankly , the church and state cannot be separated without destroying the 3 branch system of government that America has today .
Public school government classes will not teach this , but believe it or not , the founding fathers came up with idea of the 3 branches came from the Bible .
22 For the LORD is our judge , ( judicial branch )
the LORD is our lawgiver , ( legislative branch )
the LORD is our king ; ( executive branch )
it is he who will save us .
( Isaiah 33:22 NIV )
There is more i can elaborate on but i am yet to receive a worthy counterpoint to this .

TEAM 0.5 , the world 's best transmission electron microscope , is being assembled at the National Center for Electron Microscopy .
( Photo Roy Kaltschmidt , Berkeley Lab CSO )
TEAM 0.5 , the world 's most powerful transmission electron microscope — capable of producing images with half ‑angstrom resolution ( half a ten - billionth of a meter ) , less than the diameter of a single hydrogen atom — has been installed at the Department of Energy 's National Center for Electron Microscopy ( NCEM ) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
" We have beam down the column , " announced Uli Dahmen of Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division , who is head of NCEM and director of DOE 's collaborative TEAM Project , when the TEAM 0.5 microscope first delivered its ultrabright electron beam at Berkeley Lab in late December .
The TEAM Project ( TEAM stands for Transmission Electron Aberration - corrected Microscope ) is led by Berkeley Lab in a collaboration with DOE 's Argonne and Oak Ridge National Laboratories , the Frederick Seitz Materials Laboratory of the University of Illinois , and two private companies specializing in electron microscopy , the FEI Company headquartered in Portland , Oregon , and CEOS of Heidelberg , Germany .
Now that TEAM 0.5 's basic systems are operational , additional components and facilities are being completed and tuned , including a state - of - the - art control room display that shows the sample under the microscope on a flat panel resembling a wide - screen , high - definition TV .
After a long series of rigorous tests and adjustments , TEAM 0.5 will become available to outside users by October , 2008 .
Atom by atom in 3 - D
In preliminary tests at the FEI Company , before the TEAM 0.5 was shipped , NCEM 's Christian Kisielowski tested the microscope 's ability to resolve individual atoms and precisely locate their positions in three dimensions .
He made a series of images of two gold crystals connected by a " nanobridge " only a few dozen atoms wide .
From each exposure to the next , individual gold atoms could be seen changing positions .
To achieve this extraordinary resolution , TEAM 0.5 embodies technical advances that have only recently become possible , including ultra-stable electronics , improved aberration correctors , and an extremely bright electron source .
Spherical aberration degrades images , making points of light look like disks , and correcting it can make dramatic improvements to image resolution .
( This was famously demonstrated in 1993 , when spherical aberration in the Hubble Space Telescope 's optical lenses was corrected in a special space mission . )
In the case of electron microscopes , a series of multipole magnetic lenses of varying geometries shapes the electron beam .
" Correcting spherical aberration in an electron microscope has long been possible in theory , " says Dahmen .
" But only recently has it become practical , because today 's stable electronics reduce drift and fast computers allow continuous adjustments in real time . "
Corrector technology has even become available commercially , says Dahmen , " but no off - the - shelf corrector can match TEAM 0.5 's ability to compensate even higher - order aberrations . "
Correcting spherical aberration makes it possible to use the TEAM 0.5 not only for broad - beam , " wide - angle " images but also for scanning transmission electron microscopy ( STEM ) , in which the tightly focused electron beam is moved across the sample as a probe , capable of performing spectroscopy on one atom at a time — an ideal way to precisely locate impurities in an otherwise homogeneous sample , such as individual dopant atoms in a semiconductor material .
Aberration correction is also essential for another advanced feature of TEAM 0.5 : its ability to maintain high resolution with lower electron beam energies .
" Low energy electrons have longer wavelengths , so they are harder to focus , " Dahmen explains .
" Aberration correction allows better than one - angstrom resolution with excellent contrast even at 80 kilovolts .
This is important when you do n't want to damage the sample with a high - energy beam — in biological studies , for example . "
It 's not just high resolution that makes TEAM 0.5 the world 's best microscope , Dahmen says .
When all the electrons in the beam focus at the same plane , image contrast and signal - to - noise ratio improve tremendously .
" It 's because the signal - to - noise ratio is so good that you can adjust focus atom by atom , with enough sensitivity to obtain information about the three - dimensional atomic structure of a single nanoparticle . "
Dahmen adds , " This brings us within reach of meeting the great challenge posed by the famous physicist Richard Feynman in 1959 : the ability to analyze any chemical substance simply by looking to see where the atoms are . "
The position of individual atoms in a structure can be determined by taking images at different angles , from which the computer reconstructs a 3 - D tomograph of the sample , as in a CAT scan .
To make this possible an innovative system capable of tilting and rotating the sample , and moving it up , down , or sideways under the electron beam , is also being developed at NCEM .
Much smaller than sample stages now in use , the new TEAM stage will be housed entirely inside the microscope column .
Manipulating the sample by such methods as minute piezoelectric " crawlers " that change shape when electricity is applied , the new stage will be able to control and reproduce the sample 's position and attitude with an accuracy of less than a billionth of a meter .
Installation of the new stage must await the next phase of the TEAM Project : the TEAM I microscope , due to be set up at NCEM early in 2009 .
While TEAM 0.5 corrects spherical aberration in both the " probe " beam ( the electron beam before it strikes the sample ) and the image beam ( after it exits the sample , but before it reaches the detector ) , TEAM I will also correct chromatic aberration in the image beam , which has never beeen accomplished before .
Spherical aberration is caused by the shape of a lens ; chromatic aberration results when a lens refracts light or electrons of different wavelengths ( different colors or energies ) at different angles .
" Correcting chromatic aberration is harder and takes more space , " says Dahmen .
" The chromatic aberration corrector will add two feet to the height of the TEAM I column .
But the new configuration will also allow us to enlarge the gap between the pole pieces , into which the sample fits .
In TEAM 0.5 this gap is only about two millimeters , so we have to use traditional outside - mounted sample stages , with limited space to manipulate the sample .
In TEAM I the gap will be five millimeters ; the sample stage will have much greater freedom of movement . "
New vistas in the realm of the small
TEAM 0.5 and TEAM I will be housed side by side at NCEM for some time , occupying the two multistory " silos " that until recently were the homes of the historic High - Voltage Electron Microscope and the Atomic Resolution Microscope , the most powerful microscopes in the world when NCEM was established in the early 1980s .
Ambitious as those microscopes were in their day , says TEAM's Project Manager , Peter Denes of the Engineering Division , " when the TEAM Project was launched in 2004 , it was not quite clear if the goals could even be achieved .
The electron microscopy community had never done a collaborative project like TEAM before , and certainly not with full DOE project - management rigor . "
Says Denes , " Perhaps the biggest contributor to success was a series of scientific workshops that contributed to forming a converging opinion on what the next steps would be , and what would constitute success .
That helped in getting everyone — if not quite on the same page — at least in the same book . "
Dahmen agrees .
" This is a big jump for the microscopy community .
TEAM 's success will open the door to other ambitious developments around the world . "
Dahmen suggests at least two broad categories of researchers who will benefit from the powerful new electron microscopes : experts with sophisticated microscopy problems to solve , and scientists less familiar with electron microscopy but with a particular problem for which microscopy can provide the answer .
" For example , Jim Zuo at the University of Illinois is doing studies of electron diffraction from the surface of single nanoparticles , " Dahmen says .
" He sees evidence of surface contraction .
But when we at NCEM do imaging of similar nanoparticles , we find that the surface is expanding .
Jim looks forward to using the TEAM microscope because it can do diffraction and imaging of the same particle at the same time — a grand experiment , and the only way to solve the apparent contradiction . "
An example of a problem - solving nonspecialist , says Dahmen , might be a materials scientist who has created a new kind of nanostructure , such as a tetrapod semiconductor , and needs to know exactly where in this complex , three - dimensional shape the impurity atoms reside .
" TEAM 's ability to image the structure in 3 - D through tomography and its ability to do spectroscopy with single - atom sensitivity can identify each kind of atom at each position in the structure .
That has never been possible before . "
The basic TEAM components of aberration correction , enhanced signal - to - noise ratio , single - atom sensitivity , and an ultrabright beam that can be used in both TEM and STEM modes — all the while manipulating the sample in the beam — are goals that until recently seemed at the very edge of technological daring .
All are on track , and some have been solved ahead of schedule .
The TEAM Project 's continuing success , signaled by the installation of TEAM 0.5 at NCEM , has opened the possibility of numerous future advances in electron microscopy that were barely conceivable when TEAM was launched .
The multi-institutional TEAM project represents a new kind of distributed planning and cooperation for the electron microscope community , moving beyond the limited , incremental improvements of individual investigators and harnessing the power of collaboration .
Argonne National Laboratory is leading the development of the chromatic - aberration corrector in close collaboration with CEOS in Heidelberg .
The University of Illinois 's Frederick Seitz Materials Laboratory is jointly developing the new piezoelectric - controlled sample stage with Berkeley Lab's NCEM , and Oak Ridge National Laboratory is helping to optimize the new probe corrector .
NCEM acts as project leader to integrate the individual components into single instruments , in close collaboration with all other TEAM partners .

Candidates back impeachment hearing
By Portland Press Herald Staff Report
PORTLAND — Two Democratic congressional candidates from southern Maine are applauding Rep. Mike Michaud for calling for impeachment hearings on Vice President Dick Cheney .
In a letter sent last month , Michaud , D - Maine , urged House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers to schedule impeachment hearings before the end of current congressional session .
The letter cited “ serious allegations ” that the vice president played a role in mischaracterizing prewar intelligence , outing CIA agent Valerie Plame , and abusing detainees , among other issues .
Michaud ’s call is being echoed by state Sen. Ethan Strimling and York County District Attorney Mark Lawrence , both of whom are Democratic candidates for Congress .
“ We need an investigation into the abuses of this administration , and there are many of them , ”  Strimling said in a statement , “ and impeachment hearings will provide an opportunity to get facts on the table . ” 
Lawrence said in a press release : “ If Congress does not act to hold our leaders accountable , their unprecedented expansion of executive power will become a dangerous precedent . ” 
Both Strimling and Lawrence have previously stated their support for impeachment proceedings against the vice president .
They are among six Democratic candidates running to succeed Democratic Rep. Tom Allen , who is challenging Sen. Susan Collins .
The other four Democratic candidates are Michael Brennan of Portland , Adam Cote of Portland , Steve Meister of Winthrop and Chellie Pingree of North Haven .
The Republican candidates are Dean Scontras of Eliot and Charles Summers of Scarborough .

I do n’t know if any of you have ever seen ‘ Brides of Franc ’ ( RTE1 Tuesdays ) but if you have n’t you should gouge out your eyes right now t...
When it comes to U.S. policy in Iraq , we ’ve thankfully seen some progress on the security front , but the administration ’s so - called “ surge ” has fallen far short of its goals .
The White House and the Maliki government established a series of benchmarks earlier this year , nearly all of which have gone unmet .
Political reconciliation , ostensibly the purpose of the surge , remains non-existent .
If you ask Iraqis about how best to achieve political progress , they ’ll offer a helpful perspective .
Iraqis of all sectarian and ethnic groups believe that the U.S. military invasion is the primary root of the violent differences among them , and see the departure of “ occupying forces ” as the key to national reconciliation , according to focus groups conducted for the U.S. military last month . [ … ]
Dated December 2007 , the report notes that “ the Iraqi government has still made no significant progress toward its fundamental goal of national reconciliation . ”
Asked to describe “ the current situation in Iraq to a foreign visitor , ” some groups focused on positive aspects of the recent security improvements .
But “ most would describe the negative elements of life in Iraq beginning with the ‘ U.S. occupation ’ in March 2003 , ” the report says .
To be sure , Gen. Petraeus & Co. are putting their most encouraging spin on the focus - group results .
The WaPo noted , “ At the very least , analysts optimistically concluded , the findings indicate that Iraqis hold some ’ shared beliefs ’ that may eventually allow them to surmount the divisions that have led to a civil war . ”
Yes , I suppose that ’s true .
But if those “ shared beliefs ” include the notion that we ’re an “ occupying force ” responsible for ruining Iraqis ’ lives , is n’t it a little difficult to be “ optimistic ” ?

Some women refuse to go to university because of the ban
The Islamist - rooted ruling AK Party and the nationalist MHP said it was an issue of human rights and freedoms .
Together the two parties have enough votes in parliament to overturn the constitutional ban on headscarves .
Headscarves were banned in schools and universities in 1980 after a coup by the pro-secular armed forces .
The Turkish army sees itself as the guardian of the secular tradition laid out by Kemal Ataturk , who created the modern Turkish state - secular , but Muslim majority - out of the ruins of the Ottoman empire after World War I .
It regards the public wearing of headscarves as a political statement aimed at undermining secular principles .
' Rights and freedoms '
However , opinion polls suggest there is strong public support for lifting the ban .
And some women refuse to go to university because of it .
" The issue of the headscarf was evaluated in terms of rights and freedoms , " the two parties said in a statement .
A power struggle last year between secular forces and the governing AK Party ended with the AKP being comprehensively re-elected in July .
It is not yet clear how the secular elite - army generals , judges and university officials - will react to the government 's latest move .

I keep my life in a subversion repository .
For the past five years , every file I 've created and worked on , every email I 've sent or received , and every config file I 've tweaked have all been checked into revision control .
Five years ago when I started doing this , using CVS , people thought I was nuts to use revision control in this way .
Today it 's still not a common practice , but thanks to my earlier article , CVS homedir ( Linux Journal issue 101 ) , I know I 'm not alone .
In this article I will describe how my new home directory setup is working , now that I 've switched from CVS to subversion .
Subversion is a revision control system , and like the earlier and much cruftier CVS , it 's meant to be used for managing chunks of code , such as free software programs that are worked on by many developers , or in - house software projects that are collaborated on by several employees .
Unlike CVS , subversion has reasonable handling of directories and file renaming , which is more than sufficient reason to switch to it if you 're already using CVS , and most of CVS 's other misfeatures are also fixed .
But subversion still has its warts , such as an inability to store some file permissions and its need for twice as much disk space as you 'd expect thanks to the copies of everything in those .svn directories .
These problems can be quite annoying when you 're keeping your whole home directory in svn .
So why bother ?
I see three main benefits of keeping my entire home directory in svn :
home directory replication
history
distributed backups
The first of these is what originally drove me to using revision control for my whole home directory , and is still the greatest benefit of it today .
I have many accounts on unix machines scattered around my house , the country , and the planet , and I have an abiding desire for every single one of these disparate accounts to work and look exactly the same .
I do n't care if the machine I 'm logging into is in Japan or the Netherlands , or a California co-location center , or my home office ; I do n't care if it 's a PC clone , or a Mac , or a S/390 virtual machine ; if it 's not set up the same as all the others , if I cannot concentrate on the important differences instead of being distracted by the unimportant differences , then I will be less productive .
The final ingredient for configuration insanity is that I 'm constantly tweaking my setup , and as soon as I make an improvement , I want it to be available on every one of my accounts , everywhere .
Without subversion , keeping all these accounts in sync would be well - nigh impossible .
With subversion it's as easy as typing " svn up " now and then .
It seems that the next big change in how we use computers might be the introduction of filesystems that store every old version of every file .
With the explosion in size of cheap hard disks there seems to be no reason not to keep a complete record of your computing life , and several research projects are working on it .
Meanwhile , I 've been doing just that for five years , using first CVS and now svn .
It 's amazing to check out my home directory as it looked on Christmas day , 1999 , and play around in it .
It 's neat to be able to look at the entire revision history of my . procmailrc , and watch as I moved mail around , dealt with the growing spam problem , and joined and left many mailing lists .
It 's handy to be able to run " svn diff " on my kernel config file to see how " make xconfig " changed it .
I can recover files that I 've deleted , or delete files because they 're not relevant right now , and know I 've not really lost them at all .
Amazingly my subversion repository is only 4 gigabytes in size for all this historical data .
I have not lost a file since 1999 .
And I do n't intend to , ever again .
Take one crucial file , like my resume or sent - mail archive .
I have a copy of that file on my desktop computer in the .svn directory .
There 's another copy on my home directory on my laptop , and yet another copy in the subversion repository on my server thousands of miles away .
I 'm told that the best backups are done without effort -- so you actually do them -- and are widely scattered among many machines and a lot of area -- so a local disaster does n't knock them out -- and are tested on a regular basis -- to make sure the backup works .
I 'm doing all of these things , as a mere side effect of keeping it all in subversion .
To complete the picture , I only have to be sure to take very careful backups of my subversion repository itself .
The automated distributed backups via svn keep me sleeping quietly at night -- I know that no matter what I do my life will still be there , safe and secure in svn .
At this point I should fess up to my dirty little secret :
Not everything is in svn after all .
My full home directory with all the trimmings often runs to the dozens of gigabytes .
Much of that is collections of music files and documentation , which I have not yet dared to check into svn , and which I rsync between computers .
As disk sizes continue to grow , it 's looking more and more likely that I will take the plunge soon and check these large file libraries into svn too .
Then too I have the occasional file , such as a disk image for a virtual machine , which is too large and much bother to check into svn .
And my incoming mailboxes are not kept in svn because that would lead to a merging nightmare -- instead I use offlineimap to keep them synchronized between several computers .
The mail archives do get checked into svn , by a cron job .
A few other missing corners include my web browser cache , which I would love to have a history of , and my temporary directory , which I 'd rather not .
I have made some progress recently in moving more things into svn .
I 've managed to check the /etc directories of several machines into svn .
While this is of questionable value as a way to replicate those machines , and some files like /etc / shadow are not included , it 's useful to be able to check old versions of config files .
I 've also come up with a way to check crontabs into svn .
This is a great improvement , since I can edit and view any machine 's cron jobs from anywhere , and have all the history and backup benefits of svn .
I 'm sure that my use of svn will only increase as I find ways to use it in the odd little corners that remain .
Yesterday I even found myself checking baby photos into svn for my family 's website .
Time to get down to the details of how I organize my home directory in svn .
I speak of my svn repository , but I actually have several repositories .
First there 's the public one , which holds most of the less private parts of my home directory , and lots of software projects .
You can even browse the contents of this directory on the web at svn. kitenet .
net , or check it out anonymously from svn://svn.kitenet.net/joey/ .
Next I have a private repository that holds things like my email archives , and I have several other small special purpose repositories .
I also work on other projects which are themselves kept in svn , on other servers .
A full checkout of my home directory will include parts from all of these repositories ; the svn:externals feature of svn lets me knit them all together into a whole that I can check out or update with a single command .
I 've always managed my home directory with an iron hand , and keeping files in revision control has only exacerbated this tendency .
Let 's look at the top level :
joey@dragon :~>ls Maildir / bin/ doc/ html / lib/ mail / src/ tmp /
That really is everything , except for 100 + dot - files .
Most people use their home directory a cluttered scratch space for files they 're working on , and subversion is more suited to this kind of work than CVS , since it lets you easily rename and move files and directories .
My tightly controlled home directory is partly personal preference and partly a leftover from my days as a CVS user .
Keeping a home directory in subversion does encourage some neatness , since svn will complain about files that are not checked in .
This encourages keeping things organized , or out of the way in a temporary directory .
Since my home directory is publically available online , I have to take care to keep private files private , and one tricky thing is private dotfiles .
These need to be in my home directory , but I can't keep them in the public repository .
To manage this , I keep all the private dotfiles in ~/.hide , which is stored in an entirely different , private subversion repository .
The private dotfiles in ~/.hide have to be symlinked into my home directory to be used , and for this I have a svnfix program that symlinks them into my home directory , as well as doing some permissions fixing and other symlinking , and even updating my crontab from svn .
I have to remember to run this program from time to time , or put a call to it in my crontab , since there is no way to add a client - side hook in subversion , or CVS for that matter .
My ~/.hide directory is just one of several subversion repositories that are pulled into my home directory by subversion 's useful svn:externals feature .
My ~/src subdirectory , which holds various code projects I 'm working on , is an even better example , as some of its contents come from repositories shared with others .
joey@dragon :~>ls src Words2 Nums / debconf / filters / packages / sleepd / alien / debhelper / flashybrid / pdmenu / tasksel / apt - src/ debian - cd / kernel / sarge / ticker / base - config / debian - edu / misc / secure - testing / unreleased / d- i/ dpkg - repack / mooix / skolelinux / wmbattery / joey@dragon :~> svn propget svn:externals src mooix

After I use the svn propedit command to add external repositories , they are pulled in and become subdirectories in my home directory that behave , mostly , as if they are part of the same larger repository .
This is a great feature , and it has uses beyond including directories from other repositories .
On many of the machines I use , I do n't need my entire home direcotry checkout , and so my home directory is more minimal .
joey@elephant : ~>ls bin/ tmp /
I use this machine for occasional development .
It 's not a fully trusted machine , so I do n't want to put private files there .
So I 've got a branch of my home directory that includes ( using svn:externals ) only the basics and is perfectly usable for everything I normally do on that machine .
Using svn:externals like this to pull in optional directories keeps the part of my home directory that I have to branch ( and merge ) small .
When I want to check out my home directory to a new account , I run one of these commands :
% svn co svn+ssh://joey@svn.kitenet.net /svn/joey/trunk/home-base . % svn co svn+ssh://joey@svn.kitenet.net /svn/joey/trunk/home-full .
The first is the minimal version of my home directory , the other is the whole thing .
The dots at the end of the command lines make svn check it out directly into my home directory .
I switched from CVS to svn over a painful couple of months in the winter of 2003 .
CVS had many misfeatures that made keeping a home directory in it annoying , and I 'm glad I do n't have to worry anymore about picking file and directory names ( svn can easily rename them ; cvs could n't ) , that svn can handle binary files well and efficiently ( unlike CVS ) , that svn is quite a bit faster at updating large home directories than CVS , that managing branches is so much easier with svn that I actually have some branches of my home directory , and that those annoying " CVS " directories that once cluttered up every corner of my home directory have gone away .
The transition from CVS to svn would be easier today , since the conversion software has improved , but such a large conversion between revision control systems is bound to be a slow and painstaking process .
It 's interesting to think that the longevity of my home directory 's history is not limited to the useful lifetime of a given revision control system , or even the lifetime a given computer platform .
Converting repositories of past revision control systems seems likely to be something new systems will continue to support , and if I one day switch to arch , or a distant future relative of arch and svn , I fully expect to take my history with me when I go .
Before I go , I want to thank the hundreds of readers who responded to my original article about keeping my life in CVS .
Thanks for your encouragement , your ideas , and for letting me know I was n't as crazy as I thought .
And yes , as you can see , I finally have switched to subversion !
Now I 'm off to commit this file ..

How do they want to achieve their changes ?
( as indicated by their temperament ,
their campaigns , and to some extent , their policies . )
What role do they see for the government ?
What is their character ?
( which can be very subjective – but is still basic to understanding any candidate . )
Obama and Hillary agree to a large extent on the first two questions .
Arguably , they agree on the general role of government as well .
In terms of character there are significant differences , but those are more subjective – and not something I want to delve into at the moment .
The real conflict between Obama and Clinton is on how to achieve change .
And it is why I came to believe in Obama ’s approach and to reject Clinton in such strong terms .
The past few weeks have only solidified my position .
Obama believes in change that is gradual , driven by the grassroots , and done through an open and transparent process .
Clinton believes in imposing policies from Washington and using whatever means are necessary to achieve whatever change she can .
Obama and Clinton are both only proposing minor changes in policy so far .
But Obama is proposing major changes in the process , which he has indicated will lead to lasting and substantial changes in policy .
I believe – as does Senator Obama – that America is not on the wrong track because the president has been steering the country wrong – like a captain setting the wrong course on a ship in working order , but because the processes which drive our policy and actions and politics have become distorted – as if the ship , still afloat and strong , needed repairs and maintenance .

European aerospace company EADS unveiled a model of a jet designed to take tourists into space on Wednesday , rocketing paying passengers to weightlessness 100 km above the earth 's surface .
EADS Astrium said it hoped the space jet - which looks much like a conventional aircraft , though it is outfitted with rocket engines - will be operational by next year , with the first flight scheduled for 2012 .
Tickets are expected to sell for 150,000 to 200,000 euro ( $ 317,000 to $ 240,00 ) , said the company , which presented a full - scale model of the craft in Paris .

[ We 've linked Andrew Doull , who runs the Ascii Dreams weblog and develops the Roguelike game Unangband a few times on GSW recently , after he previously helped us cover the Edinburgh Interactive Festival for Gamasutra .
In this guest editorial , he considers what game mechanics just are n't utilized enough in video games today . ]
In the spirit of everyone else doing ' 20 game clichés we thought we 'd repeat for you ' lists at the moment , I 've written a 20 under - used game mechanics list that 'll hopefully at least give you some game design suggestions .
No pictures - I do n't want to pad out the reading time unnecessarily .
1. Asymmetric Co-op :
The game has a playable co-op mode , but the second player has different abilities from the first .
Whether it 's collecting star fragments , shooting colour drops or rising out of the ground to bust heads , allowing a second player to drop in for some lighter entertainment without needing the l33t skillz of the main gamer in the room is a sure - fire winner .
Idea from : Wizball .
Druid .
Super Mario Galaxy .
2. Bad-Ass Boss Fight :
You want to know how tough the bad guy is ?
Play as him , before you fight him .
Then you can really justify your inability to beat him .
Idea from : Marvel Nemesis : The Rise of the Imperfects .
3. Design Your Own : Design the dungeon , then play through it .
You can't blame anyone else for the problems with the architecture .
Idea from : Dungeon Maker : Hunting Ground .
Who raved about it : Clive Thompson in Wired Magazine .
4. Not Re-Using Mini- bosses :
You 've all had those games when you get to the mini-boss , and have to pull out the stops to beat them .
Then , on the next level , the same mini - boss is back .
Multiple times .
The idea is as old as Ghosts 'n ' Goblins .
Well here 's another idea .
Don't .
Idea from : Darwinia .
Who raved about it : Kieren Gillon in Eurogamer .
5. Letting You Fight Fights
You 're Intended to Lose :
You 've been betrayed by Athena and shrunk back from god - like dimensions to normal size .
Then Zeus sucks the rest of your power out of you by tricking you into channelling it into a sword .
You 're left weak and bleeding , unable to even move faster than a stagger .
And still you have to fight .
Idea from : God of War II .
Who raved about it : N'Gai Croal in the inaugural Vs mode discussion .
6. Interactive Cut -Scenes ( But not Quick Time Events ) :
If you 're going to be stuck in cut - scenes telling part of the story , you may as well make them interactive .
And I 'm not talking about hiding unimplemented game - play behind a Quick Time Event - I 'm talking about looking down Eva's top in Metal Gear Solid 3 , or completely changing the outcome of the final cut scene in Soul Calibur .
Idea from : Soul Calibur .
7. Breaking the Fourth Wall :
Whether it was showing you the Game Over screen prematurely , or telling you that you 've been playing long enough , there 's not enough games that break the fourth wall and talk to you the player , as opposed to the character you 're playing .
Or for that matter , deceive gamers about which character they 'll end up playing .
Idea from : Metal Gear Solid 2 .
Who raved about it : Tim Rogers in " dreaming in an empty room "
8. Moving the Controller :
And if there was one way to really break the fourth wall , it was for a computer game to reach out and cause your controller to move without you touching it .
A heart - stopping moment for many a game - player .
Not enough games make you look on the jewel case for clues these days either .
Idea from : Metal Gear Solid .
Who raved about it : Practically everyone who played the game .
9. Upwards Preference :
Get the player to look up early in the game .
Use it to figure out whether they prefer regular or inverted mouse - look .
It 's not a hard thing to do .
So why do so few games do it ?
( I know this is an Xbox console setting now .
Hiding the option elsewhere in the user interface still does n't solve it though . )
Idea from : King Kong .
10 . Vengeance is Mine : First you sneak past them , then you kill them .
It could be a Tyrannosaurus Rex in King Kong , or a gang of Outlaws in Call of Juarez .
The opportunity to turn the tables and lay the smack down is not one to be missed .
Idea from : Call of Juarez .
Who raved about it : Kieron Gillen in Eurogamer .
11 . Seeing the Consequences : Re-encountering the same scene as from a different point of view suddenly gives you a whole new perspective on events .
Half - Life gives you the opportunity to go back to the Xen teleport chamber in both expansions , while Fahrenheit and Call of Juarez allow you to see the same scenes as both the pursued and the pursuers .
Idea from : Fahrenheit .
Who raved about it : Michael Filby from Jolt.co.uk .
12 . Setting the Environment on Fire : Sure , physics engines are great .
And destructible environments will be ' teh next - gen ' as soon as they catch technology up with the likes of X - Com .
And you can set fire to enemies in lots of games .
But nothing goes better with marshmallows than watching half a hillside go up in smoke from a single match .
Games should bring the pyromaniac out in all of us .
There needs to be more first - person shooters in burning buildings as well .
Idea from : King Kong .
Who raved about it : Kristan Reed in Eurogamer .
13 . Playing with Scale :
There 's nothing quite like scaling tall buildings , crushing people beneath your feet and watching the screaming multitudes fleeing in front of you .
Psychonauts ?
King Kong ?
Katamari Darmacy ?
The end of God of War ?
Pick one - they 're all good at it .
The re-use of the sword level in God of War is a particular standout - arguably one of the best level designs ever .
Idea from : Katamari Damacy
Who raved about it : Tom Bramwell in Eurogamer .
14 . Better Level
Themes :
You 've played games with the lava level .
The ice level .
The sewer level .
Well how about a game with the Milkman level ?
The disco level .
The Escher level .
The Meat Circus level .
Welcome to Psychonauts .
Idea from : Psychonauts .
Who raved about it : Yahtzee throws down the praise and back - hands you .
15 . Designing the Level to Let You Use Your Toys : Bridge littered with the debris of cars moved into make - shift blockades .
Check .
Concrete barriers behind which terrorists are cowering .
Check .
An M203 grenade launcher and enough ammunition to take all of them out .
Check .
Survival horrors and low ammunition be damned .
If you give me something shiny , I want to be able to play with it to my hearts content .
Shame on those games that give you sniper rifles without suitable draw distances , or rocket launchers in twisty corridors .
Idea from : Black .
Who raved about it : Kristan Reed in Eurogamer .
16 . Adding Things to Photographs :
The photograph collection mechanic has been used well - arguably over - used in some games .
But the photographs tend to turn up - well , just like you took them .
What you really want is a game where the photos you take , and the resulting pictures have disparate elements - ghosts in the background , missing objects , weird aliens like in They Live .
It could be a whole mechanic in itself , but sadly , just a nice Easter egg in the example below .
Idea from : Metal Gear Solid 2 .
17 . Economy of Design : Stop using a game - mechanic when it stops being interesting .
We 've played with the toys - it 's time to put them back in the pram and move on .
The whole of Portal is an exercise in economy of design - once you 've learnt how to do something , you 're only ever asked a few times to expand on it .
I mean , the weighted companion cube appears on one freakin ' level and already has its own fan clubs .
So is some of the mechanics in Half - Life 2 - in particular the pheropod .
Idea from : Portal
Who raved about it : Every game journalist this year .
18 . Annotating Maps :
The in - game map - an abused and reviled mechanic if there ever was one .
The only way to pep it up is to let you draw on it like you used to as a kid .
And if you 're really lucky , mum will let you put in the oven afterwards so it can curl up and look , like , really old ...
Idea from : Zelda : The Phantom Hour - Glass .
Who raved about it : Tom Bramwell in Eurogamer .
19 . Telling the End of the Story First : Kratos stands at the edge of a cliff .
He is heavy with despair .
He slumps forward , taking a final step and tumbling into the abyss towards the rocks below .
Sure , they cheated in the end with a deus ex machina .
But you want to find out how such a kick - ass character wanted to top himself .
Hell , build a game where you 're forced to fail a scenario , go back three years earlier , and then have to replay the events , with additional information that 'll help you beat it the second time around .
Idea from : God of War .
Who raved about it : Kristan Reed in Eurogamer .
20 . Falling Action / Playable Denouement :
You 've saved the world .
Just seen the biggest explosion ever .
Fled out of the castle as it crumbles around you .
And the credits roll .
Well , howabout for once , let you actually enjoy the moment .
Kratos gets to run up to the steps to Mount Olympus .
Call of Duty 4 goes all slow - mo on you .
Grand Theft Auto - well , it never gets dull .
Idea from : Grand Theft Auto .
Who raved about it : Stephen Totilo in MTV Multiplayer .
It ’s a tie .
Two marketers , same category .
My criteria :
focus on authentic storytelling
ability to not just use the web for marketing purposes , but to let the web drive the entire tone of marketing and product development
desire to push through the dip and to either quit or win
willingness to stand out and do things that people want to talk about
guts to avoid burning the permission asset of supporters by spamming them to senselessness
Both winners built world - famous brands in less than a year of effort .
Both paid for their marketing largely through self - liquidating campaigns on the web itself .
And neither one of them has a job you will ever likely have .
Which makes it even easier to learn from their work as marketers .
In two days we find out if either one of them actually built a marketing campaign that worked .
It really does n’t matter , though .
The fact that they ’ve gotten this far ( with diametrically opposed points of view , by the way ) is proof that this marketing thing is n’t just a fad .
You ’ve probably guessed my two winners : Ron Paul and Barack Obama .
Who would have guessed two years ago that without much help at all from the establishment , either would be where they are today ?
That ’s the power of the new marketing .
If you want to read more , in order , my books on this : All Marketers are Liars , Meatball Sundae , The Dip , Purple Cow , Permission Marketing .
If you have to drive tonight , do n’t drink , okay ?
Happy New Year !

LAS VEGAS —CES is best known for what seems like miles and miles of shiny consumer electronics , product demos , and expansive booths .
But some of the most interesting action takes place off the beaten track of the show floor , in meeting rooms where players from opposite ends of the tech world come to discuss the issues of the day .
Such was the case at this year 's show .
In a discussion called " The True Cost of DRM : What Can't We Do Now ? " moderated by Paul Sweeting of Content Agenda , four panelists had different takes on impact of DRM over the past decade , while managing to agree that , when it comes to music , DRM is indeed dead .
The panelists included Patricia Aufderheide of American University , coauthor of a recent fair use primer for online content creators ; Russ Frackman , a partner at the law firm of Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp who specializes in copyright , trademark , entertainment , IP , and technology litigation ; Jonathan Lee , VP of business development for content - protection company Media Defender ; Ian Rogers , general manager of Yahoo !
Music ; and EFF staff attorney Fred von Lohmann .
Ian Rogers began by making the pronouncement that DRM is done when it comes to music .
" When it comes to music , we 're set , " he said .
" Next question : do we have to go through all of this nonsense with video ? "
The answer , unfortunately , appears to be a resounding yes .
" I think DRM in video is robust and healthy , and we 'll be stuck with it for a long time , " said von Lohmann , who then brought up a point we 've touched upon repeated here at Ars over the years .
" [ DRM ] is not about piracy .
AACS has been broken and stayed broken through 2007 , " explained von Lohmann .
" It 's about controlling competition and eliminating disruptive innovation .
If you want to play my content , I get to tell you how to build your player . "
Surprisingly , Jonathan Lee of Media Defender agreed .
" DRM is not an antipiracy tool , " he said .
" What we 've seen in P2P networks is that DRM has n't slowed it down at all .
It just takes one person to crack it and it spreads virally ...
DRM and lawsuits really have n't changed the population , throughput , or bandwidth that is being consumed . "
Much of the problem stems from the music industry refusing to give customers what they want for so long , Rogers argued .
Drawing on his experience with Nullsoft in the late 1990s , he characterized the labels as being more concerned with creating scarcity where none was possible .
" They have created such a large opportunity for pirated material by not giving people what they want , " he concluded .
Lee also shared some similar experiences , but then said that it's a mistake to pigeonhole labels as obstinately refusing to do the right thing .
" There are some bright people [ at the labels ] who want to do some interesting things . "
It 's apparent that the labels are finally listening to the bright people , given the way that DRM is being dropped from the big four labels ' catalogs and how the industry has embraced DRM - free streaming services like iMeem .
From DRM to filtering
Speaking up for the rights - holders , IP attorney Russ Frackman was quick to argue that infringement is still a major problem .
" Everyone on the panel recognizes that there 's a real piracy problem that has been facilitated by the Internet , " he said .
" We all know that a lot of what is going on with P2P sites is widespread , full - scale copying with viral distribution of the material .
Copyright owners are justifiably looking or a way to combat it . "
The discussion then turned to the question of whether filtering was a " reasonable approach " towards achieving the content owners ' goals of controlling the unauthorized spread of content and how much the economic burden of developing effective filters should factor into the discussion .
Professor Aufderheide expressed a well - founded concern that purely technological measures were inadequate to task , given the future of culture .
" What 's at stake here are really the core values of our political culture : freedom of expression and the First Amendment , and second , the core of copyright law , the fomenting of new culture , " Aufderheide claimed .
" That really can't be defended on the basis of whether it 's going to be expensive or cheap for Viacom to address this issue . "
Frackman took issue with Aufderheide 's singling out of Viacom .
" What about the other side of the equation ?
How much are YouTube and Google going to pay ? " he asked .
" They built a filter Viacom did n't pay for , " countered von Lohmann .
The panel was then asked if the key for content creators was monetizing piracy .
Von Lohmann and Lee agreed that it was , while Frackman said that monetizing piracy legitimizes it .
" When you monetize piracy , you 're saying that it 's no longer piracy , " he argued .
" Copyright holders may determine that it 's best not to license certain uses because they impinge on other uses .
" What we 're missing here is the third leg of the stool , " he continued .
" We 're not talking about the businesses that use copyrighted material for their own commercial purposes .
What is their obligation to filter ? "
Frackman the brought the Grokster case into the discussion , saying that failure to effectively filter could leave companies open to a finding of infringement .
That 's the crux of the issue , especially in the Viacom v. YouTube copyright infringement lawsuit .
Viacom , like other rightsholders , believes that many UGC sites have a business model built on infringement , profiting from their users posting content without permission .
UGC sites argue that the onus of copyright enforcement is on the rightsholders .
A consortium of companies including the major TV networks , Viacom , and Microsoft last fall published a set of user - generated content principles .
While nodding in the direction of fair use , the principles would require sites to employ filters that would prevent infringing content from ever being made available .
Those do n't go far enough , argued von Lohmann .
" Video fingerprinting is very primitive .
Fair use is hard , as it requires a human to look at the video .
There 's no filter near being capable of separating fair use from something that 's not fair use . "
That 's why the EFF , Public Knowledge , and a handful of other groups posted a set of UGC copyright principles of their own .
Those principles would keep " fair use dolphins " from being ensnared in a net intended for " infringing tuna . "
" I 'm thrilled I 'm not part of the industry that has to solve the problem , " cracked Aufderheide .
Continuing on a more serious note , she said that the creative issues are critical to the discussion .
" We are really talking about the emergence of a whole new participatory culture , the emergence of a new and potentially dominant set of cultural practices . "
Unfortunately for both the industry and users , there are no easy solutions for the quandaries everyone is facing .
For a free culture to thrive , users need to be able to use content in new and transformative ways ; indeed , that 's much of what Hollywood does .
But for content creators to thrive , they need to be compensated to a degree that makes producing new content a worthwhile endeavor .
In the best of all possible worlds , it would be an issue for the market to sort out .
But when content creators are using technological measures to hamstring consumers who want to consume content on their own terms , the sorting out process becomes far more difficult , if not downright impossible .

A report by the Oxford Research Group ( ORG ) said a “ fundamental re-think is required ” if the global terrorist network is to be rendered ineffective .
“ If the al Qaeda movement is to be countered , then the roots of its support must be understood and systematically undercut , ” said Paul Rogers , the report ’s author and professor of global peace studies at Bradford University in northern England .
“ Combined with conventional policing and security measures , al Qaeda can be contained and minimized but this will require a change in policy at every level . ”
He described the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq as a “ disastrous mistake ” which had helped establish a “ most valued jihadist combat training zone ” for al Qaeda supporters .
The report -- Alternatives to the War on Terror -- recommended the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Iraq coupled with intensive diplomatic engagement in the region , including with Iran and Syria .
In Afghanistan , Rogers also called for an immediate scaling down of military activities , an injection of more civil aid and negotiations with militia groups aimed at bringing them into the political process .
If such measures were adopted it would still take “ at least 10 years to make up for the mistakes made since 9/11 . ”
“ Failure to make the necessary changes could result in the war on terror lasting decades , ” the report added .
Rogers also warned of a drift toward conflict with Iran .
“ Going to war with Iran ” , he said , “ will make matters far worse , playing directly into the hands of extreme elements and adding greatly to the violence across the region .
Whatever the problems with Iran , war should be avoided at all costs . ”

BROOKLYN : JUDGE FACES MORE SEVERE CHARGE Criminal charges against Justice Gerald P. Garson of State Supreme Court were raised yesterday to include bribe - receiving , three months after he was indicted on charges of accepting gifts from a lawyer in return for preferential treatment .
Justice Garson , 71 , left , was indicted yesterday on one count of third - degree bribe - receiving .
The new charge carries a maximum seven - year sentence .
The six counts of the previous charge each carry a penalty of up to four years in jail .
Prosecutors said the lawyer , Paul Siminovsky , plied Justice Garson with meals , cigars and cash , and in return , the judge advised him on how best to try matrimonial cases before him .
Justice Garson 's lawyer , Ronald P. Fischetti , said it was nonsense to describe the relationship between the judge and Mr. Siminovsky as criminal .

MANHATTAN : RULING ON BARRIERS IN CHINATOWN
A state judge has ruled that the New York Police Department must take the first steps toward removing security barricades that have angered Chinatown residents , but it stopped short of ordering the reopening of the street .
The barricades , north on Park Row from Frankfort Street to Chatham Square , helped protect nearby police headquarters after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attack .
But Chinatown residents complained they were not consulted about the street closing and were unable to invite family members or friends to their homes .
In a decision Monday , Justice Walter B. Tolub of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ordered the department to have an independent agency conduct an environmental analysis of traffic congestion and pollution .
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said yesterday that the department was studying the ruling , but that " obviously we 'll do whatever the court directs us to do . "

CENTRAL ISLIP : NASSAU REDISTRICTING
IS UPHELD
A federal judge has upheld the remapping of the Nassau County Legislature 's districts by its Democratic majority .
A lawsuit filed by the Republicans called the changes politically motivated to benefit the Democrats .
It challenged the districts as odd - shaped with unequal populations and divided communities .
In a decision dated July 31 and made public yesterday , Judge Denis R. Hurley of Federal District Court said that " redistricting is essentially a political and legislative process , " but ruled that the new districts were within federal law .

One of the seminal papers in computer science is Edsger Dijkstra 's 1968 paper GOTO Considered Harmful .
For a number of years I have been familiar with the observation that the quality of programmers is a decreasing function of the density of go to statements in the programs they produce .
More recently I discovered why the use of the go to statement has such disastrous effects , and I became convinced that the go to statement should be abolished from all " higher level " programming languages ( i.e. everything except , perhaps , plain machine code ) .
The abuse of GOTO is , thankfully , a long forgotten memory in today 's modern programming languages .
Of course , it 's only a minor hazard compared to the COMEFROM statement , but I 'm glad to have both of those largely behind us .
GOTO is n't all bad , though .
It still has some relevance to today 's code .
Along with many other programmers , I always recommend using guard clauses to avoid arrow code , and I also recommend exiting early from a loop as soon as you find the value you 're looking for .
What is an early Return , or an early Exit For other than a tightly scoped GOTO ?
foreach my $ try ( @options ) { next unless exists $ hash { $ try} ; do_something ( $try ) ; goto SUCCESS ; } log_failure ( ) ; SUCCESS : ...
The publication of such an influential paper in this particular format led to an almost immediate snowclone effect , as documented on Wikipedia :
Frank Rubin published a criticism of Dijkstra 's letter in the March 1987 CACM where it appeared as ' GOTO Considered Harmful ' Considered Harmful .
The May 1987 CACM printed further replies , both for and against , as ' " GOTO Considered Harmful " Considered Harmful ' Considered Harmful ?.
Dijkstra's own response to this controversy was titled " On a somewhat disappointing correspondence " .
That 's easily one of the funniest things I 've ever read in Wikipedia .
Who says computer scientists do n't have a sense of humor ?
But I digress .
Most software developers are probably familiar , at least in passing , with Dijkstra 's GOTO Considered Harmful .
But here 's what they might not know about it :
The paper was originally titled " A Case Against the Goto Statement " ; the editor of the CACM at the time , Niklaus Wirth , changed the title to the more inflammatory version we know today .
In order to speed up its publication , the paper was converted into a " Letter to the Editor " .
In other words , Wirth poked and prodded the content until it became incendiary , to maximize its impact .
The phrase " considered harmful " was used quite intentionally , as documented on the always excellent Language Log :
However , " X considered harmful " was already a well - established journalistic cliche in 1968 -- which is why Wirth chose it .
The illlustration below shows the headline of a letter to the New York Times published August 12 , 1949 : " Rent Control Controversy / Enacting Now of Hasty Legislation Considered Harmful " .
I 'm sure it's not the earliest example of this phrase used in a headline or title , either -- I chose it only as a convenient illustration of susage a couple of decades before the date of Dijkstra 's paper .
Note that this example is also in the title of a slightly cranky letter to the editor - it 's probably not an accident that the first example that came to hand of " considered harmful " in a pre-Dijkstra title was of this type .
So when you emulate the " considered harmful " style predicated on the work of these famous computer scientists in 1968 , keep that history in mind .
You 're emulating a slightly cranky letter to the editor .
It 's frighteningly common -- there are now 28,800 web pages with the exact phrase " considered harmful " in the title .
This leads , perhaps inevitably , to Eric Meyer 's " Considered Harmful " Essays Considered Harmful .
He points out that choosing this style of dialogue is ultimately counterproductive :
There are three primary ways in which " Considered Harmful " essays cause harm .
The writing of a " considered harmful " essay often serves to inflame whatever debate is in progress , and thus makes it that much harder for a solution to be found through any means .
Those who support the view that the essay attacks are more likely to dig in and defend their views by any means necessary , and are less receptive to reasoned debate .
By pushing the opposing views further apart , it becomes more likely that the essay will cause a permanent break between opposing views rather than contribute to a resolution of the debate .
" Considered harmful " essays are most harmful to their own causes .
The publication of a " considered harmful " essay has a strong tendency to alienate neutral parties , thus weakening support for the point of view the essay puts forth .
A sufficiently dogmatic " considered harmful " essay can end a debate in favor of the viewpoint the essay considers harmful .
They 've become boring cliches .
Nobody really wants to read " considered harmful " essays any more , because we 've seen them a thousand times before and did n't really learn anything from them , since we were too busy being annoyed to really listen to the arguments presented .
If you have a point to make , by all means , write a great persuasive essay .
If you want to maximize the effectiveness of your criticisms , however , you 'll leave " considered harmful " out of your writing .
The " considered harmful " technique may have worked for Wirth and Dijkstra , but unless you 're planning to become a world famous computer scientist like those guys , I 'd suggest leaving it back in 1968 where it belongs .
The Turing Machine Goes Public December 2 , 2007
New York , N.Y .
Many " how computers work " books written for a general audience contain a discussion of the Turing Machine .
I never quite saw the point of this .
Although the Turing Machine is great for examining the concepts of computability , I do n't think it helps at all in understanding the actual mechanism of the computer .
That 's why I did n't include an extended discussion of the Turing Machine in my own " how computers work " book , Code : The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software .
Now I 'm making up for that .
My forthcoming book , The Annotated Turing is all about the Turing Machine , including how this little invention emerged from the rarefied field of mathematical logic to become a tool for understanding ourselves and the universe in which we find ourselves .
But how did this happen ?
Who first picked up on the concept of the Turing Machine and disclosed it to the general public ?
Most of the early references are for rather specialized audiences , such as the famous Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts 1943 article " A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity . "
Norbert Wiener discusses Turing 's work in his 1948 book Cybernetics , Or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine , and the Turing Machine itself featured prominently in Stephen Kleene 's Introduction to Metamathematics ( 1952 ) and Martin Davis 's Computability and Unsolvability ( 1958 ) , but I was curious about more popular treatments .
When , I wondered , did the Turing Machine make its first appearance in a book or article not intended for mathematicians or scientists ?
After exploring my own collection of antique computer books and sorting through stuff that turns up in Google Book Search , I am 95 % certain that the Turing Machine was first presented to the general public in the 189 - page book Thinking Machines : A Layman 's Introduction to Logic , Boolean Algebra , and Computers by Irving Adler and published by the John Day Company in 1961 :
Notice the vacuum tubes in the lower - right corner of the cover !
Adler 's explanation of a Turing Machine as a function calculator that reads and writes strokes is apparently derived from Kleene 's or Davis 's book , although his brief bibliography does n't list either .
According to the Wikipedia entry on Irving Adler , he is now 94 years old and the author of 56 books .
More biographical information appears here .
If anybody knows of an earlier book or magazine article featuring a discussion of the Turing Machine for the " layman " I 'd love to hear about it .

This is deeply weird .
For hundreds of miles , the central - Florida interstate has been lined with trailer parks and parched ranch lands .
Switching to the two lanes of Highway 301 sends me along the broken - down main street of a town called Oxford , which is lined with single - story , mostly vacant redbrick houses , barbecue joints , and auto - repair shops , a reminder of the days when Florida was actually a part of the Deep South .
Then , a right turn and authentic redneck suddenly gives way to invented oasis : 33 lush , manicured golf courses .
Pods of new half - million - dollar houses , clustered behind security gates .
Man -made lakes and streams gently burbling .
This is the Villages , a 26,000 - acre , three - county development with 68,000 residents , sprawling its way to a population of 100,000 in the next ten years .
Calling the Villages a retirement community demeans the genius of the concept .
This is nothing like the slabs - of - concrete condo towers and shuffleboard courts off I -95 around Fort Lauderdale or Miami where thousands of New Yorkers , like my grandparents , fled the Northeast winters after turning 65 .
The Villages is a dreamland for the active , well - off elderly , created by a Florida real - estate magnate who is also a powerful Republican fund - raiser .
The Villages ’ “ town square ” is a brilliant piece of nostalgia , an idealized small - town midwestern crossroads circa 1954 .
There ’s an old - timey movie house , prefaded copper roofing on the expensive boutiques , and fake historical markers on buildings like “ Skip ’s General Store . ”
Thousands of residents are strolling toward the central weathered - wood bandstand waving small American flags .
Yet just when the atmosphere starts to seem oppressively cloying , I notice that many of the old folks gabbing beneath the palm trees are good and drunk .
It ’s the daily happy hour , and the open - air bars lining one side of the square are jam - packed .
The Villages is Celebration crossed with Geezer Spring Break .
Now the wholesome , pleasantly toasted crowd is roaring : America ’s Mayor has just climbed onstage .
Rudy Giuliani peels off his navy suit jacket and rolls up his shirtsleeves , grinning so wide that every one of his suspiciously white teeth is visible .
Six years of nearly nonstop speechifying , selling either his own book or George W. Bush , have made Giuliani a masterful campaigner .
He still has that odd lisp , and his accent is irreducibly New York , so that the name of today ’s state comes out “ Florider . ”
But Giuliani is relaxed , confident , able to quickly incorporate whatever the moment may offer to the narrative of his own greatness .
“ I see a New York Yankee hat ! ” he says , to cheers .
“ And I see a Brooklyn Dodger hat !
So I ’m gonna tell you why I ’m such a determined person and I fight so hard for what I believe in .
You know why ?
Because I was born in Brooklyn .
But I was born about one mile from Ebbets Field — and I was a Yankee fan .
I was a Yankee fan in Brooklyn ! ” Laughter , applause .
“ My father … put me in a pin-striped uniform and sent me out to play with all the other kids in Brooklyn .
Oh -ho !
So I had to fight my way just to get to the candy store . ”
The next 45 minutes wander from gushy Ronald Reagan tributes to complicated plans for a 2,000 - mile immigrant - repelling border fence to a discourse on the infallibility of the Founding Fathers .
Central to it all , though , is Rudy the resolute , the lonely man tough enough to stick selflessly by his convictions , even when they ’re unpopular , until he ’s ultimately proved right .
And the proof is his glorious success as mayor of the most dangerous , most corrupt , most Democratic city in the land .
“ Every candidate promises you lots of things , ” he says .
“ The most important thing is , can somebody deliver ?
Can they get something done ?
Well , here ’s what I have to offer : I know how to get things done .
I did it in the place where it was really hard to do !
Nobody , nobody really got anything done in New York about crime , about welfare , about the condition of the streets , about our economy , about bringing jobs to New York !
Not only did nobody get anything done for a long time , most people had given up , and they did n’t think anything could be done ! ”
This is a disorienting notion — but the condescending attitude is completely familiar to any New Yorker .
The city in the nineties was far from perfect .
But were we really living in the hellhole of depravity and despair that Giuliani describes without ever realizing it ?
And was he the man who single - handedly tamed 8 million misbehaving New Yorkers , delivering us from an economic and physical nightmare ?
They sure think so out here in the real America :
The chants of “ Roo-dee ! Roo - dee ! ” are drowning out Giuliani ’s final words , and women are elbowing one another in pursuit of his autograph .

It ’s the crucial second plank of his presidential platform , fitting snugly between the invocation of his September 11 heroism and his mocking of Hillary Clinton : Rudy Giuliani is the man who saved New York .
His campaign TV ads are a perfect distillation of the strategy .
Before Mayor Rudy , the city was a black - and - white jungle - land of sex shops , violence , and crushing taxes .
After Rudy , New York is Oz : sunshine , happy young couples , and shiny gold - plated statues .
The message , which Giuliani hammers in his appearances outside the city , is that he made big bad New York safe for the rest of the country .
For the pitch to work , Giuliani has to demonize the city he inherited and claim all the credit for the improvements he left behind .
The city itself is his original enemy .
The brilliance of this story line ( for a formerly very liberal Republican ) is that it is based more on “ character ” than on any specific policies .
Giuliani is running for president not on what he stands for but on who he is : the one man tough enough to subdue New York .
Of course , Giuliani ’s character is what the city knows best .
New York knows Giuliani is capable of quiet grace — and of cheap cruelty .
He shook the city ’s political culture out of its lazy , reflexively liberal posture .
But Giuliani ’s personal character is defined by a parochial , boys - from - the - neighborhood attitude that ’s far more old - school bossism than 21st - century globalism .
That bunker mentality was useful when Giuliani was enduring the withering criticism that came with overhauling the city ’s welfare bureaucracy .
But it also underlies the ugly racial polarization Giuliani stoked .
And his character includes the cronyism that created the Bernie Kerik debacle .
In the current production , the part of David Dinkins is played by Hillary Clinton , rampant crime is played by Al Qaeda , and welfare cheats have been replaced by illegal aliens .
So far on the campaign trail , the genial Rudy has been showing his face .
The city saw plenty of that other guy — the nasty , credit - hogging , conflict - addicted , wife - humiliating Rudy .
The man who tried to put himself above the law and stay mayor after September 11 .
And we know he ’s still in there .
Lately , as he ’s fallen behind Mitt Romney in early Republican - primary states , there have been flickers of the autocratic Rudy .
That ’s why the most important lines in Giuliani ’s TV spots and speeches are n’t the ones about crime or welfare , but those about being tested in a crisis .
Giuliani wants that phrase to be code for 9/11 .
And indeed , at the beginning and end of his years as mayor , when the city faced physical peril , Giuliani rose to the occasion .
But New York , from all the years in between , knows something else about his character that maybe the rest of the country should notice :
If a crisis does n’t present itself , Rudy Giuliani can be counted on to create one .
Even as Giuliani runs away from New York , one fundamental thing remains the same as it was when he was shaking hands at subway stations in 1993 :
He ’s running a campaign rooted in fear .
In the current production , the part of David Dinkins is played by Hillary Clinton , rampant crime is played by Al Qaeda , and welfare cheats have been replaced by illegal aliens .
The star of the show is still Rudy , the strongman who can protect the vulnerable , right - thinking citizenry .
He ’s promising to do for the country what he did for the city .
Yet with the benefit of hindsight — and especially with the ongoing contrast to Michael Bloomberg ’s lower - volume years as mayor — it ’s possible to see much more clearly the places Giuliani deserves credit for helping to save New York .
It ’s now equally clear where the story he tells is more myth than reality .
You could hear the man thinking .
In 1989 , Rudy Giuliani was a famous prosecutor making the transition to political candidate .
He sat for an interview with New York ’s then–political columnist , Joe Klein , that was fascinating because of Giuliani ’s willingness to think out loud and in print .
Giuliani openly , humbly admitted to all the things he did n’t know .
Nice did n’t work for Giuliani .
He lost that election , but he learned his lesson .
The next time around , in 1993 , he came out punching and never stopped .
Not only was it a winning electoral strategy , but the pugnacity was a perfect fit for that moment in the life of the city .
The crime tide had already started to shift , yet New York was still suffering from a widespread reputation for anarchy on the streets and lassitude in city government .
Giuliani rammed , head first , into the entrenched interests .
His pugilism produced great headlines , and spectacular results : Crime plunged , the homeless were made to disappear , and the city once again had someone emphatically in charge .
Attacking — all the time , relentlessly — worked .
Taking control , however , was never enough for Giuliani .
When a newspaper story gave passing mention to David Dinkins ’s role in bringing Disney to Times Square , Giuliani raged in a press conference that he deserved the credit .
But that skirmish was nothing compared to Giuliani ’s war with the man who laid the foundation for New York ’s revival and for Giuliani ’s mayoral triumphs .
Bill Bratton came to New York from Boston in 1990 , hired by the MTA to overhaul the city ’s transit police .
Four years later , the new mayor appointed Bratton police chief .
The efficiency and aggressiveness of the NYPD increased markedly under the new leadership .
And the department ’s combination of street - savvy personalities and nuevo - thinking made for an irresistible , media - ready narrative .
The murder rate dropped 74 percent .
But murders also dropped 73 percent in San Diego ; killings were down 70 percent in Austin , 59 percent in Honolulu , and 56 percent in Boston .
None of those miracles , however , was accompanied by a cult of personality forming around the relevant mayor .
There ’s now a large body of research indicating that crime would have shriveled even if New York had n’t been lead by two self - proclaimed geniuses .
The crack plague burned out just as Giuliani and Bratton deployed an additional 8,000 men and women in blue — thanks to President Bill Clinton and David Dinkins , Giuliani ’s much - derided predecessor at City Hall .
The murder rate had actually begun declining in 1991 , under Police Commissioner Lee Brown , and continued to fall under his successor , Ray Kelly ; Dinkins , however , was n’t quick enough or deft enough to claim credit .
Giuliani and Bratton took full advantage of the increase in manpower and were even better at exploiting the media attention .
Bratton was too good at it , at least in his boss ’s view .
Giuliani could n’t stand Bratton sharing the spotlight and forced him out of the job months after the chief ’s appearance on the cover of Time .
Under Bloomberg and the reinstalled Kelly , crime has continued to shrink — even as crime rates have rebounded in other major cities and even though the current department is working with less money and fewer cops .
For his campaign to work , Giuliani has to demonize New York and claim all the credit for the improvements he left behind .
But the constant confrontations and Giuliani ’s growing ego did more than drive away top talent from his administration .
As the end of his time at City Hall grew near , he ’d also lost nearly all his intellectual curiosity as well as his sense of humor .
Or maybe he ’d simply run out of worthy villains .
The senior citizens boo on cue when Giuliani uses the words Hillary Clinton and higher taxes in the same sentence .
“ The best thing to do , and I did this in New York , is to reduce the size of government and to reduce the amount of taxes that we charge you , ” Giuliani says , to sustained applause .
“ People said it could not be done in New York .
When I proposed doing it , they laughed at me !
When I proposed doing it , the New York Times wrote editorials explaining how irresponsible it was . ”
From the back , there ’s a shout , loud and clear : “ The New York Times sucks ! ”
After he stops laughing , Giuliani playfully pretends to take offense .
“ Now , now — we do n’t talk that way !
We do n’t say bad words !
We ’re the party of family values !
The way we say it is , ‘ The New York Times is incorrect . ’
And they are !
I lowered taxes in New York 23 times !
Nobody had ever done it more than once .
I did it 23 times !
Nine billion dollars ! ”
Now it ’s Giuliani ’s turn to be incorrect .
The city payroll ballooned by 25,000 during his tenure .
Eight of those 23 tax reductions came from Albany .
A ninth , by far the largest , originated in the City Council — and Giuliani fought it , tooth and nail , for nearly two years .
The truly rich irony in that episode , the expiration of a 12.5 percent surcharge on personal income , is that it ’s the same tax Dinkins , with the help of Council Speaker Peter Vallone , added to hire more cops .
Some of Giuliani ’s tax reductions seem purely symbolic , like slashing the levy on “ coin - operated amusement devices . ”
Even conservative economists were disappointed by the gap between Giuliani ’s rhetoric and results .
“ By big - city standards , he has a reasonably conservative fiscal record — that he has inflated , ” says E. J. McMahon of the Manhattan Institute .
“ The tax cuts enacted during Rudy ’s tenure did , indeed , contribute to the city ’s economic growth .
But he funded the biggest increase in school spending that had ever been seen up to that point .
He talks now about collecting more revenue with lower taxes — of course he did !
The economy was booming ! ”
When a recession started , Giuliani was n’t able to adjust .
His borrowing and spending helped transform the city ’s $ 3 billion budget surplus into a $ 4.5 billion deficit — most of which piled up prior to September 11 .
Giuliani ’s other signature accomplishment is his slashing of New York ’s welfare rolls .
By making the city ’s welfare - application procedures more rigorous , by requiring work in exchange for a check , and by combing for fraud , he trimmed the welfare rolls by 500,000 people .
“ Giuliani ’s achievement was considerable , in some ways more impressive than what happened in other big cities , because the culture here is very averse to the assumptions of welfare reform — individual responsibility , a rejection of claims of disadvantage by people who are poor , ” says Lawrence Mead , an NYU professor who is one of the intellectual fathers of “ workfare . ”
“ The ethos of the community groups was totally rejected by Giuliani .
He did it without apology and without compromise .
He did n’t even maintain appearances . ”
But the rest of the story illustrates the sleight of hand Giuliani uses to embellish his record .
“ His welfare people matched the city data with the State Department of Labor data , and basically found that people were working already , ” says Ester Fuchs , a Columbia University professor of public affairs whom Bloomberg hired to evaluate city government when he was elected .
“ So they found fraud , sent out letters , people left the rolls — and they were instantly employed ! ”
Weeding out fraud is an inarguable achievement , but Giuliani makes it sound as if he also created a robust jobs program .
Locking up criminals and clamping down on welfare cheats played to Giuliani ’s talents as a prosecutor .
Issues that required patience and diplomacy , like fixing the public - school system , frustrated him to fury .
Other agencies that Giuliani did control simply did n’t function by the time he was done with them .
“ One of the most amusing things about Rudy is his crisscrossing the country speaking on ‘ management , ’ ” Fuchs says .
“ City Hall did n’t even have functional e-mail when we arrived — in 2002 !
You cringed when you looked at the capacity of agencies to really do what they were supposed to do . ”
Giuliani ’s supporters trumpet his personal incorruptibility , but as mayor he larded his administrations with unqualified cousins and cousins - in - law .
Though the current building boom has been fueled by the surging national economy , City Planning Director Amanda Burden and Deputy Mayor Dan Doctoroff have been creative in finding ways to advance the cause — to the point at which many neighborhoods are cringing beneath the glut of high - rise construction .
“ The cupboard was totally bare [ when we took over ] , ” a Bloomberg economic - development official says .
“ The Giuliani administration ’s view was that you improve the quality of life and economic development will occur .
Up to a point , that view is correct .
But we had to start from scratch on literally hundreds of different projects . ”
Bloomberg ’s impact on city life — from 311 to the smoking ban to public schools and massive infrastructure projects — is likely to be farther - reaching and longer - lasting than Giuliani’s .
And Bloomberg still has two years left in office .
Some of the forces responsible for the city ’s rebound are largely outside the influence of mayors .
“ What has really enabled New York to be so resilient in the face of all these challenges — white flight , disinvestment , de- industrialization , global competition , 9/11 ? ” asks John Mollenkopf , a CUNY professor of political science .
“ New York is trying to sail upwind against some fairly strong storms .
Yet the population is going up , per capita income is going up in real terms .
How did we do it ?
It ’s kind of crass , but New York has continued to be a place where a lot of people can make a lot of money , which attracts one kind of talent .
The corollary to that has been immigration .
The city has been renewed by the continuing influx of diverse , energetic newcomers .
It ’s sad to see Giuliani turn from what he said on immigration as mayor , when he was very welcoming , because he senses the anti-immigrant winds blowing through the Republican Party . ”
Sad , maybe , but not out of character .
“ It ’s insulting to every New Yorker that he goes around the country talking as if he thinks he was the animal tamer and we were the animals , ” Ed Koch says .
Especially when it was Giuliani who so often riled up the animals in the first place .
Giuliani arrived at City Hall at a pivotal moment in New York ’s history , and his contribution to the city ’s revival was enormous .
Yet his true legacy is more attitudinal than programmatic .
At a time when the city ’s spirit and public image were taking a beating , he made an invaluably emphatic statement that New York was worth fighting for .
The downside to Giuliani ’s temperament was that when battles did n’t present themselves , he invented them or lost interest .
So with murder rates plunging , Giuliani turned his sights on jaywalkers , hot - dog vendors , and sensation - seeking artists .
“ In the second term as mayor , I think he got depressed , ” Fran Reiter says .
“ The minute he won reelection , he realized it was the beginning of the end .
With the exception of welfare reform , he stopped focusing on the big stuff . ”
Instead , Giuliani dwelled on the petty , even when it meant turning his back on loyal friends .
One of them was Reiter , a Liberal Party veteran who served as a deputy mayor in Giuliani ’s first term and managed his second winning campaign .
Reiter then found herself on the outside of Giuliani ’s shrinking inner circle , for reasons she says are still mysterious .
She ’s now backing Clinton .
“ Whatever issues I have with him , I believe Rudy saved New York , ” Reiter says .
“ But I ’m not convinced the things he did as mayor , and the way he did them , will translate well into the presidency .
I know a lot of good people he pushed away .
There ’s a tendency for Rudy to personalize stuff and be unforgiving of differences of opinion . ”
The litany of needless fights Giuliani picked as mayor is astoundingly long .
Some of the confrontations at least had their origins in policy differences or political calculation .
That category includes his battles with the Port Authority , over control of development projects , and with the Brooklyn Museum , which Giuliani smacked around in order to boost his conservative credentials for a prospective Senate race .
But even if a dispute had started over issues , Giuliani would escalate it into a playground contest of insults .
His feud with George Pataki started with Giuliani ’s saying “ ethics will be trashed ” if Pataki was elected governor , and it never really ended , descending at one point into a standoff over who should call and apologize first .
Giuliani assailed Schools Chancellor Ramon Cortines as “ precious ” and a “ little victim . ”
Sometimes Giuliani simply froze people out without provocation ; for years , he refused to meet with mild - mannered Manhattan borough president C. Virginia Fields , who happens to be black .
Other times , his anger just seemed disproportionate , as when Giuliani blasted the head of the Grammy Awards .
Often , though , his tantrums were gratuitous : calling a Bronx schoolteacher a “ jerk ” when she dared to question his commitment to better schools , for instance .
Easily the lowest moment , however , came in March 2000 .
Three weeks after a jury had acquitted the police officers who shot Amadou Diallo , when emotions were still raw , Patrick Dorismond was killed by an undercover cop after saying no to drugs .
Giuliani trashed the victim , releasing Dorismond ’s sealed juvenile records and sneering — wrongly — that the dead man had been “ no altar boy . ”
“ Rudy ’s not a racist , but he loves to inflame , ” says Ed Koch , a connoisseur of conflagration .
“ He loves to spit in your eye .
It ’s character , not strategy .
He ’s acted reasonably polite since September 11 , and he can be very charming .
But unless you ’re a saint , an epiphany does not make a permanent change in you .
And he ’s no saint . ”
Any discussion of Giuliani ’s character inevitably leads back to two issues : his family and his friends .
The significance of last week ’s story on Politico.com about Giuliani ’s jaunts to the Hamptons was n’t the exposure of an accounting shell game ; it was the reminder of the casual arrogance and viciousness that permeated Giuliani ’s mayoralty .
He ran up the public tab while pursuing an extramarital affair .
The fact that Giuliani has been married three times may give pause to voters elsewhere .
The city was n’t so much troubled by the divorces themselves .
What ’s indelible and unforgivable to New Yorkers is the grotesquerie of Giuliani ’s press conference dropping the news on Donna Hanover and a live television audience .
The ugliness of that moment lingers , to many a distillation of his core ruthlessness .
The other key marker of Giuliani ’s character is his New York inner circle — and its most infamous member , Bernie Kerik .
The two met at a New Jersey fund - raiser in memory of Michael Buczek , a 24 - year - old city cop .
Buczek was shot and killed in Washington Heights just blocks from where Giuliani , with his then - friend Senator Al D’Amato , had staged an infamous buy - and - bust photo op at the height of the city ’s crack epidemic .
When Giuliani ran for mayor in 1993 , Kerik got himself assigned to the candidate ’s protective detail .
Giuliani quickly promoted his friend from obscurity , first to deputy commissioner of the Correction Department , then two years later to boss of the city ’s jails .
These days , Giuliani defends Kerik by pointing to the reduction in violence at Rikers Island under his friend ’s watch .
While that ’s true , Kerik ruled with an iron hand , racking up enemies and ethical messes , among them dating one of his female subordinates .
When he married another woman , Kerik was accused of assigning corrections officers to staff the wedding .
Giuliani and Kerik grew ever closer , with the mayor serving as godfather to two of Kerik ’s children .
In 2000 , Giuliani elevated Kerik to police commissioner .
“ Too many leaders overlook candidates with unusual résumés because of a failure of nerve , ” Giuliani wrote in his 2002 book , Leadership .
A willingness to hire people with interesting lives is admirable , and it ’s a trait too often lacking in an American political culture scared of Drudge and Fox .
But Giuliani goes further , enlarging his tolerance into an unshakeable faith in the genius of his own judgment .
“ By the time I appointed Bernie Kerik , I had hired so many people that I was immune to such criticisms …
I believe that the skill I developed better than any other was surrounding myself with great people . ”
And once he ’d become deeply invested in Kerik ’s success , Giuliani ignored any facts that might contradict his perspicacity , as when the city investigations commissioner mentioned Kerik ’s connections to a contractor with alleged mob ties .
There were plenty of dubious episodes on Kerik ’s public record , including his order for 30 miniature commemorative busts of himself as commissioner .
And we now know that Kerik ’s sixteen months as police commissioner were busy with much more than crime - fighting : apartment renovations paid for by a contracting firm that was trying to win city business , the use of city detectives to do research for Kerik ’s autobiography , and an affair with the publisher of that book , Judith Regan .
Yet Giuliani stayed loyal to Kerik , and has only recently , and mildly , distanced himself from the disgraced commissioner .
But there are some things from his New York past that Giuliani ca n’t shed .
The relationship , still only partly understood , is an especially important marker in understanding Giuliani ’s character .
Maybe standing by Kerik so long is simply part of his code of loyalty .
Leave it to Kerik , now under federal indictment , to give that bargain an especially sinister edge :
In his Regan - edited book , Kerik wrote that he felt like a made man in Rudy ’s mafia .
Gosh , there are more Republicans on this side of the room than there are in all of New York City , ” Giuliani said at a campaign stop in South Carolina .
“ So I am really comfortable here . ”
In the reddest states , he uses the city as his foil .
“ I got elected and reelected honestly not because the people of New York City agreed with my ideas , ” he says Down South .
“ They did n’t .
They agreed with my results .
You agree with my ideas . ”
He ’s painting himself as a citizen of picket - fence America .
Long gone is David Garth , the prototypical New York adman who steered Giuliani ’s first victorious mayoral campaign .
Now Giuliani ’s image is spun by consultants with vast experience in states that are very much not New York .
The leader of his creative team is Heath Thompson , a Dallas - based consultant whose most famous TV ad ran in last year ’s Senate race in Tennessee :
The come - hither blonde whispering breathy invitations to black Democratic candidate Harold Ford .
Scott Howell , another important media operative , has won U.S. Senate races in Texas , Georgia , and Missouri and learned his trade from Lee Atwater .
They ’re trying to pull off the nifty trick of packaging Giuliani , the Yankees mascot , as being from New York but not of New York .
Giuliani did indeed arrive at City Hall as a refreshing outsider to the city ’s dominant political culture — he was a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic town , a prosecutor not a career politician , an outer - borough Roman Catholic in a Manhattan - centric , agnostic world .
But that does n’t mean he ’s not a New Yorker .
In fact , many of his character traits — his anger , his blind loyalty — come straight out of the tribal culture of New York ’s old neighborhoods .
On the presidential - campaign trail , Giuliani defines every issue and problem facing the country — not to mention his political competitors — as “ enemies . ”
He sees an America besieged — by illegal aliens , by liberals , but most of all by Islamic terrorists .
“ We are the strongest country on earth , but we need a very , very strong military to protect us and to defend us , ” he says in Florida .
“ And if I ’m elected president of the United States , I will rebuild our military !
I will make up for the damage that Bill Clinton did to our military ! ”
Never mind what George Bush has done to our military .
Just then , there ’s a murmur in the crowd .
People are pointing at the sky behind the stage .
An eagle is hovering against a backdrop of ominous gray clouds .
“ Oh , look at that ! ” Giuliani says .
“ I think he liked that message about a strong military ! ”
When the applause fades , he picks up where he left off .
“ We also have to be concerned about some specifics , like what do we do about Iran . ”
“ Nuke ’em ! ” comes a shout .
Giuliani grins .
“ If I ’m president of the United States , it will be crystal clear we will not allow Iran to become a nuclear power .
We will take whatever action is necessary to stop them !
We will not take the military option off the table .
We will not beg to negotiate with them .
We ’re gonna make them beg to negotiate with us ! ”
Giuliani says he wants to do for the country what he did for the city .
Yet the tactics he used in New York are either inapplicable or irrelevant .
Crime is down nationally , and Bill Clinton reformed federal welfare policy ; lowering taxes seems extremely unlikely , especially if a recession sets in .
What would certainly be transferred to the White House , though , is Giuliani ’s character .
He ’s selling his strength of will as an indispensable trait in a tough world .
But we know from eight years of firsthand experience that Giuliani ’s strength would also mean degrading his enemies , a contempt for the press and Congress , a mania for secrecy , and the rewarding of personal loyalty at the expense of competence .
And instead of the NYPD , he ’d be expressing his strength through the U.S. military .
In the sultry Florida air , in the center of a retirement fantasia , Giuliani is suggesting he ’d clean up Islamic terrorists like so many South Bronx crack dealers .
He ’s repeating one of his favorite phrases , that a President Giuliani would “ keep us on offense ” against terrorism .
But it ’s the way he says it that rings suddenly loud and clear .
This was the man who told President Bush he wanted to personally push the button to execute Osama bin Laden .
Anyone who was downtown on September 11 , 2001 , can empathize .
But Giuliani has internalized one side of his hometown too deeply : the side that does n’t just fight back but is n’t happy unless it ’s in the middle of a brawl .
Giuliani ’s well - worn anecdote about his boyhood bond with the Yankees is meant to show his determination in the face of pressure .
But New Yorkers know there ’s a less flattering interpretation .
For most of Giuliani ’s life , the Yankees have been the richest , most powerful , and usually winningest team in baseball .
Yet the ultimate fan of baseball ’s biggest overdog thinks he ’s a brave , oppressed partisan of an underdog .
Giuliani won back the city from the mongrel hordes — the descendants of Brooklyn Dodgers fans — and now he ’s proposing to win back the world for America .
But New York , more than anyplace , is wise to Rudy Giuliani ’s game .
While the question of whether the Fed will lower interest rates again after its emergency cut last week is still up in the air , it is pretty clear that further cuts in the Fed ’s target rates are in the offing .
And the markets believe the Fed will continue to cut quickly , putting the odds of a 50 basis point cut tomorrow at 88 %
At a Fed funds rate of 3.5 % , some would say the Fed has already created negative interest rates :
This view , that published real inflation rates understate the real level of price increases , is due at least in part to the work of the Boskin Commission , whose work led to changes in the computation of the consumer price index in the mid 1990s .
Some believe that these moves lowered reported CPI by 0.5 % , others argue for 1 % , while others , per the chart above , believe the dispartiy is even greater .
Why should we believe that the old CPI metric is better than the one we have now ?
Consider the criticisms the Boskin Commission made of the “ old ” CPI , which then led to changed to address those issues .
From Wikipedia :
The report highlighted four sources of possible bias : Substitution bias occurs because a fixed market basket fails to reflect the fact that consumers substitute relatively less for more expensive goods when relative prices change .
Outlet substitution bias occurs when shifts to lower price outlets are not properly handled .
Quality change bias occurs when improvements in the quality of products , such as greater energy efficiency or less need for repair , are measured inaccurately or not at all .
New product bias occurs when new products are not introduced in the market basket , or included only with a long lag .
Of the list of four supposed problems , all but the second , outlet substitution , are completely at odds with the concept of what an index is supposed to do , which is to track the price of the same grouping of items over time .
For instance , the first one says that if the initial CPI included steak once a month and steak prices rise sharply , then the index should substitute hamburger .
But even if you trust the current inflation figures , a cut to 3 % reaches the danger zone .
And remember that borrowers that can deduct their interest payments from taxable income enjoy an even lower effective rate .

The Power :
He has a precognitive painting ability and the ability to turn pupils white , thus disguising one 's self kind of as an albino if necessary .
Imagine someone chasing you and you had to blend in with a number of albinos provided you could only see their eyes .
It gets complicated , right ?
Why It Sucks :
The ability to paint the future , as long it narrowly concerns a limited set of people with whom you 've never met , sounds like the power equivalent of being handed the scripts to the entire next season of As the World Turns .
Assuming you do n't watch
As the World Turns ( and we assume you , not being a 40 - year - old woman , do n't ) , this power would be all but worthless .

You never saw Isaac painting something useful such as next week 's stock ticker or the result of horse races or lottery numbers .
Instead , he 'd just paint pictures of a nuclear explosion which never happened .
And , the power 's not even that accurate .
Why did n't he paint a picture of Nathan Petrelli flying Peter to safety , seeing as how that 's what actually happened ?
With this power , you would get up each day , turn your eyes a milky white color , and paint something like your next door neighbor buying a new Dodge Stratus six months from now .
Add to this power the cost of canvasses , oil paint and brushes , and you have what amounts to one expensive and fairly useless hobby .
Iran has described the incident as an " ordinary occurrence "
The confrontation
The US military has released video and audio recordings of Iranian boats that it says threatened to blow up US Navy vessels in the Strait of Hormuz .
The jerky footage , shot from one of the three US ships , shows several small boats approaching at high speed .
US President George W Bush described the stand - off as " provocative " , adding that it was a " dangerous situation " that should not have happened .
Iran has dismissed the incident as a " routine " encounter .
The video , which was shot from the bridge of the USS Hopper , appears to show the small boats racing near the wake of the US ships and crossing close to each other .
One boat is shown in close - up - a blue speedboat with at least two crew .
After spotting the approaching vessels , a Navy crewman can be heard over the radio , warning them they are approaching a coalition warship .
You will explode
Voice on US tape
Radio communications
" Request you establish communications , identify yourself and state your intentions , over , " he says .
He refers to " five unidentified small surface " boats , and the ships ' sirens can be heard in the background .
The four - minute video condenses what US officials have described as a 20 - minute stand - off .
At the end of the US recording , the screen goes black and the remainder is in audio only .
Some of the communication is unclear .
The US issues a final warning that if the boats do not change course immediately they will be " subject to defensive measures " .
A heavily - accented male voice can be heard saying : " I am coming at you .
You will explode . "
The Pentagon has said this threat was issued by the Iranian boats .
The speedboats , believed to belong to Iran 's Revolutionary Guards , came within about 200 m ( 650 ft ) of the US vessels , Pentagon officials said .
The weekend stand - off happened in a major oil shipping route , in what the Pentagon insists were international waters .
Played down Mr Bush said : " I do n't know what their thinking was , but I 'm telling you what I think it was , I think it was a provocative act . "
The US president was speaking in the White House Rose Garden on the first anniversary of the Iraq troop surge , hours before leaving for a week - long Middle East trip .
During his first visit to Israel as president , Mr Bush hopes to push forward Israeli - Palestinian peace talks relaunched in Annapolis late last year .
The BBC's Richard Lister in Washington says it seems the US does not want to make too much of the incident for fear it will overshadow his visit to the region .
Iran has played down the event , calling it an " ordinary occurrence " .
An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said : " This ... happens for the two sides every once in a while and , after the identification of the two sides , the issue is resolved . "

1 Princess Juliana International Airport ( Saint Martin )
Princess Juliana International Airport serves Saint Maarten , the Dutch part of the island of Saint Martin .
It is the second busiest airport in the Eastern Caribbean .
The airport is famous for its short landing strip — only 2,180 metres / 7,152 ft , which is barely enough for heavy jets .
Because of this , the planes approach the island flying extremely low , right over Maho Beach .
Countless photos of large jets flying at 10 – 20 m/30 - 60 ft over relaxing tourists at the beach have been dismissed as fakes many times , but are nevertheless real .
For this reason as well it has become a favourite for planespotters .
Despite the difficulties in approach , there has been no records of major aviation incidents at the airport .
2 Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport ( Saba )
Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport is the only airport on the Caribbean island of Saba , in the Netherlands Antilles .
It is well known among experienced fliers for the way in which airplanes must approach or take off from the airport .
Yrausquin Airport covers a relatively large portion of the small island of Saba .
Some aviation experts are of the general opinion that the airport is one of the most dangerous in the world , despite the fact that no major tragedies have happened at the facility .
The airport ’s sole runway is marked with an X at each end , to indicate to commercial pilots that the airport is closed for commercial aviation .
The danger arises from the airport ’s physical position .
It is flanked on one side by high hills , and on the other side and at both ends of the runway by cliffs dropping into the sea .
This creates the possibility that an airplane might overshoot the runway during landing or takeoff and end up in the sea or on the cliffs .
3 Courchevel ( France )
Courchevel is the name of a ski area located in the French Alps , the largest linked ski area in the world .
It ’s airport has a certain degree of infamy in the aviation industry as home to a relatively short runway , with a length of 525 m ( 1,722 ft ) and a gradient of 18.5 % .
It ’s so short that you have to land on an inclined strip to slow down and take off on a decline to pick up enough speed .
Who gets to land here ?
Well , Pierce Brosnan made the short list .
This was the airport used in the opening seen of Tomorrow Never Dies .
For the rest of us , private plane , helicopter , or charter are the only ways to go , and your pilot is going to need some serious training before he or she is allowed to land at CVF .
4 Gustaf III Airport ( St. Bart )
Gustaf III Airport also known as Saint Barthélemy Airport is a public use airport located in the village of St. Jean on the Caribbean island of Saint Barthélemy .
Both the airport and the island ’s main town of Gustavia are named for King Gustav III of Sweden , under whom Sweden obtained the island from France in 1785 ( it was sold back to France in 1878 ) .
The airport is served by small regional commercial aircraft and charters .
Most visiting aircraft carry fewer than twenty passengers , such as the Twin Otter , a common sight around Saint Barth and throughout the northern West Indies .
The short airstrip is at the base of a gentle slope ending directly on the beach .
The arrival descent is extremely steep over the hilltop traffic circle and departing planes fly right over the heads of sunbathers ( although small signs advise sunbathers not to lie directly at the end of the runway ) .
5 Barra International Airport ( Barra )
Barra Airport is the only airport in the world where planes land on the beach .
BRR is situated in on the wide beach of Traigh Mhor , on Barra island , in the Outer Hebrides , Scotland .
If you want to fly here commercially you will want to book with British Airways , which flies to Barra from Glasgow and Benbecula .
The airport is literally washed away by the tide once a day , and if you arrive on a late afternoon flight , you may notice a couple of cars in the parking lot with their lights on , which provides pilots some added visibility , since the airport is naturally lit .
Needless to say you probably do n’t want to hang out at Barra Airport beach , unless you are a aviation junkie , in which case Barra Airport has a fool proof system , as sign that reads : “ Keep off the beach .
When the windsock is flying and the airport is active . ”
6 Madeira Airport ( Madeira )
Madeira Airport also known as Funchal Airport and Santa Catarina Airport , is an international airport located near Funchal , Madeira .
The airport controls national and international air traffic of the island of Madeira .
The airport was once infamous for its short runway which , surrounded by high mountains and the ocean , made it a tricky landing for even the most experienced of pilots .
The original runway was only 1,400 metres in length , but was extended by 400 metres after the TAP Air Portugal Flight 425 incident of 1977 and subsequently rebuilt in 2003 , almost doubling the size of the runway , building it out over the ocean .
Instead of using landfill , the extension was built on a series of 180 columns , each being about 70 m tall .
For the enlargement of the new runway the Funchal Airport has won the Outstanding Structures Award , given by International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering ( IABSE ) .
The Outstanding Structures Award is considered to be the “ Oscar ” for engineering structures in Portugal .
7 Lukla Airport ( Nepal )
A huge mountain on one end , a thousand meter drop on the other .
And it ’s at 2900 meters elevation , so you do n’t exactly have full power .
Lukla Airport is a small airport in the Town of Lukla in eastern Nepal .
In January 2008 , the government of Nepal announced that the airport would be renamed in honor of Sir Edmund Hillary [ 1 ] , the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest , who passed away on January 11 , 2008 .
The airport is quite popular as Lukla is the place where most people start their trek to climb Mount Everest .

What a strange time to display " leadership " .
When moderator Carolyn Washburn , editor of the Des Moines Register , asked for a show of hands of whether the GOP candidates thought that global climate change was a real and serious threat and caused by human activity , Fred Thompson led the rebellion , refusing to raise his hands on principle - - or was it just laziness ?
Pretty soon , the candidates had grabbed control of the debate from Washburn and any serious points to be made by the likes of John McCain got lost in fray .
Obviously , I 'm not the potential voter from whom the Republicans are seeking to woo a vote , but I have to wonder if any of them think this kind of ridiculousness makes them look good .
Today 's Best - of - the - Sidebar was originally posted by " Yahweh " ...
Being a programmer and the only computer literate person in my family , I get tech support calls from my family all the time .
I got a phone call from a brother - in - law today :
Him :
Hey , you 're good with computers right ?
Me : Yes .
Him :
And you know how to program computers ?
Me : Yes , that 's my job actually .
Him : Could you explain programming please ?
Me : I 'm sorry , what do you mean ?
Him : I want to make a game like Halo , but I do n't know how to start .
Could you explain what I need to do ?
Me :
You should probably go to the library and get a book .
Him :
Can you just tell me what I need to do ?
Me : Wait a minute .
Are you asking me to explain how to program computers ?
Him : Yeah .
Me : Over the phone ?
Him : Yeah .
My brother in law apparently made several unsuccessful attempt to " learn programming " by opening up exes in Notepad .
He created a text file with the words " Morph the screen into something cool " and could n't figure out how to run it , even had the balls to ask me " how do I install my program ?
Do I just put a shortcut on the desktop " .
My dad , a programmer , lent him an unfortunately titled book called " Teach Yourself Java in 24 hours " .
He immediately flipped to the back of the book and reading sections on server and Swing development , and was very excited to see that he could write his own server after just one day .
In the end , I was unable to teach my brother in law how to make his own Halo over the phone , and he decided that I was n't a very good programmer .
We are looking for someone to help develop and maintain the RepRap control software .
This is an essential part of the project that needs to be be easy and intuitive to use for it to ever gain mainstream adoption .
Fortunately , its probably the easiest and least groundbreaking part of the system ... and yet still exciting !
The software is the main method of interacting with and controlling the RepRap machine .
Unfortunately it is hard to install , needs some UI work , could use some more intelligence with auto - detection / configuration , and has some bugs .
The software can also be run in a stand - alone mode without a RepRap machine attached .
That means you can get involved in a meaningful way even if you have no interest or capabilities to build the machine .
One could do development work without ever having a RepRap machine at all .
There are a variety of tasks that range from simple to hard .
Even small improvements to our code would be awesome .
As an added bonus , if you agree to take on this challenge , the project is willing to provide free development boards to you .
If you are interested , please email hoeken@rrrf.org directly , or visit our support forums
To get started now , check out the RepRap Java development instructions .
Ron Paul Is n't Being Censored
by Tibor R. Machan
Some of the folks who are eager supporters of Representative Ron Paul as the Republican presidential nominee are sadly misspeaking themselves these days .
On the Free Market News Network web site the question of whether Paul is being censored by mainstream media has been posed , as one of the site 's polls , and the overwhelming majority has answered " Yes " .
But this is very confused .
All that the mainstream media can do to Paul is to ignore him , maybe to distort his views or perhaps fail to report on the level of his support among American voters .
But only the government can censor someone !
Only the government has the power to legally silence Ron Paul or anyone else .
Big media may have clout but it has no legalized use of weapons with which to silence someone .
In the past this mistake has been made by many , both Left and Right .
I recall a while back when Harvard 's celebrity law professor Alan M. Dershowitz was hired by the producers of the movie The Pope Must Die to sue NBC , ABC , and CBS for these networks ' refusals to run advertisements for the movie that the networks supposedly considered inappropriate for television broadcast .
Prof. Derschewitz made some rather provocative claims in
connection with this suit in a television broadcast and at a news conference and , judging by these claims , the title of an earlier book of his , Chutzpah , seems to be entirely justified .
In that case , Mr. Derschewitz construed the refusal of the three networks to run the television ad for the movie The Pope Must Die as censorship .
And he got on television to say so .
He claimed that censorship , " whether public or private , endangers the marketplace of ideas . "
Now neither Dershowitz nor Paul has been censored , actually , because neither has been forced by the government to desist from voicing an opinion or stating some fact .
Being rejected for coverage by the major networks does not constitute censorship any more than does being ignored by the major media .
Perhaps , however , there is value in such language for polemical purposes , even if it is not strictly speaking accurate .
Maybe both Derschewitz and the supporters of Ron Paul are merely trying to stress the infelicity , the unprofessional conduct of those they accuse of engaging in censorship .
Perhaps that is all that 's going on here .
In the case of Ron Paul , however , one must be very careful not to undermine his credibility .
Consistency and integrity are his central widely recognizable virtues in the contest for nomination , something his rivals all lack .
On other matters he is unfortunately quite unpopular .
So , he should insist on these virtues even when they take away some of the bite of his complaint against the mainstream media .
If he lets go of them , he will join the rest of the politicians who are willing to prevaricate in order to gain favor with — or sympathy from — the public .
In brief , then , only governments censor , never private sector agents , no matter how wrong they act otherwise .
Refusing to report on Representative Paul 's views and support is , indeed , journalistic malpractice .
But it is n't censorship .
For libertarians , who want no government interference in peaceful conduct even when it is wrongheaded , this distinction must remain vital even as they do battle with various forces in the culture who want to silence them .
They have to find some other means by which to indict such forces not by falsely charging them with attempting to censor their preferred candidate for U. S. president .
Now Ron Paul himself may never have indicted mainstream media for allegedly censoring him — it is only his supporters who have made that charge .
Then they should realize that they are not being very helpful .
And perhaps Representative Paul could point this out to them and rein in their misguided zeal .
No one is responsible for the actions of those who support him but one could do worse than help such folks get it right about just what the mainstream media is doing wrong .
It is not censoring Ron Paul but failing to do its job right .

Canadian DCMA : Protect Your Anus
by Gordon McDowell
If you ’re a Canadian concerned about your fair - use rights ( to say , quote a verse from a song without having to ask for permission ) , or Canada ’s ability to compete in the world economy … then you ’ve probably already asked yourself , “ What can I do to ensure Canada ’s future copyright legislation is n’t written strictly to appease multinational media corporations ? ”
Hell , we all have .
There ’s some sound advice out there , to be sure .
Michael Geist has 50 suggestions how you can make a difference .
There is a Facebook group available to help organize activities .
And activists are collecting media clips you can use to help create your own viral video campaigns .
But what if you are the Honorable Jim Prentice ?
You ’d be looking at Michael Geist ‘s call - to - action and thinking to yourself , “ It does n’t look like there ’s anything on that list for me … ”
Jim , do n’t you worry !
There ’s opportunity for everyone to help out when it comes to improving Canadian copyright law .
In fact , as Canada ’s Federal Industry Minister who is tabling legislation to update , you ’re in the perfect position to help !
The first thing to remember is , we ’re on your side .
Copyright activists might crash your occasional constituent open house , but that ’s just because we ’re worried you might fail to recognize the disaster which is American copyright policy .
Certainly we believe you ’ve only heard from proponents of stricter copyright .
In 2003 , out of 98 conservative MPs only yourself and 2 others voted to extend the definition of marriage in Canada to include same - sex couples .
This either shows you ’re capable or reasoning problems out logically … or you ’re more then happy to let the gays fall into this death spiral we call marriage .
They kept whining about not being able to marry eh ?
Well this will learn ’em .
So keeping an open mind , here ’s what music industry lobbyists do n’t want you to know about American copyright , and the DMCA :
If you ’ve gotten this far , you probably see yourself stuck between a rock and a hard place .
American DMCA has been a shit - show , but at least American lobbyists do n’t show up and disrupt your parties .
Yet if you give in to their demands , you ’ll be accused of not listening to the needs of Canadians !
And to top it off Patricia Neri , the previous Director General of Copyright Policy , was removed from her position over what some call “ personal reasons “ …
What others are calling having inappropriate personal relationships with a copyright lobbyist …
And what I am calling having hot , sweaty sex with Doug Firth , who represented the American film industry in Canada .
Could n’t she have at least boinged someone representing the Canadian film industry ?
So how can you steer through this valley of doom ?
… One word : Jewish People .
Israel was in a very similar situation to Canada , sharing a common copyright heritage .
Both Canada and Israel ’s copyright acts stem from UK Copyright Act of 1911 .
Like Canada , Israel was under pressure from copyright lobbyists to “ modernize ” its protections .
But the International Intellectual Property Alliance ( IIPA ) , one such group attempting to pressure Israel , also charged Canada , Brazil , and South Korea with having granted inappropriate copyright exceptions to students and education institutions .
How did Israel respond to the pressure from the United States ?
Ha , just kidding .
The United States does n’t pressure Israel !
The United States knows if it dreams about pressuring Israel it had better wake up and apologize .
Israel , despite its antiquated patchwork of copyright laws , is a technological powerhouse producing more scientific papers , startup companies and new books than any other country ( per capita ) .
And some of it in Hebrew , which is crazy hard .
So how did Israel respond to pressure from copyright lobbyists ?
True common law approach : Israel ’s new act is rather slim .
It contains 5546 words , compared to more than 35,000 in Canada’s .
Fair Use : Permitted for purposes such as : private study , research , criticism , review , journalistic report , quotation , or training and examination by an educational institution .
No Anticircumvention : Israel ’s brand new copyright act contains no anticircumvention provisions .
The Israeli government has taken the view that at the moment , anticircumvention legislation does not seem to be urgently necessary .
So Jim … you do n’t mind if I call you Jim do you ?
So Mr. Prentice , I hope you get a general idea what some of my concerns were last weekend when I stopped by to talk about copyright reform , and it , well … there were a lot of people competing for your time that day .
But when you do get a chance to talk to artists and content creators ( copyright lobbyists rarely represent content creators , only copyright owners ) , you ’ll probably find this subject is one that offers exciting possibilities .
True copyright reform will expand Canadians ’ creative and academic freedoms , and give us a competitive edge over our DMCA encumbered neighbor .

There is strong public support for lifting the ban , polls suggest
The Islamist - rooted governing AK Party and the nationalist MHP say it is an issue of human rights and freedoms .
The two parties have enough votes in parliament to overturn the constitutional ban on headscarves .
A strict headscarf ban has been in force in universities since 1997 .
It was ordered by the secularist military .
The issue is highly controversial in a mainly Muslim country whose secular elite - including the powerful military - sees the headscarf as a symbol of political Islam , the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Istanbul says .
The move to ease the ban has been criticised by judges and university officials .
Chadors , veils and burkas will not be allowed - no - one will be allowed to use headscarves as political statements against the state
Devlet Bahceli , MHP leader
" Solving the headscarf issue would relax a large segment of the society , " MHP leader Devlet Bahceli was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency .
" It is a question of rights and freedoms , " he added .
The reforms are a compromise though , our correspondent says .
The proposed changes state that only traditional scarves will be permitted in universities , tied loosely under the chin .
Headscarves that cover the neck , like those worn by many Turkish girls , will still be banned , as will the all - covering burka , or chador .
Power struggle
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has stressed that this reform will be restricted to universities .
It will not apply to women civil servants , including teachers , who are still banned from covering their heads .
A power struggle last year between secular forces and the governing AK Party ended with the AKP being comprehensively re-elected in July .
Opinion polls suggest there is strong public support for lifting the ban .
And some women refuse to go to university because of it .
Following up on the alleged incident in the Strait of Hormuz with those five Iranian speedboats , remember that radioed threat supposedly coming from the Iranian side ?
Now they ’re blaming it on  are you ready for this ?
 “ the Filipino Monkey , ” some crazy guy ( or guys ) whose obscene remarks have come crackling over ship radios in the area for years .
Notice how quickly the official story is changing .
First the transmission was a threat coming from the Iranians : now they ’re “ unsure . ”
This is contrary to the President ’s characterization of what occurred , and the Pentagon ’s video presentation of a threat emanating from the speedboats : the allegedly “ aggressive ” actions of the Iranians are underscored by an audio overlay in which a voice interpolates “ I am coming to you , you will explode in a few minutes . ”
The Iranians are calling the US video a fabrication , and it sure does look like that .
Yet the Navy Times has another explanation :
“ In recent years , American ships operating in the Middle East have had to contend with a mysterious but profane voice known by the ethnically insulting handle of “ Filipino Monkey , ” likely more than one person , who listens in on ship - to - ship radio traffic and then jumps on the net shouting insults and jabbering vile epithets .
“ Navy women  a helicopter pilot hailing a tanker , for example  who are overheard on the radio are said to suffer particularly degrading treatment .
Several Navy ship drivers interviewed by Navy Times are raising the possibility that the Monkey , or an imitator , was indeed featured in that video . ”
The Monkey , in this account , takes on the aura of a legend , alongside Scylla and Charybdis :
“ Rick Hoffman , a retired captain who commanded the cruiser Hue City and spent many of his 17 years at sea in the Gulf was subject to the renegade radio talker repeatedly , often without pause during the so - called ‘ Tanker Wars ’ of the late 1980s .
‘ For 25 years there ’s been this mythical guy out there who , hour after hour , shouts obscenities and threats , ’ he said .
‘ He could be tied up pierside somewhere or he could be on the bridge of a merchant ship . ’
And the Monkey has stamina .
‘ He used to go all night long .
The guy is crazy , ’ he said .
‘ But who knows how many Filipino Monkeys there are ?
Could it have been a spurious transmission ?
Absolutely . ' ”
Spurious is right .
According to this guy , there is no Filipino Monkey :
“ First of all any seaman , military or commercial , can tell you their is no heckler know as the “ Filipino Monkey “ .
Rather it ’s a phrase that ’s been uttered by thousands of mariners for decades .
This harassing radio call with racial origins is made over the radio when a sailor hears the distinct accent of a Filipino mariner on the VHF radio .
Why is it said ?
Mostly out of boredom but also for the simple reason that it is sure to get a heated response .
“ Initially I was shocked that a Navy ship , or any ship , could not have known the taunt was a joke .
This is seamanship 101 .
I clearly remember having the taunt whispered in my ear by an upperclassmen during my plebe year that the Naval Academy and by the time I received my officers license I had heard it hundreds of time .
How could the officers of the cruiser Port Royal not know this was a common joke ?
I ’m admitting still confused but after hearing the audio file I must say it does n’t sound like the typical ‘ Filipino Monkey ’ taunt . ”
Oh , and look over here , at this Los Angeles Times story from November 12 , 1987 :
“ A cargo ship was sailing through the Strait of Hormuz recently when it was challenged by an Iranian warship demanding to know what it carried .
Iranian gunboats in these waters frequently attack vessels they suspect of carrying war materials to Iraq , and for the crew of the cargo ship , it was a tense moment .
“ ‘ What is your cargo ?
What is your cargo ? ’ the voice of an Iranian officer crackled over the radio .
“ Before the ship ’s captain could respond , a third voice came on the air : ‘ I am carrying machine guns and hand grenades to Iraq . . . and the atom bomb . ’
“ The Filipino Monkey had struck again . ”
And again  and again .
The Monkey , the Times tells us , hated Iranians , and told them what he thought of them “ in graphic terms . ”
The return of the Monkey is so very convenient  anything can be attributed to that mischievous imp of the perverse and the profane , including doing the voiceover for a staged Gulf of Tonkin - style “ incident . ”
Now , I ’m not saying that this is so , only that several factors raise the possibility .
The Navy Times interviewed “ a former skipper ” who “ noted how quiet and clean the radio ‘ threat ’ was , especially when radio calls from small boats in the chop are noisy and cluttered .
‘ It ’s a tough environment , you ’re bouncing around , moving fast , lots of wind , noise .
It ’s not a serene environment , ’ he said .
‘ That sounded like somebody on the beach or a large ship going by . ' ”
A large ship  there are several such in the crowded waterways of the Strait , and surely the American warships are the largest .
As for beach  there ’s plenty to choose from .
There are also plenty of US military bases for a country not quite as big as Kansas : Thumrait Naval Air Base , the Masirah Air Base , and the US Air Force stationed at Seeb International Airport , the sultanate ’s main air transport hub .
There is also a naval base at Al Khasab , on the Musandam peninsula  the Omani side of the “ beach ” where captain Hoffman thinks the transmission might have come from .
I do n’t buy the Monkey narrative : it sounds too much like a cover story to be quite real .
Time magazine , too , has its suspicions :
“ There may be a serious problem here .
Has the Bush administration ’s demonization of Iran so pervaded the U.S. government that the judgement of vital decision - makers is becoming dangerously clouded ?
So when a possible practical joker issues a threat to a warship , you have a Strangelovian military chain of command from Bahrain to Washington racing to insist that the crazy , murderous mullahs in Tehran are at it again . ”
The problem may be more serious than Time blogger Scott Macleod , reporting from Cairo , may think , but , in any case , he has lots of questions .
He wants to know
“ If there was any monkey business involved in how the Pentagon originally spun the sensational kamikaze angle to the press and the global public .
How seriously did the officers on the three ships take the suicide - attack threat ?
Were they certain that it had been issued by the Iranians ?
Did they consider or believe that it could have come from a prankster ?
How carefully did the Pentagon analyze the verbal threat once it was relayed back to Washington ?
Were officials there completely convinced that the threat came from Iran ?
Or did they have doubts yet went ahead anyway and indicated to reporters that Iran did it ?
Were officers on the scene and Pentagon officials in Washington aware that pranksters are prevalent on the Gulf radio networks ?
Did they factor that into their risk assessment and into their decision to point a quick finger at Iran ? ”
This narrative depends on the authenticity of the Monkey  who may or may not be more than one person  but we have no proof of that , and every reason to disbelieve it .
Whoever told the Americans that they were going to explode “ in a few minutes ” was certainly monitoring the scene at sea , perhaps in sight of the encounter : in any case , the voice did not sound Iranian , according to Farsi speakers interviewed by the Washington Post .
“ Some have even said the voice sounds more like Borat than a real Iranian , ” quips Editor and Publisher .
Gee , I wonder if they hired an actor to do the voiceover .
No one is saying that the US government , or some subterranean branch of it  perhaps a “ rogue ” faction , as in Iran - Contra  is responsible for what happened in the Strait of Hormuz , where a “ misunderstanding ” almost sparked World War III .
However , it ’s just possible  given our government ’s dismal record in this regard  that we ’ll be talking about the Hormuz Hoax , years from now , when the history of this decade of deception is written .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I am humbled and grateful for the large number of condolence messages I received about my Mom ’s recent death .
Thanks to all for your words of comfort and support .
My answer to Jamie Kirchick ’s recent piece on Ron Paul ’s alleged hate crimes will appear very shortly in Taki ’s Top Drawer , in my first  and hopefully last  commentary on the controversy .
Check it out , it ’s a humdinger .
I think it all started when the American electorate elevated a not really very good " B " movie actor to be the most powerful person in the world , and for that matter in all history .
Prior to that , America had certainly not been perfect ( just ask any black person over the age of 60 ) but it was moving albeit clumsily in generally the right direction .
And , yes , there had been some serious setbacks such as the Bay of Pigs and Viet Nam -- the most monstrous -- but it appeared that we had learned something from them , and we were not then salivating to attack the United Nations for advocating statecraft over warmongering .
.
The electorate fell for Reagan 's Captain America role and it's been all downhill from there .
That 's when the rhetoric over content really seemed to get started and then continued to mushroom until it would have made George Orwell blush , and now has culminated into just bald faced lying and sloganeering such as " freedom's on the march " and " support our troops " to justify mass slaughter and torture , and for the most part Americans ate it up and even put it on their car bumpers .
And what should we call this development ?
Not to get too fancy , an appropriate label would be the Age of Bullshit .
.
From Reagan 's example , the Republicans were quick to pick up on the bullshit methodology with George I , and then Bill Clinton came along with a soft - shoe version of the bullshit two - step and the stage was set for NAFTA and CAFTA , otherwise known as the selling of America as well as the welfare of the people of any other nation who subscribed .
And the electorate just ate it up .
.
Then :
The American labor movement strangely died ( actually was murdered ) and no one seemed to care .
Then the media consolidated , as well as the message , and no one seemed to care .
Then the rich got progressively richer and the poor regressively poorer .
And then comes along George II , King of all bullshitters , liar of liars , fixer of elections , shredder of the Bill of Rights .
Then came the judicial exponents of bullshit , a new chief justice and another associate justice who talked about the principle of the " unitary executive " at their confirmation hearings while the sappy Democrat senators listened , then allowed their approval , never stopping to ponder the difference between the " unitary executive " and ... " dictator , " perhaps ?
.
All this time the putative " opposition " ( AKA the Democrats ) simply caved , their majority Senate gifting Bush II with war powers unprecedented in our history , and subsequently allowing every war funding bill he requested , any and all of which they could have stopped with a mere 41 Senate votes ( the number needed to disallow cloture ) .
The Dems had caught on : substance did n't matter anymore , nor did doing the right thing .
Just feed the electorate bullshit and all was possible without the strain to muster courage and integrity .
.
What of my lifelong political affiliation , the Dems ?
Well , Paul Wellstone 's plane fell (? ) from the sky , the years have eroded Senator Byrd 's physical ability to stand up to speak , and Teddy just gets grumpier rather than more persuasive .
So much for the champions of the people .
In the mean time , a permissive if not obsequious handful of Dem senators would like to be elevated to the presidency .
The leaders of this pack include a nice young man of no specific stature gained in his mere four years on the national level who talks about " change " ( yeah , really good , but how about some specifics , like what , how , when , where , how much , with whom , dates , numbers , names , etc. ) and a woman addicted to trousers who after her spanking in Iowa announced , " I am SO READY to lead ! "
( Do intelligent adults who want to be the most powerful person in the world actually talk like that ?
She did .
And the audience roared its approval . )
.
Meanwhile closer to home in Florida , the Democrat I voted for in the last congressional race is denied admission to a state Democrat function because it is suspected he may ask some embarrassing questions of the Dem anointed , including the state chairperson who demands a six - figure salary and takes side - money from the opposition .
Another local politico ...er... politica advises me that she intends to " reform the Democratic Party from WITHIN ! "
Whooeee , with Karen Thurman and Bill Nelson ensconced -- rots o' ruck !
But we must admit , that the gate barrers and the reformers - from - within enjoy the grand majority support of all loyal Democrats .
.
Meanwhile on the protest scene , all are moving apace , apace that is with the same pace of five years ago .
There are signs paraded on the sidewalks and the usual summons to a higher level of morality and the occasional " festival " on the Mall .
The grim veterans ' groups seem to have some purchase on integrity and are bolder than most -- one must admire their grimness ; struggling against popular stuff like war should be a grim business .
Then there is Code Pink , who does exhibit some confrontational courage and also is more persuasive than most , but perhaps too much enjoying the process to the detriment of their credibility .
And then come the more pedestrian variety of protestors , not to exclude the activist - junkies , to whom protesting is more of an activity than something dealing with accomplishment , so to speak the journey having priority over the destination .
( Case in point :
When I appealed the national luminaries of UFPJ with an action plan for actual change , I was summarily admonished that nothing of the sort could be considered as their current priority was to " further develop their organization " -- this after five years of unconscionable slaughter ! )
And the sum and substance of all this is : NOTHING HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ACCOMPLISHED .
The bullshitters are still in charge and likely to remain so , even though the partisan label on the biggest of the political plums is likely to change .
.
What will happen now in the face of bullshit from both sides destroying America while the electorate approves , can't be bothered or simply tut - tuts ?
It appears that things will not get better peacefully , the leadership and the electorate lacking the courage , integrity and even interest in effecting such .
So it will probably get worse , and worse , and worse until one day it becomes unbearable , impossible to deny , and that sadly is the requisite breeding ground of revolution .
.
Now , while all this is happening , criticism however constructive and urgent is not allowed in ANY camp .
Criticism of lying , treachery and torture not allowed among Republicans .
Criticism of inaction , permissiveness , even political cowardice not permitted among the Democrats .
Criticism of ineffectiveness and appeals to action not tolerated among the peace movement .
Each group has its own brand of bullshit and all are expected to suck it up or be branded traitor , trouble maker , know - it - all , ego maniac , and this of me : " mole for the Republicans " and " do nothing but sit at your computer and be nasty . "
.
What is nasty is what has happened to America , and I 'll personally not finish getting nasty until everyone who has a stake in this disaster knows what he or she has contributed to it , yes to include the whole bloody zombie electorate if I can possibly reach it .
.
So get ready , bullshitters , my friend Rob Kall has done a great job of describing how the treachery was done to us , but has not touched upon how we aided and abetted it , we the proxy bullshitters .
I 'll take a crack at that assignment .

The iPlayer is a catch - up online TV service
It comes after the BBC said a download service for Mac and Linux users was not 100 % definite and would depend on cost .
A spokesman for the BBC Trust said it had approved the iPlayer on the condition of " platform neutrality " , including a download service .
The BBC said it " had not ruled out " a download system for non-Windows PCs .
But , the corporation has promised video streaming for those platforms as well as Windows users by the end of 2007 .
It has also said it remains " committed to platform neutrality " .
When asked if offering just video streaming across all platforms would fulfil the BBC Trust 's terms of approval for iPlayer , a spokesman for the regulators said : " We required platform neutrality across downloads , streaming and cable [ set - top boxes ] . "
If it 's a genuine move towards interoperability , consumer choice and Open Standards , then certainly we welcome it
Open Source Consortium
On Monday , the BBC 's director of Future Media and Technology Ashley Highfield said : " We need to get the streaming service up and look at the ratio of consumption between the services and then we need to look long and hard at whether we build a download service for Mac and Linux . "
He added : " It comes down to cost per person and reach at the end of the day . "
The BBC Trust spokesman added : " We would expect BBC management to come back to us if they are planning any changes to iPlayer . "
The issue of platform neutrality and the iPlayer has been controversial , with open rights advocates complaining that the service was initially only available to Windows users .
An e-petition signed by more than 16,000 people led to a government statement backing the Trust 's requirement for platform neutrality .
Progress monitored
Progress on the iPlayer is being monitored by the Trust and the first six - monthly review of work is expected soon .
The BBC has said it launched on Windows to get the service out to as many people as possible .
More than 250,000 people are using the service regularly .
The BBC says it hopes to have 500,000 users by April next year .
While accurate figures for Linux users among licence fee payers are not available , it is thought that less than 3 % of computer users in the UK have Macs .
The BBC has said the problem in offering a cross- platform download service lies in protecting rights holders ' content .
All downloaded video content from the BBC contains digital rights management ( DRM ) technology to prevent the programmes being copied and to ensure the content is only available for 30 days .
The BBC says the DRM offered by Microsoft - which is not available for Linux and has not been licensed from Microsoft by Apple for Macs - is the only solution at present .
Time frame
In its original submission to the Trust for approval of the iPlayer project , the corporation said it was " exploring alternative DRM systems " but was unable to commit to a time frame for delivering a non-Windows solution .
At the time , the Trust said that " catch - up television over the internet should become platform neutral within a reasonable time frame " .
A spokesman for advocacy group the Open Source Consortium welcomed the commitment to a streaming solution across platforms .
He said : " If it 's a genuine move towards interoperability , consumer choice and open standards , then certainly we welcome it .
" If , however , it 's a cynical ploy by the BBC's Future Media and Technology team to avoid being taken to the European Competition authorities for promoting Microsoft 's abusive monopoly , then certainly we are against it . "
DIGG THIS
Angelo Mozilo is the Chairman , President , and Chief Executive Officer of the failed Countrywide Financial Corporation .
Mr. Mozilo co-founded this company , nearly 40 years ago , in 1969 .
To be in business for almost forty years , and to become America ’s top private home - mortgage lender , are testimonies to genuine business acumen .
However , success can breed arrogance , and a sense of supreme power , to the point where a corporate chieftain believes his personal will can override the free market and reshape society according to a grand vision — which , for Angelo Mozilo , entailed making America a better country by bringing home ownership within reach of all and sundry .
For Countrywide Financial , unfortunately , Mr. Mozilo ’s dream of social engineering demanded that sound credit - underwriting principles be abandoned .
And now , Countrywide Financial Corporation ’s failure stands as a monument as to how integrating egalitarianism and political correctness , into a business plan , is downright poisonous .
February 4 , 2003 marks the day when Countrywide Financial ’s shareholders should have dumped every last share of their stock .
For on this day Angelo Mozilo made a presentation , at The Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University , titled The American Dream of Homeownership : From Cliché to Mission .
This is the day that Mr. Mozilo revealed to the world that political correctness had infected his mind .
He openly declared that sound credit underwriting was tantamount to judgmentalism and , therefore , anti-egalitarian .
How dare anyone judge anyone else — credit standards be damned .
Subprime mortgages , accordingly , were going to be a blessing for America since everyone deserves a house .
Oh how political correctness feels so good .
He worshiped the mortgage socialism hatched in the New Deal along with every federal - housing program introduced in the succeeding decades .
A true credit professional would have been horrified by this speech ; which indubitably was met with approving applause by the pseudo - intellectual , limousine liberals populating Harvard University .
February 4 , 2003 is the day Countrywide Financial ’s Board of Directors should have fired Mr. Mozilo .
Over the years , Angelo Mozilo has been handsomely rewarded by Uncle Sam ’s mortgage socialism .
Here ’s how it works .
Countrywide Financial makes a conforming home loan , sells it to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac ( both are government sponsored enterprises ) , and has its coffers replenished in doing so ; hence , allowing Countrywide to keep churning out loans .
Countrywide , in turn , remains the mortgage servicer on each loan and earns a fee for doing so .
These fees most certainly add up when you are servicing $ 1.5 trillion in home loans ( not all of which are Fannie and Freddie loans ) .
Needless to say , Countrywide had other sources of revenues but mortgage servicing was top - shelf when it came to profitability .
Thus , it is no wonder why Mr. Mozilo waxed fondly , in his Harvard speech , regarding America ’s foray into mortgage socialism .
After all , it made him very wealthy .
Here is an excerpt :
Our Nation took another important step in 1938 — in fact , 65 years ago this week — when Fannie Mae was created to buy those FHA loans , and as a result , the secondary mortgage market was born .
We took a few more giant steps in the 1940s with the G.I. Bill in 1944 and the Housing Act of 1949 , which stated the goal of " a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family . "
We witnessed the Fair Housing Act in the 60s , the creation of Freddie Mac in 1970 , the expansion of Fannie Mae ’s activities , the Community Reinvestment Act in the 70s , the introduction of adjustable - rate mortgages in the 80s , and more recently , the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 .
We have traveled so far — thanks to a mortgage - finance system that remains the envy of the world ; thanks to a constant stream of creative and innovative mortgage products , and efforts directed at encouraging the offering of loans to those who have been previously shut out ; and simply put , thanks to housing being an enduring public policy objective and the lasting commitment to that objective symbolized by our partnership .
We have transformed from a Nation of renters to a Nation of homeowners .
The overall U.S. homeownership rate , which was at 44 percent in 1940 , hit 68 percent by the end of the third quarter of 2002 .
One can only imagine Mr. Mozilo ’s broad smile as he delivered these words .
Between his compensation and stock sales , Angelo has made hundreds of millions of dollars .
Socialism certainly can be beneficial for an elite few .
Do you remember President George W. Bush ’s initiatives to increase homeownership in the United States ?
His administration definitely played a role in creating America ’s housing bubble .
When speaking about housing assistance , President Bush evoked the emotion of envy and declared that the U.S. had a " homeownership gap . "
Angelo Mozilo , being a kingpin of political correctness , could n’t resist playing the envy - card to an approving Harvard audience .
He stated :
It started with the New Deal , and now , we ’re in a new century .
But through it all , one thing has remained , more or less , constant .
This constant is our challenge .
And this challenge is to increase the access to affordable housing .
And in order to do this , we must close the homeownership gap that still exists .
As President Bush said last October :
" Two thirds of all Americans own their homes , yet we have a problem here in America because fewer than half of the Hispanics and half of the African Americans own their home .
That ’s a homeownership gap .
It ’s a gap that we ’ve got to work together to close for the good of our Country , for the sake of a more hopeful future .
We ’ve got to work to knock down the barriers … "
While the number of minority homeowners has advanced recently , climbing from 9.5 million in 1994 to 13.3 million in 2001 — an increase of 40 percent — the fact remains that it is still not at a level equal to that of white homeownership .
And as President Bush pointed out , the homeownership rate for African Americans is 47 percent and for Hispanic Americans it is 48 percent , a stark contrast to the homeownership rate of 75 percent for white American households .
That means there is currently a homeownership gap of over 25 points when comparing white households with African Americans and Hispanics .
My friends , that gap is obviously far too wide .
It has been far too wide for far too long .
And when adding new factors into the equation — like an influx of new immigrants or continued reduction in the supply of affordable housing — it has the potential to become far worse .
Credit underwriting has nothing to do with race , creed , skin color , gender , or religion .
Sound credit underwriting has everything to do with the " Five Cs " of credit — i.e. , character , capacity , capital , collateral , and conditions .
Under pure capitalism , a credit underwriter is not concerned about making people happy by lending money regardless of a person ’s creditworthiness .
An underwriter ’s primary objective is to make profitable loans and this demands nothing less than effectively assessing risk on a case - by - case basis .
This , undeniably , requires underwriters to exercise learned judgment .
Ah , but to say this in the cradle of political correctness ( Harvard ) would have been met with resounding " boos . "
To be sure , Mr. Mozilo did not disappoint his fellow limousine liberals .
He goes on the attack and smears credit underwriters as being judgmental — the antithesis of political correctness .
Considering that Countrywide had become the largest private mortgage lender in the U.S. , the following words depict a man who had taken leave of his senses :
I have two issues with our industry ’s current underwriting methodology .
The first is that the automated underwriting systems kick far too many applicants down to the manual underwriting process , thereby implying these borrowers are not creditworthy ; and the second issue is that once arriving in the hands of a manual underwriter , the applicant is subject to basic human judgment that can be influenced by the level of a borrower ’s credit score .
Let ’s address my first issue .
I acknowledge that credit scoring uses proven statistical methods to provide lenders with the ability to quantify the risk of extending credit .
And there is little question that the technique effectively and efficiently separates those with very good credit from those with questionable credit .
However , far too many borrowers are being referred to an arduous manual and cumbersome underwriting process .
To me , that is clear proof that the level deemed to be an acceptable risk by our automated underwriting systems is much too high .
While many of these borrowers may ultimately be approved , it is because the manual process , or human underwriter , has analyzed non-traditional factors such as the borrower ’s rent and utility payment history , which should be imbedded in the automated underwriting process .
Now , let me address my second issue , and that is the manual underwriting process itself .
While Countrywide ’s own internal evidence supports the notion that manual underwriters are approving a good majority of the loan applications that get referred , the fact of the matter remains that a human is involved in this step of the process thereby creating the possibility that a decision is made based upon the level of the borrower ’s FICO score .
Thus , the current protocol intentionally creates an environment where borrowers with lower FICO scores are subject to being disproportionately affected by the manual underwriting process .
I say we need to amend these systems to do more than just approve the " cream of the crop , " by creating a system that says " no " only to those deemed unwilling to make their mortgage payments .
We must understand that the credit scoring system we have built is still imperfect , and that if we are to have any chance at closing the homeownership gap , we must make a serious investment in improving its capacity and capabilities .
We must do this through improved automated underwriting models that take into account more variables , and measure true indicators of risk and willingness to pay .
We need an ongoing educational process , not only at the primary market level , but also in the secondary markets and with mortgage insurers to help lead this effort to recalibrate the scoring system .
And finally , it must be recognized that borrowers with credit scores below what is currently defined as " creditworthy " levels can still be acceptable credit risks .
Thus , the credit score bar dividing creditworthy from high - risk borrowers , must be substantially lowered by the GSEs , the secondary market in general , and with bank regulators .
The GSEs have made good progress over the last few years in expanding their credit criteria , but I encourage them to become much more aggressive in this regard .
What Angelo Mozilo desires to accomplish is to replace human underwriters with computers .
He never mentions the Five Cs of credit because sound credit underwriting requires human judgment ; which can be aided with , yet never replaced by , technology .
In Mr. Mozilo ’s daffy world of credit progressivism , he may as well distill the mortgage application down to a one - page document containing a single question :
Are you willing to make your mortgage payment ?
If the answer is " yes " then the loan is approved and if the answer is " no " then it is declined .
Under such circumstances , a computer would work perfectly .
As I have asserted before , political correctness is an enfeebling infection of the mind .
Mr. Mozilo ’s vision of politically - correct , and " enlightened , " credit underwriting was nothing short of daffy .
Yet , one can only imagine how approvingly this pabulum was met by his Harvard chums .
Angelo Mozilo had no intention of disappointing his fellow travelers .
There was hope as to closing the homeownership gap .
It was something called the subprime mortgage .
In his bizarre mind , the more subprime mortgage originations there were , the better off America would be .
To wit :
Historically low interest rates along with new , creative and flexible underwriting techniques are continuing to fuel a record period of growth for our industry .
According to the Federal Reserve , the amount of overall mortgage debt outstanding is nearly $ 6 trillion .
And , increasingly , the sub - prime market is boosting that number and the industry as a whole .
During the first nine months of 2002 , sub - prime originations rose an estimated 26 percent over the same period in 2001 — outpacing the overall market .
Had Mr. Mozilo delivered this speech today , he would have immediately been fitted into a straightjacket and then driven to the nearest loony bin .
Countrywide Financial and many other financial institutions ended up throwing all credit standards out the window in order to package and sell as many subprime mortgage - backed securities as possible .
To be sure , many did not do so sharing Mozilo ’s politically - correct and egalitarian hallucination — they just wanted to make a fast buck .
An important distinction to convey here pertains to the fact that Countrywide and others were not selling all of their loans to Freddie and Fannie .
The aforementioned mortgage - backed securities were purely packaged and sold under private labels .
When America ’s housing bubble was expanding , buyers of such subprime securities obviously felt there was no downside .
Such are the delusions that materialize when central bankers flood the world with the opiates of easy money and credit .
Regrettably , by completely ignoring underwriting fundamentals , Countrywide and its ilk have set up so many borrowers for failure ( as have the king and queen of mortgage socialism , Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae ; both of whom , by the way , may be on the brink of their own financial meltdowns ) .
The pain and anguish of losing a home , and having one ’s family displaced , will be visited upon countless families .
Of course , such borrowers must look in the mirror when the urge , to pass around the blame , emerges .
Nonetheless , Angelo Mozilo ’s dream has transmuted into a nightmare for millions .
My , oh my , are n’t political correctness , egalitarianism , and social engineering wonderful ?
You be the judge .

Last week I gave a talk at the 16th International XBRL Conference here in Vancouver .
XBRL is an XML - based system for packing up companies ’ financial information , and I think it ’s real important .
But its take - off has been kind of protracted and arduous .
I was there as an Ambassador From the Web .
Here ’s what I told them .
Of course , this message will be old hat to most readers here , but they ’re still new and strange to lots of people .
And there are some things you just ca n’t say too often .
Centralization is a bug · Bill Joy : “ Wherever you work , most of the smart people are somewhere else . ”
The reason the Web worked so well is that nobody had to ask anybody ’s permission to build a browser or a crawler or a search engine or an auction site or a dating service .
Anything in the system that requires central authority , that ’s something that holds you back .
Good - enough today beats complete next year · Gall ’s Law : “ A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked .
The inverse proposition also appears to be true : A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work .
You have to start over , beginning with a working simple system . ”
There ’s a perfect convergence storm , the pressures of quick community building coming from “ Web 2.0 ” culture and the pressure of quick feature release coming from the Agile software - development community .
Both of these are in some part motivated or facilitated by the Web .
If you wait long enough to ship something that solves the whole problem , nobody will care .
Getting started should be free .
· Also , it should n’t take more than a few days .
How much did it cost you to start using Google or Flickr or Facebook or YouTube ?
The answer is always the same .
If you want people to adopt anything in any scale , you have to remove barriers , and money is one .
Let ’s imagine a scenario :
There ’s a smart young - ish person who has a basic understanding of business realities and accounting fiction oops methodology .
Let ’s call her “ Emma ” .
Emma decides that people are underestimating the importance of collecting receivables in Value - Investment portfolios , and figures out a better way to compute a number that reflects that .
She lives in Manitoba and does n’t work for Goldman Sachs , but she can write CGI scripts .
She has the idea on Wednesday and gets the script working next Monday , and one quarter later , either gives up on the idea or is incredibly rich .
Both are good outcomes .

Management will go along .
· After all , it was developers who brought in PCs , Unix , Linux , Java , and the Web .
It ’s hard for businesspeople to believe , but it ’s true .
CEOs and CIOs and CTOs do n’t really guide technology futures ; it ’s people with bad hair and bad T - shirts .
They ’re good at finding things that Get Shit Done and figuring out ways to get them into production , even if that means going through the back door .
If you ’ve got something good , figure out a way to get it in front of them .
Try to lock them in and they ’ll walk away ·
Put it another way : make it easy to walk away , and they ’ll come back .
The first generation of commercial Web sites ( except maybe Yahoo ! ) was managed by people who did n’t understand the Web , and they developed this deeply pernicious notion of “ stickiness ” ; a successful site was one that was hard to leave .
I can remember this horrible magazine ad from , I think , RealAudio , with an actual picture of people stuck to a sphere representing a Web site .
Gack .
Google has been the best at turning this inside out ; making it effortless to go away , so they come back .
The lesson is obvious : anywhere in a Web site that there can usefully be a hyperlink to somewhere else , there should be .
Some popular tools will be Open Source · Which raises a question : would you rather provide the popular OSS tools , or compete with them ?
Now , monetizing OSS is hard .
But on the other hand , monetizing software is hard , always has been .
And doing it while you ’re competing with Open Source is especially hard .
To make money , give things away ·
Or as this pony - tailed executive I know says : “ Monetization at the point of value . ”
There are two kinds of people in the world : those who might do business with you , and those who never will .
For the second group , you lose nothing by letting them grab your stuff for free .
The first group is more interesting .
On one hand you have the risk that they ’ll go ahead and use your product or service without ever paying a penny for licensing or support or indemnification or whatever .
On the other , there ’s the risk that if you make them pay up front , they ’ll try something else that is free - to - try and it ’ll be good enough .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - How do you keep a leader as verbally gaffe - prone as U.S. President George W. Bush from making even more slips of the tongue ?
U.S. President George W. Bush talks during a U.N. Security Council meeting on Africa at the UN in New York , September 25 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Larry Downing (
When Bush addressed the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday , the White House inadvertently showed exactly how -- with a phonetic pronunciation guide on the teleprompter to get him past troublesome names of countries and world leaders .
The White House was left scrambling to explain after a marked - up draft of Bush ’s speech popped up briefly on the U.N .
Web site as he delivered his remarks , giving a rare glimpse of the special guidance he gets for major addresses .
It included phonetic spellings for French President Nicolas Sarkozy ( sar - KO - zee ) , a friend , and Zimbabwe leader Robert Mugabe ( moo - GAH - bee ) , a target of U.S. human rights criticism .
Pronunciations were also provided for Kyrgyzstan ( KEYR - geez - stan ) , Mauritania ( moor - EH - tain - ee - a ) and the Zimbabwe capital Harare ( hah - RAR - ray ) .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said the draft , labeled the 20th version and complete with typos and speechwriters ’ cellphone numbers , had been turned over in advance to help U.N. interpreters who must simultaneously translate leaders ’ speeches into several languages .
Bush ’s text also had to be loaded onto a teleprompter to appear on screens in front of the podium as he spoke .
“ There was an error made , ” Perino told reporters .
“ I do n’t know how the draft of the speech that was not final was posted but it was and it was taken back . ”
“ Anyone giving a major speech or delivering a broadcast , like on the morning and nightly network news , has phonetics for cues just for the possibility they ’re needed , ” she later explained .
Bush is no stranger to the occasional faux pas , and often jokes about his habit of mangling the English language .
One of his highest - profile gaffes came in May when , at a welcoming ceremony for Britain ’s Queen Elizabeth II , he nearly placed her in the 18th century .
At a speech during the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) summit in Sydney earlier this month , Bush seemed to confuse the organization with OPEC and spoke of Austrian troops in Iraq when he meant to say Australian .
The best news as 2008 dawns , of course , is that this most endless of presidential campaigns now finally reaches a point at which something actually happens .
Finally the people will speak , starting Thursday in Iowa .
So what will they say ?
The races in both parties have developed along very unexpected lines , making this probably the most fascinating presidential election in decades .
Let 's start with the Republicans .
Here we have the most unpopular sitting president since Richard Nixon .
Significant majorities of his countrymen have long since concluded that they made a mistake in electing him ; that he is n't up to the job ; that he basically lied us into a war ; that his domestic policies have been at best no great shakes ; and that the conservative ideology to which he has been in thrall has not served the country well , to put it mildly .
And yet , by and large , the Republican candidates are running on exactly the same policies that Bush has pursued .
Consider this list .
All the major Republican candidates want to " stay the course " in Iraq , denouncing any discussion of withdrawal as evidence of pusillanimity .
All see the fight against terrorism in more or less Bushian terms .
All want to make the Bush tax cuts , now scheduled to sunset in 2010 , permanent - even John McCain , who at the time voted against them .
All have promised the leaders of the Christian right that they will appoint supreme court judges " in the mould of " Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas .
What this euphemistic language means is that whatever a candidate 's previous positions on abortion and gay rights - Rudy Giuliani , for instance , has supported both - the leaders of the religious conservative movement have exacted commitments from all the Grand Old Party candidates to appoint the kind of judges they want , and that matters far more than past positions .
There 's more .
Healthcare is a priority in this election .
But to hear these Republicans , you 'd never know it .
Their healthcare plans range from cynical to inadequate .
Climate change ?
They barely acknowledge the problem and are particularly loath to acknowledge that human activity has contributed to it .
They continue to insist , as Republicans since Ronald Reagan have , that the only real domestic enemy the American people face is the federal government , which they continue to want to starve .
It 's pretty astonishing , really - we 're at the tail end of a failed presidency , and the people running to succeed it are promising to continue its failed policies .
Now , many observers would say , well , they 're just pandering to their party 's rightwing base , and once one of them secures the nomination , he will tack to the centre .
Undoubtedly , he will , for tactical reasons .
But the real question is how the next Republican will govern should he happen to win .
And the answer to that question is that there 's every reason to assume that he will be just as a conservative as Bush for one simple reason : the interest groups that run the GOP will not brook much deviation from the standard line .
Those interest groups are three .
The neocons run foreign policy - the Iraq disaster has not affected their influence in the GOP one whit .
The theocons run social policy .
And the radical anti-taxers run domestic policy .
Until forces inside the GOP rise up to challenge these interests , any Republican administration will be roughly as conservative as Bush .
The candidates have slightly different theories of stasis , they will tinker around this edge or that , but that 's about all you can say .
On the Democratic side , there is far more divergence .
Not so much on policy - they 're all for universal or nearly universal healthcare , for getting out of Iraq , for doing more for unions , for bringing some equity and progressivity to our taxation system and so on .
If you 'd asked me a year ago what the major Democrats ' positions on the leading issues would be , I would not have guessed that they'd be this uniformly liberal .
What they differ on is how they and the country will accomplish these things .
The astute analyst and writer Mark Schmitt was the first to identify this phenomenon , naming the Democratic race the " theory of change " primary .
John Edwards 's theory of change is that the system is corrupt , spoiled by corporate greed , and so the way to get change is to wage a kind of class war against it .
Barack Obama 's theory of change is to ask independents and conservatives of good faith to work with him on encircling resistant forces and changing the system .
Hillary Clinton 's theory of change is that the system is failing Americans in certain particular respects and that it is best massaged by someone with years of experience working within it .
The Democratic caucus - goers of Iowa will tell us Thursday night which of these theories , retailed to them at close range for many months , they 've embraced , although the outcome seems likely to be close , so the question wo n't yet be settled .
Republican caucus - goers seem more likely to tell us that they like Mike Huckabee 's version of stasis .
But even that wo n't reveal much , because Iowa 's GOP caucus - goers are heavily weighted toward religious conservatives like Huckabee .
Whichever theory of change Democratic voters nominate , and whichever theory of statis Republican voters select , the choice before Americans next November will be stark .
In 2004 , many Americans , particularly liberals fearful about a second Bush term , took to calling that election " the most important of my lifetime " .
And it was , for a while .
Now this one is .

Preface :
Now that it has been discovered that the Pentagon , CIA , Vice President and other agencies and officials lied to The 9 - 11 Commission about the timeline of the military 's reaction to the hijackings , the interrogation of alleged members of Al - Qaeda , orders given regarding response to the hijackings and other issues , the Commission has decided to issue a revised , Second Edition of our Report .
Our revised Second Edition removes all material based on false or unverifiable information provided to us by the United States government .
As such , we hope that this revised Second Edition will lay to rest once and for all the distrust in the government that so many Americans have expressed , and will remove all controversy concerning the events of September 11th .
Tuesday , September 11 , 2001 , dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States .
Recommendation : Keep monitoring the weather .
Notes to the Second Edition : Because the government has refused to give the Commission access to any of real sources of unbiased information concerning the 9/11 attacks , obstructed our investigation , failed to fund the investigation in any meaningful fashion , and sabotaged our investigation from the first day , the weather for 9/11 is the only thing our Report can really discuss .
[ GW 's comment :
The above is , of course , parody .
The first sentence of the " Second Edition " is the first sentence from the original report , and the " recommendation " is just satire -- the Commission 's series of " Recommendations " end their Report .
It is true , however , that I could n't read much past the first sentence of the Report without running into claims based upon alleged confessions made by alleged members of Al Qaeda , concerning which information the government wants us to simply take its word , since it has destroyed any videotapes which would show what these people actually said , if anything .
In addition to the supposed interrogation information , there is also the false information about military reactions to the hijackings , Dick Cheney 's provably false statements about when he entered the PEOC command center and what orders he gave there , and many other demonstrably false assertions .
So , while this may be parody , it is - unfortunately - not far from the truth . ]

Bali climate conference ends in farce as US vetoes emission targets
By Patrick O’Connor
17 December 2007
The UN - sponsored climate change conference held on the Indonesian island of Bali ended on the weekend without any agreement on combatting global warming other than vague generalities .
A last - minute , face - saving communiqué was issued but , at the insistence of the Bush administration and its allies , it made no mention of specific carbon emission reduction targets .
The UN ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) had recommended a cut in carbon emissions of 25 to 40 percent in the advanced industrial countries by 2020 and a total world emissions reduction of 50 percent by 2050 .
More than 10,000 delegates , lobbyists , scientists and bureaucrats from 180 countries participated in the Bali conference .
The event was the first of a series of international summits scheduled over the next two years , which are to determine a successor agreement to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol due to expire in 2012 .
All of those present paid lip service to the need for concerted action to avert a global environmental calamity , but each national delegation was primarily concerned to defend its own narrow economic interests .
Deep divisions between the major powers dominated the conference .
The European powers , together with China , India and other emerging industrial countries , pressed for the inclusion of a reference to the IPCC emission targets in the final statement .
The Bush administration — which never ratified Kyoto and has adamantly refused to agree to binding carbon cuts — led a bloc of countries including Japan , Canada , and Australia , which rejected this and also demanded that so - called developing countries be issued emission targets .
( These countries are currently exempt under Kyoto . )
In the end , the Bali statement attempted to fudge all the disputed issues .
After acknowledging that evidence of climate change was “ unequivocal ” and that “ deep cuts in global emissions will be required ” , conference delegates endorsed “ quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives ” for developed countries without specifying any targets .
The question of whether undeveloped economies would be assigned emissions targets was similarly left unanswered .
Delegates agreed that “ nationally appropriate mitigation actions ” should be developed for China , India , Brazil and the other emerging industrial countries , “ supported by technology and enabled by financing and capacity - building ” .
Exactly what will be done — particularly relating to the transfer of technology and finance from the advanced capitalist countries — remains unclear and is subject to further negotiation between the participating countries .
Even this very limited statement was in doubt .
The conference was supposed to finish on Friday , but in the absence of an agreement , the reportedly acrimonious talks continued well into the weekend .
Only after all reference to specific emissions targets was dropped did Washington sign on .
Even at the last minute , US delegates threatened to halt everything because they were dissatisfied with a minor amendment included by India regarding the transfer of “ green ” technologies to developing countries .
Other delegates loudly booed the American team , which then withdrew its opposition to the amendment in the face of this hostility .
Sections of the US and international media presented the decision as a significant shift and even a “ u- turn ” on Washington ’s part .
Several members of the European delegation claimed the final communiqué was a victory on the grounds that the Bush administration signed on to the “ road map ” that would lead to a new agreement .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Shortly after the end of the conference , the White House released a statement that reiterated Bush ’s long standing positions and made clear that the Bali statement changed nothing .
Several climate scientists expressed disappointment with the outcome .
“ We could have moved on from here with a confident range of future cuts , ” the University of Washington ’s Andrew Light told the New York Times .
“ Instead we have to move on with the same continued uncertainty .
At the beginning of the week I was really heartened by the public praise the US delegation was giving to the IPCC and now I ca n’t help but think , was it all lip service ? ”
Angus Friday , Grenada ’s UN ambassador and chair of the Alliance of Small Islands , said : “ We are ending up with something so watered - down there was no need for 12,000 people to gather here in Bali .
We could have done that by email . ”
The Alliance of Small Islands is a grouping of low - lying island nations that face inundation from rising sea levels .
The UN ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had earlier issued clear cut warnings of the grave and immediate threat posed by global warming .
More than 200 climate scientists involved in the IPCC research issued an open letter to the Bali delegates pleading for urgent action .
“ The amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere now far exceeds the natural range of the past 650,000 years , and it is rising very quickly due to human activity , ” the letter explained .
“ If this trend is not halted soon , many millions of people will be at risk from extreme events such as heat waves , drought , floods and storms , our coasts will be threatened by rising sea levels , and many ecosystems , plants and animal species will be in serious danger of extinction . ”
Washington has again drawn international condemnation for its position on climate change .
Ever since coming to office , the Bush administration has sought to protect the interests of its close allies in the US oil industry by playing down the scientific evidence for climate change and refusing to ratify the Kyoto protocol .
American intransigence has allowed the European powers to posture as serious advocates for the world ’s environment .
However , the stance of Europeans is driven just as much by short - term economic self - interest .
The EU based its preferred targets on the IPCC report , which itself is outdated , relying on an assessment of scientific studies published only up to mid-2006 .
Additional evidence released in recent months indicates that climate change is far more advanced than was previously realised and requires far greater emissions cuts .
Greenhouse gas emissions are rising faster than even the worst - case IPCC scenarios forecast .
While carbon dioxide emissions increased by 1.1 percent a year from 1990 - 1999 , they grew by more than 3 percent from 2000 to 2004 .
This enormous increase , which testifies to the failure of the Kyoto Protocol to address the climate change crisis , threatens to trigger irreversible climate change “ multipliers ” .
One of these potential multipliers is the melting of the Arctic ice cap , which is proceeding far more rapidly than the IPCC realised .
Scientists this week warned that Arctic ice could completely melt during summer as soon as 2013 .
Recent studies have established that the melting of the polar ice caps is not a gradual , linear process but instead flips from one state to another as temperature increases lead to a qualitative transformation in the structure of polar ice sheets .
Scientists from NASA , Colombia University and the University of California published a paper in May showing that when temperatures rose to 2 - 3 degrees Celsius above today ’s level , 3.5 million years ago , sea levels rose by 25 metres .
The study concluded by warning that the Earth was in “ imminent peril ” and stated that without major emissions cuts , “ devastating sea - level rise will inevitably occur ” .
This process , should it ever occur , will only compound the problem of global warming .
An absence of polar ice means that heat previously reflected back into space will be absorbed by the world ’s earth and oceans , leading to a cycle of further heat absorption and warming .
The precise level of emission cuts required to prevent dangerous global warming is not known .
One scientific study published this year in the Geophysical Research Letters journal concluded that even with a 90 percent cut in global emissions by 2050 , the generally agreed threshold of tolerable global warming — a 2 degree Celsius rise above pre-industrial level — would eventually be broken .
Some scientists have warned that what is required is nothing less than the immediate transition to a “ decarbonised ” world economy .
None of the major delegations to the Bali conference raised this possibility .
That the European powers stuck with the outdated emission reduction recommendations points to the fact that their position was not driven by genuine concern for the environment .
Their real agenda is that of securing the long - term future of the $ US30 billion Emissions Trading Scheme ( ETS ) and maintaining Europe ’s domination of the world carbon commodity trade .
A joint communiqué issued by more than 150 mostly British and European companies before the Bali conference underscored the enormous economic interests at stake .
The statement — signed by executives of companies including Shell , Allianz , HSBC Bank , KPMG , British Airways and Lloyds Bank — demanded the establishment of emission reduction targets , including a 50 percent cut by 2050 .
The “ shift to a low - carbon economy will create significant business opportunities , ” the corporate chiefs declared .
“ New markets for low carbon technologies and products , worth billions of dollars , will be created if the world acts on the scale required ... we believe that tackling climate change is the pro-growth strategy . ”
The European ETS has emerged as the most lucrative of all the so - called free market mechanisms developed through the Kyoto Protocol .
The ETS has done nothing to significantly reduce emissions in Europe , but it has spawned an enormous international market in carbon investment and speculation .
Carbon trading involves businesses being allocated emissions “ credits ” which can be sold to other corporate polluters if their carbon output falls under their allotted “ cap ” .
All the world ’s leading banks and financial institutions are now involved in various forms of carbon investment and speculation .
“ More than $ US60 billion changed hands in the global carbon market this year , double the trade of last year and up from just $ US400 million three years ago , ” an article in last Saturday ’s Sydney Morning Herald titled “ Bali ’s Business Bonanza ” explained .
“ Analysts estimate the market could be worth $ US1 trillion within the next 10 years .
By 2030 , according to some carbon bulls , it may even be the biggest commodity market in the world , overtaking crude oil . ”
The carbon market has rapidly developed into a vast international racket , with an array of subsidiary corporate industries and services .
Their representatives played a prominent role in the Bali discussions .
The largest single lobby group at the conference was the International Emissions Trading Association , which constituted 7.5 percent of the nearly 4,500 registered non-governmental organisation delegates .
More than twice as many carbon trading operatives were present than representatives for the World Wide Fund for Nature and Greenpeace combined .
The carbon trading industry received a major boost through the Bali conference , primarily due to the efforts of the EU delegation .
In one of the few concrete measures agreed at the meeting , deforestation will now be tied to the European ETS .
A new scheme known as “ reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ” ( REDD ) will allow Europe ’s corporate polluters to maintain existing operations , even if they emit more than their allotted cap , provided that they buy additional carbon credits through schemes to supposedly prevent deforestation in undeveloped countries .
The plan , which is modelled on the corruption - riddled Clean Development Mechanism , will almost certainly fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or halt deforestation .
It will , however , generate further profits for the international carbon market .
Analysts estimate that carbon credits worth $ US10 billion a year could be generated through the REDD scheme in Indonesia alone .
The European powers expect that the enormous profits on offer will lead to a significant shift in the US after Bush leaves office .
A similar process in Australia culminated in the Labor government ’s ratification of Kyoto .
Just as Australian big business repudiated the Howard government ’s intransigent stance , so powerful sections of corporate America have concluded that Bush has favoured the fossil fuel industry at the expense of their broader interests .
Earlier this year the US Climate Action Partnership — comprised of major corporations including Alcoa , Chrysler , Ford , General Motors , Dow Chemical , General Electric , and Rio Tinto — issued a “ call to action ” to the US president and congress , demanding the establishment of a national carbon trading market based on clear emission targets .
The three leading Democratic presidential candidates — Hillary Clinton , John Edwards , and Barack Obama — have all pledged to set up a US carbon - trading scheme , as has Republican challenger John McCain .
Other Republicans are yet to make their position clear .
None of the piecemeal and pro-market schemes advanced by the major capitalist powers can resolve the climate change crisis .
The entire framework within which the Kyoto and post - Kyoto negotiations have proceeded testifies to the anarchic and anachronistic character of the capitalist system .
While the present epoch is marked by the ever - closer integration of the world economy , official discussion on potential solutions to climate change remains posed in terms of national emissions targets .
This has inevitably led to absurdities .
If , for example , an American transnational corporation is emitting copious greenhouse gases in a factory located in Mexico , which country is credited with the emissions ?
Under Kyoto the answer is Mexico .
Or if Australian mining companies export enormous supplies of coal , a fossil fuel , to China for electricity generation , which country is held responsible for the resulting carbon combustion ?
Under Kyoto — China .
And what about the emissions generated by international travel ?
Should ships and planes transporting people and goods add to the tally of national emissions for the country of departure or of origin ?
Under Kyoto , these emissions are classed as “ orphan emissions ” and not attributed to any country .
To achieve the reduction in required global carbon emissions , nothing less than the complete reorganisation of the world economy is necessary .
An internationally coordinated economic plan is needed involving the complete restructuring of the world ’s industrial and agricultural sectors , as well as the reorganisation of energy generation , transportation , and urban planning .
As the outcome of the Bali conference again demonstrated , this is impossible under the present capitalist order in which the priority is the short - term profits of the corporate elite at the expense of the social needs of the majority and the long - term viability of the planet as a whole .
" An electronic voting system is to a mechanical one what a nuclear bomb is to a hand grenade .
If someone manages to sabotage it , the results can be catastrophic " unknown Gosh , what a bummer , all the polls predicted a blowout for Obama 49 / 29 .
Huh ?
Seems that only Hillary saw a sudden surge .
" Old Dems " ( women ) coming out to vote - her tears - Whites deciding not to vote for a Black , etc , are just some of the cartoon sound bites used to describe the " most stunning upset in the history of politics . "
The Diebold optical - scan system is used across NH .
Approximately 25 % of NH votes are hand counted .
Only if the paper ballots are properly audited by hand in some fashion , can the results of the op - scanners be trusted in any way , shape or form .
The machines used in NH ( also Vermont , Conneticut , Massachusetts ) are the same ones seen being hacked in HBO 's documentary ' Hacking Democracy ' ( shown across NH in 2004 ) .
A single private company , with a very bad record , LHS Associates , Diebold 's distributor and technical contractor in New England , runs the elections and CONTROLS the vulnerable memory cards for the voting systems across the state .
Diebold 's opti-scan ( paper ballot ) voting system uses a curious memory card design , offering penetration by a lone programmer such that standard canvassing procedures cannot detect manipulation .
This method is the equivalent of having a little man living in the ballot box , holding an eraser and a pencil .
With an executable program in the ' memory card ' , no Diebold opti-scan ballot box can be considered empty at the start of an election !
This company has an horrendous record of lax security policies and has admitted to having replaced memory cards , on a whim , on their own , in the middle of past elections .
Jan 9 - 2008 , Bev Harris expert in computer hacking states : " NH is the exact opposite of Iowa .
NH used one of the worst systems in America and then handed the programming of EVERY memory card in NH over to a PRIVATE ( LSH Associates ) OUTFIT run by John Silvesto . "
So much for the " Live Free or Die " state - when you entrust the people 's most treasured asset to a corporation !
Truth be told , when voting today , you 'd do better putting a quarter in a bubble gum or slot machine !
Voter fraud expert Bev Harris has warned that NH 's electronic voting machines are wide open to fraud and that even modestly skilled programmers were able to identify key vulnerabilities .
The contract for programming all of NH's DIEBOLD voting machines , which combined count 81 % of the NH vote , is owned by LHS Associates .
It 's not like NH politicians are unaware of this travesty against NH citizens :
In Sept 2007 - hearings in Concord showed ( see video clip ) the duplicity and chicanery !
This was not reported on our local news .
" It 's who counts the votes " that matters .
Who can forget Lieberman in Conneticut ?
Hell he can't make up what country he represents let alone party ?
In 2000 the candidate running against Lieberman got 448,077 votes .
In 2006 the candidate ( Lamont ) who ran against Lieberman got the exact same number of votes , 448,077 .
Huh , I wonder what the ' chances ' are for this ?
Looks to me like they just keep the machines programed in CT for Lieberman ?
Suspicious me - why can't I just conform and mooove with the herd ?
Yawn - the more things ' change ' the more they remain the same .
" Once during the time when days were darker , I made a promise .
Thanks New Hamphire ! " President - elect George Bush , Nov 8 , 1988 victory speech .
Bush senior needed NH or he was out of the race .
He 'd come in third in the Iowa caucus 19 % to Dole 's 38 % .
The computers that spoke in Nov 1988 held in their inner workings small boxes that contained ' secret codes ' that only the sellers of the computers could read .
The programs or ' source codes ' were regarded as ' trade secrets ' .
The sellers of the vote - counting software zealously guarded their programs from the public ( voters ) fearful that someone would steal their ' ideas ' .
You may ask :
What secret is needed to count something as simple as ballots ?
Can they be more complex than an ATM or grocery receipt ?
Only the Shadow knows !
We know nothing about the people programming these machines and even less about LHS Associates .
People like to say ' but we can use paper ballots !
They can always be counted by hand ! '
But they 're not .
They 're counted by DIEBOLD .
Only a candidate can request a hand recount .
Nobody in NH ( across the country ) except the programmers at LHS Associates and Diebold Election Systems knows .
Why has n't our Attorney General / Secretary of State and legislators put the vote in the ' live free or die ' state back into the hands of the people ?
That 's what we'd all like to know ?
Checks and balances , required by the FEC standards to catch unauthorized changes , have not been implemented by Diebold - yet the system was certified anyway ?
Never trust a machine !
Dr. Howard Strauss , a Princeton computer science professor stated : " The presidential election , without too much difficulty and with little chance of the felons getting caught , could be stolen by computers for one candidate or another .
The candidate who can win by computer has worked to rig the election by getting his ' consultants ' to write the software that runs thousands of vote - counting computers from coast to coast .
There are so many computers that use the same software now that a presidential election can be tampered with - in fact , may already be tampered with .
Because of the trade secrecy , nobody can be the wiser " .
I may not be the sharpest tool in the shed but what legtimate representative democracy entrusts its citizen 's most precious asset ( their vote ) into the hands of corporate predators ?
Computers in voting machines are effectively immune from checking and rechecking .
If they are fixed , you cannot know it , and you can not be at all sure of an honest tally .
In the 1988 Republican primary in New Hampshire , there was no panel of computer experts who worked for the people and throughly examined the source codes before and after the voting .
It is quite possible that the notorious collection of " Shouptronic " computers " preordained " voting results to give George Bush his " Hail Mary " victory in NH ?
Yes Virginia there are unscrupulous people in this world - sorry .
Nobody save a small group of computer engineers , like Republican Governor John Sununu , ( genius engineer - 3 degrees from MIT ) would be the wiser ?
Recall that back in 1988 your perception of who won or lost was not based on the honest visible marks on paper ballots that were checked and rechecked by all concerned parties or their chosen representatives .
You learned about George Bush Senior 's astounding victory in NH from TV - which learned it from a computer center into which other computers fed information .
Just like this year 's NH Primary .
TV is my teacher far into the night !
TV would n't lie ?
Was the NH Primary scenario a modern classic in computerized vote manipulation ?
The Bush campaign of ' 88 , saw George Bush standing to lose the Republican nomination .
He had suffered a terrible political wound when Dole won by a BIG show of hands in the Iowa caucus .
Every TV and newspaper poll had Bush losing by up to eight points just before balloting .
When election day was over the following headline appeared in the Washington Post : NEW HAMPSHIRE CONFOUNDED MOST POLLSTERS .
The poll was wrong by 17 points !
Some believe that such a wild reversal of form would have been subject to an immediate inquiry ?
Any horseplayer would have nodded sagely , put a finger up to his eye , pulled down the lower lid , and signaled : " Fix " .
In NH there was wonderment in the press , and little more .
There was no rechecking of the computerized machines , no inquiry into the path of the vote from the voting to the central tallying place ( Voter News Service - New York ) etc .
No longer in business .
Nothing was said in the press about the programmed computer chips inside the " Shouptronic " Direct Recording Electronic voting machines in Manchester .
These 200 lb systems were so easily tampered with that the integrity of the results they gave - will forever be in doubt .
The " Shoutronic " was purchased directly from a company whose owner Ransom Shoup , had been twice convicted of vote fraud in Philidelphia .
It bristled with telephone lines that made it possible for instructions from OUTSIDE to be telephoned into the machine without anyone 's knowledge .
It completely lacked an AUDIT TRAIL , an independent record , that could be checked in case the machine ' broke down ' or its results challenged .
The concept is clear , simple and it works .
Computerized voting gives the power of selection , without fear of discovery , to whomever controls the computer .
If you ask your friends to describe how their vote ( if they vote ) is counted , they are unlikely to get much further than the polling booth and the rudimentary requirements to operate the machine .
Beyond that they are probably ignorant .
Most people expect that the Democrat and Republican poll watchers will watch out for their interests .
During a little publicized trial in West Virginia , it was revealed that there were ways to stop the computers during a count , while everyone watched .
Simply fiddle a few switches , turn the computer back on again , and thereby alter the entire vote , or parts of it .
If anyone asked questions , the fixer could make any number of plausible excuses .
With voting machines attached to telephone lines it was possible to meddle with the actual vote from a telephone miles away .
Getting caught was NOT possible - not with SECRET source codes .
A 1980 U.S. electoral study by the Air Command and Staff College reported : " The US government has NO elections office and does not attempt to administer congressional elections .
In the case of counting actual ballots on election night , public officials have abdicated responsibility of vote totals to a private organization , Voter News Service " ( now regrouped ) " This private organization performed without a contract : without supervision by public officials .
It made decisions concerning its duties according to its own criteria .
The question and accountability of Voter News Service was never reported in the nation 's press because the responsibility of Voter News had in counting the nation 's votes was assumed gradually over a lengthy period without ever being evaluated as an item on the public agenda " .
Britney Spears was n't employed there !
Your Vote :
Once the vote is cast and counted by computers , the unverifiable results were then transferred to Voter News Services .
This little - know private media conglomerate located on 34th street in New York was one of the most powerful corporations in the world .
Comprised of all the major networks - NBC , CBS , ABC , CNN , AP plus the New York Times and the Washington Post - Voter News Service was the ONLY entity tabulating the nation 's votes and disseminating the results to the PUBLIC .
This means that the dramatic election night ' competition ' among the Networks to be first with the results in nothing but show business !
They all get their numbers from the same place .
Note : Jan 14-2003 , Washington Post : " The major TV networks & AP decided to dissolve the Voter News Service exit poll consortium .
They have not yet reached an agreement on a replacement . "
Though Voter News folded the networks were reported as regrouping to form a new consortium with some of the Voter News Service employees .
Since this entity is so secretive ( changed names ) it 's next to impossible to track down any information of their current activities ?
Reports are that it is now identified as the National Election Poll ?
This is a rare photo of the Voter News Service Exit poll box .
Perhaps these were abandoned because of the polling results being so far out of alignment with the desired results ?
Could n't tell you - only the Shadow knows .
Be it the defunct Voter News Service or its replacement - these consortium 's have co-opted the American vote count with NO public knowledge , and no public bid .
They remain exempt from anti-trust laws .
They have NO literature , no brochure , no fax sheet , and no Website .
They have changed their name approximately three times ?
They will not tell you anything about what they do .
No , you cannot watch their operation .
No , you can not get in the doors on election night .
No , you can not work for them .
You also cannot get a straight answer from them on how the count the vote , where they do it , and who does it !
It should n't surprise anyone that the vote is in the hands of the few .
Who is the watchdog ?
There are none .
A reading of Votescam : The Stealing of America , by James and Kenneth Collier , published in 1992 , has been banned by all major book chains .
You can purchase it online ( cheap ) .
It 's pretty safe to say that there has not been an honest election - at least not an important one - since the late 1960s , and its possible that there has never been an honest election at all .
And Governor Sununu ?
Bush the greater , appointed this man , who he did n't ( until NH primary - 1988 ) know from a cow pie , as his Chief of Staff .
Pretty powerful position for a nonentity .
What a great thank you !
Ca n't prove anything ( no paper trail ) its just these pesky aberrations ( like NH 's supposed blowout for Obama ) with the polls that keep popping up , and things like computers that go down in the middle of an election , and then come back up with different results - entirely different - than before .
Ohio Voting Machines readied for 2004 : See http://www.freepress.org/departements/display/19/2007/2553
; which never made the national news .
The only part I take exception to , is that the lust for power , is not exclusionary to one party -
This voting debacle is truly a non-partisan issue .
Otherwise you 'd hear some outrage ( besides Edwards & Kucinich ) on the part of candidates running for office .
Ah but if you should question the integrity of corporate hucksters controlling our nation 's vote - you 'll be named the fruit loop !
But we can have observers in Third World Countries .
Huh ?
Today 's explanation that is being given by the ' news ' for such an aberration in the NH polls ?
" White people lie ! "
And guess what ?
The majority of people will buy this goofy clap trap .
The Corporate Clowns with Hatchets are destroying the American midway .
Denis Kucnich has sent a letter to the NH Secretary of State asking for a recount of NH 's votes because of ' unexplained disparities between hand counted votes and Diebold votes . '
U.S. Congressman Kucnich is n't interested in challenging his votes .
He says " This is about establishing whether 1005 % of the votes counted are exactly as the people cast them .
None of the other candidates seem concerned that corporate voting machines are the final authority !
" Under a democracy one party always devotes its chief energies in trying to prove that the other party is unfit to rule - and both commondly succeed , and are right . "

With the recent talk on the blogosphere about deployment ( and for Django , and lots of other posts too ) , people are thinking about PHP a bit more analytically .
I think people mostly get it wrong .
There are several different process models for the web :
CGI , where every request creates a new process , and the process handles only one request .
( You could also fork a new process each request with mostly the same result . )
Worker processes , where a process handles one request at a time , but the process is long - lived and will handle another request after finishing the first .
Threaded , where a process handles multiple requests , each in its own thread .
Threads may or may not be reused ( depending on whether you use a thread pool ) , and that ’s kind of like the difference between CGI and worker processes .
But it ’s not a big difference because either way the process is long lived , including all your objects .
Asynchronous , where a process handles multiple requests without threads .
Typically your code is event driven : a request is an event , but so are things like “ database results returned ” , or “ file read from disk ” .
Code takes the form of short snippets between these events .
What people do n’t realize is that PHP is effectively a CGI model of execution .
People do n’t appreciate this because PHP is implemented with mod_php , an Apache module .
There are many other modules like mod_perl ( the first of these mod_language modules ) , mod_python , mod_ruby , etc .
None of these other modules are like mod_php .
This has led many a commentator astray because they do n’t get this .
This is because the PHP language was written for mod_php .
Perl , Python , Ruby — none of them were written to be used as an Apache module .
You ca n’t take one of these existing languages and just retrofit it to be like PHP or like mod_php .
Why is it important that PHP has a CGI like model ?
Mostly because it lets two groups separate their work : system administration types ( including hosting companies ) set up the environment , and developer types use the environment , and they do n’t have to interact much .
The developers are empowered , and the administrators are not bothered .
Some details :
PHP processes can leak memory like crazy .
It does n’t matter because they only leak memory for one request .

PHP processes can be easily killed if they act badly ( sucking up too much memory or if they get caught in an infinite loop ) .

PHP code has no global state .
It has lots of global variables , but since they only live for one request they are relatively harmless .
( Not entirely harmless , but what ’s a major sin in another language is only a minor sin in PHP .)
The process cannot become corrupted .

There ’s no global set of installed libraries ( besides what PHP is compiled with ) .

If you want to include a library you include files , typically relative paths .
You wo n’t include someone else ’s library accidentally .
( This has changed in , but the search path remains largely unused . )
Most of the language is implemented in C , in a shared library .
In comparison Python has “ batteries included ” , but those batteries are largely written in Python .
Python code is not shareable , and can take time to load up .
So while a single Python CGI script might be small , it probably imports lots of code which would have to be loaded each request .
PHP scripts actually are small .
( Stuff like PEAR changes this by adding substantial libraries written in PHP , but also seriously effects PHP performance . )

( Stuff like changes this by adding substantial libraries written in , but also seriously effects performance . )
What few system - dependent libraries and C extensions that are required are compiled into PHP , and hosting companies have kind of figured out a consistent set of these libraries ( stuff like database drivers , an image processing library , and XML parsing ) .
Individual developers write only PHP ( and that ’s all they are typically allowed to write ) .
These features are all contrary to the design of these other languages , and even more contrary to the conventions in other language communities .
Python programmers could write all their libraries in C and start to make CGI scripts feasible , but they do n’t and they wo n’t .
Focusing on mod_php is a goose chase .
You have to focus on the features it provides .
Here ’s the features I think are important :
The failure cases are isolated .
Processes never get wedged .
One user does n’t take out another user ’s application .
Even one bad page in an application wo n’t take out the entire application .
File - based deployment .
There is n’t a build process for deploying a PHP application .
You put the files in the right place and they are deployed .
( Configuration in PHP is fuzzy , but PHP is not perfect . )
application .
You put the files in the right place and they are deployed .
( Configuration in is fuzzy , but is not perfect . )
Minimal global dependencies .
If you use libraries then you package those libraries with your application .
You do n’t worry about the administrator upgrading something on the system and breaking your application .
( At least not much , there still things like upgrading mod_php that can break your application , or changing settings in php.ini .
PHP is not perfect . )
is not perfect . )
It ’s pretty easy to do multiple deployments for development .
You just drop another copy of the files somewhere else and change your database settings .
And of course the high - level features :
Working applications stay working .
( Even half - working applications at least stay half - working . )
Administrators are n’t being hassled to make little changes and fixes all the time .
Developers can do what they need to do without going through the administrators .
People or organizations that are hybrid developer / administrators do n’t care about this so much .
And that makes sense ; this is all about separating those two roles .
Though even developer / administrators would benefit from a better story here because it would let them concentrate more on being developers and the administration part will start taking care of itself .
Solving this is all the harder because of how it interacts with the language itself .
But it ’s not impossible .
Process model 2 — worker processes — are feasible for most languages .
You just need a really good process manager ( including process setup for isolation , and process monitoring to mitigate problems ) .
Apache alone is not this manager .
mod_fastcgi could be this manager , but it ’s not .
Maybe mod_wsgi will become this manager for Python .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Black Death that decimated populations in Europe and elsewhere during the middle of the 14th century may not have been a blindly indiscriminate killer , as some experts have believed .
This undated handout photograph shows the skull of a woman killed by the Black Death in the middle of the 14th century in London .
A new analysis of 490 skeletons from a London cemetery for Black Death victims demonstrated that the plague did not place everyone at equal risk , two U.S. scientists wrote in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
While many perfectly healthy people were cut down , those already in poor health prior to the arrival of the plague were more likely to have perished , they found .

An analysis of 490 skeletons from a London for Black Death victims demonstrated that the infection did not affect everyone equally , two U.S. scientists said on Monday .
While many perfectly healthy people certainly were cut down , those already in poor health prior to the arrival of the plague were more likely to have perished , they found .
“ A lot of people have assumed that the Black Death killed indiscriminately , just because it had such massive mortality , ” anthropologist Sharon DeWitte of the University at Albany in New York , said in a telephone interview .
People already in poor health often are more vulnerable in epidemics .
“ But there ’s been a tradition of thinking that the Black Death was this unique case where no one was safe and if you were exposed to the disease that was it .
You had three to five days , and then you were dead , ” DeWitte said .
The plague epidemic of 1347 to 1351 was one of the deadliest recorded in human history , killing about 75 million people , according to some estimates , including more than a third of Europe ’s population .
DeWitte analyzed skeletons unearthed from the East Smithfield cemetery in London , dug especially for plague victims and excavated in the 1980s , for bone and teeth abnormalities that would show that people had health problems before they died of plague .
She found such abnormalities in many skeletons , suggesting these people had experienced malnutrition , iron deficiencies and infections well before succumbing to the Black Death .
The proportion of people with such signs of frailty in the cemetery , compared to those who appeared to have been of robust health before the epidemic , indicated that the infection was somewhat selective in who it killed , DeWitte and Pennsylvania State University anthropologist James Wood reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Some experts have thought the Black Death -- named after the black spots the bubonic form of the plague caused on the skin -- killed indiscriminately regardless of age , sex or level of health because it was so virulent and the European population so immunologically unprepared , DeWitte and Wood wrote .
“ The Black Death was highly virulent and undoubtedly killed many otherwise healthy people who would have been unlikely to die under normal - mortality conditions , ” they wrote .
But people already in poor health were more likely to die , they wrote .
Many scientists think the plague was caused by Yersinia pestis , a bacterial disease spread by fleas from rats .
It still kills between 100 and 200 people a year .
The Black Death pandemic thought to have begun in Asia , then spread into the Middle East , Africa and Europe .
“ On average , it killed between 30 to 50 percent of affected populations .
But we know that there were some areas where mortality was even higher .
So there would have been villages that were completely wiped out , ” DeWitte said .
Other experts now think the Black Death may have been caused not by bubonic plague but by a viral hemorrhagic fever , similar to the disease caused by the Ebola or dengue viruses .
Story Highlights •
Benchmarks in bill would be tied to Iraqi economic aid
• White House declines comment on items in proposed legislation
• Bill also would raise minimum wage to $ 7.25 per hour
• Democrats still hope to write timetable into defense spending bill during summer
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi will present a plan to House Democrats for a war funding bill that wo n't include a timeline for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq but will feature benchmarks with consequences , according to Democratic leadership aides .
The bill also would raise the federal minimum wage to $ 7.25 per hour from $ 5.15 per hour , and fund other domestic spending programs , which were still being negotiated .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said any talk of a deal was premature .
" We 're hopeful that the discussions over the emergency supplemental funding bill for the troops is nearing a conclusion , " she said .
" We have not seen the final language yet , and we look forward to reviewing it . "
The legislation would provide more than $ 90 billion to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through September 30 , the end of the fiscal year .
Leadership aides said the benchmarks would be tied to Iraq reconstruction aid and would require President Bush to present to Congress numerous reports before August .
They said Democrats wo n't give up on a deadline for pulling troops out of Iraq , hoping to write language into defense appropriations and defense authorization bills over the summer .
Some prominent antiwar Democrats denounced the compromise , and even Pelosi said she was unsure of her vote .
But Rep. Rahm Emanuel , the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus , called the plan " the beginning of the end of the president 's policy on Iraq . "
In the Senate , Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , said the final bill has yet to emerge .
But he said he expects to vote on the spending bill by Thursday night or Friday , and he said that even if the bill goes no further than setting benchmarks , " it 's a lot more than the president ever expected he'd have to agree to . "
" Keep in mind , this is the seventh supplemental appropriation bill that the president has sent us , " said Reid .
" We do n't know what the language will be on this for sure , but it 's for certain it'll be the first supplemental ... that he has n't been given a blank check . "
Meanwhile , he said , Democratic efforts to wind down the war will continue .
" We 're going to continue our battle -- and that 's what it is -- to represent the American people like they want us to represent them , to change the course of the war in Iraq , " Reid said .
Republican senators , who had objected to timelines and deadlines , sounded optimistic that a compromise would be reached .
" Hopefully , we will get through this process before Memorial Day , " said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Kentucky .
" I know that 's been the desire certainly of the majority leader , to finish the bill , to get the bill to the president for signature without a ' surrender date . '
I think that is the direction in which we are headed . "
The language on benchmarks will be taken from an amendment backed by Sen. John Warner , the influential former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Reconstruction funds could be cut if the Iraqi government fails to meet the U.S. benchmarks -- but the president could waive those penalties if he feels it necessary , leading several Democrats to blast the plan as toothless .
Even Pelosi hedged her support for the bill , telling reporters , " I 'm not likely to vote for something that does n't have a timetable or a goal of coming home . "
But the speaker said party leaders will not be trying to whip members into line on the vote .
House leaders are splitting the package up into two amendments .
The first contains the war spending ; the second contains up to $ 20 billion in additional money for military and veterans ' health care , children 's health insurance programs and hurricane reconstruction in addition to the minimum wage increase .
The tie to the minimum wage rankled another war critic , Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio .
" If this is true , and I hope it is not , it tells American workers that the only way that they will get an increase in wages is to continue funding a war that is taking the lives of their sons and daughters , " said Kucinich , a candidate for the party 's 2008 presidential nomination .
A leading anti-war voice in the Senate , Wisconsin Democrat Sen. Russ Feingold , said Tuesday that the proposed bill " does nothing to end this disastrous war . "
" I cannot support a bill that contains nothing more than toothless benchmarks and that allows the president to continue what may be the greatest foreign policy blunder in our nation 's history , " Feingold announced on his Web site .
The proposal would require the Bush administration to send progress reports to Congress in July and September , and make changes to U.S. strategy if the Iraqis have made no progress in reaching a political settlement .
Warner said the measure would send the message to Iraq that " we 're not there forever , " and that the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki must " pull your own weight and do your responsible job . "
Democrats have said they wanted to get Bush a bill that he could sign by the Memorial Day weekend .
The vote in the House of Representatives could come as late as Friday , the day the weekend starts .
Bush vetoed a bill last month that included a timetable for withdrawing troops .
Bush also objected to portions of that bill that would have provided domestic funding .
CNN 's Dana Bash , Andrea Koppel and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .
Since its introduction in 2005 , “ Guitar Hero ” has become one of the most popular video game franchises in the world .
Its latest installment , “ Guitar Hero III , ” released at the height of the 2007 holiday shopping blitz , raked in more than $ 115 million in sales in its first week alone .
Regardless of actual musical talent , legions of would - be rock stars , young and old , can now live out their rock ’n ’ roll fantasies from the comfort of their living rooms via a flimsy plastic guitar , modeled after the Holy Grail of rock axes , the Gibson SG .
Originally intended as a means for folks without appreciable musical skill to feel the thrill of shredding classic - rock guitar riffs , the game is , at its core , just a game .
Color - coded “ notes ” scroll on a TV screen and correspond to buttons on the guitar ’s fret board .
A “ strum bar ” simulates picking action , while a whammy bar can be employed for maximum face - melting effect .
Players earn points for accurately hitting and sustaining notes and chords in rhythm .
Meanwhile , depending on the player ’s performance , his or her virtual onscreen counterpart — a cartoonish rock cliché — shreds the axe , also cartoonishly .
Frankly , it ’s a hoot .
The game does require significant hand - eye coordination , particularly at its most difficult levels .
But the key to its popularity is that gameplay does n’t involve any real musical technique .
Or does it ?
Dave Contois , owner of Contois Music in Essex Junction , begs to differ .
A pillar of the town ’s music community for 38 years , this small , family - owned business has provided lessons to generations of aspiring musicians and sold them their first instruments .
Perhaps it ’s a sign of the times , but these days , the kids are coming to play video games — specifically , “ Guitar Hero . ”
Contois and his staff of instructors have long been ahead of the curve when it comes to using current technology in tandem with traditional music - education methods .
From employing electronic keyboards with lights to guide novice players to the correct keys , to offering online music - theory programs to engage his students , the Berklee - trained Vermont native has seen firsthand how effectively technology can be adapted to captivate young minds .
Perhaps it should come as no surprise , then , that Contois has begun using the wildly popular game as a means of teaching guitar .
Still , it ’s something of a shock to walk through the front door of his small store on Route 15 and be greeted by a giant “ Guitar Hero ” display , which honestly would look more at home at Best Buy or Toys R Us .
“ I ’d wager you would n’t see this in too many other music shops , ” Contois says with a chuckle .
As more and more school districts cut funding to the arts and music , it goes without saying that music stores like this one feel the trickle - down effects .
But for Contois , selling a video game in a music store is no scheme to turn a quick buck — or , in this case , about $ 100 per game .
Rather , it ’s a natural extension of his educational philosophy .
“ I do n’t care what is , ” he says , adding , “ if it gets kids interested in music , I ’m all for it . ”
Generating interest in music is one thing .
But can a video game about music , even one as engaging as “ Guitar Hero , ” really translate into guitar proficiency ?
In short , yes .
As he watched his son Tanner shred through level after level of the game , it occurred to Contois that what kids are really accomplishing via “ Guitar Hero ” — largely without realizing it — is learning basic music theory .
By showing them the link between what they do on the plastic SG and what they could do on an actual guitar , one might inspire an entire generation of potential musicians .
The game presents notes in rhythms that correspond to those of each song .
( The soundtrack consists of re-recorded versions of rock classics such as Lynyrd Skynyrd ’s “ Freebird . ” )
Hit a note on the wrong beat and you lose points .
Nail it and you win .
Pretty simple .
But the brilliance of the game , intended or not , is that it instills the player not only with a sense of rhythmic timing but also with a subconscious recognition of melody lines .
Essentially , what players see as little colored dots scrolling down a TV screen are actually a form of guitar tablature .
And when you connect those dots , you ’ve got the makings of a real guitar player .
“ Kids could play that game forever and probably never even touch a guitar , ” Contois says .
“ They might not even show any interest in playing guitar , ” he adds .
“ But when you show them that what they ’re doing is actually related to playing guitar , that it ’s tablature , it ’s like a light goes on .
Once they make the connection and figure out that they want to play guitar , whatever they ’ve done in the game has absolutely helped them to get into that instrument . ”
Contois proves his theory by handing this reporter a little plastic guitar with five brightly colored , finger - sized buttons on the neck and a miniature whammy bar .
“ Try it , ” he says with a grin , selecting Deep Purple ’s “ Smoke on the Water ” from the game ’s menu .
Guitar instructor Stu Cook , 36 , sits on a nearby stool with an actual guitar across his lap .
The game loads , and lights come up on an outlandishly decorated stage .
Notes begin to scroll at the bottom of the screen , and I do my best to keep up .
I miss the opening riff completely , my fingers still adjusting to the controls on the neck .
Eventually , I settle in and run off three or four riffs in a row .
The crowd — the virtual one , anyway — goes wild .
My “ Rock Meter ” is off the charts , so I lay into the whammy bar , prompting lightning to strike the stage .
Rad , I think , just before completely muffing the final third of the song .
Meanwhile , Cook plays along on his real guitar , following a book of tablature published by “ Guitar Hero . ”
The song ends , and he hands me his axe .
“ OK , ” he says , “ now play it for real . ”
Though I ’m a moderately accomplished guitar player , I ’ve never learned to read tablature .
Cook briefly explains how it corresponds to the guitar ’s frets and strings and then sets me loose to play along with Deep Purple — or their virtual equivalent , at least .
Again , I stumble a bit at the start , but eventually I get it .
This time , though , I leave the whammy bar alone .
“ Everyone knows the game is pretty cool , ” says Contois .
“ But this , ” he adds , pointing to the guitar in my lap , “ this is a lot cooler . ” I nod in agreement .
It would be easy to dismiss Contois ’ method as a gimmick .
But his 50 - plus students would probably disagree .
In fact , a small group of them recently performed as a band at the Lincoln Inn in Essex Junction .
They opened for local rockers The Phil Abair Band , playing songs they learned through “ Guitar Hero ” and the game ’s latest spin - off , “ Rock Band ” — which applies the same principles to bass guitar , drums and vocals .
Judging from a video record of the show , some area cover bands could stand to learn a thing or two from the game .
Contois spreads the “ Guitar Hero ” gospel outside Vermont , too :
He was selected to present at a recent National Association of Music Merchants conference in San Diego , as part of the “ Guitar Hero ” booth .
For his pupils , the game is certainly a hook .
But learning how to play an instrument is still the most important aspect of the lessons .
Contois and his instructors use the same music - theory curriculum that Berklee students are taught .
And sometimes they can convey it more nimbly , he says , with the aid of “ Guitar Hero . ”
“ I had one student who started guitar back in September .
Two months later he ’s learned some ‘ Guitar Hero ’ tablature ; he ’s playing some pretty complicated Dire Straits passages , ” says Cook .
“ When I started playing , two months in I was still strumming open chords . ”
Contois concurs .
“ The kids who are really into it pick it up so much faster now , ” he says approvingly .
“ And as teachers , we have to keep up .
“ These kids are n’t just twiddling their thumbs , ” he adds .
“ They ’re interacting with music . ”
IT HAS long been said that money cannot bring you happiness , but scientists have found that financial reward does make people feel good - especially when they know they are earning more than their peers .
Research showed people were motivated by greed and only felt truly rewarded when they outdid their friends .
Scientists at the University of Bonn , in Germany , pitted pairs of men against each other over a series of games , promising to pay them according to their performance .
Using brain - scanning techniques , they found the men only felt happy if they beat their partner and earned more money .

Gas prices , thanks to the Global War on Terror and Hurricane Katrina , are now the highest in the nation ’s history .
Gas easily tops $ 3 per gallon in San Francisco , Boston , Los Angeles , Miami , and other cities across the nation , making driving an expensive way to get around .
For reference , gas prices have increased roughly 100 % since 9/11 .
What ’s the upside ?
That ridiculously expensive petroleum is prompting people to drive more slowly on highways , drive less often , buy more fuel - efficient cars , and take mass transit more often .
A recent Congressional Budget Office report found that based on statistics from 2003 to 2006 , a theoretical 15 - year , 10 % increase in gas prices would reduce consumption by 4 % as consumers replaced their gas - guzzlers with more fuel - efficient cars .
And I do mean cars .
Sales of light - trucks dropped 10 % beginning in 2003 , when the Iraq invasion made gas prices spike .
Sales of compacts and mid-size vehicles , on the other hand , have been on the rise : the combination of more compacts and fewer SUVs means the average vehicle on the road today has a higher fuel - efficiency than three years ago .
Although the CBO report did not list the amount of CO2 saved by having fewer trucks on the road , it did say that a 20 % rise in gasoline prices created a 2 % increase in mass transit ridership and took 730 vehicles ( per weekday ) off the freeways .
A bonus : the drivers on the roads drove more slowly .
Now , this may be a coincidence , but since gas prices went up , traffic fatalities for all vehicles ( except SUVs ) have decreased .
Overall , 2006 ( the most recent data year available ) had the lowest traffic fatality and injury rate in five years , and most of the decrease was due to reduced accidents during daylight hours on weekdays ( commute time ) .
So is the high price of gas making us safer ?
Indeed .
With fewer commuter vehicles on the road , especially roll - over prone SUVs , and more people taking public transit , the facts suggest there ’s less chance for accidents .

NEW YORK : Crude oil rose above $ 111 a barrel in New York and gasoline surged to a record after a government report showed that U.S. supplies unexpectedly dropped .
Crude oil inventories fell 3.15 million barrels to 316 million last week , the first decline since February , the Energy Department said .
A 2.3 - million - barrel gain was forecast , according to a Bloomberg News survey .
Supplies of gasoline and distillate fuel , including heating oil and diesel , also fell .
“ The crude stock draw was obviously the big surprise and leaves supplies too tight for comfort , ” said Antoine Halff , head of energy research at New York - based Newedge USA .
“ Refineries are operating at a very low rate and we still did n’t get an inventory gain . ”
Crude oil for May delivery rose $ 2.71 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 111.21 a barrel in late morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices are up 81 percent from a year ago .
Futures prices rose to a record $ 111.80 a barrel on March 17 .

Evangelical video shows cadets pressured to be missionaries Katie Baker

This A video made by Campus Crusade for Christ , a Christian ministry group , shows Air Force Academy cadets being pressured to participate in religious activities and become " government paid missionaries when they leave . "
Mikey Weinstein , president of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation ( MRFF ) , which released the video this week , says the video is " absolutely out of control . "
" You cannot engage the U.S. government to propel your religion , " said Weinstein .
The video , filmed in the summer of 2002 , opens with tranquil shots of " Colorado 's most frequently visited man-made attraction . "
The unnamed narrator describes the chapel in detail , which " resembles a formation of fighter jets shooting into the sky . "
While the narrator says that students receive a " well - rounded education " at the Academy , the video focuses mainly on how stressful the environment is and not so subtly suggests that cadets can find solace in religion .
" I do a lot of counseling ... like any other college campus , there are a variety of needs that arise ... spiritually and emotionally , " says Major John Dider , who " considers himself a chaplain first . "
" Our purpose for Campus Crusade for Christ at the Air Force Academy is to make Jesus Christ the issue at the Air Force Academy and around the world , " says Scott Blum , the former Academy Campus Crusade for Christ director , who had no previous military experience but -- according to the video -- always " knew that God called him to invest in the lives of military men and women . "
As a Church choir sings in the background , the video 's narrator asserts that " each year , cadets are recognizing God 's call which will make an impact in the present ... and for eternity . "
Weinstein says the video is only one item on a " long menu " of unconstitutional evangelism going on in the military .
The MRFF compiled a six month investigative report in 2007 on the Christian group , focusing on the group 's Fort Jackson " God Basic Training " that they allege teaches the recruits that " when you join the military , you 've really joined the ministry . "
An Air Force Academy spokesman , who said he has not seen the video , said the Air Force Academy has pledged to defend religious rights .
" We 've worked actively to remind our people to respect others , and we make sure we offer a wide variety of [ religious ] services , " the spokesman said .
This video is from Global Pastors Network , filmed in the summer of 2002 .

A teacher accused of having an affair with a teenage pupil has told a court that she loved him .
Jenine Saville - King , 29 , told the jury she " really cared " for the boy and when questioned admitted the depth of her feelings .
The teacher , from Hook , Hampshire , denies engaging in sexual activity with the boy while she was teaching at a school in Watford , Herts .
Prosecutors say Saville - King was involved with the boy for more than a year , from 2004 to 2005 when the boy was aged 15 and 16 .
Asked if she was in love with him she said : " No , I did n't love him . "
But under further questioning she replied : " Yeah , I think maybe I did . "
It is also alleged that the affair continued after Saville - King became pregnant by her husband Paul , 37 , a manager with an engineering firm , and after both she and the boy had left the school .
Saville - King denies sexual activity with a child and breach of trust .
She said she began seeing the boy every day - at break times , lunchtimes and at an after - school study group - when they would talk about " things apart from school " .
She said she was " pleased " he had singled her out .
" He was confident , very popular , liked to have a bit of a joke , needed to be around people , " she told jurors .
Saville - King said she first met the boy outside school in October 2004 .
" He did n't feel I had enough time at school to help him with what he needed help with , " said Saville - King .
" I liked him and I wanted to help him .
I felt a bit sorry for him . "
She said she picked the boy up and they sat in her car outside a local pub looking at his schoolwork .
Slim Saville - King , 29 , told the jury : " He was a comfort to me , he made me laugh .
He was nice to me and I liked the attention .
" He would say nice things about me , that I was pretty , that I made him happy and I was funny . "
She said as the relationship developed she found herself unable to tell her husband , Paul , an operations managing for an engineering firm , about the relationship with the boy .
" I could n't tell him because I was scared at way he would have reacted .
I knew how bad it looked and I would have destroyed his dream of an MBA - he was heading towards a distinction , " she said .
The mother - of - two who now lives with her family in Hook , Hampshire was giving evidence at St Albans Crown Court , where she pleaded not guilty to seven charges of sexual activity with a child and one offence of abuse of trust .
The prosecution claim that after going to work as a teaching assistant at the boy 's school she began an affair with him during the summer term when he was 15 years old .
The affair is said to have lasted for more than a year ending when he was almost 17 .
It was claimed the pair enjoyed sex romps at her home in St Albans where she was living at the time , when her husband was working in London .
Giving evidence the teenager , who is now 18 years old , told the jury that shortly after he was 16 , he and the teacher began having full sex regularly .
Sex sessions , he said , took place at her home and there were even occasions when they checked into hotels to spend the night together .
The jury also heard evidence how the pair emailed one another , used MSN to chat and would text one another .
Rumours about the relationship began to circulate around the school and in September 2005 staff were made aware of a photograph of the two them that had been found by another girl pupil on the boy 's MSN site .
The picture showed the two posing intimately cheek - to - cheek .
The school launched an internal investigation and in February 2006 Mrs Saville - King was arrested at her then home in Puddingstone Drive , St Albans .
Giving evidence Mrs Saville - King told her barrister , Miss Sarah Forshaw that she is still married to her husband who she said was supporting her .
She told the jury that before going to work at the school , she was suffering from bulimia and she and her husband were having difficulties as they tried for a baby .
The wife said she underwent surgery to help her conceive and she was seeing a psychologist for her eating disorder .
She said she was taken on at the school as a teaching assistant to work with children with learning difficulties but within a short space of time she was promoted to assistant year leader for Year 10 , dealing with youngsters aged 14 and 15 .
Mrs Saville - King said she was given no training and found the job difficult .
In addition she was also give a mentor 's role in the school .
Eventually she said she found herself mentor to the boy who is at the centre of the allegations .
Mrs Saville - King said the teenager 's claims that they had begun meeting up outside school before the summer holidays were untrue .
She said their relationship began in September 2004 when the boy went into Year 11 and they began sending text messages to one another .
Asked why she had become his mentor she replied : " I just wanted to help him with his course work .
He was behind and needed to catch up , I was helping him to do that . "
She said they would see each other at school break times , during the lunch hour and after school in the study club .
Miss Forshaw asked " Did it occur to you that you were seeing rather a lot of him ? "
She said : " I did n't really think about it . "
Mrs Saville - King said the boy's then girlfriend - a pupil at the school - would also confide in her about her relationship with the teenager .
" She told me she had lost her virginity to him and she told me where they had sex and things like that .
I hoped she was being careful and using contraceptives . "
Miss Forshaw asked her : " Did you feel any jealousy ? " .
Saville - King replied : " No " .
Miss Forshaw asked : " Was it ever a sexual relationship that you had with him ? " .
She again replied : " No " .
She then told the jury how she agreed to meet the boy out of school to help him with his course work .
" He felt I did n't have enough time at school to help him , " she told the court .
As a result she said in October 2004 she picked him up in her car from outside his grandmother 's home and drove him to a pub car park where he balanced school books on his knees in the vehicle and did some work .
She admitted she found it easy to talk to the schoolboy and they would talk about their families .
Miss Forshaw then asked her : " The boy suggests that before he was 16 you were kissing each other , indulging in mutual masturbation and mutual sex is that true ? "
She replied : " No , that 's not true " .
She said in September of 2004 she found herself expecting her husband 's baby .
At the start of term in January 2005 Saville - King said she was doing nothing to keep the boy at " arms length " .
Asked how it had got to the situation where she as a 26 - year - old woman was sending messages to a 16 year old boy that she was missing him , she replied : " I ca n't answer that question , I do n't know .
Whatever I needed , he made me feel okay .
" I was fond of him and he was a comfort to me . "
Reminded that the boy had claimed in his evidence that by this time they were meeting two or three times a week for sex sessions she said it was " untrur " .
Saville - King said : " He wanted it to be a proper relationship .
that 's what he wanted for me to leave Paul and for us to be together . "
The trial continues .
MANCHESTER , N.H. — Secret Service presence has increased for Sen. Barack Obama since his dramatic win in Iowa , amid fears over the safety of the man seeking to become America ’s first black president .
The Illinois senator ’s security now rivals that of President Bush , with a dozen Secret Service agents wearing dark suits and earpieces leading bomb - sniffing dogs through event venues , sweeping all equipment brought by journalists and flanking the candidate as he plunges into crowds of supporters .
“ For many black supporters , there is a lot of anxiety that he will be killed , and it is on people ’s minds , ” said Melissa Harris - Lacewell , a Princeton University professor of political science and contemporary black culture .
“ You ca n’t make a prediction like this — like he has ‘a 50 percent chance of getting shot . ’
But the greater his visibility and the greater his access to people , there is a danger , ” she said .
Another black presidential candidate , Jesse Jackson , drew Secret Service protection because of violent threats during his campaigns in the 1980s .
And former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell ruled out a presidential run in part because his wife expressed fears he would be assassinated .
Mr. Obama , who reportedly resisted asking for Secret Service protection but personally requested a detail of agents after friends insisted , has been under federal watch since early last year .
No one will say whether he has received an explicit death threat — his campaign said yesterday only that “ we do n’t comment on security ” — but officials have tracked racist chatter on white - supremacist Web sites .
The Internet is rife with theories that someone may try to assassinate the senator — typing into Google “ assassinate Obama ” brings up more than 2,000 hits .
Anyone from Islamist terrorists to racist Americans to operatives of Halliburton and Blackwater are speculated about , but other , more nefarious Web sites are for real , according to reports from the Associated Press .
At his first morning event yesterday , at least a dozen plainclothes Secret Service agents , most with yellow pins on their lapels , stood guard in and around the Palace Theater , and , unlike other candidates touring the state , uniformed police were also on hand .
The theater was emptied early so bomb - detecting dogs could sweep through , and journalists covering the event were corralled for inspection .
“ Just put all your equipment down , leave the room , and close the door , ” one agent barked as another agent paced the hallway with a bomb - detection dog .
Known as a “ sweep ” on the White House beat , the media did as told , allowing agents to rustle through their computer bags and turn on electronic equipment to make sure it was real .
Only Mrs. Clinton , who is entitled to protection as a former first lady , and Mr. Obama have Secret Service details .
Mr. Obama was given Secret Service protection far earlier in the campaign than any previous candidate following worries about racist threats , federal officials said .
For instance , both Sen. John Edwards and Sen. John Kerry , two Democratic presidential candidates last election , were given Secret Service protection in February 2004 , after the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary .
There were more agents in the theater yesterday , some undercover , some wearing temporary pins .
Reporters who have covered the candidate for months said the increase in security was obvious .
But Secret Service agents have been blanketing the candidate for some time .
At an event last month in Manchester , agents ordered people to step down from the chairs they were standing on to take photographs .
“ We ca n’t have them that high , ” one agent was heard to say .
Agents surrounded the candidate as he worked a rope line , just as they do for President Bush .
While there were no metal detectors at yesterday ’s event , some guests with bags were checked as they entered .
And while no helicopter hovered overhead , no sharpshooters eyed the streets from building tops and no black SUV stood nearby , packed with heavily armed agents — three signs the president is in the area — agents yesterday were anxious and very low on patience .
As Mr. Obama was 90 minutes late for the event , a couple of photographers stepped out a side door for a smoke .
They were immediately ordered back into the theater by agents .
Inside , one photographer was told he could not even carry a cup of coffee in the theater .
Photographers have long complained about the aggressive tactics of Mr. Obama ’s protectors , saying they flank him at every stop , making photographs difficult .
Some say they have been strong - armed by agents , pushed out of prime picture perches for security reasons .
The senator ’s prospects and popularity are rising quickly , creating new problems for his security detail .
On Friday , hundreds of people gathered to see Mr. Obama went into a frenzy even before he came into the room , chanting the senator ’s signature phrase : “ Fired up !
Ready to go ! ”
An event organizer then said over a loudspeaker : “ Ladies and gentleman , for security seasons , please take your seats . ”

Leave it to Tucker Carlson to find yet another way to be annoying and obtuse .
In discussing the Nevada Democratic Debate , Tucker Carlson had a little issue with the three candidates saying that they were against nuclear power .
I was struck — this is a small thing but I thought it was really telling last night .
All three candidates were asked about nuclear power and all three of them basically said , ‘ you know I ’m against nuclear power . ’
And it seems to me that we ’ve reached this place where we can be more honest about certain things like nuclear power .
If you ’re against nuclear power just reflexively in 2008 , you ’re not a forward - thinking person , it seems to me .
Yeah , how unprogressive to be worried about nuclear waste , especially in the state where Yucca Mountain is located .
Tucker actually says that nuclear power is cleaner , except for the waste part , like it 's a little thing .
Just for those less reflexive types that think Tucker might have a point :
Nuclear waste is produced in many different ways .
There are wastes produced in the reactor core , wastes created as a result of radioactive contamination , and wastes produced as a byproduct of uranium mining , refining , and enrichment .
The vast majority of radiation in nuclear waste is given off from spent fuel rods .
A typical reactor will generate 20 to 30 tons of high - level nuclear waste annually .
There is no known way to safely dispose of this waste , which remains dangerously radioactive until it naturally decays .
.
The rate of decay of a radioactive isotope is called its half - life , the time in which half the initial amount of atoms present takes to decay .
The half - life of Plutonium - 239 , one particularly lethal component of nuclear waste , is 24,000 years .
The hazardous life of a radioactive element ( the length of time that must elapse before the material is considered safe ) is at least 10 half - lives .
Therefore , Plutonium - 239 will remain hazardous for at least 240,000 years .
Hey Tucker , I 'll just give you two words : wind power
Imagine being able to burn copies of your home movies , TV shows , films and more without having to begin a computer session .
You can easily copy DVD ’s with a small sized duplicator .
The EZ Dupe is a stand alone DVD copier that can be easily carried and used .
It acts just like DVD burner , but at a size that is only a little more than four stacked CD boxes , it is a lot more compact , mobile , and therefore convenient .
In addition , if you are interested in creating labels and such , it could be plugged into the computer to assist even further .
For those that have a need for additional CD / DVD drives , it could remain plugged in and act as a double drive in one .
The simplicity of this idea is what tickles me .
I remember some scenes from different films , where a data disc is being copied in seconds .
Sometimes you see a person inserting a minidisc into a small portable device , and seconds later a copy is created .
We may not be there yet , but the EZ Dupe concept makes it look like we are getting fairly close .
The picture kind of says it all .
Think how easy would it be to copy a DVD at a friend ’s house with this gadget ?

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- A Senate panel grilled a key government energy expert Tuesday over why the Bush administration plans to continue adding to the nation 's oil reserve as the price of crude spikes near $ 100 a barrel .
Lawmakers also accused the administration of turning a blind eye to the role that oil speculators are playing in driving up prices .
The Department of Energy is planning to spend nearly $ 1 billion in 2008 to boost the amount of oil the nation holds in its 750 million barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
One industry analyst , testifying before a Senate panel made up of energy and homeland security and government affairs committee members , said the government may cause a significant increase in the price of crude over the next six months by filling the reserve with the easily refined and most valuable light , sweet crude .
" If I 'm right , we could see prices go to $ 120 a barrel , " said Philip Verleger , president of the Aspen , Colo . - based energy consulting firm PK Verleger .
The lawmakers blasted the Bush administration for undertaking such action in light of the high price and with seemly little analysis on what effect this could have on prices .
They asked Guy Caruso , the head of the Energy Information Agency , the statistical arm of the Department of Energy , if top DOE officials had consulted him on the impact of filling the strategic reserve .
Caruso , who was nominated by President George W. Bush , said he had not been contacted .
The EIA was set up by Congress in the 1970s by a law that aims to protect its role as an independent service monitoring the supply and demand for oil .
" The law says filling [ the reserve ] must not result in excessive costs , " said Sen. Susan Collins , R - Maine .
" It seems evident to me the department is not complying with the law . "
Collins was joined by Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich .
" It looks to me like the DOE is ignoring the law and the pocket book of Americans - this is a reserve , " Levin said .
Caruso said he did not believe that filling the reserve would have a big impact on prices , as it is only taking about 20,00 barrels a day off world markets , compared to other disruptions in places like Nigeria that have taken up to 500,000 barrels of light , sweet crude off the market without too much of an impact on price .
The senators told Caruso , whose agency does not control the reserve , to look into its potential price impact and to ask DOE why it had n't contacted his agency .
Caruso was also taken to task for his stance on energy speculators , the effect they are having on prices and the limited information his agency could provide on the subject .
He said that speculative investment - banks , hedge funds and others buying oil - is having just a marginal effect on prices .
The main reason prices are so high is tight supply and demand , he said .
Several senators and other witnesses disagreed .
" The commodities futures markets have become an orgy of speculation , a carnival of greed , " said Levin .
" I see no justification for oil to be at $ 100 a barrel . "
" The current high oil prices are inflated by as much as 100 percent , " said Fadel Gheit , a senior energy analyst at Oppenheimer , an investment firm .
" The price surge is the result of excessive speculation . "
Caruso said EIA has looked into speculation and said it is hard to say exactly how much it is contributing to high prices .
He said it was the role of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to regulate oil trading .
Sen. Ron Wyden , D - Ore. , was n't satisfied .
" You 've got hundreds of people , but you can't even put a few people on this role of looking into speculation , " Wyden said .
Wyden suggested that EIA disclose in its weekly inventory survey the size of individual company oil stockpiles , a suggestion that Caruso said would violate the confidential nature of the survey .
Gheit , the Oppenheimer analyst , said that lowering the amount of oil traders could buy with borrowed money , requiring investors to hold oil contracts for a certain period of time , and limiting the amount of contracts that could be bought under one name could help reduce the effect of speculative money on prices .
How to Have Less Awkward Conversations : Assuming Rapport
Image by kalandrakas .
Assuming rapport .
This is definitely one of the best social skill tips I have ever learned about .
Unfortunately I 've forgotten a bit about it lately .
Maybe you have too .
Or missed it altogether .
So I thought I 'd bring it up again .
Now , what is assuming rapport ?
Basically , instead of going into a conversation or meeting nervously and thinking “ how will this go ? ” you take different approach .
You assume that you and the person(s ) will establish a good connection ( rapport ) .
How do you do that ?
You simply pretend that you are meeting one of your best friends .
Then you start the interaction in that frame of mind instead of the nervous one .
I have found that this advice is surprisingly useful and easy to implement .
Just before the meeting , you just think that you 'll be meeting a good friend .
Then you 'll naturally slip into a more comfortable , confident and enjoyable emotional state and frame of mind .
This also helps you and the other people to set a good frame for the interaction .
A frame is always set in the at the start of an interaction .
It might be a nervous and stiff frame , a formal and let 's - get - to - the - point kind of frame or perhaps a super relaxed one .
The thing is that the frame that is set in the beginning of the conversation is often one that may stay on for a while .
First impressions last .
If it 's a very stiff frame then it may very well continue to be so until the end .
It can be quite difficult to for instance change that frame into a more relaxed one .
Often people – you and the others – adapt to the frame that is set and interact within it .
Breaking or changing that frame may feel uncomfortable or a bit weird .
And so you and the others can become reluctant to do so and instead just play along .
First impressions last
So setting a good frame at the very beginning can bring more enjoyment and better results out of any kind of meeting .
That 's one of the reasons why it 's so useful to smile when you first meet someone .
And it's also important to consider that the impression made and frame set may not just last during the first conversation .
It may continue throughout your relationship with this new friend , classmate or co-worker .
Now , meeting your best friend might not always be the best thing to think about before a meeting .
If it 's a meeting at work or in school then you may need to have use a more formal frame ( for instance without hugs and the relaxed attitude you have with friends ) .
In that case you may want to try to imagine a similar meeting that went well and your interactions with the people there .
If you go into a conversation with the right frame of mind a lot of the problems you may have encountered before or created outside and inside your mind just never come up .
Much of communication is non-verbal and can be difficult to manually correct in a conversation .
But when you go in with a positive and relaxed energy then that is fed into the interaction by you using your non-verbal communication – like your voice tonality and body language – in good way .
Just be yourself
When you 're with your friend you do n't think about what you should say next or what funny comment you could pull out of your sleeve .
You just stay in the present moment , moment by moment , and the conversation flows easily and naturally .
I think this is what some people mean when they give the often confusing advice to “ just be yourself ” .
When your friends give you that advice then they may mean that you should be like you are when you are hanging out with us .
They want to see you bring out your natural and relaxed self in other interactions .
One final useful thing about assuming rapport is that you may also start to feel positive feelings towards this new person , just as you do with your friend when you meet him / her .
This is a pretty good starting point for getting the new person to reciprocate and for developing a good relationship .
The Rev. Ted Haggard emerged from three weeks of intensive counseling convinced he is “ completely heterosexual ” and told an oversight board that his sexual contact with men was limited to his accuser .
That is according to one of the disgraced pastor ’s overseers , who on Monday revealed new details about where Haggard has been and where he is headed .
The Rev. Tim Ralph of Larkspur also said the four - man oversight board strongly urged Haggard to go into secular work instead of Christian ministry if Haggard and his wife follow through on plans to earn master ’s degrees in psychology .
Haggard broke a three - month silence in e-mails over the weekend to select members of his former church .
New Life Church interim senior pastor Ross Parsley forwarded Haggard ’s message to the wider church body Monday .
In the message , Haggard revealed that he and his wife , Gayle , intend to leave Colorado Springs and pursue master ’s degrees through online courses .
Haggard mentioned Missouri and Iowa as possible destinations .
Another oversight board member , the Rev. Mike Ware of Westminster , said the group recommended the move out of town , and the Haggards agreed .
“ This is a good place for Ted , ” Ware said .
“ It ’s hard to heal in Colorado Springs right now .
It ’s like an open wound .
He needs to get somewhere he can get the wound healed . ”
Sex-addiction program
Haggard , 50 , resigned as president of the National Association of Evangelicals and was fired from the church he built from nothing into a 14,000 - member congregation after a former male prostitute in Denver alleged a three - year cash - for - sex relationship .
Haggard admitted to “ sexual immorality ” and a long battle against feelings contrary to his beliefs .
He admitted buying methamphetamine but said he never used it .
Haggard did not respond to interview requests .
Among other things , the overseers urged Haggard to enter a 12 - step program for sexual addiction , Ware said .
Ralph said three weeks of counseling at an undisclosed Arizona treatment center helped Haggard immensely and left Haggard sure of one thing .
“ He is completely heterosexual , ” Ralph said .
“ That is something he discovered .
It was the acting - out situations where things took place .
It was n’t a constant thing . ”
Why Haggard chose to act out in that manner is something Haggard and his advisers are trying to discern , Ralph said .
In investigating Haggard ’s assertion that his extramarital sexual contact was limited to former male escort Mike Jones , the board talked to people close to Haggard and found no evidence contradicting him , Ralph said .
“ If we ’re going to be proved wrong , somebody else is going to come forward , and that usually happens really quickly , ” he said .
“ We ’re into this thing over 90 days , and it has n’t happened . ”
Steering Haggard away from a return to ministry was based , in part , on Haggard ’s high profile , Ralph said .
He cited biblical passages about holding influential figures to a higher standard .
“ Nobody is saying he ca n’t go back into ministry , ” Ralph said .
“ Somewhere down the road , that could very well happen , and that would be wonderful . ”
Counseling continues
Haggard is being asked to join a church wherever the couple moves and continue the Christian counseling he receives twice a week , Ralph said .
The oversight board that includes Ralph is focusing on New Life Church ’s future but continues to counsel Haggard .
What has been termed Haggard ’s “ restoration ” is being overseen by another panel : H.B. London , who runs a Focus on the Family ministry to pastors , and megachurch pastors Tommy Barnett and Jack Hayford .
London said he was not surprised Haggard was considering the psychological field .
“ Many of us that go into the healing , helping professions do so out of some sort of dysfunction or traumatic event in our lives , and we want to do what we can to help other people avoid what we ’ve gone through , ” he said .
“ He is certainly gifted and intelligent and has an intuitive side to him .
And he has life experience .
Those are good credentials . ”

I work as an IT professional .
I read a lot in the course of my job .
Be it technical manuals , project management tools , or software manuals , I read books constantly .
Most are forgettable , in fact , most necessary only in the context of solving a specific problem .
Boiling the IT Frog is different .
This commonsense managerial guide is a page - turner .
At 183 pages , the book only takes about four hours to read .
However , it manages to impart a great deal of wisdom in a short time .
I said “ Wow , that makes sense ” at least once a chapter .
I was assigned the book as part of required reading for an Information Services conference I hosted last week .
I read it once before the conference and once again after the conference .
This book has earned a spot on my top ten work - related books list , right next to number 1 - Getting Things Done .
Here are the specifics of this self - published jewel .
Title : Boiling the IT Frog Subtitled : How to Make Your Business Information Technology Wildly Successful Without Having to Learn Anything Technical by Harwell Thrasher ISBN : 978-1-4196-6415 -1 Price : 19.95 Buy it here .
Since this book does not fit the core theme of my blog very well , I will only spend a few words on its content .
Chapter 9 : Can Nine Women Have a Baby in a Month ?
This chapter deals with project restraints , a subject of grave importance to those of us who try to manage complex IT projects .
The non-linearity of most IT projects is legendary .
Developing the ability to describe this concept to your customers is worth the price of the book alone .
A common refrain I hear from my users is " put more people on it " .
Basically , the more resources I add , the less time the project will take , however adding more resources will decrease the quality of the project while increasing the cost .
In other words , adding another woman to a pregnancy does not decrease the length of the pregnancy , nor deliver a better baby .
This chapter dissects this common misconception while suggesting common sense approaches to dealing with the issue .
I 've read this chapter four of five time already .
I do not normally do this with a book , I normally read a book and then move on .
This book will set in the reference section of my office bookshelf .
It already has lots of little sticky notes popping out it and is full of my own handwritten comments .
Managing complexity is hard .
This book focuses on a common sense approach to managing complexity within context of IT .
I found it a little hard to read , mainly because I wanted to jump out and start fixing my problems .
For those of you who work in the IT field , I recommend this book .
For those of you who use IT services , this book will give you a unique look into the minds behind your IT team .
The wind farm was to be built at Barvas Moor on Lewis
The BBC's Gaelic news service , Radio nan Gaidheal , has learned that Scottish Government ministers are " minded to refuse " the 181 turbine scheme .
More than 5,000 letters of objection to the proposals were received by the Scottish Government .
It is believed environmental concerns are behind the decision .
An official announcement from the Scottish Government is not expected for a further two or three weeks .
This is going to allow us to go back to living like normal people
Dinah Murray
Anti-wind farm campaigner
A Scottish Government spokesman said : " No final decision has been taken and ministers are working towards finalising and announcing a decision in the near future . "
A spokesman for Lewis Wind Power said they welcomed the Scottish Government 's commitment to make a swift decision on the application .
He said : " We continue a dialogue with Scottish Government officials about our application . "
Campaigners had warned the wind farm would cause " irreversible damage " to one of the country 's most important wetland sites .
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds also opposed the project , disputing job figures put forward by developers Lewis Wind Power and raising concerns about the farm 's impact on local wildlife .
Supporters of the turbines pointed to potential economic benefits , claiming more than 400 jobs would be created during construction .
Return to normal
Councillors on Comhairle nan Eilean Siar ( Western Isles Council ) voted by 18 to eight to support the £ 500 m project in February 2007 .
But the final decision on the planning application rested with the Scottish Government .
The news was welcomed by local anti-wind farm campaigner Dinah Murray , who said the refusal would allow islanders ' lives to return to normal .
She said : " We are absolutely over the moon .
We were opposed to this development from the start on the visual impact , on the damage to the landscape , the damage to the habitat , the damage to the moorland and also the danger there would be on the roads during construction .
" This is going to allow us to go back to living like normal people .
For four years we have had this sitting over our heads and we just did n't know whether it was going to go ahead or be rejected .
" No - one was giving us any indication of how it was going so this is wonderful news . "
An opportunity to help us revitalise our economy has been lost
Angus Campbell
Comhairle nan Eilean Siar
But Angus Campbell , vice - convener of Comhairle nan Eilean Siar , said the decision was a " bitter blow for the Western Isles " .
Mr Campbell added : " An opportunity to help us revitalise our economy has been lost .
" The Comhairle will now engage with the Scottish Government to discuss their plans for how the economy of the Western Isles can be developed .
" They must make clear what their vision is for the islands .
Are we to become an environmental museum ?
Is any development at all to be allowed in the Western Isles ?
" Those who opposed this development must now come forward and outline their proposals for regenerating the economy of the Western Isles . "

Apple 's version works like this : you buy a song from Apple 's iTunes store for $ 1 — a song that , in the latest version of the iTunes software , bears the little ringtone icon ( looks like a bell ) .
( At the moment , they 're far and few between .
Apple says about half a million of the store 's 6 million songs are available as ringtones ; more will follow as Apple gets permission from the record companies , one song at a time .
The eligible songs are indicated by a little bell icon in the Ringtones column , which appears when you open the View menu , choose View Options , and turn on the Ringtone checkbox . )
Once you 've downloaded the song to the iTunes program on your Mac or PC , you click the little bell icon to open up a very slick ringtone editor .
Here , you can select a slice of the song , between 3 and 30 seconds long , that you want to be your ringtone .
You can control whether it loops and whether it fades in or out .
Then you can buy the ringtone for another $ 1 and transfer it to your iPhone .
O.K. , this is all fine , and fun , and just what a lot of people had been asking for .
But I have some questions about ringtones .
Truth is , I 'm a bit baffled by the whole phenomenon .
Maybe some articulate 14 - year - old can answer them for me .
Question 1 : Apple is selling a ringtone and the full song together for $ 2 , and claims that that 's a bargain .
As it turns out , that 's correct — at least compared with existing sources for ringtone sales .
Pop song ringtones from T - Mobile and Sprint cost $ 2.50 apiece ; from Verizon , $ 3 .
You do n't get to customize them , choose the start and end points , adjust the looping and so on .
Incredibly , after 90 days , every Sprint ringtone dies , and you have to pay another $ 2.50 if you want to keep it .
Verizon 's last only a year .
Three bucks for a 30 - second snippet that lasts a year — when you can buy the entire song online for $ 1 and own it forever ?
What am I missing here ?
How is a 30 - second , time - limited excerpt worth three times as much as the full work forever ?
Does this not enter the heads of the people who are paying $ 5 billion a year ?
Question 2 : If I buy and download a pop song legitimately , should n't I be able to trigger playback any way I want ?
Why must I pay one fee to play it by tapping Play , and a second fee to play it when someone calls my phone ?
It just makes no sense .
Now , I realize that it 's easy to get ringtones onto your phone ( or iPhone ) for free , using unauthorized techniques of varying degrees of difficulty .
Thousands of people do ringtones that way , but I 'm not even going there .
And my intention is n't to shoot the messenger by blaming Apple for the insanity of this pricing .
Apple 's pricing is lower than any American carrier , offers customizability that nobody else does , and gets you both the ringtone and the full song .
No , I 'm sure that , if you follow the ringtone gravy train to its source , you 'll find record - company executives .
There they 'll be sitting , rubbing their hands together with glee and hoping that their young customers do n't identify the ringtone industry for what it is : the last great digital rip off .

Greetings and Salutations ,
The cracks in the establishment are showing forth and the needs and the solidarity front that has been going on for so long is crumbling .
The bankers are starting to recognize that they are not as protected and out of harm ’s way as they thought .
The politicians are likewise seeing a different view .
All of that is on - going and will be for some time now .
We are watching the entire scenario playing out in the world field with much gusto .
It 's a learning curve and one that no one has traversed before .
Never before has there been so much transparency and ways to see what is occurring as there are today .
Make that a very strong SIGN re : the things you have been waiting to see happen .
There is a drive toward humanizing and restoring the field of humanity into more compassion and more respect for each other .
Oh , not yet you are n't seeing it but it is coming !!!!
Go on with your lives and just pay attention to the people who rub the politicians the wrong way .
Beyond that we are experiencing an anticipatory energy that says " keep the high watch " .

SUSAN SAYS Dear Community , Frank ’s Diner was once an energized , thriving business , a favorite spot for locals and tourists alike in the scenic New England town of York Beach , Maine .
But when the economy hit a brick wall , Frank found it more and more difficult to hold onto his trademark , cheerful smile .
One day , Frank caught a glimpse in the mirror on the diner wall of a grumpy , scowling old man with frown lines embedded deeply in the corners of his mouth .
He did n’t recognize the man as himself .
Looking around his desolate diner , he knew that it was n’t just the economy that had driven his customers away – it was his pessimistic attitude toward life .
Frank had tried to remain optimistic but it seemed like the hits just kept coming , like a NorEaster pummeling the coastline .
He often wondered what there was to look forward to each day .
His eyes met with a booth in the back corner of the diner where a frail elderly woman ate breakfast with a college - age girl .
Mrs. Sheridan and her caregiver Michelle had been coming in for breakfast every day for a couple of years .
Frank would nod and force his face into a smile when they walked in the door each day .
They were his best customers after all .
Mrs. Sheridan would conclude each meal by scribbling something onto a dinner napkin and placing the napkin in her purse with a contented smile .
One sunny fall day , even though the New England leaves painted a breathtaking landscape outside the diner windows , Frank was oblivious to the beauty that surrounded him .
He was currently crouched under the counter , grumbling about how the dishwashers were always leaving spots on the coffee mugs .
A feeble voice above interrupted his rant .
“ Frank , I wonder if I could have a word with you . ”
Frank nearly smashed his head on the cash register as he jumped to his feet , looking at Mrs. Sheridan in surprise .
Michelle held onto the old woman tight , obviously propping her up .
All Frank could do was nod agreeably .
“ I wanted to talk to you about these … ”
She lifted her trembling arm , pointing toward the frown lines on Frank ’s face .
He opened his mouth to say something , to explain , to defend himself … but realized he had nothing to say , so Mrs. Sheridan continued .
“ Young man , I learned a long time ago that life does n’t always go your way .
Believe me , I have 90 plus years of my fair share of heartbreaks and challenges that I could easily carry around with me as baggage .
Instead , I choose to carry these with me . ”
She reached into her purse and took out a stack of the napkins Frank had watched her scribble on every day .
She had written things like autumn leaves , Michelle ’s kindness , seashells from the beach , the beautiful sunrise today , another delicious breakfast at Frank ’s Diner .
“ Frank I would like to challenge you to do the same ; to stop carrying around your struggles and start carrying an attitude of gratitude instead . ”
After Mrs. Sheridan further described his daily “ homework assignment , ” Frank did n’t have the heart to refuse her request .
At first , he did it to appease her .
As she watched from her booth each day , Frank would dutifully take a napkin from a dispenser on the counter , scribble something he was grateful for on it and put it in his pocket .
The process was mechanical in the beginning , mindless instead of mindful .
But each time Mrs. Sheridan smiled over at him , wordlessly encouraging him to continue .
Frank barely noticed when things began to change when the words of gratitude he jotted down on the napkin each morning began to sink into his thick , stubborn skull .
The attitude of gratitude he had inadvertently adopted through the sheer routine of it , began to truly mean something .
That was when Frank ’s life began to change …
A little over a month into his daily gratitude homework , Frank once again caught a glimpse of himself in the diner mirror .
The reflection in the mirror was of a glowing , joyful man whom he had n’t seen for years .
This man looked forward to each new day with hope and enthusiasm .
Still smiling almost uncontrollably at the realization of how much life had changed , Frank surveyed his now bustling business .
Locals , staff , and tourists alike were cheerfully enjoying the revitalized space .
Even though Frank had n’t made any physical renovations , the diner somehow looked brighter to him .
His eyes automatically drifted to the corner , to share in the moment with Mrs. Sheridan .
But for the first time in a few days , the booth was empty .
Frank ’s heart sank …
A couple days later Michelle arrived and placed a box on the counter in front of Frank with a solemn smile , tears glistening in the young woman ’s eyes .
“ Mrs. Sheridan wanted you to have these . ”
Looking at the floor so she could n’t see his own tearful eyes , Frank simply nodded his appreciation .
He felt an overwhelming wave of gratitude wash over him that such a special lady had come into his life , and exactly when he needed her most .
By the time the springtime leaves were blooming , Frank ’s Diner was more popular than ever in York Beach .
There was one new feature , in particular , that was a huge customer draw .
When a diner patron reached for a napkin from a dispenser , they also received a message of gratitude printed on it .
Each message was word for word from Mrs. Sheridan ’s collection ; along with a few from Frank ’s own personal stash .
Beneath the message was the question – “ What are you grateful for today ? ” with a blank line beneath .
Frank would watch from the counter as customers of all ages and from all walks of life eagerly scribbled their answers on napkins , and almost always with a smile .
Mrs. Sheridan ’s unwavering attitude of gratitude , it seemed , had transformed not only his own life but the lives of those around him as well .
What steps will YOU take today and every day to adopt an attitude of gratitude in your life ?
Will you make the choice to focus on your burdens or your blessings ?
It is so easy to feel shortchanged when we focus on lack .
But when we practice gratitude as a daily habit , life has a way of transforming positively around us .
Whether you use something as simple as a napkin ora journal , when you write down the things you are grateful for each day you ’ll be changing your view of the world around you , just one day at a time .
Linda McLean http://go.proctorgallagher.com/e/45802/33191-gratitude-napkins/6bw3ry/18779
As we count our blessings it becomes clearer and clearer that our much awaited blessings are quickly moving into view .
Namaste , Susan ZAP SAYS
HI ALL , ALL THE DISTRACTIONS BY THE MAJOR LEADERS OF THE LARGE COUNTRIES HAVE WORKED WELL , AND IN PARTICULAR , THE DISTRACTIONS BY TRUMP .
HE BAITED THE BAD GUYS , AND THEY WERE DUMB ENOUGH TO TAKE THE BAIT AND SWALLOW IT WHOLE .
AFTER ALL , THEY ARE MASTERS AT POLITICS , NOT BUSINESS MANEUVERING AND POSITIONING .
TRUMP HAD THEM FROM THE BEGINNING .
THE SEALED INDICTMENTS HAVE BEEN OPENED , AND IT WILL TAKE A WHILE TO GET THROUGH THEM SINCE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MANPOWER TO DO IT ALL IN ONE FELL SWOOP .
THE SECRECY SURROUNDING THE TRIBUNALS WILL CONTINUE , SO DO NOT EXPECT THAT STUFF TO BE ON MAINSTREAM MEDIA .
THE IMPRISONMENTS AND EXECUTIONS WILL KEEP GOING UNTIL THE SWAMP IS FULLY DRAINED .
THE MIDDLE MANAGEMENT GUYS ARE GOING FIRST .
THAT WILL LEAVE A VACUUM IN THE MIDDLE THAT CAN NOT BE REPLACED OR FILLED BY THE HIGHER OR LOWER ECHELONS , AND THE LOWER RANKS WILL BECOME LEADERLESS AND DISJOINTED .
IN EFFECT , INEFFECTIVE .
SO MUCH FOR THE CABAL DEEP STATE OPERATIONS .
SO THE PLAN THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE A LONG TIME AGO THAT WE KNOW OF IS BEING FULFILLED .
THAT WAS TO GIVE THE CABAL ENBOUGH ROPE TO HANG THEMSELVES AND THEY DID EXACTLY THAT .
THE LEGAL PROCESS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN WORK PROPERLY IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCE INSTEAD OF THE PITCHFORK AND HANGING ROPE .
IT IS BEING DONE LEGALLY AS WITNESSED BY THE START OF THE TRIBUNALS .
RECENTLY , DAVID WILCOX AND A FEW OTHERS PUT THEMSELVES DIRECTLY ON THE FIRING LINE AND WENT FOR IT EXPOSING A LOT .
HATS OFF TO THE GUYS AND GALS THAT ARE STANDING STRAIGHT AND GETTING SOME OF THE INFORMATION OUT TO ALL OF US .
AS DAVID AND A FEW OTHERS SAID , THIS COMING TIME WILL BE FULL OF REVELATIONS AND INFORMATION DUMPS THE LIKES THIS WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN .
I AM GLAD FOR THE SECRECY BECAUSE IF THE CONTENTS AND DETAILS OF WHO IS GOING UP IN FRONT OF THE TRIBUNALS WAS MADE PUBLIC , THE GENERAL STATE OF THE POPULATION WOULD LEAN TOWARDS THE PITCHFORK I THINK , SO IT IS A WISE MOVE .
WE WILL ALL KNOW THE RESULTS AT SOME TIME AND WILL SHAKE OUR HEADS IN DISBELIEF AS TO WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO US AT THE HANDS OF THESE MONSTERS .
SALIENT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE HERE : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmIyTZEN4wU A CORROBORATIVE ARTICLE THAT HAS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THINGS THAT CONCERN US IS HERE .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNPp16ku5jA SO THE FAMOUS FLYING PURPLE PIGS ARE HAVING A FIELD DAY FLITTING HERE AND THERE PICKING UP THE BAD GUYS AND DROPPING THEM OFF IN NICE MILITARY RUN ACCOMMODATIONS .
YOU CAN BE SURE THE NEW TENANTS OF THESE PLACES WILL BE WELL LOOKED AFTER .
I HAVE RARELY SEEN THE PORKERS GRINNING SO MUCH .
THE NEW AGE IS COMING FAST WHERE WE WILL SEE INCREDIBLE ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE CLEANUP OF THIS PLANET .
OUR ROLE IS PRETTY WELL DEFINED HERE IN THE SERVICE ASPECT OF COURSE , BUT WHAT ABOUT THE STRIDES THAST HUMANITY WILL ACCOMPLISH IN ITS EVOLUTION IN THE SHORT TERM ?
I RAN ACROSS A VERY INSIGHTFUL DISSERTATION BY A MAN THAT HAS GOOD VISION TO SEE QUITE FAR , AND HAS NAMED THE 5TH AGE ( HUNTER / GATHERER – AGRICULTURE – INDUSTRIAL – INFORMATION ARE THE FIRST FOUR ) AS THE AUGMENTATION AGE .
I TEND TO AGREE WITH HIM AND HIS VIEWPOINTS .
THE ONLY THING THAT DOES CONCERN ME IS RAMPANT AI THAT CAN DO HARM , AND HAS DONE SO HERE AND IN THE FUTURE .
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS CONTROLLABLE AND WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF AS TIME PASSES .
IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE MUCH TO LEARN AND DO .
PLEASE TAKE SOME TIME OUT TO SEE THIS SHORTY AS WELL .
IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THIS DIRECTION IN OUR EVOLUTION .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR5N2Jl8k14
THERE IS ANOTHER MATTER THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION , AND THAT IS THE GREEN DEAL .
A BROTHER OF MINE HAD THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS IN REGARD OF THIS GREEN DEAL DIRECTION THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TAKEN : Most Democrats never ran a business and their politics is their religion .
They are not too smart , just evil
BTW , Did you see Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez 's Green Deal ?
What an idiot .
Eliminates all cars , no more air travel within 10 years and so much more non-sense .
Incredible that her finances were so bad that she could not move from NY to DC until she got her first check as a Congresswoman .
Then , the put her on the Congressional Finance Committee .
WHAT A JOKE !!!!!
Oh , forgot to mention that all Democrats ( Kamala Harris , Bernie Sanders , Coy Booker , Elizabeth Warren and others ) that have filed to run for President have signed on to this ridiculous Green Deal !!!!!!
They are ALL NUTS !@#^>-*
This should seal Trump 's second term THIS IS THE FIRST I HAVE HEARD OF THE GREEN DEAL , AND WHILE MOST OF THE ELEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE ORIGINAL LAUNCH MESSAGE SOUND RIGHT AND ARE EMINENTLY DOABLE ( IT WAS DELETED BUT THE ORIGINAL COPY IS BELOW WITH A COMMENT ) , WHAT MY BROTHER SAYS GIVES PAUSE FOR THOUGHT .
IT SURE IS REAL SOON THAT THIS WAS PUT OUT RIGHT AFTER THE STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH .
THIS , IF IT WAS TO HAVE BETTER CREDENCE AS TO DIRECTIONS BEING CONSIDERED , SHOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT OUT DURING THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT OR SHORTLY THEREAFTER .
I SEE THIS AS DAMAGE CONTROL BY DEMOCRATS AS IT DOES APPEAR TO BE A TIMED THING .
OVERALL IT DOES MAKE SENSE , BUT THE FLAWS IN IT , IF GOTTEN RID OF , COULD MAKE THIS A GOOD GUIDELINE TO FOLLOW AS IT DOES MAKE GOOD SENSE , RIGHT ?
ANOTHER MATTER IS THE IMMIGRANT ISSUE .
PLEASE LOOK AT THIS EVENT BY THE UNITED NATIONS THAT HAS IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON ALL OF US .
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW .
THIS ALTERS THE CURRENT TRAVEL NORMS .

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSbzav6UITA
BUT DESPITE EVERYTHING , WE ARE TRULY STANDING AT THE EDGE OF THE POOL AND IF WE ALL HOLD HANDS AND JUMP IN AT THE SAME TIME … THE REST WILL BE HISTORY .
I THANK ALL THE SOULS THAT HAVE MADE THIS HAPPEN FOR US .
THE SPIRITUAL SIDE MUST DOMINATE WHAT IS TO COME , AND I AM SURE LOOKING FORWARD TO LOVE DOMINATING THE ENERGETICS .
GREAT THANKS FOR HELPING OUT THE LAST TIME .
THE KIDS HAVE FOOD AND MEDICATION AND WILL MAKE IT THROUGH THE NEXT DAYS UNTIL WE CAN BEGIN OUR HELP TO THEM .
BLESS YOU FOR THAT .
AND YET AGAIN , GOD BLESS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR !
( THIS IS DAY 6 – DAY OF THE HORSE AND CLEAN BATHROOMS…AND YES THERE IS IN FACT A GOD OF BATHROOMS IN THE CHINESE CULTURE ) LOVE AND LIGHT

COPYRIGHT ZAP 2013-2019 ADDRESSING
THIS GREEN DEAL THING IS NOT A POLITICAL STANCE IN RESPECT OF WHAT I SAY BELOW .
IF I DID NOT SAY THAT EXPLICITLY I WOULD GET MAJOR FLAK FROM MY LEGAL DEPARTMENT , SO THERE I SAID IT – AGAIN – IN WRITING .
( REPETITION SOMETIMES SUCKS ) .
THE FOLLOWING IS THE DELETED ORIGINAL GREEN DEAL PLAN BEFORE THE NEW STUFF IS CONSIDERED THE ACTUAL STANCE OF THE PROPONENT PARTY .
LAUNCH : Thursday , February 7 , at 8:30 AM .
Overview
· We will begin work immediately on Green New Deal bills to put the nuts and bolts on the plan described in this resolution ( important to say so someone else can't claim this mantle ) .
HERE I DISAGREE – I HAVE BEEN SAYING THESE SAME THINGS FOR YEARS SO YOURS IS NOT AN ORIGINAL IDEA – AND WHAT I HAVE SAID HAS BEEN MIRRORED BY MANY OTHERS ( BEFORE I SAID IT TOO ) SO YOU ARE OUT OF LUCK AS THE FIRST .
FUNNY … POLITICIANS THAT THINK THEY HAVE AN ORIGINAL IDEA BY STEALING WHAT IS OUT THERE AS HOW MANY REALLY THINK IN THIS DIRECTION ?
BUT GIVE THE NEW BUNCH A CHANCE – THEY SEEM TO BE ON TRACK FOR THE FORTHCOMING CHANGES SO LET THEM GROW INTO IT LIKE TRUMP GREW INTO A STATESMAN .
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE THINGS I ADDRESS HERE ARE NOT POLITICAL IN NATURE AS I DO NOT SUPPORT ANY POLITICAL PARTY , JUST THE MEN AND WOMEN OF ANY PARTY THAT MAKE SENSE TO OUR HUMANITY .
IT IS IMPORTANT TO STAY OUR OF POLITICS , BUT SUPPORTING A MAN LIKE TRUMP FOR HIS ACCOMPLISHMENT IS OK – THE POLITICAL PARTY DOES NOT MATTER IN THAT CONTEXT .
I DO NOT NEED TO COMMENT ON THE CONTENTS OF THIS STUFF AS IT IS ALL PRETTY CLEAR AND DISCERNMENT IS ALL YOU NEED TO READ WHAT THEY ARE REALLY SAYING OVERTLY , COVERTLY AND INVERTLY AND HOW SINCERELY COHESIVE IS THE THOUGHT FORM AS OPPOSED TO A WHOLE BUNCH OF “ LET ’S FIT THE PIECE HERE ” STUFF .
SO FAR I AM HARD PRESSED TO COMMENT AS I DO NOT WISH TO PUT ANY SPIN ON THIS .
IT IS A THEATRICAL ACT ANYWAYS AND WHY DISTURB IT – IT HAS A HABIT OF TAKING MUCH TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME .

This is a massive transformation of our society with clear goals and a timeline .
o The Green New Deal resolution a 10 - year plan to mobilize every aspect of American society at a scale not seen since World War 2 to achieve net - zero greenhouse gas emissions and create economic prosperity for all .
It will :
· Move America to 100 % clean and renewable energy
· Create millions of family supporting - wage , union jobs
· Ensure a just transition for all communities and workers to ensure economic security for people and communities that have historically relied on fossil fuel industries
· Ensure justice and equity for frontline communities by prioritizing investment , training , climate and community resiliency , economic and environmental benefits in these communities .
· Build on FDR 's second bill of rights by guaranteeing :
· A job with a family - sustaining wage , family and medical leave , vacations , and retirement security
· High -quality education , including higher education and trade schools
· Clean air and water and access to nature
· Healthy food
· High -quality health care
· Safe , affordable , adequate housing
· Economic security for all who are unable or unwilling to work
· There is no time to waste .
o IPCC Report said global emissions must be cut by 40 - 60 % by 2030 .
US is 20 % of total emissions .
We must get to 0 by 2030 and lead the world in a global Green New Deal .
· Americans love a challenge .
This is our moonshot .
o When JFK said we'd go to the by the end of the decade , people said impossible .
o If Eisenhower wanted to build the interstate highway system today , people would ask how we 'd pay for it .
o When FDR called on America to build 185,000 planes to fight World War 2 , every business leader , CEO , and general laughed at him .
At the time , the U.S. had produced 3,000 planes in the last year .
By the end of the war , we produced 300,000 planes .
That 's what we are capable of if we have real leadership
· This is massive investment in our economy and society , not expenditure .
o We invested 40 - 50 % of GDP into our economy during World War 2 and created the greatest middle class the US has seen .
o The interstate highway system has returned more than $ 6 in economic productivity for every $ 1 it cost
o This is massively expanding existing and building new industries at a rapid pace - growing our economy
· The Green New Deal has momentum .
o 92 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans support the Green New Deal
o Nearly every major Democratic Presidential contender say they back the Green New deal including : Elizabeth Warren , Cory Booker , Kamala Harris , Jeff Merkeley , Julian Castro , Kirsten Gillibrand , Bernie Sanders , Tulsi Gabbard , and Jay Inslee .
o 45 House Reps and 330 + groups backed the original resolution for a select committee
o Over 300 local and state politicians have called fork federal Green New Deal
o New Resolution has 20 co-sponsors , about 30 groups ( numbers will change by Thursday ) .
FAQ
Why 100 % clean and renewable and not just 100 % renewable ?
Are you saying we wo n't transition off fossil fuels ?
Yes , we are calling for a full transition off fossil fuels and zero greenhouse gases .
Anyone who has read the resolution sees that we spell this out through a plan that calls for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from every sector of the economy .
Simply banning fossil fuels immediately wo n't build the new economy to replace it - this is the plan to build that new economy and spells out how to do it technically .
We do this through a huge mobilization to create the renewable energy economy as fast as possible .
We set a goal to get to net - zero , rather than zero emissions , in 10 years because we are n't sure that we 'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast , but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production , retrofit every building in America , build the smart grid , overhaul transportation and agriculture , plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net - zero .
Is nuclear a part of this ?
A Green New Deal is a massive investment in renewable energy production and would not include creating new nuclear plants .
It 's unclear if we will be able to decommission every nuclear plant within 10 years , but the plan is to transition off of nuclear and all fossil fuels as soon as possible .
No one has put the full 10 - year plan together yet , and if it is possible to get to fully 100 % renewable in 10 years , we will do that .
Does this include a carbon tax ?
The Green New Deal is a massive investment in the production of renewable energy industries and infrastructure .
We cannot simply tax gas and expect workers to figure out another way to get to work unless we 've first created a better , more affordable option .
So we 're not ruling a carbon tax out , but a carbon tax would be a tiny part of a Green New Deal in the face of the gigantic expansion of our productive economy and would have to be preceded by first creating the solutions necessary so that workers and working class communities are not affected .
While a carbon tax may be a part of the Green New Deal , it misses the point and would be off the table unless we create the clean , affordable options first .
Does this include cap and trade ?
The Green New Deal is about creating the renewable energy economy through a massive investment in our society and economy .
Cap and trade assumes the existing market will solve this problem for us , and that 's simply not true .
While cap and trade may be a tiny part of the larger Green Neweal plan to mobilize our economy , any cap and trade legislation will pale in comparison to the size of the mobilization and must recognize that existing legislation can incentivize companies to create toxic hotspots in frontline communities , so anything here must ensure that frontline communities are prioritized .
Does a GND ban all new fossil fuel infrastructure or nuclear power plants ?
The Green New Deal makes new fossil fuel infrastructure or nuclear plants unnecessary .
This is a massive mobilization of all our resources into renewable energies .
It would simply not make sense to build new fossil fuel infrastructure because we will be creating a plan to reorient our entire economy to work off renewable energy .
Simply banning fossil fuels and nuclear plants immediately wo n't build the new economy to replace it - this is the plan to build that new economy and spells out how to do it technically .
Are you for CCUS ?
We believe the right way to capture carbon is to plant trees and restore our natural ecosystems .
CCUS technology to date has not proven effective .
How will you pay for it ?
The same way we paid for the New Deal , the 2008 bank bailout and extended quantitative easing programs .
The same way we paid for World War II and all our current wars .
The Federal Reserve can extend credit to power these projects and investments and new public banks can be created to extend credit .
There is also space for the government to take an equity stake in projects to get a return on investment .
At the end of the day , this is an investment in our economy that should grow our wealth as a nation , so the question is n't how will we pay for it , but what will we do with our new shared prosperity .
Why do we need a sweeping Green New Deal investment program ?
Why can't we just rely on regulations and taxes and the private sector to invest alone such as a carbon tax or a ban on fossil fuels ?
• The level of investment required is massive .
Even if every billionaire and company came together and were willing to pour all the resources at their disposal into this investment , the aggregate value of the investments they could make would not be sufficient .
• The speed of investment required will be massive .
Even if all the billionaires and companies could make the investments required , they would not be able to pull together a coordinated response in the narrow window of time required to jump - start major new projects and major new economic sectors .
Also , private companies are wary of making massive investments in unproven research and technologies ; the government , however , has the time horizon to be able to patiently make investments in new tech and R&D , without necessarily having a commercial outcome or application in mind at the time the investment is made .
Major examples of government investments in " new " tech that subsequently spurred a boom in the private section include DARPA - projects , the creation of the internet - and , perhaps most recently , the government 's investment in Tesla .
• Simply put , we do n't need to just stop doing some things we are doing ( like using fossil fuels for energy needs ) ; we also need to start doing new things ( like overhauling whole industries or retrofitting all buildings to be energy efficient ) .
Starting to do new things requires some upfront investment .
In the same way that a company that is trying to change how it does business may need to make big upfront capital investments today in order to reap future benefits ( for e.g. , building a new factory to increase production or buying new hardware and software to totally modernize its IT system ) , a country that is trying to change how its economy works will need to make big investments today to jump - start and develop new projects and sectors to power the new economy .
· Merely incentivizing the private sector does n't work - e.g. the tax incentives and subsidies given to wind and solar projects have been a valuable spur to growth in the US renewables industry but , even with such investment - promotion subsidies , the present level of such projects is simply inadequate to transition to a fully greenhouse gas neutral economy as quickly as needed .
· Once again , we 're not saying that there is n't a role for private sector investments ; we 're just saying that the level of investment required will need every actor to pitch in and that the government is best placed to be the prime driver .
Resolution Summary
· Created in consultation with multiple groups from environmental community , environmental justice community , and labor community
· 5 goals in 10 years :

o Massive federal investments and assistance to organizations and businesses participating in the green new deal and ensuring the public gets a return on that investment
o Ensure the environmental and social costs of emissions are taken into account
o Provide job training and education to all
o Invest in R&D of new clean and renewable energy technologies
o Doing direct investments in frontline and deindustrialized communities that would otherwise be hurt by the transition to prioritize economic benefits there

DID YOU KNOW ?
Good Evening ,
As we all impatiently wait for the arrival of the GCR / RV our focus must be directed to the underlying cause or need for the event .
We must treat the disease not the symptom .
The disease is a global financial system predicated on debt .
The " burden " of the government is what it spends , since it can only pay its bills through taxes , debt , and increasing the money supply ( government spending = tax revenues + change in government debt held by public + change in monetary base held by the public ) .
The debts can be repaid by the borrowing government through raising taxes , reducing spending , or simply printing more money .
Sovereign debt is also called government debt , public debt , and national debt .
Sovereign debt is a central government 's debt .
It is debt issued by the national government in a foreign currency in order to finance the issuing country 's growth and development .
The stability of the issuing government can be provided by the country 's sovereign credit ratings which help investors weigh risks when assessing sovereign debt investments .
The debt falls into two broad categories : intra-governmental holdings and debt held by the public .
Intra -governmental Debt . ( In the U.S. )
This is the portion of the federal debt owed to 230 other federal agencies .
In December 2018 , intra-governmental holdings totaled $ 5.9 trillion , or 27 percent of the debt .
The government owes money to itself !
Some agencies , like the Social Security Trust Fund , take in more revenue from taxes than they need .
Rather than stick this cash under a giant mattress , these agencies buy U.S. Treasury ’s with it .
That surplus must , at some time , be paid back thus creating debt liability to itself .
Public Debt .
The public holds the rest of the national debt of $ 16.1 trillion .
Foreign governments and investors hold 30 percent of it .
Individuals , banks , and investors hold 15 percent .
The Federal Reserve holds 12 percent .
Mutual funds hold 9 percent .
State and local governments own 5 percent .
The rest is held by pension funds , insurance companies , and Savings Bonds .
Aside from issuing sovereign debt , governments can finance their projects by creating money ( more debt ) .
By doing so , governments are able to remove the need to pay for interest .
However , this method only reduces government interest costs and can lead to hyperinflation .
Thus , governments still need to fund their projects through the aid of other governments .
Our foreign debt is known as our foreign assets , and it totals a bit over $ 5T .
That means for every dollar we owe to a foreign government , a foreign government owes us about 90 cents .
If we were all to cash out right now , we'd be a little less than $ 1T in the hole .
If we want to be super exact , it 's $ 568B .
( This number is specifically known as our “ Net Foreign Assets " and you can see it over time here : https://data.worldbank.org/indic.)
But we can't cash out right now .
These are structured debts .
If the US pulled all of its markers just to pay the markers owed , it would be a net wash ( the US would still be “ in the hole ” ) and a destroyed world economy .
“ Trade deficits ” are not real numbers , just indications of how much country A is economically intertwined with Countries B , C & D .
The world economies have effectively intertwined with each other ’s debts so much that any attempts for any one country 's ’ economy to separate itself from the pack generally leads to some sort of implosion and ultimately a return to the pack .
It is like a forest of trees where all the roots have grown together .
Ca n’t take down one tree without other trees dying .
The above illustration is an example of U.S. “ Sovereign Debt ” but the mechanisms that create and pay back debt are not unique or specific to the U.S .
The same format is pretty much utilized by all nations .
There are only three ways to decrease the debt .
The first is to cut spending ; the second is to raise taxes ; and the third is to drive economic growth at a faster rate than the debt ( Remember most debt is created when money is printed ) .
There is another solution .
Congress and other international governing bodies should shift spending to areas that create the most jobs .
We should look at the common denominator that effects debt ( disease ) the most .
Currency !
As an Example take the Kuwaiti Dinar .
It is currently the world 's highest - valued currency unit per face value .
$ 3.30 U.S. dollars to 1 Kuwaiti Dinar and has been the strongest global currency for some time .
Kuwait has a $ 21 Billion deficit ( expected to decrease by 25 % in 2019 because of rising oil prices ) and has a $ 600 Billion sovereign wealth fund .
We have to ask how Kuwait manages to keep its currency so strong .
Kuwait ’s currency is fixed - point rather than floating point .
A floating point currency is one where the value of the currency is determined by its supply and demand .
( As are most currencies in the world ) .
In floating point systems , if a country exports more than it imports - its value increases .
A fixed point currency is one where the exchange rate is pegged to another currency .
Ex. 1 Kuwaiti Dinar = 3.30 US Dollars , and the central bank of the country ( Kuwait ) must adjust their reserves of the pegged currency ( US Dollar ) in order to keep the exchange rate intact .
In other words , the exchange rate is artificially set .
( Pegged currency is a fixed exchange rate .
It is a type of exchange rate protocol ( regime ) in which a currency 's value is fixed against either the value of another single currency , a basket of other currencies , or another measure of value , such as gold )
The Kuwaiti dinar is actually pegged to an undisclosed basket of currencies , meaning the Central Bank of Kuwait has set the exchange rate of the Kuwaiti Dinar with a number of currencies , including the US Dollar .
Kuwait ’s currency is highly valued because the country ’s central bank sets and maintains high exchange rates with a basket of other countries .
In many ways it ’s like we are having two parallel global financial system going at the same time ; 1 ) ( Gold backed ) system which is like what PJ Morgan himself said , “ Gold is money EVERYTHING else is Debt ” , and 2 ) being the corrupted ( Fiat ) system that was established since 1913 ( Federal Reserve Act ) , which they used to replace the bill of sale ( Gold backed currency ) with FRNs so they can multiply many times without limitation .
This was designed to enslave and control people and the puppet leaders around the world .
As far as Kuwaiti goes , In 1960 - 1961 The British ( Rothschilds ) came in to Iraq and drew a line and took it away from Iraqis , and called it The kingdom of Kuwait , where the Central bank of Kuwait is actually in City of London , that is why Kuwaiti Dinar is strong , and so has less to do with GDP or CPI ( Consumer Price Index ) , as they import everything and they do n’t produce anything , except Oil .
Also , ' changes in money supply ' and ' liquidity ' is not the necessarily same thing .
Liquidity is the outcome of the interplay between the supply of and the demand for money .
﻿ Contrary to commonly held beliefs , it is possible that changes in money supply and liquidity may move in different directions .
In addition , even if we see strong increases in money supply like in Q1 ( First Quarter ) , as suggested by some commentators , this is not necessarily going to be bullish for the stock market given the likely negative effects of past fluctuations in liquidity .
There are at least 66 countries that either peg their currency to the dollar or use the dollar as their own legal tender .
There are Twenty - five countries who peg their currency to the Euro and 17 Eurozone members use it as their currency .
To maintain this peg , a country must have lots of dollars / euros on hand .
That 's why most of the countries that peg their currencies to the dollar / euros have a lot of exports to the United States / Eurozone .
Their companies receive lots of dollar / euro payments .
They exchange the dollars / euro for local currency to pay their workers and domestic suppliers thereby creating “ Foreign Assets ” or “ Hold Foreign Debt ” .
The Chinese yuan has had a currency peg since 1994 .
This approach makes Chinese exports cheaper and , therefore , more attractive compared to those of other nations .
By motivating the global marketplace with greater motivation to buy its goods , China ensures its economic prosperity .
If the People 's Bank of China keeps the yuan weak compared to the U.S. dollar , consumers using the greenback can buy more Chinese exports .
The Chinese Yuan is pegged to a basket of currencies .
Initially 13 currencies .
The PBOC in December 2015 unveiled the China Foreign Exchange Trade System ( CFETS ) RMB ( Yuan Renminbi ) Index .
The RMB Index measured the yuan against a basket of 13 currencies , with the U.S. dollar having the highest weighting at 26.40 % .
Starting January 1 , 2017 , the number of currencies in the basket was increased to 24 from 13 .
Under the new basket , the U.S. dollar has a weighting of 22.40 % , down from 26.40 % previously .
The euro comprises 16.34 % and the Japanese yen less than 12 % .
An “ Asset ” by definition has a fixed value ( i.e. : gold , oil , precious metal etc. )
The paradigm shift will come as counties who do not possess enough hard asset resources to back their own currency issue can accumulate “ Foreign Assets ” , through international commerce , backed by a universally accepted hard asset , not debt .
This will effectively eliminate deficit spending ( creating debt ) by only printing money based on real values .
As currencies become Gold / Asset backed it will eliminate the need to peg their values to another country ’s currency , or a basket of currencies , and not rely on the fluctuations of other economies to dictate its value .
( Country A ’s buying power is relatively the same as Countries B through Z ) .
This will also level the playing field for countries to become more self - sufficient by being competitive in global markets by retaining their manufacturing base and revenues ( Jobs and taxes ) generated from that base thereby eliminating debt and stimulating economic growth .
Sources from Australia have informed me that Australia has recently gone completely gold backed and has started the migration away from the Central Banking System and its subsidiaries ( i.e. IMF , World Bank ) and is integrating into the new financial systems .
Multiple countries have been following the same initiatives .
In the near future , watch for the United Nations to restructure and relocate from New York to a more friendly Asian location .
Global debt is the disease that has infested the financial systems we currently employ .
The current systems are geared to accommodate and manipulate that debt .
It is important to understand how currencies are valued and interact within the system and the scope of what needs to change for the GCR to occur .
Remember the GCR is about stabilizing and maintaining global economies .
Intel providers consistently only speak to small aspects of the total picture .
There are multiple symptoms of this disease .
Treating one symptom does not cure the disease .

The US housing market is in a sharp downturn
The sales of newly - built US properties totalled 770,000 in the year to September , said the Commerce Department .
The latest official data comes a day after figures showed that sales of existing US homes fell 8 % last month .
This was the biggest year - on - year decline for non-new build properties in
16 years .
Recession fears
A growing number of economists now fear that the downturn in the US housing market could lead to a wider recession .
The Federal Reserve is now widely expected to try to soothe the economic woes with an interest rate cut next week .
The September new home sales figure from the Commerce Department was a 4.8 % rise on August , although this is only after August 's figure was revised down to 735,000 .
Previously , the Commerce Department had calculated that 795,000 new homes were sold during August .

A criminal court on Saturday acquitted two former Guantanamo Bay prisoners of joining al - Qaeda or the Taliban .
Omar Rajab Amin and Abdullah Kamel al - Kundari denied any terror connections at the start of their trial .
Their lawyers argued there was no evidence against them and the case was " political . "
Defense attorneys said the accused were in Afghanistan for charity work - not to fight .
Amin , 41 , and al - Kundari , 32 , were released from the U.S. detention camp in September after spending nearly five years there .
They were detained by authorities for questioning upon their return to Kuwait .
Six other Kuwaitis formerly held in Guantanamo have been acquitted here of terror charges .
Another four are still imprisoned there .
" We call on the United States to either give our four sons a fair trial in America or any other place in the world , or to hand them to Kuwait so that they can be ... given their legal right to defend themselves , " said Khaled al - Odah , who heads a private group that lobbies for the release of the Kuwaiti prisoners - including his son - from the U.S. naval base in Cuba .
I almost feel ashamed writing this post .
The things that are being done in our name will cause damage to America for generations to come , I fear .
How many young , impressionable people around the world will be motivated to rally against the United States after reading a story like this ?
For those of you who have n't seen it , The Road To Guantanamo , is a gripping portrayal of three British citizens known as the Tipton Three who were held at Gitmo for two years , only to be released without ever being charged with a crime .

CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida ( Reuters ) - NASA managers on Wednesday cleared the shuttle Atlantis for launch on February 7 to deliver Europe ’s first permanent space laboratory to the International Space Station .

The only issue pending is a bent coolant hose discovered in the shuttle on Tuesday .
But program manager Wayne Hale said Atlantis should be OK to fly as is .
Engineers are studying a similarly bent pipe removed from the shuttle Discovery to determine if there are any safety concerns .
The pipe is part of the cooling system used by the shuttle in orbit .
“ If it ’s not safe to fly , we wo n’t fly , ” Hale told reporters at a news conference .
Earlier on Wednesday , two U.S. astronauts aboard the space station replaced a broken motor on one of its solar wings during a seven - hour spacewalk , clearing the way for more modules to be added to the outpost .
“ Thanks for making it look so easy , ” astronaut Tom Marshburn from NASA ’s Mission Control Center in Houston radioed to the crew as they returned to the station ’s airlock after the outing .
It was the fifth spacewalk that station commander Peggy Whitson , a 47 - year - old biochemist , has made since arriving at the outpost in October , and the fourth for flight engineer Dan Tani , 46 , who arrived two weeks after Whitson during the last shuttle mission .

BUS - SIZED MODULE
Tani had been due to go home in December aboard Atlantis , but the flight was postponed because of problems with a fuel sensor system .
The faulty equipment was replaced , clearing the way for the February 7 liftoff .
The shuttle will carry Europe ’s first permanent space station laboratory , a bus - sized module named Columbus , which is to be connected to the seven - room complex .
NASA plans to follow Columbus ’ launch with one carrying the first part of Japan ’s Kibo laboratory complex in March .
Before the Japanese components can be installed , NASA needed to recover at least part of the station ’s troubled solar power system .
One side of the station ’s two solar power wings has been locked in place since December , producing a fraction of the power needed to support expanded station operations .
Whitson and Tani replaced a 200 - pound ( 90 - kg ) motor that allowed the wing to pivot its panels to catch the sun ’s rays .
A more complicated repair that will allow the wing to freely rotate like a Ferris wheel is in the planning stages , said Kirk Shireman , NASA ’s deputy space station program manager .
Whitson and Tani left the station ’s airlock shortly before 5 a.m. EST ( 1000 GMT ) .
While installing the motor , they worked only during night - time passes around Earth , when the solar energy - collecting cells are passive , to avoid electrical shock .
The station circles Earth about every 90 minutes , half the time in darkness and half in daylight .
NASA has completed about 60 percent of the work on the $ 100 billion station .
It has until September 30 , 2010 , to finish 12 remaining construction and resupply flights before the shuttle fleet is retired .
The agency also plans to make a final servicing call to the Hubble Space Telescope .
Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei
さよなら絶望先 生
by Kumeta Kouji
runs in Magajin
Quite possibly the least translatable manga ever done .
The basic structure of each chapter of this gag manga is to take a turn of phrase , and idiom , some slang -- some kind of buzz word , and with George Carlin like dexterity , apply it to increasingly far fetched situations in a free associative cloud .
Often the phrase is flipped backwards on itself , applied to some entirely different , tangentially related field , or replaced by an opposite phrase in desperately untranslatable arrays of wordplay .
Kumeta Kouji is on record as saying that the less people get a joke , the funnier it is , and he makes up for this by burying readers in a sea of jokes , so that even if they do n't get half of them they 're still laughing .
He takes the same attitude towards the collected volumes , which bury all white space in jokes , liner notes , extra drawings , and random crap .
The front flap is a fake summary of events that did n't happen in the previous volume ; the back flap is a fake preview of events to come , and there are extra jokes hidden under the dust jacket .
One volume I bought of this came with two copies of the dust jacket , and I was unable to work out if this was done on purpose until I went looking around online and could n't find anyone else reporting this bit of strangeness .
The main character here is Itoshiki Nozomu ( 糸色 望 ) , whose name , written sideways , looks unfortunately like the Japanese word for " despair . " ( 絶望 ) Indeed , he is the world 's most negative personality , taking every single event or phrase in the worst possible light .
For some reason , he has become a teacher , but on his first day he hangs himself from a cherry tree .
He is found by one of his students , who is the world 's most positive person , and assumes he was trying to become taller .
The vast majority of the students in his class seem to be girls , largely because this is Magajin and nobody is interested in reading about anything else .
All of the girls can be distinguished only by their hairstyles , and that requires frequent flipping to the chart at the front of the book - Kumeta 's art has become quite amazingly stylized , to the point of basically only drawing one person over and over .
This is n't really a major issue , since there is no story to speak of , and each character has exactly one personality trait .
There 's pretty much nothing sacred in this book ; Kumeta sets his sights on anyone and anybody , trashes Japanese culture and politics , never hesitates to include sex jokes in the least expected places , and is even willing to crack jokes about his own manga 's imminent cancellation .
Many of these jokes are even funnier if you recognize the specific target he 's taking aim at , but the gist is generally clear even when you do n't .
A passage on white lies , for instance , has the characters coming out of Gedo Senki and telling the people in line that they really liked it .
Sayonara Zetsubo - sensei appears to be another member of that troubling range of books that are extremely unpopular among the readers of the magazine they run in , yet sell quite respectably once released in trades .
This led to the author 's previous book , Katte ni Kaizou , being cancelled over in Sunday ( partly because they wanted a more kid-friendly image , and Katte ni Kaizou really ... wasn't ) and Kumeta moving to Magajin .
There 's a destructive edge of his humor , the way absolutely nothing is off limits , but while this makes it many die hard fans , it probably prevents it from enjoying the huge popularity his former assistant , Hata Kenjiro , does on Hayate the Combat Butler , but the two have more in common than you might suspect , even going so far as to parody each other in the extras page at the back of the book , jokes completely incomprehensible unless you happen to be reading both .
There 's a deep joy from getting some obscure reference in Kumeta 's manga , but this is often balanced by a vague sort of guilt -- the more jokes I get , the bigger a nerd I am .
MINNEAPOLIS —
Answering an online ad for a nanny job — which she had done at least twice before without trouble — cost Katherine Ann Olson her life , authorities said .
Olson , a 24 - year - old St. Olaf College graduate , was found dead in the trunk of her car Friday night .
She was last seen by friends on Thursday morning , when she went to meet someone in Savage , Minn. , about the job , which authorities said she had found on Craigslist .
A 19 - year - old Savage man who police think placed the ad is being held pending charges .
Authorities did not release his name .
Olson had taken nanny jobs at least twice before , including a job in Turkey , after answering online ads .
Olson 's family gathered in front of their Cottage Grove home Saturday afternoon to share stories of a vivacious young woman " who was a joy , who trusted people . "
Her family said they 'd had misgivings about Katherine Olson finding jobs online .
But she never seemed to worry .
" She always assumed the best in other people , " said her father .
" She assumed the best of this appointment Thursday morning .
And , if it did n't work out , she assumed she could turn around and go home . "
Craigslist.org , an online bulletin board , has fallen under the watch of law enforcement agencies in recent years because of prostitution ads and its use to set up robberies , but an Internet search revealed no other homicides connected to the site .
Savage Police Capt .
David Muelken gave this account of Olson 's death :
A resident told a Savage Public Works employee about a purse found in a garbage can at Pacer Park .
That employee notified police , and an officer got the purse , which contained things belonging to Olson .
At first it appeared to be a theft .
Police called Olson 's home and left a message telling her they had her purse .
About 5 p.m. Friday , Olson 's roommate returned the call and told police Olson had n't been seen since 8 a.m. Thursday .
Police went back to Pacer Park and found a garbage bag in the container .
Inside the bag was a " significantly bloody towel . "
As the search proceeded Friday night , other investigators began to focus on the 19 - year - old man from Savage .
" We 're confident we have the suspect in custody , " Muelken said .
He said he believed there is no public threat .
Nancy Olson , the victim 's mother , said , " We grieve even more because of what the world has lost .
Not just for us , but for all these other people she would have touched . "
" Parents get to raise a child and then release them to the world .
And now she 's gone to the next world , " Nancy Olson said .
" We 've had her for the time we had her .
And now we 've given her away . "
( Budget Travel ) --
It began by accident .
My girlfriend , Ronni , and her twin sister , Marina , rented a documentary on panda bears .
We all melted .
Then we went online and found videos of tourists , somewhere in China , embracing pandas .
One showed a gaggle of cubs eagerly descending a slide in what looked like panda day care .
" We have to find this place , " Ronni said , eyes lighting up .
Hugging baby pandas costs about $ 130 and the pandas are even cuter in person than you would imagine
A friend of a friend had recently gone to China on a botanical excursion , and I could see the wheels turning in Ronni 's and Marina 's heads .
Soon enough , we had tickets and immunization appointments .
Much in the same way you might say , " Hey , let 's go to a movie , " we made plans to cross the Pacific .
We had no basis to believe that meeting pandas was possible for ordinary people .
We consulted guidebooks and online travel forums , and our best bet appeared to be a facility for research and visitors at the Wolong Nature Reserve , about five hours away from Chengdu in Sichuan province .
Because it was difficult to reach , we figured it must be more rewarding .
Once in Hong Kong , I contracted a fixer on the mainland to help sort everything out .
His name was Huang , and he'd been to Wolong earlier that year with National Geographic .
Ever since Empress Wu Zetian sent a pair of panda bears to the Japanese emperor around A.D. 700 , China 's public face has been represented by the furry goodwill ambassadors , who even forced a smile from Richard Nixon .
Today , we noticed upon arrival in Shanghai , you do n't see dour Mao nearly as much as Jingjing , the flower - crowned cartoon panda that 's one of the Beijing 2008 Olympic mascots , and just the first in the parade of pandas that adorn China 's storefronts , advertising , clothing , and vibrant cell - phone - charm industry .
In Chengdu , we were greeted at the airport by a 40 - foot column topped with a giant bronze panda .
On our way into the city , we also could n't help but notice that the lampposts , rickshaws , and even highway overpasses were festooned or stenciled or otherwise decorated with pandas .
But Chengdu was just a transit point for our trek along the Min and Pitiao Rivers to the Wolong Nature Reserve .
We hired a driver , part of a fairly dodgy tour we 'd found last - minute on the Internet .
All road travel in China happens frenetically -- the constant , aggressive brinksmanship of millions of shoddy minivans with toy - like wheels .
We left for Wolong at dusk , ascending steep gorges that sometimes disappeared into the mist , on roads that sometimes disappeared altogether .
There 's no real town , and not many restaurants , other than the shabby ones at the Wolong Hotel and the Panda Inn .
The following day , we awoke to a crisp and cool autumn day , with the sound of the river filling the narrow valley .
This is the panda 's native habitat , a subalpine arboreal wonderland that makes you understand Chinese fairy tales .
The China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda has marked off large enclosures for its several dozen pandas .
Last summer , the notoriously fickle pandas produced 18 cubs .
We could see some of them through the glass of the nursery .
The newest born were tiny pink nubs .
Those slightly older were fed with bottles .
The cubs we had seen online were from the previous summer .
A little over a year old , all 16 played together in a single enclosure next to the nursery .
Three Japanese girls entered the day - care center and frolicked among the cubs .
" How can we do that ? " I asked Tang , one of the keepers .
He took us to an office , where we discovered advance work to arrange a special panda visit is unnecessary .
To hug baby pandas , all you have to do is show up and pay the Wolong Panda Club $ 130 per person .
That 's nothing for five minutes of nirvana .
In the flesh , the cubs were so unbelievably cute that they seemed artificial .
With their round heads , big eyes , and rolling gait , they looked and acted like Jim Henson creations .
Touching one felt like meeting a unicorn .
The cubs moved like puppies in a curious , playful swarm .
They did n't lick so much as nuzzle .
And grab :
To our delight , the desire for hugging was mutual , and what began as a careful encounter quickly devolved into fuzzy mayhem as the cubs attached themselves to our arms and legs .
At one point , Ronni was dragged to the ground by a clutch of cubs , and she beamed beatifically .
" I can't believe this is happening , " she said as she freed herself , only to be taken down again .
After the staff pulled the cubs off us , we stood around in a daze .
Stepping back outside of the panda pen , Ronni stopped grinning long enough to say , " I want to do that again . "
Round - trip airfare between Chengdu and Beijing , Hong Kong , or Shanghai runs $ 400 to $ 680 on Dragonair or Air China .

Las Vegas the tourist mecca of the World is set to begin development of the World ’s first vertical farm .
The $ 200 million dollar project is designed to be a functional and profitable working farm growing enough food to feed 72,000 people for a year and provide another tourist attraction to the city that does everything in a larger than life way .
The World currently uses about 80 % of the available farm land and 60 % of the earth ’s population lives near or in an urban environment so the logical choice for farming is to go up for land where the environment can be controlled and where distribution is local .
Las Vegas is seen as the perfect location for this project by Nevada State officials who would like to demonstrate their sustainability and environmental awareness instead of projecting an image of waste and excess .
Although the project initial cost is high at $ 200 million , with annual revenue of $ 25 million from produce and another $ 15 million from tourists the 30 story vertical farm would be about as profitable as a casino with operating expenses only being about $ 6 million a year .
TORONTO ( Reuters Life ! ) -
To exit through the back door of Toronto's " smallest house , " first fold the Murphy bed back into the wall ; it takes up the entire seven - foot width of the bedroom .
Built in 1912 , the pint - size " Little House " features one bedroom , a kitchen with folding table and chairs , a living room and a full , if narrow , bathroom .
With a living area of just 300 square feet , it was bought and renovated this year , and is back on the market for C$ 173,000 ( $ 172,000 ) .
" Holy cow , that is the smallest house , " said cab driver Kamran Ghuman , after pulling up outside 128 Day Avenue in Toronto 's west end .
" It looks like it used to be a garage and then they made a house out of it . "
Dwarfed between two larger homes , the detached bungalow was bought last spring for C$ 139,000 and redone inside and out , including a new decorative window for its gabled roof , hardwood floors , new cabinetry , appliances , a stone walkway and gardens .
" It reminds people of a small cottage or what they may have seen in a storybook , " said owner David Blois , a property manager who took on the " flip " project .
Many neighbors agree .
" Look how cute it is .
It looks like a little chapel , " said Marika Wheeler , who has lived down the street for over 30 years and has seen the house change owners several times .
Blois says the house was built by a contractor on a strip of land where the city forgot to cut the curb for a laneway .
He lived there for 20 years .
Since then , it has been home to several families , including immigrants from Hungary , Italy and Brazil .
Blois said one man who walked by the house during the renovations said he had lived there with his wife and three children .
Real estate agent Cristina Lopes said the property was a steal compared with bachelor or one - bedroom condominiums in Toronto , typically priced at over C$ 200,000 on property Web site mls.ca .
" Even though this is only 300 square feet , it looks more spacious than a condo that 's 700 or 800 square feet , " Lopes said .
" It all depends on the layout and the layout of this home was really nicely done . "
The house , on a street of two - and three - bedroom homes , also boasts a patio and parking for two cars , as well as a storage basement , accessible through a trapdoor in the floor .
Lopes said the owner has received a few offers since the house went on the market in the fall , but they fell through .

The Black Swan : The Impact of the Highly Improbable
Yale sluts and Princeton philosophers
Insane over - interpretation of laws against such things as " hate speech " , sexually harassing speech , and defamation will not be disappearing any time soon , it seems .
Recently there appeared on Facebook a picture of a group of Zeta Psi fraternity pledges in front of the Yale Women 's Center with a big sign saying WE LOVE YALE SLUTS .
And the Women 's Center immediately threatened to sue .
Rolling over immediately , the president of the Yale chapter of Zeta Psi has issued an apology and expressed a willingness to meet and discuss ; and the Facebook entry has disappeared .
Legal authorities do not think there was much hope of success in a legal action anyway .
The amazing thing to me is that any educated person would have dreamed , even for a second or two , that there might be .
The word slut received some discussion on various blogs in 2004 .
There is a sensitive rumination on it in this post by Mark Liberman .
Says Mark , " I would n't use the word myself , not so much because it 's offensive as because it projects bad associations based on a framework of ideas that I do n't endorse " ; but he also notes that in the Oxford English Dictionary entry for the word " bad housekeeping , loose sexuality , general uppitiness and terms of endearment have been all mixed together since the middle of the 17th century . "
It is not an obscene word , and has often been used with some affection down the years ( note the perceptive analysis by Maureen Dowd in this NYT article ) .
It is an extraordinary poor word to pick as a casus belli for that reason if no other .
The OED entry stresses that it often occurs in a " playful use , or without serious imputation of bad qualities " .
( Consider , for example , Eugene Volokh 's remark about himself : " I like to talk to the media , both print reporters and radio and TV , and do a good bit of it ; so a friend of mine told me that I was a media whore .
And then it dawned on me : I , and most of my academic colleagues who do these things , are not media whores .
We 're media sluts -- whores get paid . " )
It is ludicrous to think that legal action might be taken when a group of college boys ( probably on a dare , to show they are brave enough to be worthy of being Zeta Psi men ) hold up a sign saying that they love the sluts of Yale .
Legal authorities lost no time in stating that to the Yale Daily News today , and I 'm sure no suit will ever even be filed .
The fact is that the young Zeta Psi pledges in question are fantasizing : I 'm sure they would love to find a few promiscuously inclined babes hanging around the Women 's Center , but they probably could n't get a Yale woman to have sex with them if they got down on their knees and wept for it .
So they will fantasize about meeting some of the more sexually active of the 5700 women students at Yale ( many of whom will doubtless outshine them academically ; it 's tough life ) , and at night they will masturbate in their dorm rooms as normal , and by day they will sometimes find ways to be casually offensive to girls in standard college - boy manner , and the First Amendment will protect them if they announce their fantasies on Facebook.com , and the world will go on turning , and the sky will not fall , and I really do n't think anyone needs to go to court about such things .
Surely
Yale women can find more important lawsuits to work on than this .
Just to add one indisputably linguistic point to make this randomly opinionated post eligible for its illustrious site ( for this is indeed , let me remind you , Language Log , not the Zeta Psi national organization newsletter or a libertarian broadsheet ) : one thoroughly intimidated would - be frat boy told the Yale Daily News remorsefully : " We 're all terribly sorry , and at that moment we did n't actually think that Yale girls are sluts . "
But methinks he protesteth too much .
Part of what makes this whole incident so non-serious is that ( irrelevant though it would be to the plausibility of any lawsuit ) nobody could think that We love Yale sluts entails or implies that Yale girls in general are sluts .
It merely affirms a love of those Yale girls that are .
Compare with We love Princeton philosophers .
It does n't imply that Princetonians are all philosophers , or typically philosophers , does it ?
[ Update , a few hours later : Perhaps that last linguistic point is invalid .
Breffni O'Rourke makes the excellent point that things are different with Princeton bastards , which does tend to imply that all Princetonians are bastards .
Terms of abuse do not behave exactly the way descriptive terms do .
Nice observation , Breffni . ]
[ Further update , several days later : I got a certain amount of critical mail on the post above , naturally enough , but what I wish someone had done was just to send me a picture of the scene .
In due course I did find one .
And if ever there was a case where the non-linguistic context changed just about everything , this was it .
Take a look at the picture :
Not quite the witty , good - natured , non-threatening poster disply one might have imagined , is it ?
A dozen unsavory - looking guys looking roughly like street gang members blocking the door of a building in which rape counseling takes place .
If you were a young woman who did not want to be physically roughed up , would you have taken the risk of trying to enter through that gang after dark ?
All of my remarks above about how the message on the sign could n't possibly be a cause for action still apply ( except that I originally said that what they did was " erect " a sign ; apparently all they did was hold up a symbolically limp piece of paper ) .
The lawsuit talk just caused people like a commenter at to ask , quite reasonably , " what would you sue them for ?
Being assholes ?
Misogynists ? : in America , and you have a right to be a misogynist asshole , and express your views .
But my contempt for the young men involved just went up a substantial amount , and I no longer think that it was silly of the Women 's Center to see this event as deserving of disciplinary charges — but relating to the apparently threatening behavior , not the sign .
Among the long list of comments at IvyGate , many were obscene and threatening misogynist garbage ( " You broads need to chill the fuck out " , " silly cunts , they should shut the fuck up and go make me dinner " , that sort of thing — good examples to look at if you ever wonder why Language Log has no open comments feature ) .
But one from a commenter called Englishman seemed to me to hit the nail on the head very nicely :
Wow , i am truly amazed at the bravery of the free speech activists / men of america , standing outside a rape victim help centre with a little bit of paper saying yale girls are sluts .
Kinda shows everything that is wrong with your pathetic , penis envy driven society .
These are your most " intelligent " minds ?
no wonder you 're still in iraq ...
One of the unpleasant things about First Amendment rights , which we must never forget , is that we are forced to extend them to the wankers of Zeta Psi .
But one of the nice things about First Amendment rights is that they extend to those on the opposite side too .
They also extend to those readers who are invited to submit guest posts ; curiously , the new ( January 28 ) post by Jane Acheson was posted by Mark Liberman while this update was being written .
There is some overlap , including the picture , but I did not see her post until a couple of hours after I wrote the foregoing remarks .
The way things look to me right now , I 'd say she has it all just about right .
Except about me writing " ham - handedly " , of course . ]

The Meaning of Life
Life Explained
This is my lastest book :
The Book of Black : Black Holes , Black Death , Black Forest Cake , and Other Dark Sides of Life
Easily read my latest tweets , for free , here .
This is terrible news for the major party establishments .
That was evident on Thursday night , on a chartered jet from Iowa to New Hampshire in the wee hours after the caucuses .
On board was the press corps that follows Hillary Clinton , as well as her aides who worked their way down the aisle furiously spinning the night 's disastrous results .
With strained faces , the likes of longtime Clinton pollster Mark Penn and former Democratic party chairman Terry McAuliffe talked themselves hoarse over the engines , arguing that Hillary could survive a third - place Iowa finish some people consider a political death sentence .
Perhaps .
But it 's clear that in spurning the mighty Clinton machine for an upstart such as Barack Obama , Iowa Democrats were also rejecting their party 's old guard .
Likewise , in choosing the little - known Arkansan Mike Huckabee , Iowa Republicans also defied their party 's establishment .
GOP [ Grand Old Party ] barons from Washington to Wall Street - the think - tankers , columnists and money men who supported the Bush administration - see the folksy preacher as an unelectable ' rube ' [ hick ] with an intolerable weakness for higher taxes and social spending .
But with Huckabee 's clear win over Mitt Romney , they , too , were rebuffed just as thoroughly as were the Clintonites .
Iowans of both parties have issued a call to reboot their political system .
It 's too soon to say whether these insurgents can win their parties ' nominations .
( Obama 's prospects look much better than the underfunded and more widely resisted Huckabee's . )
But it seems likely that this taste for upheaval will carry through to the 2008 election .
With no incumbent President or Vice - President on the ticket , and with the traumas of 9/11 and Iraq beginning to fade , voters will make a reassessment of their beliefs and preferences .
In all probability , that will restore the Democrats to the White House after eight years of exile .
Why ?
Because America is becoming a fundamentally Democratic country .
That may surprise observers startled by the long reign of the Bush administration .
But the notion that the Bush era showed the US to be a ' conservative ' nation is wrong .
And the 2008 election will prove it .
Among those who buy into the fallacy that the American instinct is truly conservative , former White House svengali Karl Rove is the best known .
When George W Bush was elected in 2000 , Rove boasted that the country was embarking upon a political ' realignment ' that would usher in a generation of Republican rule .
His ambition seemed comically grandiose .
Until 9/11 .
The World Trade Centre and Pentagon attacks threw the American psyche into a reactionary jolt , one that Rove and his President happily exploited .
On 10 September 2001 , Bush had been a faltering President struggling against Democrats in the Congress .
Two years later , Republicans had exploited national security fears to consolidate their power on Capitol Hill and launch an invasion of Iraq .
Polling even showed that public opinion slanted rightward on issues such as abortion and gay marriage , as people sought comfort in ' traditional values ' .
To Rove and his cohorts , 9/11 simply accelerated an inexorable shift within the American electorate towards Republican values such as lower taxes , hawkish foreign policy and social conservatism .
Thus , when a Democratic surge cost Republicans control of the Congress in November 2006 , conservatives dismissed it .
The American psyche has n't shifted , they said ; rather , the Republican brand has suffered a horrible run of luck - from Bush 's mismanagement of Iraq to hurricane Katrina to sex scandals involving Republican members of Congress Mark Foley and Larry Craig as well as the thieving GOP superlobbyist Jack Abramoff .
As Brit Hume of the conservative Fox News network put it on election night 2006 , Democrats had carried the day , but ' from what we could see from all the polling and everything else , it remains a conservative country ' .
By this thinking , Republicans are down but hardly out .
Once a new messenger begins making the case for conservatism , free from the taint of Bush and Cheney , Americans will welcome the GOP back into their loving arms .
But this thinking is delusional .
Republicans are n't the victims of a string of misfortunes ; they were the beneficiaries of a deeply unsettling period of war and terrorism .
Now that fears of terrorism have dimmed and the Iraq war has turned from a political benefit to a political liability , it will likely become evident that the foundations of their party are crumbling .
Look at voting patterns .
During the Reagan era of the 1980s , the old Democratic coalition of minorities and union - friendly , working - class Democrats frayed as conservatives used cultural appeals to split off blue - collar ' Reagan Democrats ' .
But over the past 15 years , two new groups - women and professionals , especially those in America 's rising ' knowledge ' economy - have flocked to the Democratic camp .
Professionals , a broadly defined class that ranges from doctors to actors , sympathise with some of the GOP 's instincts , but have increasingly tended to vote on the basis of their social libertarianism on issues such as abortion and stem cell research .
Women have been alienated by Republican hostility to social programmes .
While a generation ago , women voted strongly in favour of Republicans , their rising levels of education and participation in the workforce have brought them into the Democratic fold , especially worrisome for the GOP , given that women are more reliable voters than men .
This shift has been largely responsible for a gradual change in the electoral map , as these voting blocs are turning once - solid Republican states such as Virginia , Arizona and Colorado into places where Democrats can and do win .
Moreover , Republicans have alienated minorities in droves .
First , there was Katrina , whose images of African - Americans left unaided in New Orleans erased the gains made by Republican outreach efforts to black voters .
More recently came the wave of demagoguery over illegal immigrants , who have become a scapegoat for America 's rising economic insecurity .
Rove 's realignment plan counted on wooing America 's Latino population into the Republican fold .
Last spring , Bush tried to grant millions of illegal immigrants a new path to US citizenship ( he was unsuccessful ) , but his fellow Republicans trashed the idea as an ' amnesty ' .
The effect is evident in a December poll showing that Latinos prefer Democrats to Republicans by a 34 - point margin .
Rove 's dream has been destroyed for the foreseeable future .
As the Democratic coalition expands , the Republican coalition is collapsing .
Ronald Reagan 's greatest political triumph was his ability to join together three groups with little in common : economic conservatives , religious conservatives , and national - defence conservatives .
Bush brilliantly sustained this coalition , but over the past few years those branches have begun to clash .
Evangelical voters , who tend to have lower incomes , have grown suspicious of the party 's wealthy plutocrats .
( The rise of Mike Huckabee , who offers a strong class - appeal suspicion of the rich , is perfect evidence . )
The more socially moderate wealthy Reublicans are blenching at the rising pitch of the anti-gay , anti-abortion Christian agenda .
And everyone is wary of the defence conservatives who led the way into Iraq .
Polls show that Americans have grown suspicious of free trade , support raising taxes on the rich and back government intervention to increase health care coverage .
Thanks to the debacle in Iraq , Democrats have even closed a generation - long Republican advantage on the question of who can best handle national security , once one of the Democrats ' most debilitating weaknesses .
None of this guarantees that Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton or John Edwards will win back the White House .
Another 9/11 - style event may rescue the Republicans .
But the Iowa results suggest that voters are in a revolutionary mood , that they feel their political system has drifted out of tune with their true beliefs .
After eight painful and confusing years , those beliefs will likely reaffirm themselves next year in the form of a Democratic President .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia on Monday test - launched a new intercontinental ballistic missile , part of a system that can outperform any anti-missile system likely to be deployed , according to the officer in charge of missile forces .
The missile was launched from the Tula nuclear - powered submarine in the Barents Sea in the Arctic , a statement from the Russian navy said .
It hit a designated area in the Kura testing ground on the Kamchatka Peninsula on Russia ’s Pacific coast .
“ The launch was conducted from an underwater position as a part of training to test the readiness of the marine strategic nuclear forces , ” the statement said .
A spokesman would not say what type of missile was tested .
Itar - Tass news agency said the Tula carried Sineva missiles commissioned by a decree from President Vladimir Putin in July .
Missile tests have become regular occurrences by the armed forces in the past few years .
They are viewed by the political and military leadership as evidence of a revival of military might .
The commander of Russia ’s strategic rocket forces , speaking after the launch , said Russia could thwart any anti-missile system that could be put in place for years to come .
“ The military hardware now on our weapons , and those that will appear in the next few years , will enable our missiles to outperform any anti-missile system , including future systems , ” Col. - Gen Nikolai Solovtsov was quoted as telling journalists .
The United States plans to deploy a missile defense system in central Europe to defend against attacks by rogue states and it is not aimed at Russia , but Moscow says the system threatens its security and has promised counter - measures .
Solovtsov , quoted by Russian news agencies at a site outside Moscow , said new missile systems could be deployed in the coming years in Russia , based on the Topol - M system being developed for more than a decade .
He also said the proposed U.S. anti-missile systems , to be deployed in Poland and the Czech Republic , could be viewed as legitimate targets by Moscow if circumstances warranted .
“ We are obliged to take appropriate measures to ensure that Russia ’s potential for nuclear deterrence is in no way devalued , ” he told reporters .
“ I can not rule out that should such an attempt be undertaken and in the event of a decision by top military leaders , these anti-missile sites in Poland and the Czech Republic could be selected as targets for our ... missiles . ”
Mahmoud Zahar , a senior Hamas official in Gaza , refused in an interview to take direct responsibility for ordering the Egyptian border opened , but said : “ We are creating facts .
We have to try to change the situation , and now we await the results . ”
With the crossings to Israel closed and minimal goods coming in , Mr. Zahar said : “ Rafah is our only lung .
If Rafah remains shut , it means our acceptance to be strangled , our acceptance to die .
We warned the Egyptians yesterday that people are hungry and dying . ”
Sometimes , he acknowledged , it was necessary to create a crisis to settle another one .
It was clear that Hamas , pressed by the closing from Israel , which had produced international protests , decided to push the issue with Egypt .
Muhammad Mishlahad broke down nearly a half - mile of massive concrete blocks with his big Effer crane .
“ I got a call from Hamas at 6 a .m. this morning and they said they had a job for me , ” Mr. Mishlahad said , nearly giddy with the thrill of the day .
“ They asked me to come and clear the barrier . ”
Asked if he was afraid , he laughed and said : “ Why should we be afraid ?
This is our state . ”

In Cairo , analysts said that the situation was delicate for the Egyptian authorities .
“ It is a dilemma for Egypt , ” said Emad Gad , an analyst at the Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies .
“ If it prevents Palestinian civilians from crossing and confronts them with force , it opens itself up to unlimited public scrutiny at home .
And if it lets the Palestinians through , they face the risk of not knowing who or what is coming in and criticism from Israel and the United States . ”
Here in Rafah , relatives from both sides met , as did business partners who usually smuggle goods through tunnels from Egypt to Gaza .
For one day at least , and probably longer , no tunnels were necessary , and Egyptian businessmen brought in goods to sell from the more distant town of El Arish .
Some enterprising Gazans ordered goods from Cairo in the morning and went across to Rafah to pick them up at noon .
Farid Abu Jabara , 45 , who helps to run a Swedish foundation for Gaza ’s handicapped , picked up 50 air mattresses and their pumps , which he had ordered at his own initiative from Cairo at 7 a.m .
Scientists today announced that they have crafted a bacterial genome from scratch , moving one step closer to creating entirely synthetic life forms -- living cells designed and built by humans to carry out a diverse set of tasks ranging from manufacturing biofuels to sequestering carbon dioxide .
Researchers at the J. Craig Venter Institute ( JCVI ) in Rockville , Md. , report in the online edition of Science that they pieced together the genes of Mycoplasma genitalium , the smallest free - living bacterium that can be grown in the laboratory and a common culprit in urinary tract infections .
" The 582,970 base pair M. genitalium bacterial genome is the largest chemically defined structure synthesized in the lab , " lead author Daniel Gibson told ScientificAmerican.com via e-mail .
( Base pairs are complementary linked nucleotide bases , such as adenine–thymine . )
" It 's the first time a genome the size of a bacterium has chemically been synthesized that 's about 20 times longer than [ any DNA molecule ] synthesized before , " adds Christopher Voigt , an assistant professor of bioengineering at the University of California , San Francisco , who was not involved in the study .
The research team , led by Nobel laureate Hamilton Smith , ordered short strands of genetic code from commercial DNA synthesis companies in the U.S. and Germany and stitched them into longer and longer strands using standard molecular biology techniques .
To assemble the largest pieces of DNA , they inserted them into yeast cells and exploited a natural process called " homologous recombination , " which is used by yeast to repair damaged DNA .
The experiment 's final product is equivalent to the naturally occurring genetic code of M. genitalium , with two minor exceptions :
The scientists disabled the gene that gave the bug power to infect human cells , and they added a few " watermarks , " short strips of signature genetic code that identify the product as man-made .
" This completes the second step of a three - step process in creating a synthetic organism , " Gibson says .
The first step came last summer when JCVI scientists transformed one species of bacteria into another with a DNA transplant , switching the identity of one bug by impregnating it with another 's genetic code .
The second step , constructing a synthetic bacterial genome , has now been accomplished with this study .
The final step will involve inserting the synthetic genome into a cell and bringing it to life ; Gibson says experiments with this goal are currently underway .
" We want to emphasize that we have not yet booted up the synthetic chromosome , " JCVI founder Craig Venter said in a conference call with journalists this morning .
There are multiple steps that must be overcome , the biologist explained , but " we are confident that they can be overcome . "
" The ultimate step is proving what they have synthesized is biologically active , " says Eckard Wimmer , a molecular biologist at Stony Brook University in Long Island , N.Y. , who led the effort to construct synthetic polio , the first synthetically built virus .
" Unfortunately , this very critical point is missing here . "
If the researchers succeed in creating their synthetic bacteria , they will be closer to conceiving artificial creatures that could be used to mitigate some of society 's greatest problems , among them climate change and overdependence on fossil fuels .
Venter 's team belongs to a cadre of scientists practicing synthetic biology , a burgeoning discipline that aims to design and build living things from the raw materials of life ( organic chemicals ) and nature 's blueprints ( genetic codes ) .
Synthetic biologists also draw up their own blueprints , designing genetic sequences that nature never fathomed ; the idea is to create novel functions for living things .
Man -made microbes that manufacture pharmaceuticals , crank out cheap biofuels , mop up pollutants and oil spills or invade and destroy cancer cells may be just a decade or two away .
Venter 's group is trying to create a completely synthetic bare - bones version of M. genitalium with a genome stripped of all but the most vital genes .
The goal is to use this organism as chassis into which new genes can be added -- perhaps ones that would give the germ the ability to spin silk , detect toxins or manufacture drugs .
The possibilities seem endless , albeit not all rosy .
Critics have pointed out that the same synthetic biology know - how and technologies could be used by terrorists or rogue states to engineer a bacterium that churns out a neurotoxin or , perhaps , a deadly flu virus with resistance to vaccines and antiviral medications .
Leaders in the field recognize the potential for misuse , both accidental and intentional , and have begun to address the issue .
In October , members of JCVI , the Center for Strategic & International Studies and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology released a report offering policy options for oversight , and several leading synthetic biologists have published papers on the matter in peer - reviewed journals .
Looking at potential applications , not everyone agrees on the best strategy for manufacturing these promising organisms .
The sleekest bug is not necessarily the best , points out George Church , a geneticist at the Harvard Medical School in Cambridge , Mass . , and director of the Lipper Center for Computational Genetics .
" Simplicity is overrated .
E. Coli , with all its so - called junk DNA , is way more efficient than Mycoplasma , " he says , noting that E. Coli 's genome is about eight times bigger but grows about 50 times faster .
A company called LS9 , Inc. , in San Carlos , Calif. , has already taken advantage of E. coli ’s productivity , engineering the bug to churn out DesignerBiofuels , " a family of fuels that has properties indistinguishable from those of gasoline , diesel , and jet fuel , " according to the company 's Web site .
Instead of rebuilding E. Coli from scratch , LS9 has taken the organism from nature and modified it by inserting fragments of synthetic DNA , an approach that , Church notes , is much less costly and easy to scale up for industrial purposes .
Regardless of what approach yields the most return , synthetic biology is , no doubt , racing forward .
In the last few years DNA synthesis techniques have become faster , cheaper and accessible to more people .
Ordering DNA from commercial outfits has become as easy as ordering pizza , according to Voigt , who projects that in upcoming decades scientists will be able to whip up much larger segments of DNA : synthetic genomes for yeast , animals -- perhaps even humans .
Wired 's Jennifer Granick has a chilling editorial on what a new decision out of the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts on cell - phone records means for you : law enforcement can now gain access to the record of where you 've taken your cellphone , because " stored data " does n't get the same privacy protection that " live data " does .
While most courts considering the issue have held that police need " probable cause " to track your movements , a new decision ( . pdf ) last week out of the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts holds that law enforcement need show only " relevance to an ongoing investigation " to get a historical record of your past movement ( something like the Jeffy trail in The Family Circus cartoon ) .

Lazy square roots of power series return
In an earlier article I talked about wanting to use lazy streams to calculate the power series expansion of the solution of this differential equation :
To do that I decided I would need a function to calculate the square root of a power series , which I did figure out ; it 's in the earlier article .
But then I got distracted with other issues , and then folks wrote to me with several ways to solve the differential equation , and I spent a lot of time writing that up , and I did n't get back to the original problem until today , when I had to attend the weekly staff meeting .
I get a lot of math work done during that meeting .
At least one person wrote to ask me for the Haskell code for the power series calculations , so here 's that first off .
A power series a 0 + a 1 x + a 2 x2 + a 3 x3 + ... is represented as a ( probably infinite ) list of numbers [ a 0 , a 1 , a 2 , ... ] .
If the list is finite , the missing terms are assumed to be all 0 .
The following operators perform arithmetic on functions : -- add functions a and b add [ ] b = b add a [ ] = a add ( a:a ' ) ( b:b ' ) = ( a+b ) : add a' b' -- multiply functions a and b mul [ ] _ = [ ] mul _ [ ] = [ ] mul ( a:a ' ) ( b:b' ) = ( a * b ) : add ( add ( scale a b ' ) ( scale b a ' ) ) ( 0 : mul a ' b' ) -- termwise multiplication of two series mul2 = zipWith (*) -- multiply constant a by function b scale a b = mul2 ( cycle [ a ] ) b neg a = scale ( - 1 ) a And there are a bunch of other useful utilities : -- 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , ... iota = 0 : zipWith (+ ) ( cycle [ 1 ] ) iota -- 1 , 1/2 , 1/3 , 1/4 , ... iotaR = map ( 1/ ) ( tail iota ) -- derivative of function a deriv a = tail ( mul2 iota a ) -- integral of function a -- c is the constant of integration int c a = c : ( mul2 iotaR a ) -- square of function f sqr f = mul f f -- constant function con c = c : cycle [ 0 ] one = con 1 Order
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
from Powell 's Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs , Higher - Order Perl , and I presume elsewhere .
I have n't seen the square root extractor anywhere else , but I 'm sure that 's just because I have n't looked .
-- reciprocal of argument function inv ( s0:st ) = r where r = r0 : scale ( negate r0 ) ( mul r st ) r0 = 1/s0 -- divide function a by function b squot a b = mul a ( inv b ) -- square root of argument function srt ( s0:s ) = r where r = r0 : ( squot s ( add [ r0 ] r ) ) r0 = sqrt( s0 )
We can define the cosine function as follows : coss = zipWith ( *) ( cycle [ 1,0 , - 1,0 ] ) ( map ( ( 1 / ) . fact ) [ 0.. ] )
We could define the sine function analogously , or we can say that sin( x ) = √ ( 1 - cos2 ( x ) ) : sins = ( srt . ( add one ) . neg . sqr ) coss
This works fine .
Order
How to Solve It
from Powell 's f = f ' .
The first thing I tried was observing that for all f , f = f 0 : mul2 iotaR f ' .
This yields the code : f = f0 : mul2 iotaR ( deriv f) This holds for any function , and so it 's unsolvable .
But if you combine it with the differential equation , which says that f = f ' , you get : f = f0 : mul2 iotaR f where f0 = 1 -- or whatever the initial conditions dictate and in fact this works just fine .
And then you can observe that this is just the definition of int ; replacing the definition with the name , we have : f = int f0 f where f0 = 1 -- or whatever
This runs too , and calculates the power series for the exponential function , as it should .
It 's also transparently obvious , and makes me wonder why it took me so long to find .
But I was looking for solutions of the form : f = deriv f which Haskell can't figure out .
It 's funny that it only handles differential equations when they 're expressed as integral equations .
I need to meditate on that some more .
It occurs to me just now that the f = f0 : mul2 iotaR ( deriv f ) identity above just says that the integral and derivative operators are inverses .
These things are always so simple in hindsight .
Anyway , moving along , back to the original problem , instead of f = f ' , I want f2 + ( f ' ) 2 = 1 , or equivalently f' = √ ( 1 - f2 ) .
So I take the derivative - integral identity as before : f = int f0 ( deriv f ) and put in √ ( 1 - f2 ) for deriv f : f = int f0 ( ( srt . ( add one ) . neg . sqr ) f ) where f0 = sqrt 0.5 -- or whatever
And now I am done ; Haskell cheerfully generates the power series expansion for f for any given initial condition .
( The parameter f0 is precisely the desired value of f( 0 ) . )
For example , when f( 0 ) = √ ( 1/2 ) , as above , the calculated terms show the function to be exactly √ ( 1/2 ) ·( sin( x ) + cos(x ) ) ; when f( 0 ) = 0 , the output terms are exactly those of sin(x ) .
When f( 0 ) = 1 , the output blows up and comes out as [ 1 , 0 , NaN , NaN , ... ] .
I 'm not quite sure why yet , but I suspect it has something to do with there being two different solutions that both have f( 0 ) =
1 . Order
Higher - Order Perl
from Powell 's HOP for complete details .
Sample code is here .
For a Scheme implementation , see SICP .
For a Java , Common Lisp , Python , Ruby , or SML implementation , do the obvious thing .
But anyway , it does work , and I thought it might be nice to blog about something I actually pursued to completion for a change .
Also I was afraid that after my week of posts about Perl syntax , differential equations , electromagnetism , Unix kernel internals , and paint chips in the shape of Austria , the readers of Planet Haskell , where my blog has recently been syndicated , were going to storm my house with torches and pitchforks .
This article should mollify them for a time , I hope .

At least 20,000 U.S. troops who were not classified as wounded during combat in Iraq and Afghanistan have been found with signs of brain injuries , according to military and veterans records compiled by USA TODAY .
The data , provided by the Army , Navy and Department of Veterans Affairs , show that about five times as many troops sustained brain trauma as the 4,471 officially listed by the Pentagon through Sept. 30 .
These cases also are not reflected in the Pentagon 's official tally of wounded , which stands at 30,327 .
HIDDEN WOUNDS : Marine did n't recognize signs of brain injury
The number of brain - injury cases were tabulated from records kept by the VA and four military bases that house units that have served multiple combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan .
One base released its count of brain injuries at a medical conference .
The others provided their records at the request of USA TODAY , in some cases only after a Freedom of Information Act filing was submitted .
USA TODAY ARCHIVES : Brain injuries from war worse than thought
The data came from : • Landstuhl Army Regional Medical Center in Germany , where troops evacuated from Iraq and Afghanistan for injury , illness or wounds are brought before going home .
Since May 2006 , more than 2,300 soldiers screened positive for brain injury , hospital spokeswoman Marie Shaw says .
• Fort Hood , Texas , home of the 4th Infantry Division , which returned from a second Iraq combat tour late last year .
At least 2,700 soldiers suffered a combat brain injury , Lt. Col. Steve Stover says .
• Fort Carson , Colo. , where more than 2,100 soldiers screened were found to have suffered a brain injury , according to remarks by Army Col.
Heidi Terrio before a brain injury association seminar .
• Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton , where 1,737 Marines were found to have suffered a brain injury , according to Navy Cmdr. Martin Holland , a neurosurgeon with the Naval Medical Center San Diego .
• VA hospitals , where Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have been screened for combat brain injuries since April .
The VA found about 20 % of 61,285 surveyed — or 11,804 veterans — with signs of brain injury , spokeswoman Alison Aikele says .
VA doctors say more evaluation is necessary before a true diagnosis of brain injury can be confirmed in all these cases , Aikele says .
Soldiers and Marines whose wounds were discovered after they left Iraq are not added to the official casualty list , says Army Col.
Robert Labutta , a neurologist and brain injury consultant for the Pentagon .
" We are working to do a better job of reflecting accurate data in the official casualty table , " Labutta says .
Most of the new cases involve mild or moderate brain injuries , commonly from exposure to blasts .
More than 150,000 troops may have suffered head injuries in combat , says Rep. Bill Pascrell , D - N.J. , founder of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force .
" I am wary that the number of brain - injured troops far exceeds the total number reported injured , " he says .
About 1.5 million troops have served in Iraq , where traumatic brain injury can occur despite heavy body armor worn by troops .

Dr. Jay Parkinson launched his medical practice in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn in late September with no waiting room , no fluorescent - lit exam rooms , and best of all , no overhead .
Parkinson 's practice is online .
Want to reach him ?
Try instant messenger or e-mail .
Parkinson 's medical practice combines quaint house calls of yore with decidedly 21st - century technology .
For a yearly fee of $ 500 , Parkinson makes an initial visit to his patients in their apartments and offers two additional visits as needed .
But he is available to them any time between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. weekdays for unlimited consultation on IM or e-mail .
An amateur photographer on the side – his Flickr page has a following – Parkinson launched the practice to focus on Brooklyn's young , uninsured working creative types .
" A lot of artists in New York City do n't have insurance because they 're freelancers , " says Parkinson , who earned his M.D. from Pennsylvania State and has a master ’s degree in public health .
" They 're young and wired .
Once you figure out an issue , you can follow up with e-mail , IM and video chat .
The vast majority of these people do n't need repeated physical exams . "
Parkinson uses web - based Life Record to keep his medical records .
He can access them on his iPhone if , say , he 's out to dinner and a patient needs a prescription refill .
At home , he 's parked in front of a MacBook .
When his patients need imaging tests or specialists , Parkinson refers them to a network of low - cost providers .
" I 've been very sneaky in the last three months , calling up 2,000 doctors and facilities in the area and asking how much they charge , " he says .
After all , there 's no central directory of physician prices , and insured Americans have little reason to ask .
The results have been shocking .
In researching the cost of mammograms for a patient with a strong family history of breast cancer , Parkinson found prices ranging from $ 125 to $ 750 for the service .
Anne Baker ( name changed at her request ) , an uninsured 31 - year - old art gallery owner , was one of Parkinson 's first patients .
After breaking out in a mysterious full - body rash , Baker found Parkinson online and contacted him .
The following day , Parkinson visited Baker 's apartment and went over her medical history in depth .
" It was like filling out that form when you first go to a doctor , except we did it verbally , " says Baker .
" He got a lot more nuanced than any form would . "
Parkinson diagnosed the source of her rash – an allergic reaction to lotion – and followed up with an e-mail afterwards .
" I sent him an e-mail letting him know it cleared up , and two days later he checked back to see how I was doing , " says Baker .
" It was amazing ! "
Parkinson does n't yet have malpractice insurance , but says it 's typical for a new practice to wait on insurance until building up a sufficient patient base .
But insurance agencies may be spooked by a tech - heavy new business model .
Parkinson hopes otherwise , arguing that because his practice makes doctor - patient communication easier , insurers should feel more comfortable , not less .
He also wo n't be performing pelvic exams on women , instead referring them to Planned Parenthood and other low - cost providers .
In his first four days in business , he signed up 15 patients , turning away those who live outside Brooklyn .
( House calls farther afield just are n't feasible . )
He plans to buy a scooter to zip around the borough .
Though the practice is still too new to have run into the issue , Parkinson plans to charge $ 150 to $ 200 for extra house calls after the first two per year .
In a pinch , though , he 'll accommodate his creative clientele " I 'll probably make some exceptions or accept artwork for my services , " he says .

Former newsreader Anna Ford has spoken for the first time of the " atmosphere of fear " in the BBC that led to her quitting the Corporation .
Miss Ford , who spent 17 years at the BBC and presented the lunchtime news , has revealed that she quit 15 months ago because she had become marginalised .
And to add to the BBC 's woes , the editor of Newsnight has hit out at the Corporation 's stance on climate change .
Peter Barron said it was " not the corporation 's job to save the planet " .
He said the BBC was going beyond its remit by planning an entire day of programmes dedicated to highlighting environmental worries .
Meanwhile , Miss Ford has spoken for the first time about observing a " dumbing down " in standards at the BBC and her decision to quit .
She said : " I think the BBC is now a very unkind and badly managed place .
" There is an atmosphere of fear based on the fact that people have very short contracts , and the youngsters are pushed and pushed and pushed .
" You no longer see people smiling when they work on news programmes , " she told the British Journalism Review .
" The nature of the BBC changed fundamentally with the advent of John Birt .
" The fact was he did n't have the self - confidence to manage the place himself but spent millions of pounds - it was said at the time £ 22 m - on management consultants ... well , management consultants do n't know about programming .
" They are to do with streamlining and the bureaucracy grew and grew and became unkind . "
Explaining her decision to quit , she said : " I was so uninvolved that it prompted me to hand in my notice .
" I just thought , I can either take the money and run and go on doing this job , or I can decide it is n't a job that 's worth doing , " she said .
" The BBC must differentiate itself from all other television companies by making extremely high - class programmes .
" That does n't mean they should n't be popular but they should be the best . "
She went on : " I do think complaints about dumbing down are justified .
" I must sound very old fashioned when I use the word vulgarity , but we are constantly seeing people on screen who are of low intelligence and low educational and whose views on everything seem to be made important . "
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Teenagers who have had formal sex education are far more likely to put off having sex , contradicting earlier studies on the effectiveness of such programs , U.S. researchers said on Wednesday .

Teenagers who have had formal sex education are far more likely to put off having sex , contradicting earlier studies on the effectiveness of such programs , U.S. researchers said on Wednesday .
REUTERS/SergeiKarpukhin
They found teenage boys who had sex education in school were 71 percent less likely to have intercourse before age 15 , and teen girls who had sex education were 59 percent less likely to have sex before age 15 .
Sex education also increased the likelihood that teen boys would use contraceptives the first time they had sex , according to the study by researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which was published in the Journal of Adolescent Health .
“ Sex education seems to be working , ” Trisha Mueller , an epidemiologist with the CDC who led the study , said in a statement .
“ It seems to be especially effective for populations that are usually at high risk . ”
Mueller ’s team looked at a 2002 national survey of 2,019 teens aged 15 to 19 .
They found teen boys who had sex education in school were nearly three times more likely to use birth control the first time they had intercourse .
But sex education appeared to have no effect on whether teen girls used birth control , the researchers found .
Black teenage girls who had sex education in school were 91 percent less likely to have sex before age 15 .
The researchers did not evaluate the content of sex education programs , including whether students were taught about contraception or about abstinence only .
Earlier studies , which relied on data from the 1970s through the 1990s , suggested sex education did little to persuade teens to delay sex .
The researchers said they think the difference may be that sex education in the United States is now more widespread and is being taught at earlier ages .
“ Unlike many previous studies , our results suggest that sex education before first sex protects youth from engaging in sexual intercourse at an early age , ” they wrote .
Holy crap these criminally insane knuckleheads , in positions of power , who really think that all of the American people are too stupid to see this ploy as kissing babies in an election year .
Three hundred dollars for each working man and woman WTF !!!!
This is going to prevent a recession !!!
Horse crap !!!
Bail out the predatory lenders ??
What a great idea make sure the hedge fund managers get their cut .
Oh that 's right they already got theirs plus a hefty tax break too .
Here 's the deal boys and girls .
This is chicanery , tomfoolery and you 're being hoodwinked again .
The growing economic nightmare that is coming is not going to be solved by giving me $ 300 bucks .
I am not a sophisticated financial planner or economist but here it goes my attempt at the financial survival plan for the first decade of the 21st century .
If you do n't have it in cash do n't buy it !!!!
If your kids can't wear it , eat it , live in it , or learn from it , do n't buy it !!!
If you are in a dead end low paying job , turn off American Idolatry , CSI , Survivor on The Moon , Nancy Grace , or anything that has to do with Britney Hilton , and go through the paper and find what kind of jobs are in demand that pay good and enroll in your local community college and train for that job instead of numbing your brain with mindless TV .
Pay off your credit card debt and tear up most of your cards !!!

Lynne Cheney jokes , Sometimes Dick will ' bite the head off a live chicken ' Mike Aivaz and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday October 11 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Hardly a day goes by without Jon Stewart taking a dig at Vice President Dick Cheney , portrayed as the nation 's No. 1 supervillain .
With a new book to hawk , the vice president 's wife , Lynnee Cheney , stepped into treacherous territory , with an appearance on The Daily Show Wednesday .
An interview that had plenty of potential to turn awkward began with a light touch from the vice president 's wife , as she presented Stewart with a Darth Vader doll , a sly wink at Hillary Clinton and others who have compared Cheney to the Star Wars villain .
Stewart seemed a little put off by the gift .
" Is there a microphone in it ? " he asked nervously before placing the figurine under his desk .
Later in the inverview , Lynnee Cheney invoked some of the wilder suspicions about how the vice president spends his downtime .
" He likes to watch old movies , every once in a while , he 'll bite the head off a live chicken , " she joked .
Lynne Cheney was promoting her new book , Blue Skies , No Fences , a memoir about growing up in Wyoming .
Stewart praised the book , but he also steered the interview toward current topics , such as gay marriage and the war in Iraq .
He asked whether Cheney was doing enough to lobby President Bush and other religious leaders on gay marriage , because of his personal experience raising a lesbian daughter .
Lynne said they have tried to keep a " zone of privacy " around their daughter , Mary , but she repeated criticism of a federal gay marriage amendment .
The exchange grew a little heated when the conversation touched on Iraq , with Lynne Cheney defending the war , while acknowledging that she 's frustrated at its slow pace .
She said Bush and Dick Cheney deserved a lot of credit for preventing attacks against America since Sept. 11 , 2001 , unlike bombings against US embassies and the USS Cole , carried out after the first World Trade Center bombing .
" The terrorists were n't reluctant to damage American interest and kill Americans , " Cheney said .
" You know they have been doing that all these past six years ... you know the Spanish bombing , the English bombing , and then all the bombings in Iraq , " Steward said .
" Yes , but we 're talking about American interests , " Cheney shot back , leaving Stewart stunned for a moment .
" Are n't we interested in ... alright , I had assumed they were our allies , but alright , " Stewart said .
He then changed the topic and thanking Cheney for coming on the show .
" If you do see your husband , because I do n't know how much time he spends in the man - size safe ... please tell him we would love to have him on , " Stewart said , quickly reconsidering .
" You know what , no , OK , no , forget that .
But you , we were delighted to have . "

It is not hard to see where designer Greg Madison got his inspiration from for the Madylight — namely sci- fi movies and video games .
He believes that one of the common threads between these mediums is " luminescent shapes which represent electronic circuits or magic spells . "
So the goal was to reproduce these shapes in everyday objects — like a lamp .
It looks awesome , and the best part is that it is not all that difficult to make yourself .

It do n’t get much weirder than this .
The universe is about to lose its dimension of time says a group of theoretical astrobods at the University of Salamanca in Spain .
And they got the evidence to prove it .
The idea comes from the study of braneworlds : the thinking that the universe we see around us is a 4 - dimensional cosmos called a braneworld embedded in a multidimensional universe .
The “ signature ” of our universe is the number of space and time - like dimensions it has : in our case we got 3 space - like dimensions and one time - like dimension .
It ’s what astrobods call a Lorentzian universe .
So far so good : lots of astronutters think the same thing .
But our universe may not always have been like this .
Some theorists think it may once have had a Euclidean signature meaning that all the dimensions were space - like .
Now Marc “ Bars ” Mars and a few pals in Spain say that the Universe ’s signature might be about to flip from Lorentzian to Euclidean .
In other words , our dimension of time is about turn space - like .
Gulp !
This ai n’t entirely bonkers and here ’s why .
Bars Mars has calculated what it ’s like to be an observer in a universe that is about to flip and get this : it would look as if it were expanding and accelerating away from us .
Sound familiar ?
Yep , it ’s exactly what astrobods have been observin over the last few years , a phenomenon they attribute to dark energy .
If Bars Mars is right , dark energy ai n’t got nothing to do with it and we ’re all starin ’ down the barrel of a cosmic catastrophe .
Still , maybe four space - like dimensions will be better than three .
Who needs time anyway ?
Ref : arxiv.org/abs/0710.0820 : Is the Accelerated Expansion Evidence of a Forthcoming change of Signature ?
In his new animated film , Jerry Seinfeld plays Barry B. Benson , a wisecracking , moony - eyed , charmingly petulant New York honeybee who does n’t want to spend his days as a worker bee stuck on the honeymaking assembly line .
“ You know , Dad , the more I think about it , ” Barry says , “ maybe the honey field just is n’t right for me . ”
To which his father , a proud , lifelong “ honey stirrer , ” snaps : “ And you were thinking of , what , making balloon animals ?
That ’s a bad job for a guy with a stinger ! ”
Swell comeback , Pop , but your son has a point , starting with the posterior one he should n’t have in the first place .
Is n’t Barry supposed to be a he bee ?
Well , male honeybees do n’t have stingers , for the simple anatomical reason that a bee ’s stinger is a modified version of an ovipositor , the distinctly feminine organ through which a female insect lays her eggs .
Barry is absolutely right , however , to doubt his fitness for the honey trade .
In the real world , every job on a beehive ’s spreadsheet — foraging for nectar and pollen , fanning nectar into honey , fawning over the queen , squirting out wax , battling off bears , tossing out the trash and dead bees — is performed by a cast of workers that is homogeneously female .
Sterile , yes , with stingers where their egg - laying tubes should be , but female nonetheless .
By bowdlerizing the basic complexion of a great insect society , Mr. Seinfeld ’s “ Bee Movie ” follows in the well - pheromoned path of Woody Allen as a whiny worker ant in “ Antz ” and Dave Foley playing a klutzy forager ant in “ A Bug ’s Life . ”
Maybe it ’s silly to fault cartoons for biological inaccuracies when the insects are already talking like Chris Rock and wearing Phyllis Diller hats .
But is n’t it bad enough that in Hollywood ’s animated family fare about rats , clownfish , penguins , lions , hyenas and other relatively large animals , the overwhelming majority of characters are male , despite nature ’s preferred sex ratio of roughly 50 - 50 ?
Must even obligately female creatures like worker bees and soldier ants be given sex change surgery , too ?
Besides , there ’s no need to go with the faux : the life of an authentic male social insect is thrilling , poignant and cartoonish enough .
While I wrote about music back in the days before blogs , I never really did the same with movies .
It was n't due to lack of interest .
A lot of lonely weekends in law school led to my development into a film fanatic .
Thanks to Netflix , I 've got a treasure trove of great cinema , new and old , to work through these days .
As with the tunes , I do not claim to be any kind of an expert .
Hell , I can at least make music , but I 've never made a film !
I wo n't argue that the ten movies below were the " best " of the decade ( although some probably are ) , they 're just the ones that stuck with me in a particularly ferocious way .
A word about the method to my madness - I took every flick that made my Year in Film & Video posts as well as things that got a 4 ( out of 5 ) star rating or better at Netflix and threw them in the hopper .
The plan was to narrow the list down to my top ten , but I had to include at least one more .
Even that was a challenge .
Think of these as personal recommendations - if you have n't seen these flicks , you really ought to check them out .
Films of the Decade
Murder on a Sunday Morning ( 2001 )
This has the double benefit of being a gripping , well made documentary ( it won an Academy Award in 2001 ) that also happens to have public defenders as the heroes .
Brenton Butler was a 15 year old kid swooped up by police in the wake of a brutal murder in Florida .
Police coerced a confession out of Butler , who was rescued by a collection of lawyers and investigators from the local PD office .
Not only did they clear an innocent man , they tipped police to the two real killers who were subsequently convicted .
This story is the shot of courage I need when I get in one of those " why am I doing this kind of work ? " funks .
Ararat ( 2002 )
Director Atom Egoyan could have made a straight forward Schindler 's List type movie about the Armenian Genocide .
But that would n't be Egoyan 's style .
Instead , he uses the device of a movie about the making of that kind of movie to do something much more interesting .
The result is a story that is about the power of the stories we tell , to ourselves and to others .
It 's a brilliant meditation on history and memory as well .
25th Hour ( 2002 )
I 've been pleasantly surprised to see this Spike Lee joint on several lists of the decade 's best films .
Most folks pick up on the fact that this was one of the first ( if not the first ) films shot in post - 9/11 New York City that makes reference to the fall of the Twin Towers .
Yeah , that 's part of it , but it 's not what resonated with me .
Given my line of work , this story of Monty , a drug dealer , wrapping up his life before going to prison for seven years says a lot about the collateral damage of the " War on Drugs . "
Monty 's a bastard , but you feel for him , maybe because he finally realizes how much of a bastard he 's been all his life .
Shattered Glass ( 2003 )
I 'm drawn back to this movie again and again for largely the same reason I was fascinated by Forbidden Lie$ , as it's a finely detailed examination of a fraud flailing about trying to dig himself out from underneath his artifice while actually digging himself deeper in .
Stephen Glass was a hot shot writer for The New Republic back in the Clinton years when it still meant something .
Turns out that Glass 's reputation was built on the back of stories that were largely , and in some instances completely , works of fiction .
When the bubble was pricked by a rival online magazine , it popped in spectacular fashion .
The pop and the fallout are fascinating to watch .
Oh , and it turns out young Anakin can actually act !
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ( 2004 )
If it 's true that we are all the sum of our experiences , then that must include the bad ones , right ?
Painful memories are just as important to who we are as good ones .
That 's the essential truth at the heart of one of the best sci - fi flicks of recent memory .
" Wait a tic , " you say , " there 's no lasers or aliens or spaceships here - is it really sci-fi ? "
Absolutely .
The plot is driven by a device that allows the targeted destruction of memories , a means to eliminate the nasty bits of your past .
But the mechanics of the tech are n't as important as what its effects tell us about humanity .
That 's good sci-fi .
It 's also funny , inventive , sweet , and scathing in turn .
That 's just a good flick .
Pan 's Labyrinth ( 2006 )
Speaking of inventive , but in a much darker vein .
It 's hard to believe that a movie set during the days of fascist Spain in which the main character , a young girl , dies ( after a fashion ) can be so enjoyable .
That 's largely down to Guillermo del Toro 's amazing visual style , but that does n't really mean anything without a story and compelling characters to back it up .
I 'm very glad I actually got to see this in the theater , in addition to repeated viewings on DVD .
The Prestige ( 2006 )
I wo n't argue that The Prestige is especially profound , like Eternal Sunshine . . . , or a unique visual treat , like Pan's . . . , but , damn , it was the most entertaining thing I saw in a theater this decade .
A tale of deadly oneupsmanship between a pair of Victorian magicians , it really did keep you guessing up until the end .
Or it kept me guessing , at any rate .
One of the few DVDs I 've purchased that 's devoid of any real bonus material - it's that good .
United 93 ( 2006 )
9/11 was the defining event of the decades , to be sure , and will be the " where were you when " moment for my generation .
It was inevitable that movies would be made about the event and the people involved , but it was far from certain that they would be any good .
Paul Greengrass succeeded in this flick by keeping it completely straight , simply telling the story of the " fourth plane " , which crashed in Pennsylvania after passengers , alerted to what was going on by loved ones , stormed the cockpit .
The moments before that occurs , when those on the plan make last calls to their friends and families is one of the most moving things I 've ever seen .
United 93 hurts so much because it's not been pumped up with Hollywood gimmicks .
Sadly , there was simply no need .
The Lives of Others ( 2006 )
Eavesdroppers , by definition , are a sleazy bunch .
Those who hang around to catch bits of gossip are bad enough .
Those who do it systematically for the government are on whole other level , though .
Which is why a movie about one of them , working for one of the most oppressive states ever , is so fascinating .
As much evil as Gerd does for the Stasi , he is not , deep down inside , a bad person .
If he was , his job would be easier and would n't bleed over into the rest of his life .
That 's the story - how the listening impacts the listener .
Made a great double bill with The Conversation when I saw them a couple of years ago .
4 Months , 3 Weeks , and 2 Days ( 2007 )
Black markets exist because the law can never really keep human beings from acting on their desires and needs .
We have a robust black market for drugs in this country .
The fact that it 's illegal to sell or possess them does n't make it go away .
So to with abortion , in the pre-Roe days .
That truth lurked in my mind all the way through this flick , about a woman who helps her friend obtain a black market abortion in Ceausescu 's Romania .
The plot make the film interesting , intellectually .
What makes it excellent and emotionally robust is the attention to detail and the finely worked performances of all involved .
Man on Wire ( 2008 )
Before the Twin Towers were symbols of horrific crime , they were symbols of progress , innovation , and wonder .
It 's those earlier impressions that caught the eye of Phillipe Petit , a French acrobat who saw a picture of the rising towers in a magazine in his dentist 's office in 1968 .
He hatched deviously simple idea that required a complex scheme to pull off - stretch a high wire between the two towers and walk it .
Man on Wire is the story of that scheme - the " artistic crime of the century " according to some - told with lots of enthusiasm by Petit himself .
A great documentary in its own right , but also a wonderful reminder that the WTC will always be more than the sight of the nation 's greatest crime .
There you have it .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
A federal court has ordered a Kuwait - based contractor to pay nearly $ 5 million in damages to the family of a U.S. military officer killed in Iraq -- a rare court decision holding a contracting company accountable for its actions in the war .
Lt. Col. Dominic Baragona was the highest - ranking soldier to die in Iraq when he was killed May 19 , 2003 .
Army Lt. Col. Dominic " Rocky " Baragona was just an hour away from a U.S. base in Kuwait -- ultimately headed home to the United States -- when a tractor - trailer operated by Kuwait and Gulf Link Transport Company slammed into his Humvee on May 19 , 2003 , killing him instantly .
Baragona , a West Point graduate , was 42 years old and the highest - ranking soldier to have died in the war at the time .
His family filed a wrongful death suit against KGL .
Earlier this month , the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia sided with the family , holding the Kuwait company negligent in Baragona 's death for failing to provide safe passage on the three - lane road where the accident occurred .
A key issue in the judge 's decision was whether a U.S. court had jurisdiction over a foreign contractor and whether there was a legal basis to find it negligent .
Ultimately , Judge William Duffey found that there was .
" The court enters judgment in the amount of $ 4,907,048 to be paid by KGL in a single lump payment , " the judge wrote in his 12 - page decision issued on November 5 .
Baragona 's father , Dominic Baragona , a former U.S. Marine , told CNN he is embarrassed his family was forced into a lawsuit to learn details surrounding his son's death .
He also said the court decision is bittersweet :
No amount of money will ever bring his son back , but it feels good that a court of law sided with his family .
Watch family describe Rocky 's hugs , his Mustang and his character »
" You feel good for the Rock , " he said of his boy .
" We 're going to make KGL sweat it a little bit .
I mean they 're going to remember Rocky 's name . "
Baragona 's sister , Pam , added , " Even in his death , he 's still handing out more messages -- very quietly , in Rocky 's way . "
CNN sought comment from KGL for this story , but got no response .
The law firm Crowell & Moring , which has represented KGL in the past , declined comment .
KGL has received millions of dollars in U.S. - government contracts .
On its Web site , the company says it " performs multiple operations such as providing of vehicles and equipments to customers , " including the U.S. Army and coalition forces .
It also boasts of having more than $ 1 billion in market capitalization .
CNN legal analyst Jeffery Toobin said the court decision theoretically " does open the door to more lawsuits " against contractors , but that the Baragona family is a long way from ever seeing the money .
" It is always very hard to collect judgments against foreign companies and , when you overlay the chaos of Iraq , it makes it extremely difficult -- if not impossible , " Toobin said .
The court decision comes at a time when Congress has been closely scrutinizing contractors and seeking ways to hold the companies accountable for their actions in war zones .
The Baragonas say their suit was never about money .
They would like to see changes made in the contracting business , most importantly to have third - party investigations carried out when something goes wrong and to keep everyone abreast during that reporting process .
" [ Rocky ] was about improving and changing systems so that we had a better Army .
And that 's what he believed in and that 's what he dedicated his life to .
If in his death , he adds more on to that -- that 's what I 'm fighting for , " said Pam Baragona .
If the family ever gets paid , they say they want to set up a foundation to honor their son and brother to help pay for college educations of deserving students .
" Rock 's the little guy .
We have to vindicate for him .
We have to take care of the little guy , " his sister said .
" Creating a legacy for him is a huge responsibility . "
Born on Flag Day on June 14 , 1960 , Rocky Baragona dedicated his life to the military , entering West Point after high school and graduating among the top of his class in 1982 .
His motto was : " More than expected . "
He was one of seven children , five boys and two girls .
One brother , Christopher , died of leukemia just before he would have turned 9 .
The family says it was a young , energetic and super smart Rocky who " held our family together through that dark time . "
" Rocky was my heart , " his mother , Vilma , said .
So sharp was Rocky that he attended a computer camp in the mid-1970s and then taught a computer class in high school for two years because nobody else at school knew much about computers , his mom said .
Rocky loved the military .
He also loved gadgets , the Cleveland Indians , the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Cleveland Browns .
His father , Dominic , said he spoke with his son just two hours before he was killed in Iraq .
As the commander of the 19th Maintenance Battalion based out of Fort Sill , Oklahoma , his son was helping his soldiers get out of Iraq en route to Camp Victory in Kuwait .
Once at the Kuwait base , they were scheduled to head home to Fort Sill .
" I remember asking him : ' Well , Rock , is there anything I have to worry about ? ' " the father said .
" He said , ' The only thing you have to worry about , Dad , is something stupid happening . ' "
According to the lawsuit , Baragona was traveling south through Iraq as part of a three - vehicle convoy when the crash happened .
The suit claims the KGL tractor - trailer struck a pile of dried concrete that had spilled on the road , jack - knifing the big rig and then slamming into Baragona 's Humvee .
The soldier driving Baragona 's vehicle survived the accident .
The Baragona family never expected more than four years later to be talking to a reporter about their son over the Thanksgiving holiday , a court decision and the grief they 've endured -- grief over losing a young child to leukemia and then a grown son three decades later to an accident in war .
" It just never goes away , " his mother said of her pain .
The father says he and Rocky loved to talk politics .
Rocky would always take the opposite position just to rile up his old man .
" I did n't win too many arguments off him because he was so damn sharp , " he said .
" To me , he was the guy I could n't wait to talk to . "
The dad then paused and said , " What a great relationship . "
E-mail to a friend
Corey Delaney said he could not remember much of the party
Officers answering a complaint about noise were forced to retreat and await reinforcements after they were attacked with rocks and bottles .
The teenager who threw the party while his parents were away could now face a bill for thousands of dollars to pay for the damage done in the rampage .
Police blamed lack of adult supervision for the under - age drinking spree .
Lessons to learn
The trouble started after what appeared to be a routine complaint about a noisy party in a suburban neighbourhood .
The officers backed away when confronted by a large crowd of drunken 16 and 17 - year - olds .
Best party ever , that 's what everyone 's saying
Corey Delaney
Glass bottles and other missiles were thrown at police cars and nearby houses and gardens were vandalised before at least 30 officers , a helicopter and the police dog squad arrived to try to restore calm .
An estimated A$ 20,000 ( $ 18,000 ; £ 9,200 ) worth of damage was done but no arrests were made .
Victoria state Police Commissioner Christine Nixon said the teenager who threw the party , 16 - year - old Corey Delaney , may hold ultimate responsibility .
" He needs to learn a lesson , and one way or another we will be making sure that happens , " she told a news conference .
Consequences
The BBC's Phil Mercer in Sydney says the teenage host said he hoped his mum and dad would not find out what had happened .
But they have .
His mother Jo , on her way home from Queensland , told the Seven Network : " We 're a good family .
I 'm just devastated and horrified that this has actually occurred .
" Obviously he 's very scared of the consequences that we 're going to bring upon him . "
Corey Delaney is reported to have advertised his party on the internet and by text messages and it attracted a number of strangers .
He told local media his invited guests had no part in the melee .
But when asked what advice he had for other teenagers planning a home alone party , he appeared unrepentant and told the Nine Network : " Get me to do it for you .
" Best party ever , that 's what everyone 's saying . "
Researchers are working " to create swarms of microscopic robots capable of morphing into virtually any form by clinging together , " reports New Scientist , in a fascinating article about real - life shape - shifting .
A Carnegie Mellon team of researchers " is using simulations to develop control strategies for futuristic shape - shifting , or ‘ claytronic ’ , robots , which they are testing on small groups of more primitive , pocket - sized machines . "
What ’s more , " [t ] hese prototype robots use electromagnetic forces to manoeuvre themselves , communicate , and even share power . "
Here ’s a video depicting how these morphing robots would work :
It all sounds great , and it is , but the researchers concede the robots are still a long ways off .

Stumbleupon Cross - Site Scripting Vulnerability
While I have previously identified XSS and / or CSRF vulnerabilities in both Digg and Reddit , Stumbleupon has largely remained innocuous to these types of attacks for multiple reasons .
First , the primary method of user - login and authentication is through the toolbar , which makes it substantially harder for malicious javascript intercept .
Furthermore , because many of the many valuable user functions are triggered through the individual ’s personal subdomain ( user.stumbleupon.com ) and www.stumbleupon.com, it becomes quite difficult to execute complex functions such as auto-voting or friend - adding .
That being said , there are still work arounds that exist .
In the proof of concept I was able to execute , the vector of attack was the invitefriends .
php file which does not sanitize the email1 input .
http://www.stumbleupon.com/invite_friends.php
?sendername=n&message=n&[email protected ] &email1= [[ vulnerable field ] ]
Subsequently , if an individual is logged into the Stumbleupon website ( not simply the toolbar ) , you can hijack their account to perform multiple tasks , but are still limited to their homepage .
One of the first tasks we need to do is acquire the users temporary fauth / ftoken id , which Stumbleupon uses for form field authorization .
If Stumbleupon.com simply generated a new fauth / ftoken every time a form is called , they would have stopped this vulnerability immediately .
However , because the fauth / ftoken is the same across the site , it becomes quite easy to simply grab the fauth / ftoken from the URL submission page ( http://www.stumbleupon.com/url/[[a url ] ] via an AJAX request and simple DOM calls .
This can be then used in conjuction with the REST method for adding friends …
http://www.stumbleupon.com/user.php?friend=[[insert your numeric ID ] ] &fauth= [ [ the fauth ] ]
Of course , the effectiveness of this attack is greatly diminished by the fact that the user has to still have session cookies from an actual website login to StumbleUpon – not just via the toolbar .

Lots of questions have arisen from people since President Bush signed into law the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief
Act of 2007 , whereby in certain circumstances , a homeowner does not have to pay federal income tax on debt forgiven on a loan secured by a qualified principal residence via a short sale , foreclosure , deed in lieu , loan workout or short refinance where the loan amount was reduced and forgiven in order for the homeowner to keep the property .
It is somewhat confusing just reading a bill with only references to other sections of the law .
Below is the text of Section 2 of H.R. 3648 that specifically pertains to mortgage forgiveness .
To save you the hassle of cross - referencing all this , I have included the sections of the IRS Tax Code that were added to or modified as a result of Section 2 of H.R. 3648 .
SECTION 1 . SHORT TITLE .
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘ Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 ’’.
SECTION 2 . DISCHARGES OF INDEBTEDNESS ON PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE EXCLUDED FROM GROSS INCOME .
( a) IN GENERAL .
Paragraph ( 1 ) of section 108 ( a ) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking ‘‘ or ’’ at the end of subparagraph ( C ) , by striking the period at the end of subparagraph ( D ) and inserting ‘‘ , or ’’ , and by inserting after subparagraph ( D ) the following new subparagraph : ‘ ‘ ( E ) the indebtedness discharged is qualified principal residence indebtedness which is discharged before January 1 , 2010 .’’.
( b) SPECIAL RULES RELATING TO QUALIFIED PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE INDEBTEDNESS .
Section 108 of such Code is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection :
‘‘(h ) SPECIAL RULES RELATING TO QUALIFIED PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE INDEBTEDNESS .—
‘‘ (1 ) BASIS REDUCTION .
— The amount excluded from gross income by reason of subsection ( a ) ( 1 ) ( E ) shall be applied to reduce ( but not below zero ) the basis of the principal residence of the taxpayer .
‘‘( 2 ) QUALIFIED PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE INDEBTEDNESS .— For purposes of this section , the term ‘ qualified principal residence indebtedness ’ means acquisition indebtedness ( within the meaning of section 163( h ) ( 3 ) ( B ) , applied by substituting ‘ $ 2,000,000 ( $ 1,000,000 ’ for ‘ $ 1,000,000 ( $ 500,000 ’ in clause ( ii ) thereof ) with respect to the principal residence of the taxpayer .
‘‘( 3 ) EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN DISCHARGES NOT RELATED TO TAXPAYER’S FINANCIAL CONDITION .
—Subsection ( a ) ( 1 ) ( E ) shall not apply to the discharge of a loan if the discharge is on account of services performed for the lender or any other factor not directly related to a decline in the value of the residence or to the financial condition of the taxpayer .
‘‘( 4 ) ORDERING RULE .
— If any loan is discharged , in whole or in part , and only a portion of such loan is qualified principal residence indebtedness , subsection ( a ) ( 1 ) ( E ) shall apply only to so much of the amount discharged as exceeds the amount H. R. 3648 — 2 of the loan ( as determined immediately before such discharge ) which is not qualified principal residence indebtedness .
‘‘(5 ) PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE .
—
For purposes of this subsection , the term ‘ principal residence ’ has the same meaning as when used in section 121 .’’.
( c ) COORDINATION .
(1) Subparagraph ( A ) of section 108 ( a ) ( 2 ) of such Code is amended by striking ‘‘ and ( D ) ’’ and inserting ‘‘ ( D ) , and ( E ) ’ ’ .

Paragraph ( 1 ) ( B ) shall not apply to a discharge to which paragraph ( 1 ) ( E ) applies unless the taxpayer elects to apply paragraph ( 1 ) ( B ) in lieu of paragraph ( 1 ) ( E ) .’’.
(d) EFFECTIVE DATE .
The amendments made by this section shall apply to discharges of indebtedness on or after January 1 , 2007 .
The following are the sections of the IRS Tax Code that were added to or modified as a result of Section 2 of H.R. 3648 .
Anything that was to be deleted is still there , but with a strikethrough .
Additions are highlighted in yellow .
Section 108 .

I ’ve transcripted the code examples from the paper “ The essence of functional programming ” by Philip Wadler .
Invited talk , 19 ’th Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages ,
ACM Press , Albuquerque , January 1992 .
http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/essence/essence.ps
http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/monads.html
This paper explores the use monads to structure functional programs .
No prior knowledge of monads or category theory is required .
Monads increase the ease with which programs may be modified .
They can mimic the effect of impure features such as exceptions , state , and continuations ; and also provide effects not easily achieved with such features .
The types of a program reflect which effects occur .
The first section is an extended example of the use of monads .
A simple interpreter is modified to support various extra features : error messages , state , output , and non-deterministic choice .
The second section describes the relation between monads and continuation - passing style .
The third section sketches how monads are used in a compiler for Haskell that is written in Haskell .
The Future of Coitus Life - Long Loving with a Sexbot
Sexbots have been around forever , but they are getting smarter all the time .
David Levy , an artificial intelligence expert , sees a future when people will prefer robots to humans .
They will offer , he says , better sex and better relationships .
Overview
Currently , most websites log you in the same way :
You enter a username and password , the web - server hashes the password ( generally via MD5 ( ) , or SHA1 ( ) ) .
This hash is then compared to the one stored in a database - if it matches , the user knows the original password , so it logs them in .
This method has numerous problems , such as the password being sent unencrypted to the web - server , and the fact many users reuse passwords , if an intruder works out a users password ( though any means ) , there is a good chance they can log into the same users email account , online banking etc etc . .
The whole username / password login method has many flaws , most are down to the fact most people struggle to remember a single 5 - 6 character password , let alone multiple random messy looking passwords such as " Xm2K ? pdT&av " , as most " good password guides " suggest .
GPG ( " GnuPG " / " GNU Privacy Guard " ) is a free / open - source replacement for PGP .
I wo n't go into what GPG is , since I guess quite a lot of the people reading this already know , however if you do not , it is primarily used to sign or encrypt email messages - see the Wikipedia page on it
Back to website - logins .
When you enter a username / password into a website , you are basically trying to prove you are you , but with this method , you are only really proving you know the password - something that is surprisingly easy to capture .
GPG is far more secure than a simple password , as it uses a public / private key system - anything signed / encrypted by GPG is effectively using a 4096 character password , and you never send your password anywhere ; only you can sign a message with your private key , and others verify it using your public key .
Since GPG is basically used as an identity - verification tool , it seems logical to use this to prove who you are .
You give the site your public key , it gives you a random string , you sign it with your private key and it knows what key - owner signed the string .
No private data ( private key or password ) is ever transmitted .
Steps
Site displays random string / paragraph .
The user copies this string , using : gpg -- sign - armour
The user copies the output into a textarea on the site , and submits it .
The site runs gpg --verify on the returned textarea
on the returned textarea
If it validates , who ever 's key it is ( " gpg : Good signature from " Bob Smith ( Bob ) bob@someFakeSite.com " ) is logged into the site .
Problems
Replay attacks .
If the signed string is the same , you could simply send the same signed message again .
This is easily fixed by using a temporary , random string , like the captcha - systems use .
As long as the string is only valid for a short amount of time , these attacks are no longer possible .
Even if the string is predictable , the user cannot generate a new signed message .
Session - stealing .
If the login in " remembered " by the site , using cookies , however you login does not prevent " cookie stealing " , so this would be up to the specific site to prevent ( Binding the cookie to a specific IP address for example ? )
Mapping GPG - key in GPG keychain to user - account .
Not all that complicated , but it 's far more complex than simple MD5 ( $ password ) ..
Getting users GPG public key .
Again , not all that complicated - when the user signs up , they fill in a textarea with their public " ASCII - armored " GPG key .
One of the bigger problem with this I can foresee is userA putting userB 's public key in their own account - this would lead to duplicate keys .
Although this would effectively lock userA from his own account , allowing userB to possibly log in as him .
The email / name / nickname could be used to verify who the key belongs to , but since a user may sign up to a site using a nickname or alias , not their real name , it 's may be impossible for the computer to validate this .
Portability .
It 's rather difficult to memorise GPG keys , so the user would be required to carry their keys around if they wish to login from other computers ( Schools / libraries / other peoples houses / etc/etc ) .
Although , if SSH is accessible , it 's simple to use GPG on a remote machine ( assuming you trust the machine to not have keystroke - loggers and such , but those problems apply even more so to regular password auth )
Implementation
This is just a concept currently , I have n't tried to implement this yet .
The biggest hurdle currently seems like the connection between the webpage and the GPG system .
The most obvious method would be system ( ) calls to the " gpg " binary .
This would be cross-platform and fairly easy to implement , but does raise possible command - injection security problems ( admittedly these are easy to prevent with input- sanitisation ) .
There is a GPG extension for PHP ( called GPGext ) , which would certainly make implementing this far easier , but I always preferred native implementations over extensions that require shared libraries in system folders and such .
There are similar libraries for various other languages commonly used for server - side programming ( Perl / Python / Ruby / etc )
Alternatives
OpenID -
The closest implemented system I am aware of .
It 's a " decentralised identity system " :
It allows you to login to any compatible websites simply by entering an " openID endpoint " , basically a URL .
It 's an interesting system , but it 's uptake is very slow , and very few websites have an OpenID login option ( See the " Where ? " section on the OpenID. net site )
Conclusion
For most sites , this is fairly overkill in terms of security .
For " normal " users it 's complicated - setting up GPG alone is beyond a lot of people .
But , for certain sites ( very technically - oriented sites , like NEVERFEAR ) , where the users are very technically competent , it really becomes a matter of do the users really care enough about their account 's security ?
Taking NEVERFEAR as an example , I 'd imagine , no .
The most a malicious user could achieve would be to make or delete that users posts - something easily undone .
There are two important things when it comes to security systems .
First and most obvious , is the actual security improvements , and second is connivence .
If the security improvements are n't worth the reduced convenience , it 's not going to be popular .
The security improvements are fairly substantial .
SSL for a site like NEVERFEAR is n't practical .
With the GPG login system , SSL would be more or less unnecessary , since no passwords are ever sent , and the " signed - message " used to login is invalid once the user has used it once .
The problem is , are these security improvements worth the hassle of having to use GPG every time they want to login ?
With the regular username / password system , browsers have built - in functionality to remember passwords , so all they have to do is click " Login " .
Compare this to having to copy a string , run the GPG command , enter their GPG pass - phrase , paste the string , copy the output to the page and click " Login " ..
That 's not to say if the method would ever popularised , it could n't be made much easier ( By having it built into the browser , or with browser - extensions ) - but the possibility of that happening is nearly zero , so the benefit of only having the GPG password to remember is no longer valid ( as you still need to remember passwords for every other site on the internet .. )
I may make a test site , to prove the concept , but I do n't see it progressing much more than that .
( PopSci.com ) --
Here we are , nearly eight years into the 21st century , and the most spectacular manned mission NASA can pull off is a trip to the International Space Station , a mere 210 miles above the Earth .
Lack of gravity could make exploring an asteroid tricky .
Even the most ambitious part of NASA 's current plans for human spaceflight involves visiting a celestial body we 've already been to : the moon .
Astronauts , space buffs and an unimpressed public hunger for space exploration that 's more dramatic , more heroic , more new .
Something like , say , landing astronauts on a distant rock hurtling through space at 15 miles per second .
That 's exactly the kind of trip NASA has been studying .
In fact , scientists at the space agency recently determined that a manned mission to a near - Earth asteroid would be possible using technology being developed today .
The mission would n't be easy .
A crew of two or three would spend months riding in a cramped spacecraft before reaching their barren , nearly gravity - free target .
That such a mission is even being considered , though , says a lot about the versatility of NASA 's next fleet of spacecraft and the ambitions the agency has for them .
If nothing else , it 's a signal that space exploration could soon get much more exciting .
This would n't be our first trip to an asteroid .
We 've been visiting them by proxy for years now , using unmanned space probes .
In 2000 NASA 's NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft arrived at 433 Eros , which a century earlier became the first near - Earth asteroid known to man ; five years later , the Japanese Hayabusa probe touched down on asteroid 25143 Itokawa .
Yet unmanned probes have their limitations .
NEAR Shoemaker and Hayabusa gathered a good deal of data , but we still do n't know the exact composition and internal structure of the asteroids they visited .
And although Hayabusa was designed to collect two small samples from Itokawa , it 's doubtful the probe will actually have anything onboard when it returns in 2010 .
Humans , however , could be much more effective .
Unlike robots , we adapt to our environment in real time .
" We spend weeks at a rock with a Mars rover , trying to determine what it is , " says Rob Landis , an engineer at NASA 's Johnson Space Center and one of the co-leaders of the mission feasibility study .
" An astronaut could make that determination in a matter of seconds . "
A human crew could travel across an asteroid more intelligently than a robot , making it easier to deploy scientific instruments , collect samples , and zero in on the areas of greatest interest .
" No doubt , on a human mission we would characterize an asteroid better than we ever have , " says Bruce Betts , director of projects for the Planetary Society .
Plenty of characterization needs to be done .
While most asteroids are a safe distance from Earth ( in an approximately 190 - million - mile - wide expanse between Mars and Jupiter ) , Jupiter 's gravitational tug and , less often , collisions between asteroids can kick these objects into orbits that pass uncomfortably close to Earth .
The 270 - meter - wide asteroid 99942 Apophis , for example , will pass within roughly 24,000 miles of Earth in 2029 , and could come back for a direct hit in 2036 .
And if we 're to have any hope of deflecting asteroids , we need to know a lot more about them than we do now .
First off :
What , exactly , are they made of ?
Measurements taken by Hayabusa indicate that 40 percent of Itokawa 's volume is empty space .
If some asteroids are truly this porous , that 's helpful information for any plan to destroy or deflect an Earth - bound object .
Averting the apocalypse is n't the only reason to study near - Earth asteroids , though .
They could be floating gold mines for future deep - space expeditions .
Preliminary observations suggest that some asteroids are rich in useful minerals and , better yet , frozen water -- the most valuable resource a space traveler could hope to find .
If water could be extracted from asteroids , it could not only be used for drinking , but also broken down into oxygen for breathing and hydrogen for rocket fuel .
" It might be an ultimate way to get to Mars , " Landis says .
Forty - one years ago , a scientist at Northrop ( now Northrop Grumman ) proposed using moon rockets to go to an asteroid .
In some ways , NASA 's latest plan is similar ; it too relies on spacecraft designed for lunar travel -- the vehicles belonging to the Constellation program , which NASA is building to replace the shuttle and then go to the moon and beyond .
But although the hardware is similar , an asteroid mission could n't be more different from a trip to the moon .
Actually , an asteroid mission has one clear advantage :
The virtually negligible gravity at the crew 's destination means they need less fuel to get home .
That lack of gravity , however , means that the first person to reach an asteroid will not take one giant leap for mankind , and he will not drive a dune buggy .
" You 're going to be wearing a backpack and flying around , " says Rusty Schweickart , an Apollo 9 astronaut who is now chairman of the B612 Foundation , whose goal is " to significantly alter the orbit of an asteroid , in a controlled manner , by 2015 . "
Astronauts might explore the asteroid from inside their spacecraft using remotely controlled instruments , or they might anchor their spacecraft to the surface of the asteroid by firing hooks into the object and reeling themselves in .
The biggest logistical hurdle is the sheer distance involved .
It takes a few days to travel the 238,855 miles to the moon , but it will take more than a month to cover the distance of up to 4.5 million miles separating us from just about any asteroid of interest .
The crew of two or three will live in their small quarters for several months .
Psychological experiments and historical precedent show that isolation and boredom can mentally break an otherwise sane person ; NASA will have to find a way to keep an asteroid - bound crew from losing their minds .
It will also have to engineer a means to shelter the astronauts from the intense cosmic radiation found outside the protection of Earth 's magnetic field .
Most ominously , though , there 's this little wrinkle :
If anything goes wrong out there for an asteroid - bound space traveler , there 's almost no chance of rescue .
Which asteroids would we visit ?
" You need an asteroid that 's in an orbit very similar to the orbit of the Earth , " says David Morrison , a senior scientist at the NASA Astrobiology Institute .
" There are n't many , so we would be quite dependent on carrying out a new survey . "
The ideal target asteroid will also be at least a couple hundred meters in diameter , will have a very slow rotation of 10 hours or more , and will have the potential to come too close to Earth for comfort .
Scientists suspect approximately 1,000 asteroids meet these criteria -- but we have yet to find them .
In 2005 , Congress ordered NASA to develop a program to detect , track , catalog , and characterize , by the end of 2020 , 90 percent of all near - Earth objects ( an expanded category that includes comets as well as asteroids ) 140 meters in diameter and larger .
The hitch : Right now , NASA does n't have the budget to get it done by that deadline .
The interplay between Congress and NASA brings up the more terrestrial matter of politics .
The stated goal of President George Bush 's administration is to launch an " extended " moon mission by 2020 and , later , to build a permanent moon base that could function as a springboard for a manned mission to Mars .
That could all change after next year 's election , however .
A new administration could divert money from human space exploration to any number of other projects -- say , satellite - based climate science .
" I do n't think that the Vision " -- the Bush administration 's plan for a new era of human space exploration --" as written today is likely to survive the election , even if a Republican is elected , " says Robert Zubrin , president of the Mars Society .
Then again , some experts believe the Constellation program will move forward no matter who wins in ' 08 ; if it does n't , NASA wo n't have any spacecraft after the shuttle retires .
And although the feasibility study does n't mean we 're headed to an asteroid soon , it does tell us that if we decide to go , we can get there .
So if , say , we find one day that we need to visit 99942 Apophis to find the best way to knock it off a collision course with Earth , or if we need a refueling station for astronauts headed for Mars , we might be in luck .

They pore over the 300 photos and videos in the memory card — which probably was n't exactly legal — landing upon a shot of a bunch of people drunk in a bar , wearing nametags .
Though the names themselves seemed to lead nowhere , a couple clicks up and to the right , a little zoom and voila !
Our heroes could see the bar 's name , written on an awning .
Popping over there , they shook down the bartender for information .
The barman remembered a party and a particular " big tipper " who , fortunately for the couple , worked at another bar .
They met up with her , and it turned out that her sister was amigos with the Australian who lost the camera .
( What kind of amigo , I guess we 'll never know . )
After a few e-mails , the camera is making its way back to the bloke in Australia , who is happy to " know there are some honest people left in the world . " [ SMH ]

MANCHESTER , New Hampshire ( Reuters ) - Democrat Hillary Clinton ’s shocking loss to Barack Obama in Iowa punctured the air of inevitability her U.S. presidential campaign had sought to project and left her in the political fight of her life .

The New York senator and former first lady , 60 , must prove now whether she can get up after taking a punch .
She faces her next test on Tuesday in New Hampshire , where fellow Democrat Obama , 46 , has been threatening her lead in the polls .
Iowa was the first state contest for both the Democratic and Republican party nominations .
The prize is valuable momentum and at least a temporary claim to the front - runner ’s slot in the campaign ending in a November 4 election .
The winner of the November election will succeed George W. Bush as president in January 2009 .
“ I think she ’s in a lot of trouble , ” said Merle Black , a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta .
“ The Clinton campaign has to do a lot of rethinking now , ” he said .
“ They ’re not out of it , and she may be able to recover . ”
Obama , a senator from Illinois who if elected would become America ’s first black president , rode a message of change to win the lion ’s share of Iowa ’s mostly white Democratic voters over Clinton , who finished third , slightly behind former North Carolina Sen .
John Edwards , 54 .
“ Our time for change has come , ” an excited Obama told supporters after his victory became known .
Obama and Clinton have for months been locked in a classic battle in U.S. politics -- Obama ’s promise to change the way Washington works versus the Clinton campaign ’s self - described “ strength and experience . ”
CHANGE VERSUS EXPERIENCE
Obama vowed to open talks with leaders from hostile nations such as Iran , Cuba and Syria .
Clinton and her husband , former President Bill Clinton , tried to raise doubts about Obama ’s experience .
Bill Clinton scoffed at Obama as a risky , inexperienced choice , wondering aloud whether Americans would want to “ roll the dice ” on him .
In Iowa , change appeared to come out on top .
Young people flocked to Obama ’s camp in droves , compared to older Iowans who forged the base of Clinton ’s support .
“ I think Obama was able to generate some excitement about his candidacy that Clinton could just not generate and Obama ’s sort of promise of something different was a little bit better than Clinton ’s focus on experience , ” said Peverille Squire , a political science professor at the University of Iowa .
New Hampshire will be critical for Clinton , and comparisons are inevitable to her and her husband , who finished second in New Hampshire in 1992 and declared himself the “ Comeback Kid ” after intense negative publicity about his marital infidelity and his military draft record .
The Clinton campaign , which has a strong national organization and is well - funded , tried to maintain a stiff upper lip and seemed eager to move on to other states .
“ This race begins tonight and ends when Democrats throughout America have their say , ” Clinton campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle said in a statement .
“ Our campaign was built for a marathon and we have the resources to run a national race in the weeks ahead . ”
Edwards vowed to fight on despite finishing second -- sandwiched between Obama and Clinton -- in a state in which he has spent years wooing supporters .

Here 's a story that illustrates just one reason why it 's only a matter of time before driving with a cell phone jammed in your ear will be as illegal as driving with a beer can stuck to your lips .
It 's an intersection I 've passed through every day for years on my way home .
And , it 's that familiarity first and foremost that gets credit for me being here in one piece to type these words .
( Well , that and a local police officer . )
Shortly after exiting the parking lot onto Rte. 9 eastbound , I scoot over into the high - speed lane so as to join the left - hand - turn queue to reverse direction onto Rte. 9 westbound .
This queue was judged a low priority by traffic engineers and can become crowded , meaning two or three lengthy light cycles worth of wait .
So , when you 're under the yellow , there 's a temptation to goose it and get through there .
Pushing the yellow is a temptation I 've learned to resist , however , thanks in part to the helpful intervention of the Southborough Police Department ( whose officer was kind enough to let me off with a warning ) .
I 've also seen ample evidence of why the SPD does n't want people tempting fate there .
On the day of our tale , I find myself pulling up short at the stale end of yellow and then idling first in line to make the U - turn .
East - west traffic goes first and seemingly forever , which is only proper given that Rte. 9 is a heavily traveled thoroughfare thick with office buildings , car dealerships and strip malls .
Next up is traffic exiting the side street from my left , some turning right , harmlessly , and others crossing Rte. 9 into the eastbound lane .
These folks , too , pose no worry to me because I 'm not going anywhere anytime soon .
( It 's worth noting that I 'm driving a Toyota Corolla ; a fine automobile for commuting , but not exactly Hummer - like in terms of its ability to absorb a blow , should it come to that . )
Once the drivers to my left have had their turn , it 's time for those patiently waiting on the side street over to the right to have a go at it .
And , remember , they 've been queued up there since the leaves were green , so they 're itching to move .
Some turn right onto Rte. 9 eastbound , showing me nothing more dangerous than their tail lights ; others are headed west , which brings them directly in front of and across the grill of my idling Corolla .
Zip , zip , zip , zip ...
My foot is aching off the brake and inching closer to the gas with each passing car .
After all , my 5 o'clock shadow has hit 6 since joining this queue and like everyone else on the road at this hour I just want to get home .
The left - hand turn arrow finally pops green , which I know from experience means only one thing :
Wait . ...
And then wait some more .
At least one of those zip - zip - zippers will be saying to heck with the yellow - just - turned - red light and goose it to get through there .
Two is more likely .
Three not unprecedented .
On this day , my foot moves to the gas after the third red - light ignoramus clears my idling car , but , as noted above , I know better than to presume anything .
Out of the corner of my eye , I spy No. 4 just in time to hit the brake and the horn simultaneously .
The guy does n't slow down at all .
Nor does he so much as flinch at the sound of my horn ( granted , it 's a Toyota horn ) .
And the reason is obvious :
The clown has a cell phone stuck in his ear , lips moving as fast as his car .
I blast the horn again .
Nothing .
No what 's - your - problem glare ; no extended middle finger .
...
Being a grownup , I let him go .
But I got to thinking about what had just happened .
Had it been someone with less local knowledge sitting where I was at the front of that queue - say an out - of - towner or a teen - ager - there 's absolutely zero doubt that a major collision would have occurred .
The only thing that 's unclear to me is whether Mr. Phone - in - his - Ear would have taken notice of the impact long enough to stop yapping .
And that 's why driving under the influence of a cell phone cannot be outlawed soon enough to satisfy me .
( Update :
These phone - obsessed asshats cause traffic jams , too . )
Pentagon to ask for an extra $ 42bn for wars
The US defence secretary , Robert Gates , will today ask Congress to approve nearly $ 190bn ( £ 95 bn ) for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2008 , increasing initial projections by more than a third .
In remarks prepared for a Senate hearing , Mr Gates says the extra money is necessary to buy vehicles that can protect troops against roadside bombs , refurbish equipment worn down by combat and consolidate US bases in Iraq .
A copy of the remarks was obtained by the Associated Press .
In prepared testimony , Mr Gates said , " I know that Iraq and other difficult choices America faces in the war on terror will continue to be a source of friction within the Congress , between the Congress and the president and in the wider public debate . "
" Considering this , I would like to close with a word about something I know we can all agree on - the honour , courage and great sense of duty we have witnessed in our troops since September 11 . "
In February , George Bush requested $ 141.7bn ( £ 78.5 bn ) for the wars .
Officials said at the time the figure was only a rough estimate and could climb .
In July , the defence department asked Congress for another $ 5.3 bn ( £ 2.65 bn ) to buy 1,500 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected ( MRAP ) vehicles .
Mr Gates says another $ 42bn ( £ 21 bn ) is needed to cover additional requirements .
The extra money includes :
· $ 11bn ( £ 5.5 bn ) to field another 7,000 MRAP vehicles in addition to the 8,000 already planned .
· $ 9bn ( £ 4.5 bn ) to reconstitute equipment and technology .
· $ 6bn ( £ 3 bn ) for training and equipment of troops .
· $ 1bn ( £ 500 m ) to improve US facilities in the region and consolidate bases in Iraq .
· $ 1bn ( £ 500 m ) to train and equip Iraqi security forces .
( CNN ) -- Phoenix police were investigating Sunday how a 45 - year - old woman died over the weekend while in police custody at Phoenix 's Sky Harbor International Airport .
Carol Ann Gotbaum , in an undated family photo , may have accidentally strangled herself while in custody .
Carol Ann Gotbaum may have accidentally strangled herself while trying to get out of her handcuffs , Phoenix Police Department spokesman Sgt. Andy Hill said Saturday .
" According to investigators , it appeared as though Ms. Gotbaum had possibly tried to manipulate the handcuffs from behind her to the front , got tangled up in the process , and they ended up around her neck area , " he said .
Witnesses told police that Gotbaum was " yelling and screaming " and running through the terminal Friday .
She was arrested for disorderly conduct .
While handcuffed , the New Yorker became " disruptive " and she was taken to a holding room , where she was left alone , Hill told CNN affiliate KTVK .
Investigators said officers went to check on her five to 10 minutes later .
Police policy requires that be done every 15 minutes .
Finding Gotbaum " unconscious and not breathing , " Hill said , officers performed CPR .
" Sometime during the time she went into custody , she went into medical distress , " he said .
Gotbaum was the mother of three young children and the daughter - in - law of longtime New York City Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum .
Betsy Gotbaum called Carol Ann Gotbaum " a wonderful , wonderful person " and a great mother .
She said the family was dealing with the situation " the best way we can . "
A spokeswoman for the Maricopa County medical examiner said an autopsy would be conducted Monday morning .

The Scene You Hate
A friend , having read my last post , asked if The Queen really objects to botanical inaccuracies in movies .
Oh yes , yes indeed .
And not just in motion pictures , either .
If I 'd known , in advance , that the TV show LOST would feature a bunch of people on a tropical island populated with temperate foliage , I never would have put it in my Netflix queue .
Of course , I 'm just as bad when something I 'm passionate about is misrepresented on film .
Like games , for instance .
I still break into hives whenever I think of the scene in Freaks and Geeks where the parents play the card game Pit , just the two of them .
But my all - time least favorite scene -- one that appears in about every third film , seemingly -- has to be this one :
The hero and the antagonist are playing chess , a game in which both are virtual grandmasters .
It 's a close fought match , and they banter while they play .
Slowly , their moves -- and their conversation - - become more aggressive .
Eventually they are openly hostile to one another , both on the board and off .
Then , victory .
Smirking , the villain says something irrefutable to the hero , moves a bishop , and announces check .
For a long moment the two men lock eyes .
Suddenly , the hero utters a devastating riposte , breaks eye contact just long enough to capture the bishop with his queen , and , with the slightest hint of a smile , declares checkmate .
He rises from his chair and walks briskly away , leaving the loser to gawps at the board in amazement .
Yes , I understand that one grandmaster saying " I 'm going to checkmate you in seven moves " followed by 23 straight minutes of the opponent staring at the board before replying , " ah , you are right - - good game " lacks some of the " pizzazz " of the Hollywood version .
But I still would rather sit through both episodes of Viva Laughlin , back - to - back , than endure this scene again .
What 's the scene you hate ?
Who has the right to probe digital crime ?
That very question may be the next battleground between the flatfooted private detective of old and the new - age computer sleuth .
The Internet is boundless and cybercrime scenes stretch from personal desktops across the fiber networks that circle the globe .
Digital forensic investigators like Harold Phipps , vice president of industry relations at Norcross Group in Norcross , Ga. , routinely slip across conventional geographic jurisdictions in pursuit of digital evidence and wrongdoers .
Lawmakers across the Savannah River in Columbia , S.C. , have different ideas , however .
Under pending legislation in South Carolina , digital forensic evidence gathered for use in a court in that state must be collected by a person with a PI license or through a PI licensed agency .
If the law passes , the highly specialized task of probing deep into computer hard drives , network and server logs for telltale signs of hacking and data theft would land in the hands of the same people who advertise in the Yellow Pages for surveillance on cheating spouses , workers ' compensation fraud and missing persons .
Otherwise , digital evidence collected by unlicensed practitioners could be excluded from criminal and civil court cases .
Worse yet , those caught practicing without a license could face criminal prosecution .
" It 's an ambush , " says Phipps , a 31 - year FBI veteran now with Norcross Group , a digital e-discovery business .
" Under the South Carolina statute , only a handful of licensed PIs across that state have the years of information system and tools experience needed to do true digital forensics with repeatable processes of documentation and chain of custody .
This is the only group that stands to gain . "
South Carolina is n't alone in considering regulating digital forensics and restricting the practice to licensed PIs .
Georgia , New York , Nevada , North Carolina , Texas , Virginia and Washington are some of the states going after digital forensic experts operating in their states without a PI license .
Tools and training for digital forensics have existed for years , but the process of forensics remains a relative unknown art among the information security profession .
It 's a growing field , though , given the ever - increasing amount of cybercrime , identity theft , data leakage and regulatory landscape around data protection .
Digital forensic specialists perform critical tasks ranging from identifying sources of data compromises and holes in security infrastructure , to collecting evidence for employee disciplinary actions , to testifying in criminal prosecutions .
FORUM DISCUSSION : Should states mandate licenses for forensics pros ?
Tell us what you think at ITLink .
With much of today 's evidence lingering on computers and handhelds , PIs see this is as a lucrative field to pursue , even if they lack the requisite experience , contend digital forensic experts like John Mellon , founder of the International Society of Forensic Computer Examiners ( ISFCE ) based in Brentwood , Tenn .
IT professionals also feel that putting forensics into the hands of what are mostly inexperienced , one - off divorce and surveillance PIs will ultimately bring the evolving , highly specialized field to its knees .
All but six states have PI licensing laws on the books , according to Jimmie Mesis , publisher of PI Magazine , 32 of which could be interpreted to include digital forensic investigators .
While their languages differ , these licensing laws essentially consider a PI to be anybody engaging in the business of securing evidence to be used in criminal or civil proceedings .
" In April [ 2007 ] , the state attorney general opined that even if you never set foot in South Carolina , if you 're collecting evidence to be used in court here , you still need a South Carolina [ PI ] license , " says Steve Abrams , a licensed independent PI and computer forensic examiner based in Sullivans Island , S.C. " Licensing authorities in New York , Pennsylvania , Texas and Oregon have opined the same way . "
As one of eight permanent members of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division Private Investigations Business Advisory Committee , Abrams is a key promoter and developer of the South Carolina PI licensing legislation .
He is also one of a handful of state professionals Phipps refers to who can successfully dovetail digital and conventional PI skills into a single business .
In addition to legal and computer programming background , Abrams has PI licenses in South Carolina and New York , and he 's looking into getting a license in Utah .
The state PI measures are not meant to be punitive against ethical , skilled forensic professionals working on behalf of their corporations , Abrams contends .
Rather , they are being established to protect and preserve the integrity of evidence .
Abrams ' concerns about digital evidence integrity are not unfounded .
Defense attorneys have used lapses in the chain of custody of evidence , poorly documented evidence collection techniques and lack of credibility of forensic investigators as means to have evidence thrown out of court cases .
Conversely , computer security specialists have quietly complained that prosecutors and government investigators particularly the FBI rely heavily on the naivety of defendants and their attorneys in computer - related cases .
In some cases , an attorney does n't know enough to challenge the validity of digital evidence presented by the state .
" The problems in South Carolina occur when folks from national [ law ] firms come into South Carolina , seize digital evidence , have that evidence analyzed in a lab in some other state , and then send it back to South Carolina for litigation , " Abrams says .
" The state has no mechanism to hold them accountable if they screw up , which I see all the time in cases . "

Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison when asked about Bush 's performance : ' That 's not a fair question ' Nick Langewis and Mike Aivaz
Published : Saturday October 27 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - TX ) appeared with Bill Maher to discuss her new book , Leading Ladies , and field questions about her agenda .
" It got a little more news than I thought it really should , " Hutchison says of her decision not to seek another term in 2012 .
The Senator declines Maher 's enthusiastic invitation to " let it all out , " even on late - night HBO , given her situation , though she does discuss a recent poll that showed a drop in " favorable " views of Republicans by Independents .
" I think , " Hutchison says , " any time you have troops in harm 's way -- it 's a tough time in our country , and we do -- we 're in a war , and I think that this is a tough time for Republicans .
There 's no question about it . "
" We lost the House and Senate majority last year , " she continues , " so how could we not think that this is a period of retrenchment ? "
" But usually , " rebuts Maher , " war makes people rally around the people in power . "
" I think , " replies Hutchison , " that , like Vietnam , and like this war on terror , there are a lot of people who disagree with either -- that we are in war , or the way it 's being handled , and I think , obviously , people have a right to disagree .
But , we do have troops in harm 's way .
It is a very tough time in our country . "
The Senator touts the GOP 's desire to " do the right thing , " using methods such as low taxes , lowering deficits , and " reforming " Social Security .
" You like her , do n't you , " Maher asks Hutchison about colleague and Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton .
" Personally , we do get along , " says Hutchison , with a segue into her chapter on first ladies in her book .
Maher then asks the Senator who she thinks is the better president between Bill Clinton and George W. Bush .
" Well , that 's not a fair question , as you know , " responds Hutchison .
Her rationale is that it's not a fair question because she 's a Republican .
Maher does agree with President Bush on immigration , calling him unusually reasonable on that issue in particular .
" Do you think it 's becuase he had a maid who was really nice to him as a kid , or ...? "
" He is a very compassionate person , " responds the Senator to jeers from the audience , " and he really does believe , in his heart , that we should do the right thing . "
The entire exchange , as broadcast on HBO 's Real Time with Bill Maher on October 26 , 2007 , can be viewed below .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Growth in the U.S. economy slowed abruptly in the fourth quarter as consumers curbed spending and home building plunged , according to a government report on Wednesday that kept fears of recession alive .
U.S. growth skidded lower in the fourth quarter and was the weakest in five years for all of 2007 , according to a government report on Wednesday that highlighted the toll an enfeebled housing sector has taken on the national economy .
REUTERS / Graphics
The Commerce Department said gross domestic product , a measure of total goods and services output within U.S. borders , grew at an annual rate of 0.6 percent in the last quarter of 2007 , while it expanded 2.2 percent over the whole year , the slowest pace in five years .
“ No question , the GDP number tells us the economy is on the brink of recession , if not in one already , ” said Peter Boockvar , an equity strategist with Miller Tabak & Co. in New York .
A private sector report showing employers added three times as many jobs as expected in January lifted some of the gloom surrounding the growth figures .
ADP Employer Services said U.S. private employers added 130,000 jobs in January .
That led some analysts to boost forecasts for the number of new jobs in January , which the Labor Department will announce on Friday in its closely watched report on U.S. hiring .
There have been other reassuring hints recently of resilience in the economy , including robust orders for manufactured goods in December and lower weekly claims for jobless benefits .
That did not stop the U.S. Federal Reserve from cutting its benchmark federal funds rate by one - half percentage point to 3 percent , citing a deepening of the housing slump and some softening in labor markets .
U.S. stocks rallied after the cut in benchmark U.S. short - term interest rates -- the second in just over a week -- but quickly shed the gains after a CNBC television report that said two big bond insurers faced possible ratings downgrades .
The Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq Composite Index each ended modestly lower .
Bonds were mixed , with shorter maturities rising in price after the latest
Fed rate cut , while 30 - year bonds declined because of investor concern that inflation risks were rising .
MOMENTUM WANING
Some economists noted that the GDP report indicated a disconcerting rise in prices , but the Fed said it expected inflation to moderate in the coming quarters .
That would give the U.S. central bank more leeway to cut rates even further .
The White House said the GDP report did not change its economic outlook and officials cited the slowdown as a reason to urgently pass a fiscal stimulus package that is waiting for Congressional approval .
“ We ’re not happy with 0.6 percent growth , ” Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said in a telephone interview .
“ This is why we need to get that stimulus package out the door as soon as possible and get checks into the hands of consumers as soon as possible . ”
The U.S. House of Representatives has approved measures worth about $ 146 billion , but the White House is squabbling with the Senate over lawmakers ’ calls for a more substantial boost including extended unemployment insurance benefits .
The chairman of the Joint Economic Committee , New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer , took up the cudgels for swift action on a bigger stimulus :
“ When quarterly economic growth slows to 0.6 percent , alarm bells should be going off urging Washington to give the economy a good shot in the arm . ”
RATE DISAPPOINTS
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast that fourth - quarter GDP would grow at a 1.2 percent rate -- twice as fast as it did .
Lackluster fourth - quarter performance followed a booming third quarter when GDP surged at a 4.9 percent rate .
A downward spiral in the housing sector took a heavy toll on growth in late 2007 and that drag is likely to continue .
Spending on building new homes plunged 23.9 percent in the fourth quarter , the biggest quarterly drop in 26 years , after falling 20.5 percent in the third quarter .
Over the course of the full year , residential spending fell 16.9 percent , the worst annual performance since 1982 .
While applications for U.S. home mortgages jumped to a four - year high last week -- normally a sign of housing - industry vigor -- it was mainly because people were refinancing existing mortgages , the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday .
The GDP report also showed prices were bubbling higher , as a gauge favored by the Fed , the index of personal consumption spending excluding food and energy items , rose at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter , well ahead of the third quarter ’s 2 percent increase and Wall Street expectations .
One factor that slowed fourth - quarter GDP was a decision by businesses to sell off inventories .
The report said the shift from an inventory build - up to a draw - down cut more than a full percentage point from growth .
Consumer spending , which fuels more than two - thirds of U.S. economic growth , slowed in the fourth quarter to a 2 percent annual rate compared with 2.8 percent in the third quarter .
Growth in consumer spending for 2007 was the softest since 2003 , a further indication that a weakening housing market is putting a strain on household finances and confidence .
New rules could make it easier for police to stop and search suspects
It comes as Tory leader David Cameron urged greater use of stop and search to combat gun and knife crime .
The two leaders clashed earlier in the Commons with Mr Cameron urging Mr Brown to scrap forms officers must fill in when they stop someone .
Mr Brown said the Flanagan Report on the issue will be published next week .
Labour has been locked in a war of words with the Conservatives over stop and search , with the two parties promoting apparently similar policies .
In the Commons , Mr Cameron challenged Mr Brown to scrap the " stop and account " forms officers must fill in when they stop someone , which he said were a " colossal waste of police time " .
Young black and British Asian kids ... are being stabbed and shot and the rules are getting in the way of protecting them
David Cameron
Conservative leader
How much red tape is there ?
Mr Brown told him to wait for the publication of the Flanagan report next Monday , adding : " We are taking the action that is necessary and you should be supporting us . "
In an interim report published last year , Sir Ronnie Flanagan , the chief inspector of constabulary in England and Wales , said police were bogged down in red tape and afraid to use their own judgement .
In a separate move , Home Secretary Jacqui Smith is expected to announce in the next few days that more police officers will be given the power to search people without giving a reason , the BBC understands .
Police ' racism '
The powers - which have been trialled in four pilot areas - will be limited to a 24 hour period within specific area where there is reason to believe serious crime is being committed .
Mr Cameron told the BBC he would back such a move - and he dismissed claims that it would harm community relations .
Mr Cameron said the rules had been brought in to protect black and Asian communities from racist police officers but were now harming the communities they were meant to help .
It 's one thing to cut down on bureaucracy - quite another to use powers as a blunt instrument which alienates more young people than it protects

Under
Tory proposals , police sergeants would be able to authorise the use of stop and search of pedestrians and vehicles in a specific area for up to six hours - or 48 hours if permission is granted by a senior officer .
Mr Cameron said concern about a return to " sus " laws - one of the factors behind inner city riots in the early 1980s - were misplaced and the police were no longer racist .
" We need to make sure the police behave properly but I think there is a big change in policing since the 1980s and they understand concerns about racism , concerns about targeting particular groups , " Mr Cameron told BBC News .
He said black and Asian communities would have to accept more stop and search but that it was necessary to combat the growth of violent crime in those communities .
" It may mean more stopping and searching - it should mean more stopping and searching - but I think that has to happen , " added Mr Cameron .
Government figures suggest black people are six times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people , while Asians are almost twice as likely .
Laws ' must go '
Speaking earlier , in an interview with The Sun , Mr Cameron said : " Stop and search rules were put in place to protect young black and Asian British kids .
" Now it 's the young black and British Asian kids that are being stabbed and shot and the rules are getting in the way of protecting them . "
He said a Conservative government would need to work out whether the rules on " reasonable suspicion " should be scrapped altogether or replaced with the " say - so of an inspector or sergeant or lower " .
" But those current laws , be in no doubt , have to go . "
He added : " This is not about race .
It 's about stopping crime and reducing the number of victims of crime .
" The statistics are undeniable and it 's clear by carrying out more stop and searches it is the black and Asian communities who will benefit most . "
Director of human rights group Liberty , Shami Chakrabarti , said : " We look forward to Sir Ronnie 's detailed report and less political bluster on stop and search .
" It 's one thing to cut down on bureaucracy - quite another to use powers as a blunt instrument which alienates more young people than it protects . "
Lib Dem Home Affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said he backed more intelligence - led stop and search but would resist Tory and Labour efforts to scrap data gathering .
" The police need good relations with all our communities .
Stop and search is currently used six times as much with ethnic minorities .
" That is why records must be kept and reviewed , and why we will resist any Tory or Labour attempts to remove these safeguards . "
Australia 's lungfish is the world 's most primitive ( Image : Helena Bailes )
The first creature to crawl out of the water probably had a technicolour view of the land , say Australian researchers .
Professor Shaun Collin and colleagues at the University of Queensland report their findings today in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology Seeing in colour is an advantage for animals as they can differentiate between prey , he says .
The researchers have been studying the retina of the Australian lungfish ( ) , a living fossil that dates back 400 million years .
These fish were hanging around in shallow waters just before the first land vertebrates evolved .
Lungfish have lungs and gills so can survive in and out of water .
And many scientists believe they are the closest living relative to the first land vertebrates .
But amphibian , reptile , bird and mammal land vertebrates see in colour , and until recently scientists did n't know much about the lungfish 's small eyes .
The researchers sequenced the gene responsible for opsin , the visual pigment in the photoreceptor cells of the lungfish retina .
They found all five photoreceptor genes that occur in various combinations in higher vertebrates .
These genes code for rods and cones , which enable the lungfish to see ultraviolet and visible light , both of which are useful in seeing prey .
The photoreceptors also allow the fish to see in dim and bright light .
" It 's really hedging its bets between bright light and dim light and it's able to see quite clearly in both environments , " says Collin .
This is proving an advantage today , he says , because the rivers lungfish live in now tend to be quite murky from run-off .
The researchers now plan to see if lungfish can discriminate between objects based on colour .
This will include testing to see if males and females recognise each other by the colour of their underbelly .
Birds and reptiles have retained all five photoreceptors present in lungfish .
But humans have lost two , including the cone that allows ultraviolet vision .

We would .

If former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee ends up winning the Republican nomination for president , much of the credit could be laid at the doorstep of Alex and Brett Harris , a pair of homeschooled evangelical twin teen prodigies in a suburb south of Portland , Oregon .
The 19 - year - old twins are the co-founders , along with 62 - year - old Kentucky volunteer Bill Goins , of Hucksarmy.com , an until - recently under - the - radar national grassroots effort that is growing into a powerful component of Huckabee 's support network .
It was an e-mail blast from the twins and their volunteer colleagues that won Huckabee the endorsement of roundhouse - kicking GOP celeb Chuck Norris – and the teen activists are building a highly organized national army of ground troops to support their candidate .
" It 's a bit of an outgrowth of the Rebelution.com , our other project , " Alex says .
" We call it a teenage rebellion against low expectations – what we 're doing for Huckabee is a little bit of the same rebellion against low expectations . "
The effort could turn out to be crucial for Huckabee 's campaign as it expands its territory ; it has n't had the finances to build its own official campaign infrastructure throughout the 24 states holding primaries on Feb .
5 . Hucks Army is also notable for the demographic of its leaders , who can speak the language of a voting block crucial to their candidate .
Young voters turned out in record numbers in both Iowa and New Hampshire .
More important for Huckabee , who won his party 's nomination caucus in Iowa , was that 60 percent of the Republicans who turned up to caucus were evangelicals .
South Carolina is also expected to be a bonanza state for the candidate because of its evangelical population .
The Harris brothers got started with online organizing in 2005 with Therebelution.com , a burgeoning Christian youth conference , blog and book - selling business .
The boys define the term as " a teenage rebellion against low expectations of an ungodly culture . "
Their message : Young people should reject the idea that their teen years are meant for goofing off , and instead find challenges to work on .
Their book Do Hard Things , which grew out of a blog post on the subject , will be published in April .
Hucksarmy.com uses Meetup to organize group meetings , but that 's where the resemblance to 2004 's coffee - and - croissants netroots ends .
The Harris brothers and their campaign managers are building a national team with specific responsibilities .
For example , there 's a point person for almost all 50 states , and special " liaisons " on each of the popular social - networking sites .
The twins and their 28 - year - old volunteer campaign manager , Jimmy Morris , who lives in the small town of Joplin , Missouri , meet nightly via conference call to strategize and to share ideas that have bubbled up through regional Meetup groups during the day .
The site is also a nerve center through which resources and ideas can flow almost instantaneously .
A last - minute Monday rally for Mike Huckabee in Warren , Michigan , for example , was scheduled on Sunday night .
Jeffrey Quesnelle , who heads the Michigan battalion of Hucks Army , sent an e-mail out to 200 members , and some 500 people showed up to meet the candidate , he says .
Quesnelle , a Catholic 20 - year - old software engineer in Sterling Heights , Michigan , says that the group coordinates with the Huckabee campaign to target messages to specific voters , like white , under - 30 evangelical Christian women .
" If we had every evangelical vote , statistically speaking , we 'd win , " Quesnelle says .
For Tuesday 's Michigan primary , Hucksarmy.com helped provide Huckabee supporters with campaign materials .
Quesnelle says he wrangled 500 promotional Mike Huckabee buttons from a button maker in New Hampshire , 400 rally signs from a supporter in Virginia and 600 bumper stickers " from a lady in Little Rock , Arkansas . "
For their part , the Harris twins plan on launching a revamped version of their site on Friday – a day before the South Carolina primary .
New features will include a live 24 - hour online support person , who will answer visitors ' questions about Huckabee , and rapidly updated online video feeds of Huckabee 's television appearances .
" We 're going to have a team that TiVos his appearances and have the fastest response of anyone online , " Alex says .
The Harris twins ' project is an online manifestation of what historically has been a very tight - knit community of social conservatives , who traditionally kept a low , but powerful , profile in national politics , says David All , a political technology and communications consultant and founder of the online Republican PAC Slatecard .
" They 've been social networking without the proper tools for years , " All says .
" And now they 're using some of that well - organized online elbow grease to help forward their cause . "
For their part , the Harris brothers credit a higher power for their success .
" If we did n't think there was a higher standard , we would n't be interested in writing , " Alex says .
" Ultimately , it 's in vain if God 's not involved in it – the reason we 're doing it is because we see God behind it . "
TED is a global community , welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world .
We believe passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes , lives and , ultimately , the world .
On TED.com , we 're building a clearinghouse of free knowledge from the world 's most inspired thinkers — and a community of curious souls to engage with ideas and each other , both online and at TED and TEDx events around the world , all year long .
In fact , everything we do — from our Conferences to our TED Talks to the projects sparked by The Audacious Project , from the global TEDx and TED Translators communities to the TED - Ed lesson series — is driven by this goal :
How can we best spread great ideas ?
TED is owned by a nonprofit , nonpartisan foundation .
Our agenda is to make great ideas accessible and spark conversation .
The first step in untangling religious absurdities is to recognize that the arguments for the existence of God depend on the definition of God .
Who or what is God ?
Some authors write that He is ineffable or define Him in some idiosyncratic manner as synonymous with nature or with the laws of physics or in an indeterminate number of other ways .
Most conventional monotheistic characterizations of God ( Yahweh , Allah ) , however , take Him to be an entity or being that is , if not omnipotent , at least extraordinarily powerful ; if not omniscient , at least surpassingly wise ; if not the Creator of the universe , at least intimately connected with its origin ; if not completely and absolutely perfect , at least possessor of all manner of positive characteristics .
This formulation will , on the whole , be my definition of God , and the many flawed arguments for this entity 's existence will be my primary focus .
Different traditions adorn
Him with different narratives and attributes , but I 'll discuss neither these nor the broader cultures and attitudes associated with specific religions .
An atheist I 'll take to be someone who believes that such an entity does not exist , and an agnostic I 'll take to be someone who believes that whether God exists or not is either unknown , unknowable , or a meaningless question .
( I wo n't discuss complex intermediate cases , represented in my mind by a friend who professes to being an atheist but , when asked why he adheres strictly to religious rituals , replies , " Because God commands it . " )
Contrary to some , I think it 's certainly possible to be both an atheist and an agnostic .
Think , for example , of the innumerable historical figures or events in whose existence or occurrence we do n't believe , but about whose existence and occurrence we 're not absolutely sure .
The definitions of these terms are , of course , sensitive to the definition of God to which one subscribes .
Define God in a sufficiently nebulous way as beauty , love , mysterious complexity , or the ethereal taste of strawberry shortcake , and most atheists become theists .
Still , although one can pose as Humpty Dumpty and aver , " When I use a word , it means just what I choose it to mean , neither more nor less , " others need n't play along .
One question people interested in the matters discussed in this book often have is whether , despite my present views , I ever had or perhaps somehow still have a formal religion .
There is , of course , a significant difference between the formal religion one is born into or with which one is otherwise associated and one 's true beliefs .
There are many paths to an irreligious outlook , my own , as I 've indicated above , being somewhat straightforward .
I simply never had a religious phase .
As a consequence , I am not now renouncing a faith I once had , and this book is n't intended as a sort of Epistle of Paulos the Apostate to the Theologians .
Although raised in a nominally Christian home ( my grandparents emigrated from Greece ) and ensconced now in a secular Jewish family , I never found either religion 's doctrines intellectually or emotionally palatable , much less compelling .
This is not to say that I do n't value at least parts of some religious traditions , ideals , and festivals ( ranging from Passover to Thailand 's Loy Krathong ) .
Nor is it to say I do n't acknowledge that there have been untold people who have selflessly served others in the name of their God .
Nor is it to say that I do n't recognize that many intelligent people are religious .
I mean merely to say that I am and always have been an atheist / agnostic and will herein attempt to explain why perhaps you should be , too .
Let me end these preliminaries by noting that although a nonbeliever , I 've always wondered about the possibility of a basic proto-religion acceptable to atheists and agnostics .
By this I mean a " religion " that has no dogma , no narratives , and no existence claims and yet still acknowledges the essential awe and wonder of the world and perhaps affords as well an iota of serenity .
The best I 've been able to come up with is the " Yeah - ist " religion , whose response to the intricacy , beauty , and mystery of the world is a simple affirmation and acceptance , " Yeah , " and whose only prayer is the one word " Yeah . "
This minimalist " Yeah - ist " religion is consistent with more complex religions ( but not with the " Nah " religion ) and with an irreligious ethics and a liberating , self - mediated stance toward life and its stories .
Furthermore , it conforms nicely with a scientific perspective and with the idea that the certainty of uncertainty is the only kind of certainty we can expect .
So , Yeah , let 's move on to the arguments for God 's existence .
( Continues ... )

In her 2004 book Bushworld : Enter at Your Own Risk , stubbornly irreverent New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd recalled in her introduction that " Poppy " Bush , ( Bush ’ 41 ) was rather uncomfortable with Ms. Dowd in her role during the first Bush administration as the Times ’
White House correspondent .
" Poppy Bush had been expecting a traditional pin-striped Times correspondent , one with a name like Chatsworth Farnsworth III , who would scribble about ’ 41 leading the Atlantic alliance , " Dowd observed .
Not only the New York Times , but the whole media establishment has too many aspiring Chatsworth Farnsworths , with or without Roman numerals , who are all too eager to discover the next world leader of grand ambition and global " vision . "
We would be better served if they would just stand back and report and comment on how the American people choose the president of the United States .
Where have you gone , Theodore H. White ?
The Anything But Candid ( ABC ) television network and cable channel Fox News this week announced plans to limit the number of candidates participating in this weekend ’s televised debates — ABC ’s on Saturday night and the Fox News event on Sunday night .
This is , for the benefit of that portion of the rest of the civilized world that may not have been paying attention , the weekend immediately preceding next Tuesday ’s New Hampshire primary elections .
ABC had a number of criteria for winnowing the field based on standing in the polls , money raised and how they fared in the Iowa caucuses .
Fox had already made its decision for its Republican debate and U.S. Reps .
Ron Paul of Texas and Duncan Hunter of California did n’t make the cut .
That means the Fox debate will include the Big Three — Romney , McCain , Giuliani — whom former candidate Tommy Thompson called by one name : " Rudy McRomney . "
And Gov. Huckabee will be both seen and heard by the national TV audience , unless he has lost another 100 pounds by then and has become invisible .
And former Tennessee Senator and Law and Order star Fred Thomson will be included and will no doubt lead a nationwide TV audience to the dramatic discovery of the missing smoking gun , or " mushroom - shaped cloud " that justified the war in Iraq .
Duncan Hunter wo n’t get to talk about his fence to keep the illegal immigrants out .
And without Ron Paul , there wo n’t be single voice in the Republican debate raised against our continued participation in the great neo-nuthouse Bush War II in Iraq that Paul has always opposed , still opposes and would end soon after he enters the White House .
At that time , Fox News may fall on its propagandistic sword and stop covering the White House , though there may be occasional mention of rumors of an alleged White House somewhere in Washington , DC .
Perhaps there will even be rumors of a Washington , D.C.
Who needs a real president , White House or capital , anyway ?
Who needs a real debate ?
Fox News creates its own reality .
Indeed , that is what many , if not most , of the columnists , commentators and alleged reporters in Chatsworth Nation wish to do .
They like to create our reality for us .
They will tell us who the candidates and what the issues are , thank you .
A caller on a talk show here in New Hampshire made the point that it was not so much an issue of who gets left out of the debates , but what is being left out .
Neither Paul ’s argument against the war in Iraq nor his call for abolition of the Federal Reserve will be heard by the Fox News audience .
Nor will Dennis Kucinich ’s plan for universal health care be heard on ABC .
The marketplace of ideas that should be part of a presidential debate has been shrunk by the imperial edict of the Chatsworth Caesars of the Fourth Estate .
Listening to that very insightful argument , I did n’t think it had much impact on the two professors who were guests on the program , one from the University of New Hampshire , the other from Harvard .
Both offered tepid defenses of the ABC ’s and Fox ’s fiats .
Neither , I suspect , gives a cat ’s keyster or a rat ’s rear end about " the marketplace of ideas . "
Neither , I am certain , do the two major political parties .
And neither does the " mainstream media " which is so much and so often in bed with the political establishment that they are no doubt breaking laws against incest and fornication in every state in the union .
Is it a coincidence that the establishment , kennel - fed media want to keep out pretty much the same people that the political establishment wants to keep out — the Pauls and the Kuciniches and the Hunters , the bulls in a political china shop , who are n’t afraid of breaking a few political icons ?
That gives the " mainstream media " or Nuthouse News , Inc. , more time to dote on the stars and amplify their messages for them .
We hear , for example , that voters in New Hampshire or Iowa , are being asked to compare Hillary Clinton ’s " experience " versus Barack Obama ’s promise of change .
What we do n’t hear much of is the substance , or lack of it , in the change Obama promises .
And we seldom hear the journalistic gatekeepers of the political conversation challenge Clinton ’s claim of experience .
The cartoonists do a better job — especially the one who depicted Sen .
Clinton in an operating room advising a patient not to worry : " I ’m not a surgeon , but I was married to one for eight years . "
I recently heard one of the talking heads on the radio refer offhandedly to Sen.
Clinton ’s " sensible foreign policy . "
Really ?
On what , I wonder , is that glib assumption based ?
Her cop -out , pass the buck vote in October of 2002 to authorize the Great Decider to unilaterally decide whether or not he would take this nation to war in Iraq — when it was all too obvious he would ?
Someone should have brought Senator Clinton and each of her colleagues who voted as she did a bowl of water so each could ritually wash his or her hands in the tradition of Pontius Pilate .
That is what the " mudstream " media is inclined to call a " sensible foreign policy . "
Go along to get along .
Follow the conventional wisdom , defined so well by Joe Sobran as , " what everybody thinks everybody else thinks . "
People like Paul or Kucinich , who opposed our war of aggression in Iraq from the beginning and have consistently opposed the funding of it , are usually labeled , " controversial " at best and " extremist " and " isolationist " at worst .
Last year , PBS correspondent Bill Moyers produced a documentary called Buying the War , showing how the major news media swallowed the lies , half - truths and deceptions that somehow convinced most of the nation ( if the polls were to be believed ) that Iraq was a serious threat to the United States .
Did the establishment media " buy " the war ?
Or was the media " bought " by the war ’s proponents ?
At the end of last week , Fergus Cullen , chairman of New Hampshire ’s Republican State Committee , was still trying to convince Fox News , with whom the state GOP is co-sponsor of the debate , to relent and let the banned candidates participate .
My suggestion to Mr. Cullen was that he announce the New Hampshire Republican Party has withdrawn its sponsorship , leaving Fox to either go it alone or find another sponsor .
For the sake of candor , I recommend that Fox sponsor this debate as a joint venture with the American Kennel Club .
That , or something like that , is where I would assume the political establishment finds the accommodating Chatsworth Farnsworths of the Fourth Estate .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday defended his party ’s landslide election victory as a big personal endorsement , but foreign monitors said the poll was unfair and the West pressed for an inquiry .
Putin , who ran as his party ’s top candidate in Sunday ’s vote , has vowed to use United Russia ’s victory to keep a hold over Russian politics after stepping down next year .
European states and the United States demanded Russia investigate claims of abuses while opposition parties said the vote had been marred by cheating to favor Putin ’s party , which won 64.1 percent of votes with most ballots counted .
But the Kremlin chief dismissed concerns , saying the United Russia party ’s victory was a “ legitimate ” vote of public trust .
“ The choice has been made and I of course would like to address my special thanks to those who voted for United Russia , ” Putin said .
“ I headed the party list of this party and this is of course a sign of trust , including for United Russia . ”
United Russia , which will take a large majority of the 450 - seat lower house of parliament , presented the vote as a referendum of support for the Kremlin chief , who must leave office next May after a March 2 presidential election .
Allegations of vote - rigging and fraud alarmed the European Union , which said free speech had been violated in the run-up to the vote , and the United States , which urged a probe .
Investors said the result was broadly positive but said they were waiting for any clues about the biggest question in Russian politics : who will Putin endorse in March elections and how the former KGB spy will preserve influence after stepping down .
Putin ’s party won nearly six times as many as the nearest challenger , the Communist party , whose leader said the vote was marred by “ outrageous violations ” and vowed to challenge the results in court .
The Communists won 11.6 percent of the vote .
The nationalist LDPR party and another pro-Kremlin party , headed by a Putin ally , took another 16 percent of the vote .
Smaller free - market and liberal parties won no seats .
Russian officials were jubilant .
“ This is the result we were promised last Friday , ” laughed one government figure .
WESTERN CONCERNS
The concerns of foul play could tarnish relations between Russia and Western nations , which Putin warned in the campaign to keep their “ snotty noses ” out of Russian affairs .
“ Reports from Russia include that there were allegations of Election Day violations , and we have urged the Russians to look into those , ” White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
“ It is vital that the Russian Central Election Commission urgently investigates all allegations of electoral abuses , ” Britain ’s foreign ministry said .
Observers from the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) described the election as “ not fair ” in a statement , saying it “ failed to meet many ... commitments and standards for democratic elections ” .
Europe ’s main ODIHR election watchdog decided not to monitor the election , citing obstruction by Russian authorities .
Opposition parties said one - sided press coverage , heavy use of government resources to campaign for pro-Kremlin parties , and irregularities in voting skewed the outcome .
The Communists , the liberal Union of Right Forces and opposition icon Garry Kasparov have all described the election , in separate comments , as the “ dirtiest in Russian history ” .
The head of Russia ’s Election Commission , Vladimir Churov , a former colleague of Putin , dismissed the allegations of fraud .
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the vote had been democratic and said it would mean Putin ’s policies will continue to be implemented after leaving office .
“ He has got support for the continuation of his course ( and ) he wants all his projects to be continued , ” Peskov told reporters .
Projections by the Electoral Commission showed pro-Kremlin parties would win about 393 of the 450 seats in the next State Duma , the lower house of parliament .
That would be more than enough to allow them to change the constitution if they wished , one way which some Putin supporters have suggested would allow the Kremlin chief to remain in command of Russia .
Putin has been careful to give few clues about how power will be handed over to the victor of March elections , provoking intense speculation by investors who have invested billions of dollars since he was first elected in March 2000 .
Opinion polls show Putin , a 55 - year - old former KGB agent , is extremely popular after eight years in power .
Voters credit him with restoring stability and national pride and like his tough nationalism and criticism of the West .

Here are a few concurrency tricks if you 're stuck using threads .
I used these tricks years ago to write a Swing application in Jython , and I found them to be helpful enough to warrant a blog post , albeit a few years delayed .
First , let 's suppose you have a UI and you want to talk to an external program written in another language that might occasionally block .
Use the main thread for the UI and use a separate thread to coordinate with the external program .
In general , most things that might block should have their own thread .
Name your threads .
It 's likely that certain code should only be run by the UI thread and vice versa .
At the top of each method , do an assertion on the thread name .
Avoid sharing data .
Sharing data involves mutexes , etc. which is generally painful and easy to mess up .
Instead , constrain each bit of data to a single thread .
If you need to interact with that data from another thread , " ask the other thread for help " .
The way I like to do this is to use the queue module which takes care of its own locking .
You can pass requests from one thread to another via a queue .
In some cases , I even found it helpful to pass a callback on the queue .
That 's like saying , " Call this callback , but do it from your own thread . "
Much of this approach now falls under the label of " actors " .
An actor is the combination of an input queue , a thread , and an object .
I like to think of them as " living objects that you talk to asynchronously . "
However , even years before I had heard the term actor or knew how to code in Erlang , these tricks were still useful .

Another Republican elected official -- a pal of David Diapers Vitter no less -- caught toe - tappin ' in the boys room !
And he wants wanted to be a state senator too !
Yesterday 's Times - Picayune painted another dismal picture of another Republican pervert who trawls from public restroom to public restroom looking for ... love ?
Well , looking for something .
Joey DiFatta is the chairman of St. Bernard Parish Council and a prominent Republican leader ( until 2004 on the GOP state party Executive Committee ) .
He just withdrew from his state senate race , after his arrests for lewd behavior in a public restroom were made public .

From the Times - Picayune article it appears DiFatta may have been Larry " Super Tuber " Craig 's mentor :
The report said DiFatta slid his foot into the deputy 's stall and tapped the deputy 's foot .
In the report , Conley noted that such activity is common among men to indicate a willingness to participate in sex .
The deputy inside the stall , Detective Wayne Couvillion , responded by tapping his foot , and DiFatta reached under the partition and began to rub the deputy 's leg , the report states .
The detective asked DiFatta , " What do you want ? " according to the report , and he replied , " I want to play with you . "
Illinois blogger Archpundit has what seems to me to be a useful roundup of the links between Barack Obama and Tony Rezko .
The essence of the matter is that there does n't seem to have been any quid to go with the pro quo here .
Rezko tried to curry favor with politicians in order to get stuff from them , and Obama was no exception .
And , indeed , when one of Rezko 's business partners had a son who wanted an internship in Obama 's office , Rezko wrote a letter of recommendation and the kid got the job .
It 's possible that had Obama remained in the Senate and had Rezko not gotten indicted , that he would have found occasion to do some more serious favors but in the real world there 's nothing there .
Basically , as with Obama 's questionable record on coal I 'm not particularly impressed .
But it is true that , to an unusual degree , Obama 's campaign has tried to portray their man as a living saint of some kind when , in reality , he 's a normal pol who stands up for home - state industries and gives internships to buddies of sons of campaign contributors .
On the other hand , what makes this sort of line of attack curious to me is that if there 's one thing we absolutely know for sure about the Clintons it 's that if you 're inclined to make mountains out of molehills there are tons and tons of thin ethical charges you can make against them .

This morning , the last defendant in the Michael Vick dogfighting case was sentenced , and the gag order on the case lifted .
Now , for the first time , the public can meet the dogs seized from the fighting ring .
In a first for dogfighting cases , the court allowed the seized dogs to be evaluated by dog experts , rather than euthanizing them .
An ASPCA - led team found that of 49 dogs , just one needed to be put down for aggression .
Teaching the dogs that people are okay
Twenty - two of the dogs did so well the team recommended they go to foster homes for training and observation , and then be considered for adoption .
These dogs are now under the care of pit bull - savvy rescue groups across the country where they ’ll undergo training and observation for six months to a year , and adjust to life as a family dog .
“ We ’ve got a lot of work to do to teach these dogs that the world is safe , and the people in it are good , ” says Donna Reynolds , co-founder of Oakland , California - based BAD RAP , one of the rescue groups involved .
“ We knew there were dogs in that yard who’d be fine in the outside world , and sure enough they did n’t disappoint . ”
( See more on BAD RAP in Fighting for the Underdog . )
BAD RAP and Oakland Animal Services announced today the creation of a new animal welfare program , called Code 597 .
“ Abuse and neglect of animals is an everyday occurrence here in Oakland , ” says Oakland Animal Services ( OAS ) Director Adam Parascandola .
“ The program will provide assistance to Oakland citizens to help them be more responsible and humane guardians of their animals . ”
Lifelong sanctuary
The rest of the dogs are divided between six other rescue groups and the Best Friends Animal Society , a large sanctuary in Kanab , Utah .
In addition to funding the fighting ring , Vick , age 27 , confessed to playing an active role in hanging , drowning , and electrocuting some of the pit bulls kept on his 15 - acre property in southeastern Virginia .
In December , he was sentenced to 23 months in prison .

Flynt : Hustler involved in more than 20 sex scandal investigations
Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday July 11 , 2007 Print This Email This
Hustler publisher Larry Flynt said Wednesday that investigators working for the magazine are involved in more than 20 investigations relating to his recent call for information on Washington sex scandals .
The investigations include " high ranking Republican and Democrat members of the Senate and the House , " Flynt said at a press conference in Los Angeles , in which RAW STORY participated via conference call .
" We 've got some really good information here , " he said .
Sen. David Vitter , R - La. , revealed Monday night that he had been a client of alleged " DC Madam " Deborah Jean Palfrey after reporters working for Hustler called him about the allegations .
" If somebody 's living a lie ... they become fair game , " Flynt said , referring to Vitter 's " family values " stances and opposition to same - sex marriage .
Flynt said his investigations were not meant to be witch - hunts against frisky members of Congress -- " I do n't care what their sex life involves , " he said -- rather the goal is exposing hypocrisy .
" Unfortunately we have too many of these guys in Congress , and I 'm going to do my part to get them out , " Flynt told reporters , adding that he does n't mind spending his own money to do so .
An ad that ran in the Washington Post last month offered $ 1 million from Flynt for information about people who had an illicit affair with elected officials .
Flynt said Wednesday he paid $ 150,000 to run the full - page advertisement .
The exposure of Vitter came from Flynt 's cooperation with Palfrey in securing a complete list of her phone records , not in response to the Post ad , Flynt said .
Referring to his past court battles over indecency charges , the hardcore magazine publisher said the government " did everything it could for 15 years " to put him behind bars .
" This is payback time , " he said .
" And payback 's a bitch . "

It 's one explanation for the big gap between the final polls and the result :
The term Bradley effect or Wilder effect refers to a phenomenon which has led to inaccurate voter opinion polls in some American political campaigns between a white candidate and a non-white candidate .
Specifically , there have been instances in which statistically significant numbers of white voters tell pollsters in advance of an election that they are either genuinely undecided , or likely to vote for the non-white candidate , but those voters exhibit a different behavior when actually casting their ballots .
White voters who said that they were undecided break in statistically large numbers toward the white candidate , and many of the white voters who said that they were likely to vote for the black candidate ultimately cast their ballot for the white candidate .
This reluctance to give accurate polling answers has sometimes extended to post-election exit polls as well .
Researchers who have studied the issue theorize that some white voters give inaccurate responses to polling questions because of a fear that they might appear to others to be racially prejudiced .
Some research has suggested that the race of the pollster conducting the interview may factor into that concern .
At least one prominent researcher has suggested that with regard to pre-election polls , the discrepancy can be traced in part by the polls ' failure to account for general conservative political leanings among late - deciding voters .
Tonight is the first primary - not a caucus .
People get to vote in a secret ballot - not in front of their largely liberal peers , as in Iowa .
They may have told the pollsters one thing about voting for a black man , but in the privacy of the voting booth , something else happens .
I do n't have any hard evidence for this , but the discrepancy in the polls is remarkable .
David Kuo cites it .
The vast discrepancy between the last polls and the result puts it on the table .
I hope it 's not true .
But it could be .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Why The Economic Crisis Has To Become ' The ' Political Issue for 2008
Barrack Obama 's Iowa win has forcefully put the words hope and change on the national media agenda .
His dynamic personality and uber - organized charismatic campaign galvanized attention and support even as his positions on issues seemed less clear .
The primary marathon continues with a retinue of pollsters and pundits trailing behind a diminishing number of candidates .
They never lack in inane commentary or a barrel full of predictions that are rarely as accurate despite sounding so authoritative .
But there 's another barrel to consider that 's a lot less fun .
It wo n't take us over the falls but , in fact , may lead us to a fall .
That 's the rise in the price for a barrel of oil and a set of deep economic pressures that will affect the country , the world , and every political race as unemployment goes up along with rising prices .
So far , none of the debates are focusing on solutions for the growing squeeze .
It 's easier to denounce immigrants or even corporations in the abstract .
The business press is now debating when the recession will hit , or whether or not we are already in one .
The optimism one sensed on the night Barrack 's last name was spelled BAM in the headlines is slowing giving way to trepidation that any new Administration will have to revive an economy that may , before November , be on the ropes .
There is a reason that American Dialect magazine chose " subprime " as 2007 's Word of the Year . "
Bear in mind that for the first seven months last year , the problem was downplayed , ignored , and minimized .
It was only when the markets melted down in late July that the press and the pols took note .
Even then , there was denial - and in our media and political discourse , there still is among those who have yet to feel the sting .
There may be a reason for that too because most of the progressive world has been more engaged with the war than issues of economic justice so there has been little activist pressure on most politician .
Except for a speech here or a policy paper , economic issues are not on the top of their lists .
Bear in mind also that main industries still funding our political races are - surprise , surprise - real estate , finance and insurance .
So even as the media reports on inflation and foreclosures , they often do so as , the International Herald Tribute put it , " with a " bad news is good news scenario . "
The paper quotes a Bear Stearns executive with comparing the current U.S. housing crisis to a recent natural disaster .
" Areas like Florida and Las Vegas are devastated , " he said .
" It is like Hurricane Katrina . "
And , like refugees of that whirlwind of destruction , the subprime victims will simply pick up stakes and make new lives elsewhere : " People will move out to areas like Alabama and Idaho , where there are jobs and there is growth and there is not enough housing .
So they will build more and that will add to economic growth . "
This naive silver [ lining thinking is riddled with illusions .
Avinash Persaud , chairman of Capital Intelligence , an investment advisory firm in London calls the housing bust is a catastrophe .
" American consumer boom was financed with real - estate debt : Americans have spent 130 percent of their income over the past five years .
" They borrowed money against their property , " he said .
And now as a many as 2.6 million families face foreclosure , that 's going , going , gone .
Many advocates are up in arms .
Jesse Jackson , now holding a Wall Street Summit in New York is leading a national movement calling for the jailing of " subcrime " white collar criminals .
He is planning a march on the Federal Housing Administration at HUD in Washington on January 22 , the day of the State of the Union address and the day after the Martin Luther King holiday .
He told the Summit that Dr. King , on his birthday in 1968 - the year he died - was planning a new March on Washington for Economic Justice .
He is demanding government action to " restructure loans , not repossess homes . "
Others present like Congressman John Conyers plans to pressure the Justice Department for action while Congresswoman Sheila Jackson - Lee , ( who appears in my film In Debt We Trust ) is organizing town hall meetings .
Lisa Madigan , the Attorney General of Illinois described her investigation into discriminatory and predatory lending practices by Countrywide .
David Patterson , the Lieutenant Governor of New York called for an investigation into the failure of regulators and the Federal Reserve Bank .
John Taylor , CEO of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition denounced rapacious " greed " and revealed that former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is now saying that the federal government has to act with a major financial intervention .
Jackson quipped , " why was n't he saying that when he helped cause these problems ? "
Housing is not the only crisis .
Credit card balances are at a record high along with interest rates and fees .
There are growing defaults on car and student loans .
This will get worse with more job losses and less access to credit .
When you read the press outside the US , there is even more alarm .
The Telegraph , a conservative newspaper in London reports :
" As the credit paralysis stretches through its fifth month , a chorus of economists has begun to warn that the world 's central banks are fighting the wrong war , and perhaps risk a policy error of epochal proportions . "
" The central banks are trying to dissociate financial problems from the real economy .
They are pushing the world nearer and nearer to the edge of depression .
We hope they will eventually be dragged kicking and screaming to do enough , but time is running out . "
- Bernard Connolly , global strategist at Banque AIG .
" The kind of upheaval observed in the international money markets over the past few months has never been witnessed in history , " says Thomas Jordan , a Swiss central bank governor . "
" Where will it end ?
A fresh study by Morgan Stanley warns that the big banks face a further $ 200 billion of defaults in commercial property .
On it goes . "
On it goes , true , but , its not an issue that 's going on TV much herem or being raised in political debates .
That 's why activism is needed .
We need a national organizing and education effort .
We need to be reminded of Dr King 's phrase : " The urgency of now . "

RIO GRANDE CITY , Texas ( Reuters ) - Mauro Morales has chickens in his yard , deer antlers hanging from the fence and a shed full of peyote behind his house .
Peyote buttons are shown in the yard of Mauro Morales on October 12 , 2007 in Rio Grande , Texas .
Morales is one of three people licensed to sell the hallucinogenic cactus peyote in the United States , and advertises his business on a sign posted outside his home in the U.S. - Mexico border town .
REUTERS / Jeff Franks
A slight , balding man in his 60s , Morales is one of just three “ peyoteros ” in the country licensed by the government to sell the small green cactus that contains the hallucinogen mescaline .
His profession is an old one that used to be more common along the Rio Grande , the only place where peyote grows in the United States .
Now it is threatened by the forces of modernity .
His customers are the 250,000 to 400,000 members of the Native American Church , the only people in the United States for whom peyote is legal .
The government warily allows them to buy it because it has been part of indigenous religious ceremonies for centuries .
The church members think the visions that peyote produces provide enlightenment and that the cactus has curative powers .
They reverently call it “ the medicine . ”
Morales has never tried peyote because it would be illegal for him to do so .
He does not want to risk losing his peyote license , for which the main requirement is that he be law - abiding .
“ You have to make sure you do n’t have a problem with the law , you know ? ” he said in a recent interview .
In the 1970s , Texas licensed as many as 27 peyote dealers .
There were supposedly many more before peyote was outlawed in 1967 .
One of Morales ’ fellow peyoteros also lives in Rio Grande City , the other 70 miles north in Mirando City .
The profession seems barely legal in a nation perennially at war with drugs , but in the peyote region there is nothing clandestine about it .
Morales has a big sign out in front of his modest home that proclaims “ Mauro Morales -- Peyote Dealer , Buy or Sell Peyote . ”
It includes his phone number should any prospective customers pass by .
“ It ’s a business , ” he said with a shrug of the shoulders in a recent interview .
“ It ’s the only income I got . ”
It is not a bad business , either .
State figures for 2006 show the peyoteros sold a combined 1.6 million peyote “ buttons ” -- the term for the harvested cactus -- for a total of
$ 463,000 .
But records also show volume has declined steadily from mid-1990s peaks of around 2.3 million buttons .
“ NOT LIKE IT USED TO BE ”
Several factors have contributed to the peyoteros ’ dwindling number , but the main one is the growing scarcity of peyote .
“ There ’s still some peyote out there , but not like there used to be .
It ’s getting kind of scary now , ” said Morales above the crowing of a rooster from the roof of his shed .
He has had his peyotero license for 16 years , and before that worked as a picker , walking the arid brush country of southern Texas with a machete in hand and lopping off the top of the cactus when he found it .
It used to be easy -- peyote was plentiful and landowners were happy to let peyoteros harvest the cactus for a small fee .
But urban development and widespread “ root plowing , ” which scrapes natural vegetation off the land to replace it with grass for cattle grazing , destroyed many of the peyote fields that once sprawled along the U.S. - Mexico border .
And more and more peyote land is off - limits because it is being bought by rich Texans who turn it into hunting preserves , said Martin Terry , a biology professor at Sul Ross State University in Alpine , Texas .
They have no need for the few hundred dollars the peyoteros offer to pick over their land and often view them suspiciously , said Terry , who has helped start the Cactus Conservation Institute to protect peyote .
He estimates that peyote ’s natural range in Texas covers about 800 square miles , but much less is open to the peyoteros .
The result , said Terry , is that the slow - growing cactus is overharvested and the quality and quantity of peyote available for sale is declining .
“ We ’ve got a serious case of overgrazing by human herbivores , to put it in biological terms , ” he said .
Peyote also grows across northern Mexico , which has prompted suggestions that native Americans be allowed to get it there as Texas peyote becomes scarcer .
But Terry believes the wisest thing would be for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to allow what it currently does not : greenhouse cultivation of peyote .
That would save the cactus , but likely make the peyoteros extinct .
Morales said his pickers cut the peyote in a way that allows the plant to grow back .
He grabs a machete and slides the blade horizontally along the ground to show the technique .
“ It comes back , but it grows slow , ” he said .
“ It ’s hard to get enough medicine . ”

I wanted to add some more thoughts to Sam ’s excellent estimation of the end of John Edwards ’ campaign .
I ’ve pretty much been deep in the tank for Edwards since his awe - inspiring “ Two Americas ” speech in 2004 , so to see and hear him bow out today was a grand disappointment .
But even as he did so , I looked back and considered what brought him–and those of us who stood with him–to this point .
Edwards did not fit the assumed narrative the media wanted to run with in this campaign –he was the outsider , the guy who was n’t campaigning on experience or the audacity of hope .
Moreover , he was speaking painful truths about class , corporatism , and how our lives are dictated and controlled by the power elite .
So the media machine cranked up the distortion and tried to smear him into oblivion with stupid trivialities .
Yet , through all that , his message perservered .
But his campaign did not .
I honestly think it was because he focused so much on the dark , broken side of American life that people were frightened away .
As I said to a friend of mine yesterday , the difference between Edwards and Obama is that the former inspires you to fight , while the latter inspires you to hope .
And people would much rather hope than fight .
This is not to say that hope is bad , but merely that Obama ’s tremendous success has come from merging much of Edwards ’ populist message with his own , more positive rhetoric .
In fact , everyone from Clinton to Romney has tried to appeal to the little guy as a result of how sharply and starkly Edwards brought populist issues into the debate .
Their results have been , shall we say , mixed at best .
He was n’t a perfect candidate–indeed , he was wrong on a great many things , from Iraq to the bankruptcy bill to his lack of clear support for gay rights .
As Denny astutely noted , he is just as good at playing the money game as anyone else , and his rhetorical flourishes about helping people out of poverty did n’t always have substance .
But seriously –can you remember ANY other candidate even mentioning the devastation from Katrina that still plagues the Gulf Coast today ?
Or any of the so - called “ leading ” candidates promising to get us out of Iraq as soon as possible ?
Edwards made people stand up and remember that we owe it to ourselves to help our fellow man–our fellow American–make this country great again , in every way .
The value of John Edwards to the 2008 election was about more than simply reducing him to the surface values , as people have tried to do with Obama and Clinton .
John Edwards was the messenger , the Cassandra , the man who would say the things others would n’t , and would speak painful truths , even when it meant admitting his own failures .
John Edwards may not have been able to translate his message into votes , but his message DID reach those who wanted to listen , and in turn , those who needed to hear .
As Edwards himself reminds us today :
I began my presidential campaign here to remind the country that we , as citizens and as a government , have a moral responsibility to each other , and what we do together matters .
We must do better , if we want to live up to the great promise of this country that we all love so much .
It is appropriate that I come here today .
It ’s time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path .
We do not know who will take the final steps to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , but what we do know is that our Democratic Party will make history .
We will be strong , we will be unified , and with our convictions and a little backbone we will take back the White House in November and we ’ll create hope and opportunity for this country .
Indeed we will .
And we will owe much of our success to John Edwards , who may not have made it to the Promised Land , but assured through his efforts that we will get there .
Wondering what happened to all the lead - tainted products that have been recalled recently ?
One company that recalled 350,000 lead - tainted journals and bookmarks plans to burn them in an incinerator .
In the meantime , it is storing the hazardous parts in 55 - gallon drums near its headquarters .
Toy makers are investigating whether they need to treat their tainted products with stabilization chemicals or if they must seal the toys in giant polyethylene bags .
Mattel has decided to recycle some of its recalled toys into items like park benches  after it fights pending litigation .
In China , meanwhile , several of Mattel ’s recalled toys can still be found on store shelves .
A few toys have even shown up on eBay and on Web sites that sell products in bulk .
And some children ’s jewelry , heavily laden with lead , may be legally shipped to other countries for resale .
But that ’s only counting what is actually returned .
Most of the unsafe toys and other products , it turns out , may still be in the hands of consumers .
Since the news broke about former White House press secretary Scott McClellan ’s new book , there has been a curious lack of commentary on the topic in certain mainstream U.S. news outlets and only a vague official reaction from the White House .
Meanwhile , McClellan ’s publisher is attempting to do some damage control with regard to what the author ( who apparently has n’t finished the book yet ) actually says about President Bush in “ What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and What ’s Wrong With Washington . ”
Also , the BBC reported Valerie Plame ’s reaction to McClellan ’s story on Wednesday .
Tasteless 9/11 Google Hack
On september 11th 2007 , at 2:16 am EST , I noticed somebody had very tastelessly hacked google .
The student loan interest rate will officially jump on Monday from 3.4 % to 6.8 % .
While this is bad news for those taking out new loans , it could have been worse .
One measure suggested tying student loan interest rates to the market , which could result in a student loan interest rate as high as 8.5 % at times .
Still , the new interest rate means students will be paying much more over the life of their loans , especially if they opt for extended repayment plans .

It 's no secret that advertising of all kinds is moving online in the form of banner , text , and even video ads .
The industry is booming , so it should come as no surprise that as election season draws near , political ads are moving online too .
This presents a new challenge to publishers and ad networks trying to sort out their relationships with those ads — for the most part , everyone 's interested in being as fair as possible .
For example , last August , we posted about our own policy on accepting political ads on Ars ( that is , we 'll accept them from all legitimate candidates no matter who we like ) .
This is a continually evolving issue , and now two major figures have weighed in .
Google is the first , and has recently posted its own policy on running political ads through its AdSense network .
As Peter Greenberger of Google 's Elections and Issue Advocacy Team noted on the company 's public policy blog , the new policy boils down to five main points .
First , each ad must meet the same editorial guidelines as every other AdSense ad .
This includes not violating anyone else 's copyrights , not promoting " unacceptable alcohol products , " not promoting violence against anyone , not promoting counterfeit goods , and the like .
Second , Google agrees to promote ads for all candidates fairly regardless of political views or affiliation .
The fourth point ( we 'll get to the third in a second ) says that if the ad is soliciting for donations , the ad's landing page must clearly state that they wo n't be tax - deductible .
And finally , the fifth point says that misleading ads wo n't be allowed .
The text of the ad must be descriptive of the candidate or clause , and can't trick people into clicking ( by , say , claiming to be an ad for the opposing candidate ) .
The third point reads , " No attacks on an individual 's personal life . "
Google says that a general disagreement with a candidate 's policies and overall party is fine , but that running an ad that attacks someone 's non-politically - related actions wo n't be allowed .
" So , ' Crime rates are up under Police Commissioner Gordon ' is okay , but ' Police Commissioner Gordon had an affair ' is not , " wrote Greenberger .
It 's the third point that some critics disagree with .
Former publisher and current ad network exec John Battelle wrote on his blog that he 's glad to see Google 's transparency when it comes to political ads , but that the " no attacks on personal life " rule only aids in American politics continuing to move towards " whitewashing and dishonesty . "
Because a personal attack can fall into such a gray area ( just ask our feisty forum members ) , Battelle feels that a policy against false statements would be much more useful .
( It should be noted that Ars Technica uses both Battelle 's Federated Media and Google 's AdSense to support our site . )
" [ I ] n my mind , accuracy is far more important in public debate than some subjective sense of what constitutes a personal attack , " he wrote .
" Sure , scandalous stuff is often scurrilous , but the first amendment is clear on speech : all speech , in particular , all public speech , must be allowed , so that the real truth can be assessed by an informed public .
We do n't need Google , or anyone else , sanitizing it for us . "
The online world went through a phase in 2005 when it was sorting out what , exactly , constitutes online political advertising .
These days , the industry is now making an attempt to self - regulate in the interest of being as fair as possible , but it has led to a disagreement over what type of ads to allow .
The new Google policy certainly wo n't put an end to that debate any time soon ; in fact , given the company 's online advertising reach , making itself a gatekeeper in this way will probably just stir up even more controversy .
Finding a black hole is an easy task … compared with searching for a wormhole .
Suspected black holes have a massive gravitational effect on planets , stars and even galaxies , generating radiation , producing jets and accretion disks .
Black holes will even bend light through gravitational lensing .
Now , try finding a wormhole …
Any ideas ?
Well , a Russian researcher thinks he has found an answer , but a highly sensitive radio telescope plus a truckload of patience ( I ’d imagine ) is needed to find a special wormhole signature …
Wormholes are a valid consequence of Einstein ’s general relativity view on the universe .
A wormhole , in theory , acts as a shortcut or tunnel through space and time .
There are several versions on the same theme ( i.e. wormholes may link different universes ; they may link the two separate locations in the same universe ; they may even link black and white holes together ) , but the physics is similar , wormholes create a link two locations in space - time , bypassing normal three dimensional travel through space .
Also , it is theorized , that matter can travel through some wormholes fuelling sci-fi stories like in the film Stargate or Star Trek : Deep Space Nine .
If wormholes do exist however , it is highly unlikely that you ’ll find a handy key to open the mouth of a wormhole in your back yard , they are likely to be very elusive and you ’ll probably need some specialist equipment to travel through them ( although this will be virtually impossible ) .
Alexander Shatskiy , from the Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow , has an idea how these wormholes may be observed .
For a start , they can be distinguished from black holes , as wormhole mouths do not have an event horizon .
Secondly , if matter could possibly travel through wormholes , light certainly can , but the light emitted will have a characteristic angular intensity distribution .
If we were viewing a wormhole ’s mouth , we would be witness to a circle , resembling a bubble , with intense light radiating from the inside “ rim ” .
Looking toward the center , we would notice the light sharply dim .
At the center we would notice no light , but we would see right through the mouth of the wormhole and see stars ( from our side of the universe ) shining straight through .
For the possibility to observe the wormhole mouth , sufficiently advanced radio interferometers would be required to look deep into the extreme environments of galactic cores to distinguish this exotic cosmic ghost from its black hole counterpart .
However , just because wormholes are possible does not mean they do exist .
They could simply be the mathematical leftovers of general relativity .
And even if they do exist , they are likely to be highly unstable , so any possibility of traveling through time and space will be short lived .
Besides , the radiation passing through will be extremely blueshifted , so expect to burn up very quickly .
Do n’t pack your bags quite yet …

I 've been so busy during my stay here in San Francisco that I have n't had the time to post much - less even go online , other than to upload pictures to Flickr .
I 've been leaving the house around 8 am in the morning and getting back at around the same time the next day .
I did however get to visit a ton of companies and startups in the area .
As for how I got into all these places , either I knew a friend or Mike Malone did at each place .
I posted a few pictures from each place but if you want to see them all , visit my Flickr set .
I 'm in SF for WordCamp , which is going on right in front of me now .
Digg

Mike and I met up with Digg / Pownce designer Daniel Burka on Tuesday .
Great guy , great companies .
Flickr was among the most lively places .
Cubicles are only half height and in the " bullpen " format , which facilitates fun activities such as shooting finger rockets across the room and faceball I went back to Yahoo !
to visit with friends from my internship last year and friends currently working there .
An internal hack day had just begun when I got there .
Mint is a cutting - edge , pre-launch finance web app startup in Mountain View .
Flock is the social web browser I have talked about several times before .
They 're within a block of Mint HQ and near Meebo HQ .
I visited Facebook on Wednesday when they announced their purchase of Parakey , a web OS startup by two of the Firefox guys , so it was understandably very busy and active .
The environment is amazing and has a huge number of people that appear to be under 30 if not mostly under 25 .
Definitely a place I might consider working in the future .
Google had a strict policy about photos and makes visitors sign an NDA , so I could only snap a few pics outside .
The free lunch was great though .
There are many cafes in different buildings with a variety of foods .
And of course it would n't be San Francisco without some fancy cars , such as this 440,000 Porsche Carrera GT .
update : I forgot about OpenDNS .
" The Taliban are not the only component of Afghanistan 's insurgency .
There is factional fighting in parts of the country , insecurity caused by drug traffickers and those fighting because they have been intimidated or paid to do so ...
They all form important elements of this insurgency .
the Taliban are no longer a single group , one single entity .
The Taliban , at first , were students -- Afghan students who traditionally wanted to study theology .
In the beginning , they were a group of Afghans who had very good intentions after five years of anarchy in Afghanistan -- they just wanted to bring peace to Afghanistan .
They were very popular .
Then this movement was somehow hijacked by Pakistani intelligence services and by international terrorist groups .
Now when we talk about the Taliban , we are talking about a kind of amalgam of different forces , such as people who are unhappy about government forces because they can't find their place in the present confederation of Afghan policies ; people who are committed to other interests -- foreign interests , mainly from the Pakistani circle ; and there are people with the fundamentalist ideology of the international Islamic movements .
" The Taliban " is a composite of these components .
Afghanistan : The Mirage of Peace
civil war
good work
that
The one - word answer supplied in most news reports to this question is , of course , " Taliban " .
It would be astonishing if this was all there was to it , so occasionally we get the admission that it includes other elements .
For example , a UNAMA spokesperson says
There is , of course , a way to put this that saves the basic underlying claim that anyone resisting the occupiers , in military or other ways , must have obscure and disreputable motives .
The occupiers are innocent , everyone else is guilty until proven innocent .
USA Today put it thus last year : " The insurgency is a loose alliance of Taliban guerrillas , followers of former prime minister and fundamentalist warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , al - Qaeda terrorists recruited from across the Islamic world , opium traffickers and local fighters whose murky motives are rooted in tribal politics . "
Pro-occupation think - tanks like the Senlis Council and the International Crisis Group advise the occupiers to meet the grievances of the local population , who can thus be won away from supporting the insurgency .
The Senlis Council 's report , focusing on Helmand , Kandahar and Nangarhar , describes a number of reasons why local populations are increasingly turning toward support for the insurgency , and thus putting local politicians under pressure to support it as well , and the main one is Dyncorp 's destruction of the opium farms of the poor ( those belonging to the wealthy warlords are left well alone ) .
Senlis has advocated legalising opium production for medicinal purposes
There is a misperception that opium production is especially controlled by the Taliban .
It is true that the biggest increase in product lately has been in Helmand - taking it to almost 70,000 hectares .
But across the country , according to the UNODC , total production last year was 165,000 hectares .
In those areas controlled by US - allied warlords , and for Afghanistan 's wealthy landlords more generally , opium production is a vital component of their continued control .
Various commentators have suggested legalising opium production rather than destroying livelihoods , but this sort of misses the point : keeping it illegal makes it an excellent source of funds for covert action , and right now it is providing America 's allies in Afghanistan with enormous leverage over the country .
In other words , the current war to secure a successful client regime relies on extirpating production that could generate revenue for the opposition , while leaving the resources of the ruling elite well alone .
Indeed , billions of US dollars have been ploughed through the channels of a patrimonial state into the hands of the pro-American rentier elite .
The " war on drugs " is what it has always been : a free - form , wide - ranging counterinsurgency campaign ; meanwhile , the insurgency has , as a result of this , an element of class warfare , since what is now fuelling it , in part , is the misery of poor farmers being deprived of their means of livelihood , with massive starvation and misery , while the rich prosper
So , then , perhaps we should also ask a question about who exactly the Taliban are .
For , although we assume we know , Najib Manalai , an Afghan government adviser , insists that the Taliban are a very different kind of movement today :
There is a great deal of euphemism in that .
Afghanistan 's current polity is a sectarian one , which largely excludes Pashtuns ( Karzai is in this respect a useful token ) .
Recall that the initial success against the Taliban involved the ethnic cleansing of some 50,000 Pashtuns .
But this sectarian dynamic is in part a result of the failure of the US to win Pashtun allies prior to the war beginning .
They had tried with Abdul Haq , the anti-Taliban ' moderate ' who had broken with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar 's Hizb e-Islami before fighting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan under the CIA - funded Yunus Khalis .
But he would n't follow orders and publicly criticised the bombing of the country .
It was his aim to mobilise a domestic insurgency independently of the CIA and the ISI .
One or the other of these two agencies leaked his plans to the Taliban during the bombing and ensured his death .
At any rate , the US was only interested in pro-American Pashtun leaders , and could find precious few .
As such they had to rely on the Northern Alliance with whom they started making a secret alliance in 1999 .
So , those who " ca n't find their place in the present confederation of Afghan policies " are those who are being specifically excluded .
The predominantly Pashtun Taliban regime was in fact more representative of the different ethnic groups than the current one .
Aside from the various groups in the south , there is a growing insurgency in the north - west of the country , due to conflict with the warlords in government such as Ismail Khan , and the ridiculously brutal spate of Nato bombardment ( apparently these recent massacres are the result of a deliberate policy shift ) .
Aside from the growing armed insurgency , there is of course an unarmed political opposition developing .
The Taliban era was a desperate one , but this regime is hardly more progressive .
Aside from the fairly serious matter of occupying troops rampaging through cities , airplanes lobbing bombs at villages , secret prisons , torture cells , kidnappings and so on , there is the small problem that the state built and the groups empowered by the occupiers are client despots .
They murder and torture their enemies with impunity , and their police chiefs rape and extort .
They steal taxes , bulldoze houses , steal land .
Northern Alliance rulers kidnap people and ransom them back to their families with the pretense that they were Taliban arrestees .
There is nothing the attorney general likes more than to lock up media workers who displease him .
Critics like Malalai Joya are unwelcome ( she has recently been suspended for the remainder of her term ) .
The Department for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice continues to operate .
Reports last year that it would ' return ' after a resolution passed by Karzai 's cabinet last year were misleading : the department , although now synonymous with Taliban terror , had actually originated under the US - recognised Rabbani regime , and continued under Karzai 's regime in various forms .
The Vice and Virtue squads continued to operate in Kabul , warlords like Ismail Khan imposed the old regime , and Karzai's ' Accountability Department ' took over many of the roles of the department .
In this respect , it is worth noting that , as NGO workers Chris Johnson & Jolyon Leslie point out in their widely praised , that the Taliban have been demonised out of all proportion .
This is n't simply an artefact of war propaganda , but in part a result of NGO misconceptions .
Their repression , as brutal as it was , should not have been understood as simply an emanation of their own peculiar , reactionary ideology .
It was rooted in the common social practises of the most conservative elements of society in Afghanistan , which fused with the conditions of war , and then civil war , to produce a militant war on ' sin ' and ' vice ' ( with well - known , and savage punishments such as stonings and amputations ) .
If you go back and have a look at the scholarly studies of Afghanistan during the rule of the Taliban , this is a frequent theme raised by the regime in justification for some of its worst policies ( excluding girls from education for example ) .
Nasreen Ghufran noted in Asian Survey in May 2001 that the regime 's claim was that it needed time to develop the correct environment for girls and women to be educated and work : it saw its model , ironically , as the Islamic Republic of Iran .
Nevertheless , women 's struggles were able to exert some effects .
As Jeanette O'Malley wrote in 2000 : " In early June , supreme leader Mullah Omar issued an edict allowing for the expansion of mosque schools for young boys and girls .
The mosque schools are apparently little more than a substitute acceptable to clerics and hard - line officials for state - run schools , as they offer the same curriculum . "
NGO groups who worked in Afghanistan were able to set up schooling for girls by simply telling local Taliban officials that it was a mosque .
The point is that the assumption that hardline religious and social conservatism was something that could be pinned exclusively on the Taliban has been at best a misguided one .
Today , of course , the imposition of the burqa is still enforced even if not by edict .
Women must now struggle against empowered warlords , who are given to raping women ( and children ) they like the look of .
A recent study found that most women in Afghanistan suffer mental and physical abuse .
So - called ' honour killings ' continue , as do slavery and stonings Now , whatever the prevailing barbarism in Afghanistan , the insurgency does n't command significant support anywhere beyond the southern provinces at the moment .
If the only dynamic involved here were the insurgency , which is widely understood as a Taliban affair and whose tactics are becoming increasingly brutal , then this state of affairs would remain permanent .
However , it is not .
The attempt by the United States to impose and maintain a pro-US regime is developing several oppositional currents .
Its barbaric air campaign is galvanising communities of resistance in surprising places , while also driving people into the arms of the Talibs and their allies .
This is why British military leaders are worried that they may lose Afghanistan .
They could n't possibly lose militarily to a rag - tag collection of militants : it is the political nature of the war they are fighting , the fact that is for US domination , that is producing this resistance , and that will ensure - if we do n't force our governments to end the occupation - that a prolonged and vicious war is afoot .
This may also take the form of aat some point .
Unfortunately , the resources for a left or even secular nationalist movement in Afghanistan are extremely limited .
Military resistance to the this brutal occupation is obviously legitimate , and no occupation force has a right to complain if it is tormented by its enemies ( " awe , shucks , the insurgents are holding up all our " ) .
However , if there is hope for Afghanistan it lies in a broader , more grassroots and less fissiparous movement than the austere and brutal Talibs or Hekmatyarists could ever deliver .
How much chance is there ofhappening ?
After almost thirty years of devastating war in which the most reactionary elements have been promoted and defended by imperial interlopers , in which rival imperial powers have tortured the people of Afghanistan for decades , it is easy to be pessimistic .
After all , neither the CIA or the ISI will ever leave Afghanistan alone , and even if they did it would be a long struggle to unite a sufficient coalition of women and the poor to displace the conservative elites .
A great deal depends on external factors such as what happens to the US in Iraq , whether we can force our states to withdraw their troops , whether Musharraf survives in Pakistan and who replaces him , etc .
But , the more the insurgency becomes an armed movement of the poor , the more political independence they will have to develop , and the greater chance they will have to confront the landlord class .
And groups like RAWA and fiercely independent figures like Malalai Joya are still fighting .
Labels : afghanistan , occupation , resistance , taliban , US imperialism
Sensitive to criticisms like one Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. , Democrat of Delaware , leveled  that for Mr. Giuliani a sentence was “ a noun and a verb and 9/11 ”  the campaign worked to show other dimensions .
Over the summer and fall he made policy proposals , talked about his record as mayor of New York City , and reached further into his biography to highlight his career in the Justice Department in the 1970s and 1980s .
For months , he was more likely to talk about supply - siders than suicide bombers .
Now , though , as Mr. Giuliani ’s standing in the polls has slipped and he risks being sidelined by his decision not to compete fully in the Iowa caucuses , his campaign is returning to his signature issue .
The shift began this month when he retooled his stump speech in Florida , with more references to Sept. 11 than usual .
A campaign video shown on the Internet and at rallies includes an image of two terrorists in head scarves with guns .
And he is running a minute - long advertisement focusing on Sept. 11 .
“ It is part of my life , ” Mr. Giuliani said this week about the advertisement .
“ It is part of my life that helps to define me .
It is n’t the only part of my life .
But it would seem to me that maybe the critics want you to , like , remove a part of your life in which people have every right to draw judgments about how you would handle a crisis , how you would handle a difficult situation , how you would handle terrorism . ”
The Bhutto assassination offered Mr. Giuliani a chance to appear on several news programs to talk about something other than the uncomfortable subjects that have dogged him recently , including the indictment of his former police commissioner in New York , Bernard B. Kerik , and the health scare that landed him in a St. Louis hospital last week .
But the renewed focus on Sept. 11 comes as Mr. Giuliani ’s Republican opponents are more willing to challenge his argument that his experience after Sept. 11 gives him special insight on terrorism .
" It 's happening all over , " Detective Sergeant John Pinney , head of Victoria 's organised motor vehicle theft squad , told The Sunday Age .
" These machines disappear into the ether . "
Sergeant Pinney said China 's booming construction industry had created a surge in demand for heavy machinery and vehicle parts that was fuelling the illicit trade .
" It 's been going crazy over there for the past few years so it 's a prime market for stolen heavy machinery , " he said .
" It 's hard to track these machines and they can be worth half a million dollars , some even up to $ 2 million .
That 's the kind of money you 're talking about . "
A favourite hot spot has been the EastLink road project — which is due to open next year and will connect the Eastern freeway at Donvale to the Frankston freeway on the Mornington Peninsula .
Sergeant Pinney said he was convinced machinery stolen from throughout Victoria was being used to build major sporting facilities and infrastructure for the Beijing Olympics .
Construction of the city 's 91,000 - seat national stadium is expected to be completed by the end of March next year , while the nearby 17,000 - seat national swimming centre , known as the " water cube " , should be finished by the end of this year .
Other building projects have included a 27 - kilometre subway line , the athletes ' village , a tennis centre , a hockey stadium , a shooting range and a cycling velodrome .
A spokesman from the Chinese Embassy in Canberra said he had not heard any reports of stolen machinery being used on Beijing construction sites and he doubted the Victoria Police claims .
But Sergeant Pinney said it was all too easy for thieves to steal heavy machinery , such as prime movers , put them in a container and ship them to China .
If a machine was too bulky , it was simply broken down into parts .
Many had left the state within a day of being taken .
Sergeant Pinney said customs officers were only able to check a small number of the thousands of containers leaving Australia each year so many that had valuable stolen machinery hidden inside were slipping through the net .
A lack of police resources to track down the criminals also made it difficult to crack the smuggling network .
The latest figures show that heavy machinery worth more than $ 5 million was stolen in Victoria last financial year .
The total number of thefts was 144 , accounting for just over 28 per cent of the nation - wide total of 504 .
In some cases , the machines were simply " borrowed " .
One gang used a 14 - tonne prime mover to steal a container of almost 30,000 bottles of Moro olive oil worth more than $ 200,000 from the Allied Seafreight yard in Brooklyn , in Melbourne 's west , last November .
The gang struck again in March , using two stolen prime movers to break into the same yard and steal two more container loads of olive oil worth $ 470,000 .
The prime movers were later dumped but the olive oil has never been found .
The problem , say police , is that few owners of such machinery keep a record of the vehicle identification number or the engine number .
However , businesses have become so worried about the thefts that they are installing GPS tracking devices in their machinery .
In July , four men appeared in a Sydney court charged over the alleged theft of $ 1 million worth of PlayStation consoles from a freight forwarding depot .
The operation was thwarted when a GPS device fitted to a prime mover — which was pulling the trailer carrying the consoles — was tracked by satellite to a remote farm .
Peter Butts , a former detective who now heads the company Australian Transport Investigations , said the most popular machinery targeted by thieves shipping goods overseas were bobcats , valued at between $ 30,000 and $ 50,000 .
" What they do is they 'll get a container , whack a bobcat in the back and then fill it up with other goods , " Mr Butts said .
" They could be going anywhere and everywhere and they 're just not traceable .
" The problem with bobcats is they all have common keys and very few if any have an immobilising system .
" They 're not required to be registered and they are all generic in appearance . "
Mr Butts said bobcats were prized because they were such multi-functional machines .
" You can use them for digging holes , as a grader , as a lawn mower , a front - end loader , a backhoe … plus they run on diesel and they 're a four - wheel - drive vehicle . "
Mr Butts said well - organised thieves , believed to be outlaw motorcycle gangs , were pocketing millions of dollars from the lucrative stolen heavy machinery trade .
Anyone with any information on heavy machinery theft should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333000 or visit crimestoppers.com.au .

Sometimes we face tough decisions that involve one or more unknowns .
We ca n’t know in advance what the consequences of each alternative will be .
This is especially true of big decisions like quitting a job , entering or exiting a relationship , or moving to a new city .
When faced with such a decision , what do you do ?
If you ca n’t figure out the consequences , can you do any better than guessing ?
Usually what people do in such situations is freeze .
Even when you do n’t like what you have , you may worry that the alternatives are worse .
In a way every decision involves a choice between maintaining the status quo vs. making a change .
When we ca n’t be certain a change will work out for the better , by default we stay put .
Let me give you a very simple method of making these kinds of decisions .
In most cases it takes no more than 60 seconds to evaluate any particular path .
For each alternative you ’re considering , ask yourself , “ Is this really me ? ”
What you ’re asking is whether each path is a fair expression of who you truly are .
To what degree does each option reflect the real you ?
Decisions are acts of self - expression
When we look at choices as being more than just paths — as being creative statements of self - expression — certain decisions become much easier to make .
You may say to yourself , “ This path is n’t going to be easy , but I know this is the right way to go because it ’s who I am . ”
Or you may conclude , “ No matter how I try to represent this to myself , I know that deep down this is n’t who I am .
This just is n’t me . ”
It ’s very important to separate this evaluation step from the act of summoning the courage to act on this knowledge .
It ’s OK to acknowledge you ’re in a place you do n’t want to be , even when you lack the ability to do anything about it right now .
The courage to act comes later .
Here are some ways you can apply this method :
Is this job really me ?
Is this company really me ?
Is being an employee ( or entrepreneur or investor or business owner ) really me ?
Is this relationship really me ?
Is this city really me ?
Is this house really me ?
Is this book I ’m reading really me ?
Is this shirt / dress / tie really me ?
Is this friend really me ?
Is this hobby really me ?
Is this car really me ?
Is this food really me ?
Is this habit really me ?
Is this spiritual or religious belief really me ?
Is this level of fitness really me ?
Notice that you can apply “ Is this really me ? ” to decisions both big and small .
This is something you can use every day , even when you ’re just deciding what groceries to buy .
Say a few syllables
If you have trouble deciding if a decision is really you , just describe its attributes out loud .
In the words of the Three Stooges , “ Say a few syllables . ”
For example , when you ’re thinking about changing careers , describe the new career you ’re considering .
Is it safe or risky ?
Bland or exciting ?
Social or solitary ?
Now consider whether those same adjectives could describe you as a person ?
Are you safe or risky ?
Bland or exciting ?
Social or solitary ?
Is this career really you ?
Sometimes this can get a bit silly , but I ’m certain you ’ll gain some interesting insights if you just humor me and do it .
If you ’re feeling bold , do the same for your closest relationships .
It will teach you a great deal about which people are the best fits for you .
If your current relationship feels a bit off , this process will show you why .
You ’ll be able to see where your true self and your current reality are misaligned .
A personal example – shopping for a desk
Three weeks ago Erin and I moved to a new house , and I wanted to get a new desk for my office .
( My old desk was 14 years old and so worn down that charities did n’t even want it .
I opted to use it for martial arts practice until it was a pile of sawdust . )
This time I wanted a high - quality desk that would last me a long time instead of the particle board special I bought for $ 99 after college .
I made a detailed list of criteria for what I wanted , took measurements of the available space , and gave myself an unlimited budget .
I browsed through many local furniture stores and searched through office furniture web sites , but nothing really grabbed me .
I started thinking maybe I should have a custom desk built , but that seemed like overkill .
I started to get a bit frustrated , and my new home office remained deskless for several days .
I thought to myself , “ This should be an easy problem to solve , especially with no fixed budget .
I must be making this harder than necessary somehow . ”
Eventually I stepped back and asked myself if there was a better way to find the right desk .
I did n’t want to settle for something I did n’t like , but I realized that instead of trying to find something that met my far - too - anal list of criteria , what I really wanted was a desk that would suit me , something that would reflect the kind of person I am .
So I decided to make the decision by looking at each candidate desk and asking myself , “ Is this really me ? ” I went back to the same local stores , and it was an amazingly different experience .
Instead of looking for what I wanted , I looked for who I was .
I looked around for something that was me in the form of a desk .
Yeah , I know that sounds weird .
In fact , I actually wanted to find a desk that was a bit weird .
If it was n’t a little weird , it would n’t be me .
When I saw a desk that I thought anyone would appreciate , I knew it was n’t for me .
Normally I hate shopping , but I actually enjoyed the experience this time .
I ’d probably enjoy shopping a lot more if I always did it this way .
I ’d look at a very ornate and classy desk , and I ’d say , “ That ’s not it .
I ’m not an ornate and frilly person . ”
I ’d see a heavy , solid desk that only Superman could lift and say , “ That one is too heavy .
I ’m lighter than that . ”
I ’d see the cheap particle board furniture and think , “ Nope .
I ’m more durable and tougher than that . ”
That sounds a little like the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears , does n’t it ?
Eventually I sat down at an unusual desk that caught my eye .
It was an elegant mix of glass , metal , and wood .
It felt almost familiar when I sat down , but in an alien sort of way .
I was n’t quite sure what to make of it .
It definitely was n’t love at first sight , but there was a compelling infatuation .
I became very curious about it .
This was a desk I ’d previously bypassed because at a glance I could tell it did n’t fit my initial criteria .
This time when I asked , “ Is this me ? ” the answer did n’t come back as an immediate yes .
I had to think about it .
I described the desk to myself .
I said , “ This desk is clean , efficient , organized , transparent , flowing , intelligent , creative , and well - constructed .
Some people would love this desk , but others would find it rubs them the wrong way .
I ’m not sure if I like it , but it certainly grabs my attention .
I could never be bored in a room with this thing . ”
I soon realized this was the right desk for me because I was describing myself .
Having used it for a couple weeks now , I ’ve grown to really love it .
It ’s just so me . 🙂
( If you ’re curious to see the desk I ended up purchasing , it ’s the Stockton collection from The Sharper Image , available from Office Max .
I got the matching bookcase too .
It was $ 600 for the 5 - piece set I bought … worth every penny .
And no , that ’s not an affiliate link .
That would be too weird making money from selling myself in desk form . )
So here was a decision that was important to me — I ’ll use my desk a lot , so it ’s worthwhile to get a good one — but I was making the decision way too complicated .
Asking , “ Is this me ? ” cut through the complexity and allowed me to figure out my true criteria .
Every desk I considered helped me converge on the final solution .
Again , I fully realize this must sound plenty weird to someone who ’s never tried it .
So do n’t be someone who ’s never tried it . 🙂
Positive reinforcement
When making decisions via the “ Is this me ? ” method , you ’re using an idealized version of yourself for the comparison .
This is your best self .
It ’s who you are in your dreams and goals , who you want to be .
What happens when you begin to fill your life with people , places , and objects that reasonably reflect your true self ?
By osmosis you ’ll begin to take on more of those qualities yourself .
Just sitting behind my new desk makes me feel more organized , efficient , and creative .
It ’s a constant reminder of the kind of person I strive to be .
Even when reality falls a bit short , I keep coming back to this daily positive reinforcement .
I do n’t even have to think about it .
For further thoughts on this line of thinking , see the article Environmental Reinforcement of Your Goals .
I ’ve been using this “ Is this me ? ” method a lot lately .
I recently taught it to Erin , and she ’s been telling me how much she likes it too .
When we go furniture shopping , we ’ll look at a piece and say , “ Is this really us ? ”
So far we always seem to be in agreement .
It ’s a great way to make sure we ’re on the same page .
Look around you .
What can you say is really you ?
What is n’t ?
What can you do about it ?

Cindy Crawford is more famous for the trademark mole on her face than stretch marks - but it seems that even supermodels suffer from the unsightly signs of motherhood .
The 41 - year - old 's body has been splashed all over magazines and has been the envy of every woman .
But her striking stretch marks were seen for the first time when she played in the sea on a Hawaiian holiday this week .

The 41 - year - old 's stomach was showing the effects of having two children as she enjoyed the surf on a paddle board alongside her husband Rande Gerber .
The couple have two children , Presley , eight , and Kaya , six .
Crawford gave birth to both her children through natural home birth .
She has previously been ranked number 5 on Playboy 's list of the 100 Sexiest Stars of the 20th century .

It I finally got to watch the NeXTSTEP 3 Release Demo the other night .
People have been pointing me to the link for ages .
I could n't get this equipment to work and so had to forego it .
I told everyone ' been there done that ' as NeXT Software about the same time had given me the complete kit with NS for 486 , NeXTSTEP the Movie , the Garfinkel book , the works .
We 'd all seen what this blazing platform could do , so no one expected much new from the clip .
I was in for a surprise .
First off , I was amazed it was so windy in Redwood City that day .
You can see the trees blowing out the window .
Second off , this is a demonstration right up there with Doug Engelbart 's ' mother of all demos ' .
In fact it places right up there and takes over where the other one left off .
And just like its forerunner , this demo gives you a glimpse of the distant future and actually goes a lot further than Doug 's forerunner did .
And if you have n't seen the demo , then by all means click one of these images and scoot on over for the next thirty five minutes eight seconds .
It 's a real eye opener .
But better still to stick around here a moment longer and get some perspective on what you 're going to see - and also a comparison to ' another ' Steve Jobs just five years later .
The NeXTSTEP Release 3 Demo is divided up into a number of parts .
There 's the introduction ( with campy music ) and there 's a section on networking ( which will blow your socks off ) and finally there 's a section on application development which Jobs handles all himself .
It 's all good but as things progress you 'll start to feel as if you 're in a time warp - not the infamous Steve Jobs reality distortion field but a real honest time warp .
The first thing you 'll see is that the menus are ' spatial ' .
This must leave John Siracusa singing to the moon .
The movable menus are bloody brilliant - you can move them around and each application remembers where its menu is .
The next thing you 'll notice is that the system is blazingly fast .
Remember this is fifteen years ago , and remember what kind of hardware was being used back then , and watch how fast Jobs can flip between applications .
And it 's never just one window either : it 's a whole slew - and the menus pop back up too .
The dock's on the right and it 's movable - not configurable but movable .
Just drag your mouse and it moves .
This of course is a forerunner to the OpenStep dock which in addition had tabs and started turning into a real powerhouse .
There 's no fancy - schmancy bouncy - bouncy when Jobs brings up applications : he just clicks on a dock icon and the app is there .
Instantaneously .
And so he starts talking about ' object linking ' .
Remember the year .
This is the year Microsoft would blast the planet with Windows 3.1 and part of the upgrade from Windows 3.0 was ' object linking and embedding ' .
In the autumn of 1992 we were given a demonstration of how this worked on the coming NT .
And it worked - but it was nothing like this .
Jobs connects a diagram and then starts manipulating it - and you see the embedded link in the target document being updated at the same time .
Jobs says something later on in his demo which can be good to cite already now .
He 's talking about the structure of this fantastic platform and the efforts made by others - including Apple - to emulate it , to copy it .
And he's also talking about the fact that when he first saw this years earlier at Alan Kay 's PARC lab he did n't really ' get it ' .
Now he does .
Oh does he ever .
' Think of NeXTSTEP which is NeXT 's object oriented development environment as an object oriented cake .
I 'm about to show you just the frosting on the cake .
Many people have tried to copy this frosting but what they found out is without the object oriented cake underneath it just does n't work . '
He goes on to demonstrate WordPerfect for NeXTSTEP - which is light years ahead of anything that company ever put out on another platform .
It 's 100 % WYSIWYG - it has no code panel - and ' it just works ' .
Remember again the year : remember what Will Petersen was struggling to get WP out the door for Windows 3.1 and was getting screwed left and right by Microsoft and that months later when the product hit the market network admins would joke ' if there 's something wrong with the LAN it must be WordPerfect trying a printout ' .
And then he shows off Lotus Improv - a product Lotus themselves said would be impossible on any other platform .
And to this day that seems to hold true .
And both applications offer effortless seamless object linking .
A mind blower .
And remember : this is 1992 .
Steve Jobs is still sitting at a NeXT computer - a ' slab ' - and it's still ' NeXT Computer ' instead of ' NeXT Software ' and that change is about to happen momentarily .
Whatever .
Next on the agenda is a bit about networking .
Jobs demonstrates how they couple up to Microsoft boxes over Novell , to Sun workstations , to their own kind , and to Macs on yet another network .
He takes a Mail memo with links to four different documents found on each of these networks , navigates with ease with his FileViewer to each and picks up the documents , and then assembles it all .
Effortlessly .
Piece of cake .
And the mail program he 's using is the same code used today in OS X mail - except it has more features , not fewer .
You can directly record sound bites and embed them in mail messages .
And play them back .
And so forth .
Finally Jobs moves to application development - which is where he fells the above quote which should be echoing in your ears about now .
He decides he 's going to build a simple yet powerful application for interfacing with databases and he 's going to use Interface Builder .
And he does n't have to write a single line of code .
This part is actually rather impressive , for it shows that Jobs has a lot more tech savvy than a lot of people assume .
He might have been primarily interested in chimes and startup times for the original Mac but now he's had to get his hands dirty with real programming and he 's succeeded at it .
Interface Builder is of course the revolutionary program from Jean - Marie Hullot ( which no one to this day coincidentally has ever been able to copy ) .
And Jobs ' quote might be a clue why .
The application project will connect several fields in several databases to give quite the complete picture of query results - and this literally .
Jobs digs into these ' data objects ' fields and drags them to his interface where they will show up as records of data - and in two cases as photographs .
And he's not worried about what database he 's actually accessing either as he will point out a bit later : the same code works seamlessly on all the databases they 're capable of hooking up to , including Oracle and all the other big names .
The same code works everywhere .
And so once he's got the template completed he just flips Interface Builder into test mode and away it goes .
For the first access Jobs has to authenticate but after that he 's in .
He inputs a search key , hits his big ' SEARCH ' button , and up come the results .
And it 's blazingly - unbelievably - fast .
And you get two photographs in every query and with every selected record .
Wow .
To round things off Jobs takes a few graphic images , superimposes them , gets automatic transparency , and then inserts an OpenGL three dimensional rotating image into the same photograph - halfway hidden behind the trees .
Up front he 's got a Ferrari - initially on a black background but instantaneously made transparent - and a picture of Donald Duck for which the same applies , and then he puts Donald behind the Ferrari and you can actually see him through the Ferrari windows .
They do n't have those programs on OS X .
And if you look closely at the mail correspondence in the beginning of the demo , you 'll see mention of the increase in the number of professional software titles for the previous year .
NeXTSTEP was getting a lot of heavy duty software , and Jobs knew he needed those titles to survive .
And he had them .
OK , now let 's jump five years ahead in time .
It 's Boston and it's Macworld and Steve Jobs is going to make a comeback .
And you 'd wonder how many people in the audience know much about him , for in all the dozen years he was across town they did n't pay him any heed .
And now here comes Steve Jobs and there 's an ovation .
And people are really excited .
And Steve Jobs does n't say or do a lot this time .
He has no products to show off .
Really all he 's doing , aside from presenting the deal with Microsoft , is talking bullshit .
And in the end he does come on heavy .
And you realise there 's an enormous difference between the Steve Jobs then and the Steve Jobs five years later .
The first Steve Jobs did n't have to bullshit .
His audience was n't interested in bullshit .
All he had to do was present a product .
The second Steve Jobs had to bullshit because there was nothing else to do .
There were no products to show off , nothing to sell .
And still the audience sat enraptured .
A company on the brink of ruin and nothing good - nothing at all - to show off .
And you start to wonder what they 're thinking .
In the one case you saw a product that sold itself , that even today is way ahead of its time .
In the other case you see nothing at all - only bullshit .
Fanboy bullshit .
If Apple as a corporation have issues , here 's one of them .
And please note : the NeXTSTEP you see in the first presentation was professional software for the world of business .
Obviously so .
It had database interfaces up the wazoo ; it could hook up to anyone 's network ; it worked seamlessly with Sun , with IBM and Microsoft , and even with the world of the Mac .
And that 's a lot different from the OS X of today .
As for the speed , that should give you pause .
Those machines were crippled compared to what people use today , and yet NeXTSTEP 1992 is faster than OS X Tiger 2006 .
And if you think you do n't understand why , click here .
That product demonstration you 've seen is one of the best and most important you 'll ever see .
And all the more reason to lament what 's happened since .
Congress Rushes Through Law To Protect The Children ...

Congress was apparently busy on Wednesday moving forward with incredibly bad laws that are designed to look good to certain constituents , but are highly questionable in real terms .
We already discussed the new PRO IP bill , but the House also rushed through approval of the SAFE Act , which is one of those ridiculous bills that everyone feels compelled to vote for to " protect the children . "
Only two Representatives voted against the bill ( and , yes , for his fans , one of them was Ron Paul ) .
As Declan McCullough 's report makes clear , the backers of this bill rushed it through Congress for no clear reason .
They used a procedural trick normally reserved for non-controversial laws -- and made significant changes from an earlier version , never making the new version available for public review prior to the vote .
So what 's so awful about the law ?
Well , like most " protect the children " legislation , it goes way overboard in terms of what people are expected to do , and like most legislation having to do with technology , seems utterly clueless about how technology works .
The bill would require anyone providing an " electronic communication service " or a " remote computing service " to record and report information any time they " learn " that their network was used for certain broadly defined illegal activities concerning obscene images .
That 's double trouble , as both the illegal activities and the classification of who counts as a service provider are so broadly defined .
McCullough notes that anyone providing an open WiFi network , a social network , a domain registry or even a webmail service probably qualify under the law .
Glenn Fleishman describes what the law could mean in practice , points out that anyone who runs an open WiFi network for the public is now basically required to snitch on anyone they think may be doing anything deemed " illegal " in this act , including viewing or transmitting certain obscene drawings , cartoons , sculptures , or paintings .
As Fleishman notes , it " sounds like viewing an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog could qualify . "
Even worse , part of the snitching is that beyond sending a reportthe images to the gov't , you 're supposed to retain the " illegal " image yourself -- which would seem to open you up to charges of possession as well if you somehow screw up ( if you follow everything exactly to the letter of the law , you are granted immunity ) .
If you do n't snitch on anyone suspected of viewing or transmitting these images , then you , as the network " operator " are suddenly liable for huge fines .
Honestly , the liability is so big that anyone offering WiFi is probably better off no longer doing so .
This is one of those laws that politicians love to pass , because they think it makes them look like they 're protecting children -- when all they 're really doing is creating a huge and unnecessary headache for all kinds of service providers , from open WiFi operators to social networking sites to webmail offerings .
But , of course , it moves forward -- with no public scrutiny and no discussion -- because almost no politician wants to allow a politician to accuse him or her of voting " against " protecting the children .

While Amsterdam has long been famous for its nicotine - stained " brown cafés , " these days " coffeeshop " refers to a place where the Dutch gather to buy and smoke marijuana .
While hard drugs are strictly illegal and there seems to be no interest in making them legal , marijuana is sold openly in coffeeshops throughout the Netherlands .
Wandering around Amsterdam , every few blocks you pass a window full of plants and displaying a red , yellow , and green Rastafarian flag — both indications that that coffee shop does n't sell much coffee .
I ducked into the Grey Area Coffeeshop near the Anne Frank House .
A round table at the front window was filled with a United Nations of tourists sharing travelers ' tales stirred by swizzlesticks of smoke .
The table was a clutter of tea cups , maps , and guidebooks .
From the looks of the ashtray , they 'd been there a while .
Taking a seat at the bar next to a leathery forty - something biker and a Gen - X kid with two holes in his body for each one in mine ; I felt more like a tourist than I had all day .
The bartender , sporting a shaved head and a one - inch goatee , greeted me in English and passed me the menu .
I pointed to a clipped - on scrap of paper .
" What 's ' Aanbieding : Swarte Marok ? ' "
" Today 's special is Black Moroccan , " he said .
Swarte Marok , Blond Marok , White Widow , Northern Light , Stonehedge , Grasstasy … so many choices , and that 's just the wiet ( marijuana ) .
Hashish selections filled the bottom of the menu .
Above me dangled a tiny Starship Enterprise from a garland of spiky leaves .
And behind the bartender stood a row of much - used and apparently never - cleaned bongs reminding me of the hubbly - bubblies that litter Egyptian teahouses .
With a flick of my finger , I set the Enterprise rocking .
The bartender said , " Access to the stars .
That 's us . "
When I marveled how open - minded the Dutch are , the bartender explained , " We 're not open - minded , just tolerant .
There 's a difference .
Wiet is not legal … only tolerated . "
I asked , " Does this toleration cause a problem ? "
Handing a two - foot - tall bong and a tiny baggie of leaves to a woman with a huge dog tied to the bike rack outside , he said , " My grandmother has a pipe rack .
It has a sign : ‘ A satisfied smoker creates no problems . ' "
" That was tobacco , was n't it ? "
" Yes , it 's from the 1860s .
But this still applies today . "
I asked the guy with all the holes why he smokes here .
Speaking through the silver stud in his tongue , he said , " Some young people hang out at coffeeshops because their parents do n't want them smoking pot at home .
I smoke with my parents but come here for the coffeeshop ambience . "
The older guy in leather laughed .
" Yeah , ambience with a shaved head , " he said , as the bartender handed him his baggie - to - go .
Alone with the younger guy , I asked about the sign with a delivery boy on it .
" In Holland we have pot delivery services , " he explained , " like you have pizza delivery in America .
Older people take out or have it delivered . "
A middle - aged woman hurried in and said , " Yellow Cab , please . "
She presented the bartender with a small , stickered card .
" Buy twelve , get one free , " he explained to me , and handed her a baggie saying , " I cut you a fat bag . "
With a " Dank U wel , Peter , " she tossed it into her shopping tote and hurried out .
" This coffeeshop would never be possible in the United States , " I said .
" I know , " Peter , the bartender , agreed .
He showed me snapshots of Woody Harrelson and Willy Nelson , each in this obscure little coffeeshop , and continued .
" America 's two most famous pot smokers told me all about America . "
The kid chimed in .
" Hollanders — even those who do n't smoke — they believe soft drugs … you know , pot , hash … it should n't be a crime . "
" What do your parents think ? " I asked .
" They think the youth have a problem .
My dad says , ‘ Holland will get the bill later on . ' "
" And other countries … does n't legal pot in Holland cause them a problem ? " I asked .
" Actually , it 's not legal here , " he reminded me , " just tolerated .
Officially , we can't legalize anything because of all these world treaties . "
" The French complain about Holland 's popularity with drug users , but they have a worse problem with illegal drugs , " Peter added .
" Here , the police know just what 's going on and where . "
" But what about hard drugs ? "
" These are the problem .
Europe comes to Holland for more than the pot .
Most Dutch agree that these hard drugs should be illegal .
We Dutch — I think because pot is tolerated — handle our drugs better than the kids who travel here to get high .
But , like everywhere , we have a hard drug problem . "
Peter points to a chart on the wall that shows how to avoid bad XTC pills .
" The police give us this chart .
My English friends cannot believe they help in this way .
They call our Politie the ‘ polite - ies . '
" You do n't see the Dutch dying from heroin overdoses , " Peter continued .
" But every time I read the newspaper it seems another German is found dead on the floor of a cheap Amsterdam hotel room .
" But pot , " he said , fingering a perfectly rolled joint , " this is not a problem . "
" American prisons are filled with pot offenders , " I said .
" Take your choice , " he said .
" Allow for alternative ways of living or build more prisons .
Here in Holland , pot is like cigarettes .
We smoke it .
We pay taxes .
We do n't go to jail . "
Some Hungarian engineers got together and built a fire extinguisher using two Mig - 21 jet engines .
It was specifically designed to extinguish pipeline and oil drilling fires .
As you can see from the video ( after the jump ) , it really makes fires wish they had never started .
And it makes me wish I had two spare jet engines lying around .
Not that I 'd make a fire extinguisher , because I would n't .
No , I 'm building the world 's fastest couch , and I think those are just what I need for a speed boost .
Because right now my top speed is like , well , 0 .
It 's a pretty slow couch , it just sits there .
Video of the thing in action after the inferno .

AMERICA ’S economy is headed for a major slowdown .
Whether there is a recession ( two quarters of negative growth ) is less important than the fact that the economy will operate well below its potential , and unemployment will grow .
The country needs a stimulus , but anything we do will add to our soaring deficit , so it is important to get as much bang for the buck as possible .
The optimal package would contain one fast - acting measure along with others that could lead to increased spending if and only if the economy goes into a steep downturn .
We should begin by strengthening the unemployment insurance system , because money received by the unemployed would be spent immediately .
The federal government should also provide some assistance to states and localities , which are already beginning to feel the pinch , as property values have fallen .
Typically , they respond by cutting spending , and this acts as an automatic destabilizer .
Federal assistance should come in the form of support for rebuilding crucial infrastructure .
More federal support for state education budgets would also strengthen the economy in the short run and promote growth in the long run , as would spending to promote energy conservation and lower emissions .
It may take some time to put these kinds of well - designed expenditure programs into place , but this slowdown looks as if it will last longer than some of the other downturns in recent memory .
Housing prices have a long way to fall to return to more normal levels , and if Americans start saving more than they have been , consumption could remain low for some time .

Adam Gase is doing all he can to tune out all the negative talk and criticisms aimed directly at him .
With the New York Jets off to a second straight 0 - 3 start , the heat is on the head coach in a major way .
'' It 's something , I can't focus on that , '' Gase said Tuesday .
Bisexuality in women appears to be a distinctive sexual orientation and not a transitional stage that some women adopt " on their way " to lesbianism or as a temporary phase in otherwise heterosexual behavior , according to new research in Developmental Psychology .
The study of 79 non-heterosexual women over 10 years found that bisexual women maintained a stable pattern of attraction to both sexes .
In addition , the research appears to have debunked the stereotype that bisexual women are uninterested in or unable to commit to long - term monogamous relationships .
" This research provides the first empirical examination of competing assumptions about the nature of bisexuality , both as a sexual identity label and as a pattern of nonexclusive sexual attraction and behavior , " wrote University of Utah psychologist Lisa M. Diamond , PhD , who conducted the study .
" The findings demonstrate considerable fluidity in bisexual , unlabeled and lesbian women 's attractions , behaviors and identities and contribute to researchers ' understanding of the complexity of sexual - minority development over the life span . "
Diamond used interview data collected five times over a decade from 79 women who identified as lesbian , bisexual or unlabeled .
The subjects initially ranged in age from 18 to 25 years old .
Among Diamond 's findings :
Bisexual and unlabeled women were more likely than lesbians to change their identity over the course of the study , but they tended to switch between bisexual and unlabeled rather than to settle on lesbian or heterosexual as their identities .
Seventeen percent of respondents switched from a bisexual or unlabeled identity to heterosexual during the study -- but more than half of these women switched back to bisexual or unlabeled by the end .
By year 10 , most of the women were involved in long - term ( i.e. , more than a year in length ) monogamous relationships -- 70 percent of the self - identified lesbians , 89 percent of the bisexuals , 85 percent of the unlabeled women and 67 percent of those who were then calling themselves heterosexual .
Women 's definitions of lesbianism appeared to permit more flexibility in behavior than their definitions of heterosexuality .
For example , of the women who identified as lesbian in the last round of interviews , 15 percent reported having sexual contact with a man during the prior two years .
In contrast , none of the women who settled on a heterosexual label at that point reported having sexual contact with a woman within the previous two years .
" This provides further support for the notion that female sexuality is relatively fluid and that the distinction between lesbian and bisexual women is not a rigid one , " Diamond wrote .

AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) -
The Dutch government is set to impose a ban on the Muslim burqa in schools and government offices , media reported on Wednesday , in a retreat from the previous cabinet ’s plan for a general ban .
Protestors demonstrate against the ban on Muslim women wearing the burqa in public in The Hague , November 30 , 2006 .
The Dutch government is set to impose a ban on the Muslim burqa in schools and government offices , media reported on Wednesday , in a retreat from the previous cabinet 's plan for a general ban .
REUTERS / Toussaint Kluiters
The cabinet has decided against a broad ban on burqas in public as that would violate the principle of freedom of religion , news agency ANP said , citing unnamed cabinet sources .
The Muslim community says only about 50 women wear the head - to - toe burqa or the niqab , a face veil that conceals everything but the eyes .
They said a general ban would heighten alienation among the country ’s about 1 million Muslims .
An interior ministry spokesman said there was no final decision on the subject yet and the issue is expected to be discussed at the weekly cabinet meeting on Friday next week .
The wearing of headscarves in schools and at work is a sensitive topic across the European Union .
France , with Europe ’s largest Muslim minority , bans headscarves and other religious garb from state schools .
Italy has a decades - old law against covering the face in public as an anti-terrorism measure .
Shortly before being voted out of office , the previous centre - right Dutch government proposed a complete ban on burqas and other Muslim face - veils in public , citing security concerns .
A new centrist coalition government of Christian Democrats , Labour and the Christian Union came into power in February 2007 and has taken a more conciliatory line on immigration .
Right - wing lawmaker Geert Wilders -- who has angered Muslims with his fierce criticism of Islam -- sent a bill to parliament last July proposing a ban on the burqa in public .
He called the government ’s reported retreat “ very disappointing and cowardly ” , according to ANP .
Philip van Praag , political science professor at Amsterdam University , said the partial ban would be welcomed by many : “ It does not seem extreme .
In the eyes of lots of Dutch people , they do not like the burqa at all , ” he said .
MOSCOW  A British cultural organization at the center of a dispute between the Kremlin and Britain closed its office in St. Petersburg on Wednesday under pressure from Russia ’s intelligence service , which summoned the organization ’s entire Russian staff for questioning , Russian and British officials said .
The closing , which a British official said was temporary , occurred the morning after the organization ’s director , Stephen Kinnock , was stopped in front of his home by the Russian authorities and accused of drunken driving .
The British government said he had been falsely accused .
“ First thing to say , right up front : he was not drunk , ” said James Barbour , a spokesman for the British Embassy here , who suggested that the Russian allegations , which were widely circulated by the Russian news media , were a pretext used to intensify an already bitter dispute .
Mr. Kinnock , whose status as an accredited diplomat gives him legal protections , was not arrested or charged with any crime .
But the public allegations against him , and the questioning of the staff of the British Council , which is the official cultural arm of the British government , were condemned in London , where David Miliband , Britain ’s foreign secretary , accused Russia of “ intimidation . ”

VOTERS of America , well done : you are less racist ( or sexist ) than Europeans had feared .
Remember , though , that you are rather naive : please try to pick a competent president this time .
This dismissive summary , combining condescension with distrust , captures all too many European reactions to the duel between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination in this year 's presidential election ( and , given the gulf between most Europeans and the Republicans , this is the contest to be Europe 's preferred candidate as well — although a few Europeans retain a soft spot for John McCain ) .
A French newspaper , Libération , said that the arrival in the White House of “ a black man , married to a black woman , [ with ] a black family ” would be an act of “ atonement ” that would restore the image of an America “ shunned in every corner of the planet ” .
A German tabloid , Bild , offered praise for Mr Obama 's “ sexy ” charms , under the headline : “ This Black American Will Become the New Kennedy ! ”
In Spain El País trumped all others , telling readers : “ The question is whether the United States is ready for a president who is black , a woman , an evangelical minister , a Mormon or a Catholic . ”
You might expect even cynical Europeans to be impressed by the sight of ordinary Americans tramping through the snow in Iowa and New Hampshire to hear politicians speak .
Not the writers at a German newspaper , Süddeutsche Zeitung .
The duel in New Hampshire , it grumbled , had degenerated into an apolitical beauty contest .
Mr Obama 's appeal to voters was based on sentiment without substance : if only Americans would heed the lessons of the Bush years and choose the experienced Mrs Clinton .
A Belgian newspaper , Le Soir , struck a kinder note .
Writing after Mr Obama 's win in Iowa , it argued that the signs were that “ this time , Americans will not be duped ” by calculating politicians , but were seeking leaders with convictions .
Their optimism is not without naivety , Le Soir cautioned , “ but who is going to complain after the dark years of Bush junior ? ”
In a random sampling in the streets of Nuremberg , in Bavaria , ordinary Germans seemed impressed by the two things they knew about Mr Obama : he is not George Bush , and he is the son of an African .
Dirk Hellwig , a graphic designer , said he would feel more “ positive ” about America if Mr Obama won the presidency .
“ I do n't know what he wants to do , ” Mr Hellwig admitted .
“ But I think Germans will think Obama is a sign that something is changing . ”
A win by Mrs Clinton would also send a signal of American change , Mr Hellwig said .
“ But the signal would be bigger from Obama , because he is black . ”
It is striking that many Europeans skate over the political views of Mrs Clinton and Mr Obama and instead treat their fight as a simple Rorschach test of the health of the American dream .
In fact , both Democratic frontrunners ' policy platforms answer ( at least superficially ) some of the biggest European gripes about Mr Bush over the past eight years .
Mr Obama , unlike Mrs Clinton , consistently opposed the Iraq war — although changes of government in France and Germany have largely healed transatlantic wounds over Iraq .
Both candidates take positions on climate change that are far closer to Europe than anything Mr Bush has offered .
Both have called for the closure of the Guantánamo detention camp .
Both have echoed the outrage of many Europeans at the feeble federal response to Hurricane Katrina .
In the first Democratic debate in April , Mr Obama even hailed the European Union as among America 's most important allies .
Recently he refuted charges that he had never actually been to Europe .
Telling an Iowan reporter he had been to Europe “ multiple times ” , Mr Obama recalled meeting Britain's then prime minister , Tony Blair , in Downing Street , during a stopover in London .
He has also spoken proudly of a 2006 meeting in Washington with Nicolas Sarkozy , now the French president .
Allies or rivals ?
This may turn out to be the high point of European infatuation with the leading Democratic candidates , at least if previous campaigns are any guide .
Presidential candidates routinely pledge to reach out to allies and to improve America 's image abroad .
Before the 2000 election a French newspaper , Le Figaro , was impressed by the foreign - policy experts recruited by one George Bush .
( A Bush presidency offers America 's allies the promise of “ partnership with an administration skilled in foreign affairs , ” cooed Le Figaro . )
A former Irish prime minister , John Bruton , who now heads the European Commission 's delegation in America , warns Europeans against imagining that any president will bow to calls to surrender American sovereignty , or make concessions on trade , in the global interest .
“ It 's clear that any US president will pursue the interests of the electorate that has elected him or her , ” he says .
It is also worth noting , he adds , that Mr Bush 's second term has seen smoother relations with the EU , amid “ a general willingness to approach things multilaterally ” .
Alas , Mr Bush 's first term left many Europeans past caring .
His re-election in 2004 was a shock that in part explains the snippiness of much European coverage now .
To some Europeans , Mr Bush 's election in 2000 seemed no more than an unhappy accident : in their telling , he ran ( falsely ) as a centrist and compassionate conservative and then stole the presidency in Florida .
But his re-election could not be explained away so easily .
Ultimately , it reflected the choice of American voters , which some Europeans still cannot forgive .
Nor is European enthusiasm for either candidate likely to survive the election of Mrs Clinton , Mr Obama , or whoever else becomes president .
The person who gets voters ' nod will rule as an American , promoting American interests around the world — and no doubt disappointing many watchers from abroad .
For Europeans to imagine anything else would be naive indeed .
Heat proofing the body , with sheet
metal and fiberglass insulation
I was able to use an old Cheddar Boiler , which was slim enough to fit inside the body , with just enough room for insulation .
I used sheet metal and fiberglass insulation material toline the inside of the main body , to prevent the plastic body from melting from the heat .
I used two Wilesco marine engines , and split the steam for each engine using heat resistant silicone tubing .
The steam pressure needs to be built up around 20 psi for a pretty short run .
The gas fired flue boiler simply can not keep up with the thirsty demands of the two engines .
Gearing is very low , and R2S2 runs at a snail crawl ....
However , R2S2 is still holds the record for the fastest steam powered R2 in any galaxy .
This is the second of five predictions for 2008 , expanded from the short form generated on short notice as described here .
Prediction ·
The short version :
The strain due to the fact that most business desktops are locked into the Microsoft platform , at a time when both the Apple and GNU / Linux alternatives are qualitatively safer , better , and cheaper to operate , will start to become impossible to ignore .
Experience · Around our house , we have screens connected to Windows XP , OS X , and Ubuntu GNU / Linux .
Ubuntu and OS X are easier to install , less trouble to maintain , and more pleasant to use .
If we were tracking the time we spend maintaining these things , I ’m willing to bet that Windows takes more care & feeding than the other two put together .
Down the road we ’ll have Windows only for games , I think .
We also provide tech support for our mothers , a local Pilates studio , and various random friends , local and remote .
Wherever we can , we ’re steering them to OS X just because they ’ll experience less pain and be more productive .
Pain ·
These days , when you live mostly on OS X & Ubuntu , XP is just incredibly irritating .
There ’s always something pestering you to update it : Adobe , Java , Norton , whatever .
Plus random other whining from the bottom right corner of the screen , about unused icons and firewall security and so on .
As for my family & friends who are n’t pros , and who have n’t been under the tutelage of one either , their Windows boxes are mostly smoking , diseased , quivering heaps of goo .
Who ’s got the time to deal with that shit ?
Why I Might Be Wrong · I have n’t spent any time with Vista .
Possibly , after a couple of releases , it ’ll make Windows competitive again .
From the Business Point of View · I talk to the individuals and small businesses who are still running Windows , and I compare them to those who ’ve escaped , and it ’s just not close .
Recently I was helping Mairin get her system set up — a
Mac mini , which BTW is a fabulous computer for a small business — and was showing her how to do something and she said “ But that ’s so easy ?
Why ? ” and I said “ Well , that ’s how things work on this system ” and she said “ Well , why are people still using Windows then ? ”
The Future · Microsoft ’s continuing extraction of monopoly rents is dependent , near as I can tell , on just two things :
MS Office staying good enough that people do n’t mind paying the fearful Windows tax that goes with it .
Except for , Office runs better on OS X than on Windows .
The Exchange / Outlook lock - in .
This seems the big one to me .
Like I Said ·
This problem is becoming increasingly impossible to ignore .
Especially now that nearly everyone has someone in the family with a Mac .

Sleep Anchors Memory
Aided by dramatic swings in neurochemicals , different stages of sleep help preserve different types of memory
You 'll never again take sleep for granted once you talk to Matthew P. Walker , a psychologist at Harvard Medical School 's sleep and neuroimaging lab .
" Sleep plays an important role in processing memories , " he declares .
Say you 're taking piano lessons and you learn how to play a scale .
The next day , you 'll find that " sleep has enhanced the information that you learned , so you 're 20 - 40 % better in performing those motor skills than you were the day before , " Walker says .
" Your brain has continued to learn in the absence of any further practice , which is quite magical . "
The window of time for that improvement is limited , however .
If you 're a college student and you pull an all - nighter after the piano lesson , you lose out on the memory enhancement permanently , even if you sleep the next night , Walker says .
" It 's not practice that makes perfect , " he says , " but it 's practice with a night of sleep that seems to make perfect .
If you do n't snooze , you lose . "
NEUROMODULATORS
These compounds fluctuate throughout the night , fine - tuning the impact of the neurotransmitters glutamate and γ-amino butyric acid .
Sleep apparently rearranges memory within the brain .
" We presume that it 's organized into a more efficient storage location , " Walker says .
" That means you can recollect that information the next day much better than the day before . "
Sleep has this effect only on procedural memories , that is , memories associated with a physical procedure such as playing a piano or riding a bike .
These memories are normally used without conscious effort for motor skills that can't readily be described in words .
Furthermore , it 's only light dreamless sleep that works this magic .
By contrast , deep dreamless sleep consolidates , or crystallizes into long - term memories , newly formed declarative or episodic memories , such as what you had for dinner yesterday or the fact that Paris is the capital of France .
Sleep stabilizes these memories and prevents them from decaying over time .
Unlike procedural memory , Walker says , declarative memory " very rarely improves . "
Walker recently found that sufficient sleep prior to learning is also necessary for effectively retaining episodic memory ( Nat. Neurosci . 2007 , 10 , 385 ) .
Emotional episodic memories depend on dreaming sleep for consolidation , Walker says .
That dependency could conceivably provide an entr ??e for toning down the emotional memories associated with conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder .
" Perhaps we can try and modify sleep neurochemically to prevent amplification of those memories and ameliorate some of the symptoms , " he suggests .
The brain is steeped in a neurochemical cocktail that changes during the different stages of sleep , Walker notes .
The neurotransmitter glutamate revs up the brain , causing neural transmission , whereas the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid suppresses neural activity .
The impact of these two chemicals is fine - tuned by neuromodulators including acetylcholine , serotonin , and noradrenaline ( also known as norepinephrine ) .
" When we 're awake , these three neuromodulators are all swilling around the brain in fairly high concentrations , " Walker says .
" But as we start to fall asleep , they start to decrease in concentration . "
Acetylcholine drops to its lowest levels during dreamless sleep .
During the transition to dreaming sleep , noradrenaline and serotonin levels remain low , but the acetylcholine level begins to rise , reaching twice the waking level in some parts of the brain .
The body cycles several times between dreaming and nondreaming sleep throughout the night .
The three neuromodulators are probably intricately involved in the impact of sleep on memory , Walker notes , though for now , that 's just an educated guess .
" People know a lot about the brain chemistry of sleep , and people know a lot about the brain chemistry of memory , " he says .
" But very few people have started to try and put those two fields together to understand why sleep seems to offer these benefits to memory .
We 're really just starting to scratch the surface now . "

Many outstation labourers come to Gurgaon for work
Last week , police in Gurgaon , a suburb of the capital Delhi , raided a house which was used to carry out illegal kidney transplants .
Hundreds of poor labourers were tricked into selling kidneys , officials says .
Trade in human organs is banned in India but many continue to sell their kidneys to clients , including Westerners , waiting for transplants .
Gurgaon is an affluent suburb of Delhi , home to high - rise apartment blocks and call centres .
Major centre
It is here , in a nondescript house , that many poor labourers were lured from across northern India and bribed into selling their kidneys , according to the police .
For this they were allegedly paid up to $ 2,500 .
The clients are said to be wealthy Indians , and even some foreign visitors , who were in urgent need of a kidney transplant and willing to pay large sums for it .
Last week , the police raided the illegal clinic after being tipped - off by a victim .
Four people were arrested but the main person alleged to be behind the racket , a doctor , is missing .
Gurgaon police commissioner Mohinder Lal told the BBC that an alert had been sounded at airports to prevent him from leaving the country .
He said police also planned to approach Interpol to issue a warrant for his arrest .
Despite banning the trade in human organs India continues to be one of the major centres of the trade .
Fibromyalgia .
It sounds so daunting — like angina !
which also sounds like vagina , or chlamydia .
And if the pharmaceutical industry 's multibillion - dollar marketing machine has any sort of pathway into your consuming psyche , you 're probably aware of this hot new disease .
Has n't the industry gotten so much better at naming new maladies since the whole dubious " restless leg syndrome " thing ?
Anyway , here 's fibromyalgia in brief : it affects primarily women around their middle ages — potentially 10 million of them in this country according to advocacy group , which means something like one in five .
You 'll know you have it if you start to feel " chronic , widespread pain of unknown origin . "
The pain wo n't respond to anti-inflammatories , and no one knows where it comes from really , so instead of trying to sell you on something to soothe the pain , the pharmaceutical companies — namely Pfizer — is trying to soothe your brain 's perception of pain .
Clever !
Okay , so here 's the shocker : some people think fibromyalgia is a bit , you know , fictionyalgia .
And " some people " includes the doctor who named it in the first place .
Advertisement
Why invent a disease ?
Well , if you 've got a drug with a limited market — like Pfizer 's Lyrica , originally developed for seizures , it 's pretty genius business to make up a mysterious new ailment that a lot of people could potentially have or be scared they have .
Where do you think ADD came from ?
What about " bipolar disorder " ?
" Irritable bowel syndrome " ?
Oh sure , those diseases affect one in 1.5 Americans , and we have them too , but :
... Those figures are sharply disputed by those doctors who do not consider fibromyalgia a medically recognizable illness and who say that diagnosing the condition actually worsens suffering by causing patients to obsess over aches that other people simply tolerate .

But why tolerate when you can obsess ?
And speaking of obsessing , did you know ADD makes people obsessive ?
I should be done with this post already but I did n't have enough amphetamines today .
What about you ?
Drug Approved .
Is Disease Real ?

A California man pleaded guilty Friday to charges that he shut down the data center responsible for managing the state 's electrical supply .
Lonnie Denison , 33 , is now facing as much as five years in prison and a US $ 250,000 fine after admitting to breaking a glass cover and hitting the emergency " off " switch at the California Independent System Operator ( Cal - ISO ) data center in Folsom , California , on April 15 .
By doing so , he shut off the power in the data center .
He was formerly a contract Unix system administrator at the center .
Cal -ISO is the nonprofit organization that manages California 's power .
By knocking these systems offline , Denison effectively cut the state off from the energy market , leaving California vulnerable to blackout conditions .
No blackouts occurred , however , because the data center went down at 11:23 p.m. on a Sunday -- a time when electricity demand is typically at a lull .
" If this deliberate shut - off had occurred in the morning ... things would have been far more severe , " wrote Matthew Amant , the California Highway Patrol officer assigned to investigate the incident , in an affidavit .
It 's not clear why Denison would have wanted to flip the switch on California 's power , but according to U.S. attorneys , he was in a dispute with co-workers and just minutes before the incident had discovered that his computer privileges had been revoked .
Prosecutors allege that he followed up the power outage by sending an e-mail bomb threat the next day to an unnamed Cal - ISO employee , saying , " Hey , at one point I respected you ... you have a new kid .
So this is only because of him .
Get out before the timer expires .
Not long now .
Take care . "
Following this threat , Cal - ISO evacuated about 500 employees from all three of its Folsom campus buildings , transferring control of the grid to a second control center .
That same day Denison spoke with a friend , admitting that he had tried to " shut off the power grid , " according to a statement from the U.S. Department of Justice .
The Sunday night incident knocked the data center down for about two hours , but it took 20 computer technicians about seven hours to fully restore the system .
The total cost of the outage is estimated at $ 14,000 .
Denison , of Sacramento , California , is set to be sentenced on Feb. 29 , 2008 , in federal court .

The most haunting image shows a man-made fire pit , square in shape and enclosed by 12 concrete cinder blocks , a spot where investigators made a gruesome discovery last month .
The photo is part of a group of images released Monday night by officials looking for Cpl.
Cesar Laurean , a missing Marine who police think killed another Marine who had accused him of rape .
Police say they hope the images will help end a massive FBI manhunt for Laurean that has stretched from North Carolina , across the United States and perhaps into Mexico , where Laurean was born .
The photos were taken during a police investigation at Laurean 's home after his wife confided to authorities that Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach , a missing , pregnant 20 - year - old Marine who had accused her husband of rape at the Camp Lejeune military base , was dead and buried in their North Carolina backyard .
Crime scene investigators began to slowly excavate the fire pit , and within 24 hours , Onslow County Sheriff 's Office had released a grim statement confirming its initial suspicions .
" Charred human remains of an adult and a fetus were unearthed , " the statement read .
" There appeared to be the bodies of an adult female with a fetus located near the abdomen region of the female . "
Authorities also released images from inside the Laurean house , including the garage where they believe the murder took place " based on the blood and the interpretation of the blood spatters " on the walls .
The photos show a paint tray and 2 - foot square patch of wall that has been repainted .
An arrest warrant was issued for Laurean , but the 21 - year - old , who was raised in Nevada , was already on the run , thanks to the 24 hours his wife had waited before she contacted police .
Laurean is a naturalized U.S. citizen , but may have retained his Mexican citizenship as well .
Laurean reportedly had told fellow Marines in his unit that he would run to Mexico if he were found guilty by the military of raping Lauterbach .
" That 's definitely a viable place he could be , " Capt .
Rick Sutherland , the spokesman for the Onslow County Sheriff 's Office , told ABC News .
But Sutherland said that a high volume of tips have come in placing Laurean in the American Southwest and in states immediately surrounding North Carolina .
Tips that come in of possible sightings outside of Onslow County are turned over to the FBI , Sutherland said .
The FBI 's Charlotte bureau , Sutherland said , is serving as a clearinghouse for the search .
" We 've received a number of tips that we believe are credible and worth following up on , " Sutherland added .
Lauterbach was killed Dec. 15 by some type of blunt trauma to the head , a state medical examiner determined .
Last week , Onslow County Sheriff 's
Office authorities announced that a witness had turned in a weapon that may have been used in Lauterbach 's death , but would not confirm reports the suspected murder weapon was a crowbar .
This weekend , authorities teamed up with the TV show " America 's Most Wanted " and showed surveillance footage of Laurean and an unidentified man entering and exiting a Lowe 's home improvement store once on Dec. 16 and again on Dec. 24 .
Lauterbach had been last seen Dec. 14 and was reported missing by her family in her home state of Ohio , Dec. 19 .
In his shopping trips , Laurean purchased a wheelbarrow , paint and concrete blocks like the ones used to ring the fire pit .
Another image shows Laurean using Lauterbach 's card at an ATM machine Dec. 24 .
" It 's a possibility that some of these items were used to cover up a crime , " Sutherland said .
Sutherland told ABC
News that authorities have interviewed the friend seen in the Lowe 's videotape three times and that he is considered a " cooperating witness . "
Christine Laurean , the fugitive 's wife and a former Marine , has also been called a cooperating witness , even though she waited almost a day before notifying authorities .
Christine Laurean , the mother of the couple 's 18 - month - old , handed over notes left by her husband in which he claimed that Lauterbach had slit her own throat before he burned and buried her body .
Before he took off , Laurean told his wife that Lauterbach had demanded money from him so she could leave the area and that he bought her a bus ticket to El Paso , Texas , according to court documents released last week .
Lauterbach 's abandoned car was recovered at the bus stop , but the ticket to El Paso was never used .
Physical evidence suggests that Lauterbach was planning to leave Jacksonville on her own .
She had withdrew $ 700 from her bank account and packed personal belongings before leaving her off - base roommate with a note that read , " I could not take this Marine Corps life anymore .
So I am going away . "
Questions have also been raised about the status of the military 's rape investigation and whether military investigators believed that the rape allegations from March and April may be unfounded .
Marine Corps officials had said that Lauterbach told investigators in November that she no longer believed that Laurean was the father of the unborn child .
Laurean had been Lauterbach 's senior officer until she accused him of raping her .
He was never taken into custody because he denied the charge and there was no evidence to support the accusation , Marine Corps officials said last week .
The Marines first began searching for Lauterbach , Dec. 17 , after she failed to show up for her job as a military personnel clerk .
Mary Lauterbach , Maria 's mother , told the Dayton Daily News in an interview published Sunday that questions about her daughter 's credibility may have made her a vulnerable target in the events leading up to her death .
Mary Lauterbach chided her daughter for waiting a month before reporting the rape to her commanders .
" You realize you 've lost all your evidence now ? " she recounted asking her daughter in May .
The mother reportedly had reason to question her daughter 's credibility — she had to prove to Marines at Camp Lejeune that a story Maria Lauterbach had shared with fellow Marines about her father accidentally killing her brother when he was 6 years old was a lie .
When the Onslow County Sheriff 's Office asked Mary Lauterbach to write an e-mail telling investigators everything she could about her daughter , she admitted that her daughter " had problems with occasional compulsive lying " and that Maria Lauterbach 's biological father may have suffered from bipolar disorder .
Mary Lauterbach faced criticism when she made similar comments on " Good Morning America " Jan. 11 , the day her pregnant daughter 's remains were discovered .
If Laurean is found in Mexico , Onslow County District Attorney Dewey Hudson will not be able to pursue the death penalty on the murder charge .
According to the U.S. State Department , Mexico and the United States have a long - standing agreement not to seek extradition of suspects to face charges in the United States if they could face the death penalty .

Why are more men using prostitutes ?
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
Do the figures reflect changes in behaviour or honesty
The number of men paying women for sex has nearly doubled in a decade , says research .
Why ?
One in 10 of the 11,000 men asked in a survey in 2000 said he used prostitutes , compared with one in 20 in 1990 .
The figure is published for the first time in the latest edition of the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections .
But why such a sharp rise in just a decade ?
Dr Helen
Ward , lead author of the report , points to growing divorce rates , sex tourism like stag holidays and the increasing availability of commercial sex through such means as the internet .
She sees an increased commercialisation of sex in the media , such as " lad mags " .
Sex psychologist Dr Lesley Perman - Kerr , who was not involved with the report , acknowledges sex is shedding its taboo and wonders if men are more willing to own up .
" Maybe men are just more open about it .
Human beings do n't tend to change that much and there 's always been prostitutes and always been affairs . "
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular feature in the BBC News Magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
Ask a question Research carried out in 1949 claimed one in four men used prostitutes so in that context the latest figures do not seem so startling .
However there are changes in sexual attitudes which could have contributed to an increase , says Dr Perman - Kerr .
" Men and women are saying they want the sex life they want and they 're not prepared to put up with anything less .
" In my work I see that sex is one of the major issues within marriage and people are more prepared to talk about it , and I do n't see an enormous difference between men and women complaining about it , but men have an easier outlet .
" Sex without commitment is another feature of sex with a prostitute .
You can be who you want with who you want and very often people will not explore these things with a partner , even if it 's something as innocuous as dressing up in women 's clothes . "
Ready cash
While men have prostitutes to express themselves with , this is not so available for women so some use casual relationships instead , she says .
And while stag weekends and divorce rates are probably " irrelevant influences " , greater honesty among respondents must be considered .
Work pressures too could be a factor .
I would like to see the possibility of people expressing themselves without resorting to paid sex
Dr Lesley Perman-Kerr
Chartered psychologist " People are more overloaded with work and feel they do n't have time to form relationships but still want to have sex .
Money is n't the object but the desire to form a relationship with someone is not there .
And the internet has made it more available . "
But does it really matter if more men are seeing prostitutes ?
" I think it 's healthy for sexual expression but I do n't think it 's healthy to exploit people for sex or to have sexual practices that are harmful to another person , " says Dr Perman - Kerr .
" But I would like to see the possibility of people expressing themselves without resorting to paid sex .
That 's the revolution that needs to happen . "

We ’ve underestimated the Pythagorean theorem all along .
It ’s not about triangles ; it can apply to any shape .
It ’s not about a , b and c ; it applies to any formula with a squared term .
It ’s not about distance in the sense of walking diagonally across a room .
It ’s about any distance , like the “ distance ” between our movie preferences or colors .
If it can be measured , it can be compared with the Pythagorean Theorem .
Let ’s see why .
Understanding The Theorem
We agree the theorem works .
In any right triangle :
If a=3 and b=4 , then c=5 .
Easy , right ?
Well , a key observation is that a and b are at right angles ( notice the little red box ) .
Movement in one direction has no impact on the other .
It ’s a bit like North / South vs. East / West .
Moving North does not change your East / West direction , and vice - versa — the directions are independent ( the geek term is orthogonal ) .
The Pythagorean Theorem lets you use find the shortest path distance between orthogonal directions .
So it ’s not really about right triangles — it ’s about comparing “ things ” moving at right angles .
You :
If I walk 3 blocks East and 4 blocks North , how far am I from my starting point ?
Me : 5 blocks , as the crow flies .
Be sure to bring adequate provisions for your journey .
You : Uh , ok .
So what is “ c ” ?
Well , we could think of c as just a number , but that keeps us in boring triangle - land .
I like to think of c as a combination of a and b .
But it ’s not a simple combination like addition — after all , c does n’t equal a + b .
It ’s more a combination of components — the Pythagorean theorem lets us combine orthogonal components in a manner similar to addition .
And there ’s the magic .
In our example , C is 5 blocks of “ distance ” .
But it ’s more than that : it contains a combination of 3 blocks East and 4 blocks North .
Moving along C means you go East and North at the same time .
Neat way to think about it , eh ?
Chaining the Theorem
Let ’s get crazy and chain the theorem together .
Take a look at this :
Cool , eh ?
We draw another triangle in red , using c as one of the sides .
Since c and d are at right angles ( orthogonal ! ) , we get the Pythagorean relation : c2 + d2 = e2 .
And when we replace c2 with a 2 + b2 we get :
And that ’s something :
We ’ve written e in terms of 3 orthogonal components ( a , b and d ) .
Starting to see a pattern ?
Put on your 3D Goggles
Think two triangles are strange ?
Try pulling one out of the paper .
Instead of lining the triangles flat , tilt the red one up :
It ’s the same triangle , just facing a different way .
But now we ’re in 3d !
If we call the sides x , y and z instead of a , b and d we get :
Very nice .
In math we typically measure the x-coordinate [ left / right distance ] , the y - coordinate [ front - back distance ] , and the z - coordinate [ up / down distance ] .
And now we can find the 3 -d distance to a point given its coordinates !
Use Any Number of Dimensions
As you can guess , the Pythagorean Theorem generalizes to any number of dimensions .
That is , you can chain a bunch of triangles together and tally up the “ outside ” sections :
You can imagine that each triangle is in its own dimension .
If segments are at right angles , the theorem holds and the math works out .
How Distance Is Computed
The Pythagorean Theorem is the basis for computing distance between two points .
Consider two triangles :
Triangle with sides ( 4,3 ) [ blue ]
Triangle with sides ( 8,5 ) [ pink ]
What ’s the distance from the tip of the blue triangle [ at coordinates ( 4,3 ) ] to the tip of the red triangle [ at coordinates ( 8,5 ) ] ?
Well , we can create a virtual triangle between the endpoints by subtracting corresponding sides .
The hypotenuse of the virtual triangle is the distance between points :
Distance : $ ( 8 - 4 , 5 - 3 ) = ( 4,2 ) = \sqrt {4^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{20} = 4.47 $
Cool , eh ?
In 3D , we can find the distance between points $ ( x_1 , y_1, z_1 ) $ and $ ( x_2 , y_2, z_2 ) $ using the same approach :
And it does n’t matter if one side is bigger than the other , since the difference is squared and will be positive ( another great side - effect of the theorem ) .
How to Use Any Distance
The theorem is n’t limited to our narrow , spatial definition of distance .
It can apply to any orthogonal dimensions : space , time , movie tastes , colors , temperatures .
In fact , it can apply to any set of numbers ( a , b , c , d , e ) .
Let ’s take a look .
Measuring User Preferences
Let ’s say you do a survey to find movie preferences :
How did you like Rambo ?
( 1 - 10 ) How did you like Bambi ? ( 1 - 10 ) How did you like Seinfeld ? ( 1 - 10 )
How do we compare people ’s ratings ?
Find similar preferences ?
Pythagoras to the rescue !
If we represent ratings as a " point " ( Rambo , Bambi , Seinfeld ) we can represent our survey responses like this :
Tough Guy : ( 10 , 1 , 3 )
Average Joe : ( 5 , 5 , 5 )
Sensitive Guy : ( 1 , 10 , 7 )
And using the theorem , we can see how different people are :
Tough Guy to Average Joe : $ ( 10 – 5 , 1 – 5 , 3 – 5 ) = ( 5 , - 4 , - 2 ) = \ sqrt {
( 5 ) ^2 + ( - 4) ^2 + ( - 2) ^2 } = \sqrt{45} = 6.7 $
Tough Guy to Sensitive Guy : $ ( 10 – 1 , 1 – 10 , 3 – 7 ) = ( 9 , - 9 , - 4 ) = \ sqrt { ( 9 ) ^2 + ( - 9 ) ^2 + ( - 4) ^2 } = \sqrt{178} = 13.34 $
We can compute the results using a 2 + b2 + c2 = distance2 version of the theorem .
As we suspected , there ’s a large gap between the Tough and Sensitive Guy , with Average Joe in the middle .
The theorem helps us quantify this distance and do interesting things like cluster similar results .
This technique can be used to rate Netflix movie preferences and other types of collaborative filtering where you attempt to make predictions based on preferences ( i.e. Amazon recommendations ) .
In geek speak , we represented preferences as a vector , and use the theorem to find the distance between them ( and group similar items , perhaps ) .
Finding Color Distance
Measuring “ distance ” between colors is another useful application .
Colors are represented as red / green / blue ( RGB ) values from 0 ( min ) to 255 ( max ) .
For example
Black : ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) — no colors
White : ( 255 , 255 , 255 ) — maximum of each color
Red : ( 255 , 0 , 0 ) — pure red , no other colors
We can map out all colors in a “ color space ” , like so :
We can get distance between colors the usual way : get the distance from our ( red , green , blue ) value to black ( 0,0,0 ) [ formally labeled delta e ] .
It appears humans can’t tell the difference between colors only 4 units apart ; heck , even 30 units looks pretty close to me :
How similar do these look to you ?
The color distance gives us a quantifiable way to measure the distance between colors ( try for yourself ) .
You can even unscramble certain blurred images by cleverly applying color distance .
The Point : You can measure anything
If you can represent a set of characteristics with numbers , you can compare them with the theorem :
Temperatures during the week : ( Mon , Tues , Wed , Thurs , Fri ) .
Compare successive weeks to see how “ different ” they are ( find the difference between 5 - dimensional vectors ) .
Number of customers coming into a store hour - by - hour , day - by - day , or week - by - week
SpaceTime distance : ( latitude , longitude , altitude , date ) .
Useful if you ’re making a time machine ( or a video game that uses one ) !
Differences between people : ( Height , Weight , Age )
Differences between companies : ( Revenue , Profit , Market Cap )
You can tweak the distance by weighing traits differently ( i.e. , multiplying the age difference by a certain factor ) .
But the core idea is so important I ’ll repeat it again : if you can quantify it , you can compare it using the the Pythagorean Theorem .
Your x , y and z axes can represent any quantity .
And you are n’t limited to 3 dimensions .
Sure , mathematicians would love to tell you about the other ways to measure distance ( aka metric space ) , but the Pythagorean Theorem is the most famous and a great starting point .
So , What Just Happened Here ?
There ’s so much to learn when revisiting concepts we were “ taught ” .
Math is beautiful , but the elegance is usually buried under mechanical proofs and a wall of equations .
We do n’t need more proofs ; we need interesting , intuitive results .
For example , the Pythagorean Theorem :
Works for any shape , not just triangles ( like circles )
, not just triangles ( like circles )
Works for any equation with squares ( like 1/2 m v 2 )
( like 1/2 m v ) Generalizes to any number of dimensions ( a 2 + b 2 + c 2 + …)
( a + b + c + …)
Measures any type of distance ( i.e. between colors or movie preferences )
Not too bad for a 2000 - year old result , right ?
This is quite a brainful , so I ’ll finish here for today ( the previous article has more uses ) .
Happy math .
