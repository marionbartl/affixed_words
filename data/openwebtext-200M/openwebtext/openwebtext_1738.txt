​ A moment of truth for medical marijuana dispensaries will come this week when California ’s Fourth Appellate District Division Three will issue its opinion in the Qualified Patients vs. Anaheim case by July 19 .
The decision will come after a years - long appeal process closely watched by patients , advocates , politicians , lawyers , and the press .
California ’s localized approach to interpreting the state ’s medical marijuana law has some distinct drawbacks .
Among those is the fact acting identically can either lead to profits or to jail , depending where a patient lives , points out David Downs in the East Bay Express .
Cities in conservative areas — like Anaheim in Orange County — have effectively re-criminalized dispensaries , setting up an appeals court showdown scheduled to end sometime within the next week .
California ’s localized approach to interpreting the state ’s medical marijuana law has some distinct drawbacks .
Among those is the fact acting identically can either lead to profits or to jail , depending where a patient lives , points out David Downs in the
California cities cannot make growing and distributing medical marijuana illegal , according to Qualified Patients ’ lawyer Anthony Curiale , because Prop 215 ( passed by voters in 1996 ) and SB 420 ( in which the Assembly clarified and expanded the law in 2003 ) took away the criminal penalties for doing so .
If the three - judge appellate court decides in favor of Qualified Patients with sound legal reasoning , a precedent would be set which could then be used by lawyers across the Golden State in medical marijuana battleground cities like Los Angeles , San Diego , Santa Barbara , Costa Mesa , and San Jose .
But Anaheim City Attorney Moses W. Johnson said the city ’s ban on dispensaries has already stood up once in a trial court , and if it loses on appeal , Anaheim is threatening to take it all the way to the California Supreme Court .
Another possible outcome is that the appellate court could rule in favor of Qualified Patients , but issue an unpublished opinion inapplicable to other cities , according to Oakland attorney Joe Elford , counsel for Americans for Safe Access ( ASA ) .
“ We ’re hoping it ’ll be a bellwether case , but there ’s no guarantee , ” Elford said .
With the worse case scenario , in which Qualified Patients ’ appeal fails , California would become even more balkanized in its approach to medical cannabis .
With that sequence of events , it ’s likely that hard - line conservative cities like San Leandro would send even more local tax dollars to cities like Oakland that sensibly tax and regulate the $ 14 billion a year medical marijuana industry .

If you 're anything like me you probably like keeping your expenses to the minimum – while at the same time not sacrificing so much that you 're living an austere existence .
You do n't mind giving up eating out , as long as you 're eating well at home .
You do n't mind having a pre-paid cell phone , as long as you still have a wireless plan and decent phone .
You do n't mind reading books online for free , as long as you have some good entertainment .
Finally , you do n't mind not paying for cable tv , as long as you can still watch the shows that you enjoy watching .
Continues after Advertisement
This past year or two we employed a couple of different strategies ( legal ones ! ) in order to stick it to the cable company , and not pay for all the entertainment options we were enjoying .
In reality , if you want to , you can do the same thing at your house and get free TV .
Here 's how .
Watch TV Shows And Movies On The Computer – Online
The option that many people already know about is watching the TV and movies that you want to see via the internet .
There are a large number of video streaming services that will allow you to watch TV shows free either the day of , or within a few days of the episodes airing on regular TV .
Here are some streaming sites that will help you to cut the cord .
Here are a few of my favorite online video sites :
Hulu.com : Probably the best one out there in my opinion .
Does have commercials , but options are endless .
All my favorite shows show up here .

AOL Video : Both short and long video clips and full shows .
There are a ton of other free video sites out there , this list only lists some of the ones I found to be the best .
Have some free online video options that you use ?
Let us know about them in the comments and we 'll add them to the list .
Watch Free HDTV Over The Air
One option that a lot of people are just now realizing is the fact that you can watch all the major networks , and a variety of other public television stations free of charge over the wonderful new digital airwaves .
In fact , 94 of the top 100 shows are on broadcast TV !
The picture quality is HD and better than cable at times on broadcast TV , and all you need is a nice antenna and an HDTV tuner in order to pick up the shows .
In fact , if you 're not a big TV watcher you could get by with just the big 3 networks if you wanted to .
Here 's what we use for an antenna :
There are also a bunch of over - the - air DVRs available as well .
Over - the - air DVRS will allow you to watch live broadcast TV , record your favorite shows , or entire series .
Here are the two that I think are the best .
I have tried both and like them both .
We like some of the cable shows as well , however , so this option alone does n't cut it for us .
Watch TV Shows On Your TV Streamed Via Media Player
The option that has become the standard at our house for watching TV , movies via Netflix and a variety of other sources is a software called PlayOn .
PlayOn is basically a media streaming software that will pull the video streams from sites like Hulu.com , Youtube.com , network websites , MLB.TV , Netflix , Amazon Video and others and allow you to stream them over the home network , to a network media player attached to your TV .
PlayOn also has the ability to stream and record your favorite shows , and can even record streams of entire series from websites where you have memberships , like Netflix and Amazon .
So what do you need to set up a Playon media center ?
Network Media player :
Any number of media players will work to view the media on your TV including Xbox One , Playstation 4 , Wii , Chromecast , Fire TV , Roku .
Other supported devices can be found here .
We bought a refurbished Xbox 360 for extremely cheap on Ebay – works great !

Playon software :
The software is what allows you to stream all of your favorite online video sites straight to your TV over your home network .
The software does have multiple membership levels , including a $ 59.99 one time fee for a lifetime subscription , which includes the ability to record shows .
A bargain in my estimation .

Computer :
You 'll need a home computer that is connected to your home network that will run the Playon software and serve the video to your network media player .
The graphic below gives you an idea of how it works .
We 've been using our Playon media setup for years now , and it works great .
In fact we just watched all the seasons of Walking Dead in the past few months using this setup .
I highly recommend it .
It works well because using this setup we do n't need to have a computer directly connected to the TV , and we can use our regular Logitech Harmony remote to navigate shows , pause and play , etc on the console .
Other Media Hubs
Other options include popular media hubs :
Media Hub Myth TV : Another popular Digital Video Recorder and home media center hub that you can install on your PC is Myth TV .

Plex.TV : Plex Media
Server allows you to put all your media in one place and view it on all your devices .
I recently purchased a lifetime subscription to Plex .
I rip shows from our Tablo DVR and view them on all our devices via Plex .
Computer Directly Connected To Your TV
One of the more popular options for watching streamed TV shows leaves out the media streaming software and network media device altogether , and has you just connecting your desktop or laptop directly to your HDTV .
With this option you all you need is a TV and a desktop or laptop with a video output .
Our laptop has a HDMI output , so it works well to connect it to our HDTV if we want .
Here is how you can use your computer when directly hooked up to the TV :
Navigate Computer With Mouse & Keyboard :
You connect your computer to the HDTV ( for the big screen ) and then proceed to go to your favorite websites like hulu.com , Netflix and others ( see some options above ) to view your shows .
You can use the Hulu Desktop application .
You can also watch shows that you 've downloaded from Amazon , Itunes or other online video sources – or your own videos .
You will most likely need a wireless keyboard and mouse to make this easy – although it is n't required .
Watch TV And Movies On DVD & Streaming
Another great offline option for watching TV and movies is just watching them on DVD !
Yes , I know that 's so 2000 .
There are plenty of low cost or free options for watching movies and TV shows .
Here are a few :
Redbox : Redbox allows you to rent a new release movie for $ 1 a night , which is an extremely low cost movie rental option .
They are showing up just about everywhere including gas stations , grocery stores and Walmarts everywhere .
Search for coupon codes online for free redbox rentals , and it can be even cheaper !

Your Local Library :
Your local library will most likely have a decent selection of DVD movies that you can check out for a week or more .
In fact , many libraries will actually buy copies of new releases that you can reserve .
My local library tends to be a bit picked over , but if you get on a waiting list you can usually find movies or TV shows you ’d enjoy watching .

They may as well get some use out of that large DVD library they paid so much for !
Conclusion
As you can see from the post above , there a million and one ways to watch TV , movies and other video entertainment , as long as you get creative .
It does n't have to cost an arm and a leg like the cable and satellite companies want you to think .
In fact , it can be rather affordable .
So get crackin !
Note :
One of the few glaring holes in this whole plan is that finding live sports via an online source can be difficult or next to impossible .
If you 're a big sports fan , until new options become available , you may end up having to pay for cable anyway .
Sorry !
Do you have other suggestions for free or cheap ways to watch TV ?
What setup do you have at your house , or do you still pay for cable or satellite TV ?
Are there shows that you think you ca n’t get by using these free video options ( like sports ) ?

Earth - like exoplanets could announce their presence through trailing clumps of dust – and new observations of the Earth 's own dust cloud could provide a way to find them .
Over the course of five years , the Spitzer Space Telescope drifted through a diffuse but extensive ring of dust particles that orbit the sun in lockstep with the Earth , showing astronomers for the first time what the dusty signature of an exo -Earth might look like .
" For the first time we can measure the structure of that cloud along the Earth 's orbit , using this moving space probe that travels through the cloud , " said astronomer William T. Reach of the Universities Space Research Association , the author of a paper to appear in the journal Icarus .
" We can use that as a key , as a template , to understand the dust around other stars . "
The observations showed that a ring of dust from comet tails and broken asteroids follows the Earth in its orbit , something astronomers had already suspected .
The dust particles are about 0.02 millimeters in diameter or larger .
An extra - thick cloud of these particles about 7 million miles wide trails behind the Earth at about 80 times the distance from the Earth to the moon .
Spitzer , which follows the Earth in orbit around the sun , sent images from directly inside this cloud from its launch in 2003 until its coolant ran out in 2009 .
Astronomers ' first whiff of this trailing dust clump came in 1984 , when the IRAS spacecraft showed that the sky is brighter in infrared wavelengths when looking backward along the Earth 's orbit than when looking forward .
Because dust glows in the infrared , the lightened sky was a clear sign that more dust follows the planet than leads it .
" We could n’t figure out for the life of us what the hell was going on , " said astronomer Mark Sykes , now the director of the Planetary Science Institute in Arizona , who worked on the IRAS project .
No good explanations emerged until the early '90s , when astronomer Sumita Jayaraman , also now at the Planetary Science Institute , realized that individual dust particles could get temporarily trapped in a special gravitational relationship called a resonant orbit with Earth .
Most of the dust in the plane of the solar system , called the zodiacal cloud , will eventually spiral into the sun .
But particles of the right size , tens of micrometers across , can feel a little gravitational push as they float by the Earth .
That push counteracts the sun 's pull just enough to hold the dust particles in a loose halo around the sun .
The subtle interactions of the Earth and the dust grains ' movements lead to the backward - facing clump .
Mathematical models of the dust ring gave astronomers an idea of the clump 's extent , but the Spitzer observations were the first chance to test them .
" This work is great because it provides us a novel way of probing the structure of this cloud , which could then feed back into these detailed dynamical models of the dust , " Sykes said .
The observations can feed models of what dust rings associated with extrasolar planets might look like .
Of the few extrasolar planets to have their pictures taken by direct imaging , at least two hinted at their presence by warping the disk of dust and gas around their star .
Earth - like planets that are too small or dim to find through usual methods may have a subtle but detectable influence on their dust disks .
" It 's a way that we can recognize planets around other stars that we can't necessarily see , " said NASA exoplanet scientist Marc Kuchner .
" This result make it much easier to compare solar system dust clouds with ones we see in the disks . "
But the dust can be misleading too , Kuchner warns .
" They can be bad news if you 're trying to directly image a planet , because they can masquerade as planets themselves , " he said .
" It 's both the signal and the noise . "

Image caption Construction of the Iter reactor will take place at Cadarache in Southern France
The European Union and six member states have reached a deal on the financing and timetable for an experimental nuclear fusion reactor .
An explosion in costs had cast a cloud over the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ( Iter ) .
The project , which is to be based in Cadarache in southern France , aims to harness the same physical process that fuels the Sun .
Additional construction funds will have to come from within the EU 's budget .
The extra 1.4bn euros will cover a shortfall in building costs in 2012 - 13 .
Delegates agreed that the overall costs of the project will be almost US $ 21bn , ( 16bn euros / £ 13bn ) , some three times the original price .
They also agreed a timeline that would see the first plasma experiments in 2019 , with a fusion reactor generating significantly more power than it consumed by 2026 / 27 .
' Landmark ' day
The organisation also appointed a new director general , Professor Osamu Motojima , who said that he believed the new timeline and budget agreed in Cadarache would make fusion a reality .
The end of ITER would not mean the end of plasma physics or fusion research , just the end of that project which was ill conceived Professor Jacques Treiner , Paris University
" Today is a landmark day for the Iter project , now we are moving into the real construction phase , " he said .
Four years ago , the EU , Russia , China , India , Japan , Korea and the US picked Cadarache in the south of France as the location for the experiment that aimed to produce energy from the fusing of light atomic elements , the same process that makes the Sun shine .
But since the science of how to achieve this type of fusion has n't been settled , the plans for the Iter project have been the subject of several revisions in recent years , each one leading to an increased price tag .
Coupled with the increases in costs for raw materials like steel and cement , the budget for the project has spiralled from around 5 bn euros to about 16bn euros , as confirmed today .
The EU has agreed to meet a critical short term shortfall of 1.4bn euros by using money that has been allocated to other research programmes .
But the EU has said it will cap its overall contribution to Iter at 6.6bn euros , leaving the fusion project to find cuts in costs of around 600 m euros .
" To meet this we need to reduce the construction costs and also reduce some contingency provisions , " said Professor Motojima .
" Cost containment is very important .
To get understanding from public we need to reduce costs as much as possible ; realising this is my largest responsibility , " he observed .
" My basic attitude to realise cost containment is to simplify everything , I propose to simplify a new management structure of the organisation . "
Professor Motojima agreed that there would be no more bailout in future .
" It 's impossible to look for more money .
My expectation is that we can do this within our budgets .
I have the prospect we can do this , otherwise I would n't accept my new responsibility . "
The director of research in nuclear energy at the European Commission , Octavio Quintana Trias , suggested that Wednesday marked a landmark for Iter in coming to terms with reality .
" The most important thing is that the designs which were conceptual in 2001 , now are much closer to the reality of the industry .
I can guarantee nothing but it is less likely that we will have cost surprises when the designs are much closer to the reality than they were ten years ago . "
Mr Quintana Trias said that the while Wednesday 's meeting was a major step forward for research , a commercial fusion reactor would n't happen until 2040 at the earliest .
But despite the large rise in costs , he added that he believed the investment was worth it .
" If you consider the total costs of the machine even in the worst scenario are the bill we pay for energy for one day in the world , then to get a new energy source for this price I think is worth trying . "
Cost concerns
In Europe , some scientists are unhappy with the EU proposal to take funds from unspent budgets to bail Iter out .
In France , a group of physicists - including Nobel prize winner Georges Charpak - have written a letter to the press calling Iter a catastrophe and arguing that it should be shut down .
They suggest that making up the shortfall in Iter 's budget is costing France alone the equivalent of 20 years investment in physics and biology .
According to one of the signatories , Professor Jacques Treiner from Paris University , it was time to call a halt to Iter before any more money was spent .
" The end of Iter would not mean the end of plasma physics or fusion research , just the end of that project which was ill conceived , " Professor Treiner said .
" At a certain point especially when they say they will take money from other fields to fund this one you have to say , really a clear answer and the answer is no , do n't do that . "
In my previous post , we saw how multi- parameter type classes with functional dependencies in Haskell allow us to do type - level programming in a logic programming style .
( If you ’re not clear on why this corresponds to a logic programming style , see the ensuing discussion on reddit , where others explained it much better than I did in my post . )
However , MPTCs +
FDs were n’t the last word on type - level programming .
In 2007 , along came type families .
Essentially , type families allow us to write functions on types .
For example , here ’s how we would implement the same Plus function from the last post , this time using type families :
data Z data S n type family Plus m n :: * type instance Plus Z n = n type instance Plus ( S m ) n = S ( Plus m n )
This says that for any types m and n , Plus m n is type of kind * .
But it is n’t a new type , it ’s just an alias for some existing type .
It ’s instructive to think carefully about the difference between this and type synonyms .
After all , using a type synonym declaration , we can already make Plus m n an alias for some existing type , right ?
Well , yes , but the difference is that a type synonym does n’t get to look at its arguments .
The technical term for this is that type synonyms must be parametric .
So , for example , we can say
type Foo m n = [ ( m , Maybe n ) ]
which defines the type synonym
Foo uniformly for all arguments m and n , but using only type synonyms we cannot say
type Foo m Int = [ m ] type Foo m Char = Maybe m
where Foo acts differently depending on what its second argument is .
However , this is precisely what type families allow us to do — to declare type synonyms that do pattern - matching on their type arguments .
Looking back at the Plus example above , we can see that it evaluates to different types depending on whether its first argument is Z or S n .
Notice also that it is essentially identical to the way we would implement addition on regular value - level natural numbers , using pattern - matching on the first argument and a recursive call in the successor case :
data Nat = Z | S Nat plus :: Nat -> Nat ->
Nat plus Z n = n plus ( S m ) n = S ( plus m n )
Let ’s check that Plus works as advertised :
* Main > :t undefined :: Plus ( S Z ) ( S Z ) undefined :: Plus ( S Z ) ( S Z ) :: Plus ( S Z ) ( S Z )
Well , unfortunately , as a minor technical point , we can see from the above that ghci does n’t expand the type family for us .
The only way I currently know how to force it to expand the type family is to generate a suitable error message :
* Main > undefined :: Plus ( S Z ) ( S Z ) ... No instance for ( Show ( S ( S Z ) ) ) ...
This is ugly , but it works : S ( S Z ) is the reduced form of Plus ( S Z ) ( S Z ) .
So type families let us program in a functional style .
This is nice —
I daresay most Haskell programmers will be more comfortable only having to use a single coding style for both the value level and the type level .
There are a few cases where a logic programming style can be quite convenient ( for example , with an additional functional dependency we can use the Plus type class from the last post to compute both addition and subtraction ) , but in my opinion , the functional style is a huge win in most cases .
( And , do n’t worry , FDs and TFs are equivalent in expressiveness . )
Of course , there is a lot more to all of this ; for example , I have n’t even mentioned data families or associated types .
For more , I recommend reading the excellent tutorial by Oleg Kiselyov , Ken Shan , and Simon Peyton Jones , or the page on the GHC wiki .
For full technical details , you can look at the System FC paper .
Nothing is ever perfect , though — in my next post , I ’ll explain what type families still leave to be desired , and what we ’re doing to improve things .

Lilach Shem - Tov , whose three children were murdered by their father on Saturday says her goal in life is for her ex-husband Itay Ben - Dror " to sit behind bars .
After that I will join my children .
A mother does n't abandon her children . "
On Saturday , after she learned about the murder , Lilach told her acquaintances : " If you loved me , you 'd let me die .
I have nothing to live for anymore .
I want to die . "
Shocking Murder Triple murder : Dad lay beside kids ' lifeless bodies for 10 hours Raanan Ben-Zur Itay Ben Dror , who confessed to brutal murder of his three children , says act was premeditated , driven by ex-wife 's refusal to take him back and her plans to celebrate birthday with new boyfriend Triple murder : Dad lay beside kids ' lifeless bodies for 10 hours
Meanwhile Sunday , Judge Liora Frenkel decided to extend Ben - Dror 's remand by 10 days .
The judge decided to send Ben - Dror to an initial psychiatric evaluation , despite the police 's objection .
The examination 's results will be received Tuesday .
Judge Frenkel wrote in her ruling that " this is a shocking , painful and terrible case .
As I read the investigation material , my heart cries . "
' The authorities said he was okay '
" I have nothing left to live for .
My life has been stopped at the age of 38 , " the mother told Ynet on Sunday , recounting the events of the recent months .
" Last July he attacked me and said that the weeds in my house must be removed and laid on my grave .
Then there was another incident with a knife , which he tried to bring into my home .
I reported it to the authorities , and he promised not to do anything , neither to me nor to the children .
" The authorities said he was back on track , that the children loved him and he loved them , and that I could let him have them .
They told me , ' Do n't engage in a war in front of the children ; leave the war for the court . ' "

Lilach is filled with bitterness against those who accused her of being partially responsible for the disaster .
" I woke up in the morning and the newspaper said that the writing was on the wall , " she said .
" I am tormented as it is .
I wo n't be abased as well .
I trusted the authorities and the professionals ; they told me he was okay .
I would n't have helped him murder them .
I thought he loved them . "
The Welfare and Social Services Ministry said Sunday that it had found no failures in its treatment of Ben - Dror 's case .
The ministry cited an expert opinion submitted by the treating psychiatrist , who said earlier this year that the father should be allowed to see his kids .
A Kfar Yona welfare official told
Ynet that the mother 's claims , by which the authorities had threatened her to allow Ben - Dror to see his children unsupervised , were false .
" Treatment of the family and the visitation rights were settled according to professional opinions , " he said .
Earlier Sunday , Lilach told Army Radio about her ex-husband 's mental problems and the tense relations with him since the divorce .
She spoke about the battle over alimony and visitation rights and how he had threatened her and the children .
Nonetheless , she said , she gave in and let him see them in a bid to prevent an ugly battle in front of them .
" I wanted them to have a father , " she cried .
" I did n't know I was giving them to a murderer .
They took all my … my three flowers .
They were such good children .
I waited three years with fertility treatments until happiness came to me .
Why was it taken away from me on my birthday of all days ?
How am I supposed to feel ?
Responding to claims made by Ben - Dror 's relatives , that the murder was the result of insanity , she clarified : " He is not a mental patient , but a manipulative person . "

In previous articles , we discussed seven types of designers and seven types of developers .
Designers and developers form two parts of the design trinity : the client completes it .
You can have the technology to build something and the design to make it magnificent , but if someone does n’t fund the project , it usually falls flat .
No one has the time to do such a thing for fun .
Designers and developers need clients to build their portfolio , sustain their lifestyle and grow and learn .
Not all clients are difficult , so we ’ll try not to stereotype .
But in all honesty , the perfect client needs no introduction or description .
The perfect client is rare , though not extinct .
Today ’s article focuses on seven types of clients who are n’t so perfect .
You can decide for yourself which of them are the lesser evils .
Common comments from clients :
“ I want this done as well and as cheaply as possible . ”
“ This should be easy to do right . ” “ I know of others who would do it for free , so please hurry up . ”
“ Do n’t freelancers work for free ? ” “ I need a professional - looking and functional website , but I can only pay you when I start earning from it . ”
Spotting the 7 Types of Clients
You have probably encountered all kinds of clients in your time .
You may have worked with clients from hell , and you may have been lucky to work with amiable and respectful clients .
We need clients to sustain our business and to build our portfolio and reputation .
Sometimes we have the luxury of choosing which projects to take on and which clients to work with .
So , who are these seven ?
1. The Word -Breaker
“ Promises are made to be broken , ” says the word - breaker .
Word - breaking clients remind us just how important it is to write a contract prior to commencing a project .
Sometimes , though , even legal contracts do not prevent these clients from breaking their word .
The word - breaker is dishonorable and can side - step the agreements in a contract .
He expects you to honor your end but has no intention of fulfilling his own commitments .
The word - breaker is glib and charming , and he manipulates people into doing his bidding .
He is always right in his own eyes and works hard to keep the upper hand .
Be careful when dealing with the word - breaker because when something goes wrong , you will be the target in his firing range , and he will not hesitate to shoot you dead .
Client : “ I ’m the client !
You ca n’t make me agree to your schedule ! ”
Freelancer : “ But it ’s in the contract you signed . ”
Client : “ That was a month ago — this is now ! ” Freelancer : “ You ’ve changed your mind ?
Well , I could walk you through the creation process and explain why the schedule and the fee are as they are . ”
Client : “ I do n’t care .
I ’m the client . ”
2. The Garbage Collector
Less is not more — at least , not in the world of the garbage collector .
As freelancers , we always hope that our clients have an idea of what they want , but the garbage collector goes to the extreme ; prior to approaching you with his project , he has done plenty of research and assembled all of the designs that he likes .
This kind of person goes to a buffet and puts a little of everything on his plate .
The garbage collector gathers all of the effects , functions and designs that have caught his eye and will insist that you include them in his project .
The concept of usability is lost on him , even though you repeatedly try to explain it .
It ’s his way or the highway .
This type of client wants a construction worker , not a designer .
“ Do or do not ; there is no try , ” insists the garbage collector .
Client : “ I hear a lot of new web technology has come out since we last spoke .
Can you put all of it in our website ? ”
Freelancer : “ Err , you ’re wo n’t need all of it , and more features will cost you more . ”
Client : “ Then add $ 10 to the total cost .
I ’ll also need you to help me fill in the content , write a couple of articles and set up a marketing campaign for this . ”
3. The Clueless Child
On the opposite end of the spectrum is the clueless child .
Like a child with a short attention span , he is indecisive and ignorant .
Working with the clueless child might not seem so bad at the beginning ; he is agreeable and relies on your expertise .
Problems arise after your initial agreement on the details of the project — when he starts to change his mind .
His interest was piqued by the details of the project , and now the clueless child is not so ignorant .
Perhaps he has been hit by a sudden epiphany or has received feedback from friends , co-workers or other experts .
He calls you in the middle of the night — whenever inspiration strikes — to tell you that he wants certain changes made .
It does n’t end there .
You make the changes he wants , and when he comes to view the project he brings his mother along .
She then suggests more changes .
After all , “ Mom knows best . ”
Client : “ We want something that looks professional . ”
Freelancer : “ Okay . ” Client ( three hours later , after you have sent proofs ) : “ Get rid of that image and add this instead . ”
Freelancer : “ Okay . ” Client : “ The blue is n’t right . ”
Freelancer : “ What Pantone color are we trying to match ? ” Client : “ Oh , you know — the color of the Miami sky at daybreak . ”
4 . The Queen of Hearts
Be prepared to be at the beck and call of the queen of hearts .
A royal decree must always be obeyed , and the queen is of the opinion that you are blessed to be showered by her favor .
She has no concept of weekends , public holidays or time itself .
A summons in the middle of the night is a common occurrence .
Your loyalty is expected , your respect demanded .
The queen of hearts wants you to fix all her problems , and she wants it done yesterday .
She wants you to be a designer , developer , technician , networker , anti-virus expert , plumber and even nanny .
Her wish is your command .
And do n’t expect to be paid extra — for she is your queen ; obedience is your privilege .
Just learn to say , “ Yes , your majesty . ”
And learn it fast or it ’s “ Off with his head ! ”
Client ( calling at five minutes to midnight ) : “ It ’s not too late , is it ?
I Googled my name , and there is some nasty stuff about me on the Internet .
This guy saying on his blog that I am an idiot .
I want you to remove that blog and block the Internet if they keep writing crap about me . ”
Freelancer : “ I ca n’t do that . ”
Client : “ Well , get someone else to do it then .
I want all nasty stuff about me removed from the Internet today .
And make sure no one can write bad things about me again .
I want you to control the Internet . ”
Freelancer : “ I ca n’t control it , and neither can you . ”
Client : “ Well , if you wo n’t do it , then I ’ll find someone who will . ”
Freelancer : “ Good luck .
Let me know how that goes . ”
5 . The Smart Aleck
The smart aleck thinks he knows it all .
This client probably has an interest in design and has read a couple of books about it .
He sticks his nose in the air and looks down at you from his pedestal .
The smart aleck feels compelled to interfere because he wants his “ expert views ” to be taken into consideration .
The truth is : the smart aleck knows very little about design .
He is arrogant , shows blatant disrespect and does n’t think it beneath him to order you around and insist that his ideas are better than yours .
He tells you everything without really saying anything .
He has particular ideas about what he wants but never communicates them explicitly .
“ It ’s so easy even a monkey could do it , ” he claims .
Client : “ I ’ve studied design , so basically I know what I want . ”
Freelancer : “ Sure .
What do you want exactly ? ”
Client : “ You ’re the designer .
You come up with the idea — but it better match mine . ”
Freelancer : ( in astonished silence ) .
6 . The Nitpicker
The nitpicker might seem a tad meticulous during the negotiation phase , but he appears normal on the whole .
When you start production and show him your progress , though , you ’ll see this client ’s true colors .
“ Hold it right there !
I ’ve got a bone to pick with you , ” says the nitpicker .
There is always something wrong with what you ’ve done : the color is not what he envisioned , the border is a few pixels too wide , the images are not as exciting as he expected .
The nitpicker scrutinizes your work and never fails to find fault with it .
His grip on the project is tighter than a noose .
One could call him a perfectionist , but the truth is he ’s just trying to get his money ’s worth by ensuring that you work doubly hard for the money that you will wrench from his cold unwilling hands .
Client : “ The site looks great , but I need you to do it again . ”
Freelancer : “ Um , okay .
What for ? ” Client : “ You know !
You made the website on a Mac , so you need to make another one on a PC for people who do n’t use fancy computers like you . ”
7. The Scrooge
The scrooge wants everything for nothing .
Discounts , freebies and sales make him happy .
Even if he does n’t need it , he wants to get his hands on a free item “ just in case . ”
Like his namesake , this client is a money - pincher who gives you all kinds of trouble on payday .
Even prior to payday , expect plenty of issues with payment .
And expect to battle for months with the scrooge over final payment for the project — you can certainly expect him to want the agreed - upon amount to be heavily discounted .
The scrooge is the ideal person to bring to a bargaining market , but pray he is on your side and not the other .
When the project is completed and it ’s time for the scrooge to cough up , you ’re in for a surprise .
He is not afraid to renege on your fees , and he insists on further discounts , despite your unwillingness .
In his attempt to save money and reduce costs , he suggests a barter system or offers a monetary equivalent from his belongings .
Expect the unexpected .
Once you ’ve been paid and are nearly out of earshot , the scrooge inevitably murmurs , “ Bah , humbug ! ”
The war is n’t over either .
Your dealings with the scrooge could be lifelong .
He expects you to fix everything that crops up with his website , so do n’t be surprised if the scope of your job expands over time .
Freelancer : “ Here ’s the invoice for $ 400 . ” Client : “ Okay , thanks . ”
Three days pass .
Freelancer : “ I think you made a mistake .
You paid only $ 300 . ” Client : “ No , I gave myself a discount . ”
Freelancer : “ I never agreed to a discount . ” Client : “ Well , we wo n’t be using the design anyway . ”
Clients : Devil Incarnate ?
Are all clients mean and pushy ?
Have you encountered clients who break the above stereotypes and are real gems ?
If you have , then you ’re a lucky one .
Every client has a different level of knowledge of design and development .
They also have different expectations .
Not every client will appreciate your attempts to educate them on web design .
Some will take the designer or developer for granted and try to bully them .
Still , blaming the clients entirely is not fair .
They have been coddled and spoiled by designers and developers who condoned their methods and encouraged their outrageous behavior .
If we want our industry to be fair and just , everyone has to do their part to prevent bullying .
We are all responsible for the atmosphere of the industry .

Of the clients mentioned above , which do you detest the most ?
If you have a horror story of your own , feel free to vent in the comments section below .
We are happy to hear about your client woes .
Grocery store workers still testing positive for COVID - 19 in SWFL
Publix has now confirmed a little more than 50 locations in Lee and Collier where employees have contracted the virus .
There exist two ways of writing numbers smaller than 1 : ordinary fractions and decimal fractions .
For example : 1 / 2 = 0.5
1 / 8 = 0.125
2 / 3 = 0.66666 ....
3 / 7 = 0.428571 428571 ...
In general we prefer to use decimal fractions , for a number of reasons : Addition is much easier .
Looking at two decimal fractions , we can at once tell which is bigger , whereas with ordinary fractions it is not always easy .
Using decimal fraction , any number - - for instance , any square root -- can be expressed as accurately as we wish , by using a sufficient number of decimals .
The symbol for square roots is √ , so : √ 2 = 1.414213562 ...
√ 3 = 1.732050808 ... also
e = 2.718281828459 ... ( more about this , later )
π = 3.141592654 ...
Actually ( 3 ) is not completely accurate : there does exist a way of representing √ 2 or π by ordinary fractions to any desired accuracy , in such a way that the accuracy depends on where we decide to stop the process ( like the place where we decide to cut off the decimal fraction ) .
It is called a continued fraction .
The easiest way to explain it is by an actual example .
You will need a good hand - held calculator -- the more decimals it gives , the better -- and you should use it to verify all the steps below .
Take p , the ratio between the circumference of a circle and its diameter .
To the 11th decimal it equals π = 3.14159265359 ...
Easy to write down , just remember the sentence :
Yes , I have a super motorbike to travel about the roads foolishly .
You then count the letters of each word ; actually , the comma may also belong , since in many countries a comma is used as decimal point .
The trick in deriving continued fractions is to Keep dividing numbers into integer part and fractional part .
Invert the fractional part , and when inverting , remember that for instance 17 = 1
1 / 17 and similarly for any number x = 1
1 / x
Many calculators have a " 1/ x " button which comes very handy here .
Let us work now with only 8 decimals : π = 3.14159265 = 3 + 0.14159265 = 3 + 1
1 / 0.14159265 = 3 + 1
7.0625133 = 3 + 1
1 / ( 7 + 0.0625133 ) = 3 + 1
7 + 1
( 1 / .0625133 ) = 3 + 1
7 + 1
15.9966
One would guess at this point that 3 + 1
7 + 1
16 is a very good approximation , and as we 'll see , it really is .
We may continue , but it pays to simplify the notation , before those fraction bars become unmanageable .
Multiple fractions may be more easily written with slash bars 3 + 1/( 7 + ( 1/15.9966 ) ) and that is the notation adopted from here on ( if you prefer fraction bars , please transcribe onto paper ! ) .
Mathematicians may write 3 + 1 1
7 + 15.9966 with the " + " sign at the level of the denominator .
That is not recommended to anyone not familiar with the notation , or whose handwriting tends to wander .
π = 3 + 1/( 7 + ( 1/15.9966 ) ) = 3 + 1/( 7 + ( 1/( 15 + 0.9966 ) ) ) = 3 + 1/( 7 + ( 1/(15 +(1/1.0034 ) ) ) ) = 3 + 1/( 7 + ( 1/( 15 +( 1/( 1 + 0034 ) ) ) ) ) = 3 + 1/( 7 + ( 1/( 15 +( 1/(1 +( 1/292.62 ) ) ) ) )
We can stop here , dropping the extra decimals ( the process could go on with no limits except those of paper and patience ) .
Because we made an approximation , we now must use ~ which means " is approximately equal to " π ~ 3 + 1/( 7 + ( 1/( 15 +( 1/(1 +( 1/292 ) ) ) ) ) or in mathematical notation 3 + 1 1 1 1
7 +15 +1 +292
The number 1/292 is so small ( compared to 1 to which it is added ) that we may guess ( rightly ) that dropping it causes only a minor error .
Dropping it and rearranging the lowest denominator , brings us back to the earlier guess 3 + 1
7 + 1
16 Let us see what one gets by cutting this off at various places .
Cutting off all fractions gives π ~ 3 which is a very crude approximation , although it is used in the bible ( 1st Kings , ch. 7 , verse 23 ) .
The next one is very widely used : π ~ 3 1/7 = 22/7 = 3.14285 ...
It is accurate to better than one part in 1000 .
Next step : π ~ 3 + 1
7 + 1
16 = 3 + 1 . = 3 + 16 = 355 = 3.14159292 ...
113/16 113 113 which gets us 6 decimals !
To remember this result , just write the first 3 odd numbers , and double up each of them : 1 1 3 3 5 5
Divide in the middle , insert a fraction bar and you have it .
By continuing the process far enough , π can be approximated by a continuous fraction to any desired accuracy , and so can any other number .
In practical use , as noted , decimal fractions are much easier , but continuous fractions have some advantages too .
Consider fractions which need infinite decimals for their representation : 1/3 = 0.33333 ... 1/11 = 0.090909 ...
1/13 = 0.076923 076923 ... and so on : they always contain a repeating pattern .
Not so with most square roots .
One gets √ ( 2 ) = 1.414213562 ... √ ( 3 ) = 1.732050808 ... with no repetitions .
If however you try to represent these square roots by continued fractions , you will find a pattern .
Try it !
Surprise !
You will even find a pattern if you do this with e = 2.718281828459 ...
This number is just as fundamental to more advanced mathematics as π .
It arises if one calculates the sequence of values E N , one for each integer N : E N = [ 1 + ( 1 / N ) ]
N
As N gets larger , E N is found to get closer and closer to a limiting value , and that is the number e. Consider any number X raised to the N - th power , forming XN .
If X is larger than 1 , its powers grow larger and larger as N increases , without any limit .
One can say that when N becomes infinite , XN also becomes infinite .
On the other hand , if X=1 , raised to any power it remains equal to 1 : 1N=1 , even if N approaches infinity .
So what is one to make of E N = [ 1 + ( 1 / N ) ]
N ?
The number raised to the Nth power is larger than 1 , so as N grows towards infinity , one might expect its
Nth power to grow without limit -- except that at the same time the number itself gets closer and closer to 1 !
The answer is , it goes to a limit which is neither 1 nor infinity , but something in between , a number between 2 and 3 , denoted e.
Proving that is hard , but it is easy to demonstrate it on a calculator , especially if yours has on it a button that can raise numbers to arbitrary powers : N = 10 ( 1 + 1/10 ) 10 = ( 1.1 ) 10 = 2.593742 ... N = 100 ( 1 + 1/100) 100 = ( 1.01 ) 100 = 2.7048128 ... N = 1000 ( 1 + 1/1000 ) 1000 = ( 1.001 ) 1000 = 2.7169239 ...
If your calculator only has a button " X2 " which gives square powers of whatever number X you have entered , that is enough too .
Push it twice and you get X4 ( since 22=4 ) .
Push it 3 times and you get X8 , since 23=8 , 4 times for X16 ( 24=16 ) , and so on .
By pushing the button N times , you raise the given number X to the power 2N .
Let N=10 , then 210=1024 ( you can multiply 2 by itself 9 more times and check ! ) .
To calculate ( 1 + 1 ) 1024
1024 simply obtain 1 + ( 1/1024 ) and then push the squaring button 10 times ; the result should be 2.7169557 ....
Of course , it is not far from ( 1.001 ) 1000 obtained above .
You can now go on : 220 = ( 1024 ) 2 = 1048576 .
Key in ( 1 + 1 )
1048576 and push the squaring button 20 times .
You should get e correct to 4 decimals .
And now that you know about e , try to express it in a continued fraction !

Hi all ,
The Snap team is pleased to announce the release of Snap 0.2.8 .
Changes since 0.2.7
Improvements :
Changed the way that snap - server handles its thread table in the libev backend .
The old code was causing blackhole / lock contention on the shared table ; we switched to a new concurrent hash map container type , which improved performance on the “ PONG ” benchmark from ~ 16 k req/s to about ~ 22 k req/s on mightybyte ’s machine ( a > 35 % improvement ! ) .
Changes in behaviour :
Obama Polling Badly Against Prospective 2012 Opponents
The results of a new poll may have President Obama worrying about 2012 already .
Doug Mataconis · · 15 comments
A new Public Policy Polling poll has President Obama putting in a pretty bad showing against the most commonly mentioned potential Republican nominees in 2012 :
With his approval numbers hitting new lows it ’s no surprise that Barack Obama ’s numbers in our monthly look ahead to the 2012 Presidential race are their worst ever this month .
He trails Mitt Romney 46 - 43 , Mike Huckabee 47 - 45 , Newt Gingrich 46 - 45 , and is even tied with Sarah Palin at 46 .
The only person tested he leads is Jan Brewer , who does n’t have particularly high name recognition on the national level at this point .
It ’s not that any of the Republican candidates are particularly well liked .
Only Huckabee has positive favorability numbers at 37/28 .
Romney ’s at 32/33 , Gingrich at 32/42 , Palin at 37/52 , and Brewer at 17/20 .
But with a majority of Americans now disapproving of Obama it ’s no surprise that a large chunk of them would replace him as President if they had that choice today .
There are two things driving these strong poll numbers for the Republican candidates .
The first is a lead with independents in every match up .
Romney leads 48 -35 with them , Gingrich is up 50 - 39 , Huckabee has a 46 - 40 advantage , Palin ’s up 47 - 42 , and even Brewer has a 38 - 37 edge .
The other thing causing the Republicans to do so well is that their party is unified around them to an equal or even greater extent than Democrats are around Obama .
Huckabee ’s getting 85 % of the Republican vote to Obama ’s 82 % of the Democrats , Romney ’s at 82 % in his party to Obama ’s 80 % , Gingrich and Obama are each getting 83 % of their party vote , and Palin and Obama are each getting 81 % of theirs .
For the most part , it ’s clear that these numbers are more of a reflection of the President ’s declining approval numbers than they are of any particular surge on the part of any of his prospective opponents .
For that reason , I do n’t think they have any predictive value when it comes to what the situation in 2012 will actually be .
For one thing , that will depend largely on the state of the economy two years hence and , for another , as Ann Althouse notes , the situation is likely to change when voters actually have to make a decision :
I still think that once the race gets going and people really look at , say , Romney right next to Obama — really picture the other guy as President — the eagerness to oust Obama will cool off .
Is it possible that Obama will be a one term President ?
Certainly , if the right factors ( or wrong factors , depending on your political preferences ) come into play .
This poll , however , does n’t really tell us anything about that .
The doctor shortage is now so acute that locums from New Zealand are being flown from across the Tasman to work in country hospital emergency rooms - at times , just for a weekend 's work .
Locum doctors have long filled gaps in short - staffed hospitals around Australia but medical recruiters are now going to new lengths to find medical professionals .
Doctors from New Zealand are flying here for short - term work and earning up to $ 7,000 over a weekend , which is almost three times the pay of a full - time doctor .
Medical recruiter Sam Hazledine says he places about 300 New Zealand doctors a year as locums in Australia .
" The weekend warrior phenomenon for doctors is where you get a doctor who does have a permanent job in New Zealand and just wants to head over to Australia and earn massive dollars , very quickly and then come back to their standard job , " he said .
One of those Kiwi workers is Jason Pascoe , who has moved from the near freezing city of Invercargill on New Zealand 's south island to take on a three - month locum job at Port Macquarie , on the New South Wales mid-north coast .
" Number one for a lot of people is the pay , " he said .
" You are paid more and I guess part of the reason is you do n't have job security , it 's a short - term stint .
Often they 're last minute and so you are compensated for that . "
Port Macquarie , like most regional hospitals across the country , can not get enough doctors .
At the hospital a team of Kiwi locums help keep the emergency room in operation 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
Dr Pascoe says it is quite a popular thing for New Zealanders doctors to come over for short stints .
" I wanted to do more emergency department type work , and although that is available in New Zealand ...
Australia being a lot bigger and having more hospitals , there 's more of it available . "
Counting the cost
Health authorities in Victoria , Queensland and Western Australia say it is too difficult to quantify the cost of supplying locum doctors .
In South Australia $ 5 million was spent last year on locums , that is a 10 per cent rise on the previous year .
In New South Wales the Government spent $ 59 million in the last financial year for locum doctors outside cities , or more than $ 1 million a week .
Richard Murray , dean of medicine at James Cook University in Townsville , has been studying the workforce needs of regional and remote hospitals for 15 years .
" We are short of doctors and we 've got an ageing population , but that 's certainly not the only thing , " he said .
The Federal Government has recently ramped up its funding for rural doctors , announcing $ 130 million in incentives to keep doctors in rural areas and payments of up to $ 120,000 for doctors to leave the city .
From July 1 more than 3,000 overseas trained doctors will have their restrictions on where they can practice reduced , if they work in rural and remote communities .
Adding to that , Professor Murray says a recent surge in doctor training has buoyed health authorities into thinking Australia will eventually grow its own workforce .
" We 've gone from a low of around about 1,200 odd domestic medical graduates a year with a relatively small number of international students who come in and train to get a medical degree in Australia , to something like just over 3,000 domestic graduates , in less than the space of 10 years and that is an astonishing level of growth , " he said .
But he says the incentives are not yet in place to attract doctors to where they are needed most .
" If we just shoehorn all those graduates into highly specialised junior doctor training posts etcetera , in fact this could be a net negative and they wo n't trickle out , " he said .
" Once you build that training capacity into major metropolitan hospitals , it 's hard to then extract that at some later point and send to the bush .
" You really do need to take the opportunity now to build those pathways into regional Australia . "
Until then it will be doctors like Jason Pascoe who will make the trans - Tasman trip to fill the workforce gaps .
" Most hospitals , when they 've got locums , they would rather they be full - time , permanent staff , " he said .
" I can certainly understand that , but I 'm here for however long they need me . "
ArenaNet ’s recent claim that death should be fun brings up a point about punishment in video games in general .
Why do video games punish players for failing at the game ?
Would it not always be more fun to not be punished ?
History
There is a long tradition of frustrating consequences for failure in video games , starting with the earliest adventure games , and continuing through the latest and greatest MMOs , but this tradition is not a constant .
In every genre , we can see a downward trend in the use of punishment .
Think of the games you played 20 or thirty years ago ( or even 10 years ago , though the change is not as dramatic ) .
What was the punishment for failure ?
In most games , across genres , complete failure meant completely restarting the game , which , depending upon time investment , was a strong disincentive to fail .
Many of the games with the greatest punishment were on consoles and in arcades , where it was not possible to save one ’s progress — but even on the home computer , many adventure games would incorporate item - puzzles which , if failed , would render the save - games useless , since the failure actually occurred ( unknown to the player ) way back in the first scene of the game1 .
Part of this was due to a shift in focus that video game scholars refer to as The Great Score Shift2 .
Most early converts to the video gaming hobby got their start in arcades , where all games were pay - for - play , and each player was completing with all other players in the history of that machine for the “ Hi - Score ” .
The objective of these games , and the later console games designed to emulate the experience , was to have the largest in - game point total , and get your initials ( or a clever three - letter word ) immortalized at the top of a scoreboard .
Failure meant that your score stopped tabulating , and thusly that if you wanted a higher score , you would have to begin again ( and pay again ) .
Success was measured in endurance , rather than skill .
The player who completed the most levels , or killed the most enemies , won .
These games could not be “ beaten ” the way we think of games today .
There is no “ final boss ” for Pac - Man .
There is no point at which Arkanoid ‘s enemies are all destroyed .
The games themselves were simple , and it was an easy thing for the designers to write an algorithm that made each successive level more difficult without any real additional design .
This did not translate well into the home video - game console market , where usually only one person would ever play a particular copy of a game , and so the scoreboard would fill with the accomplishments of only that one person .
With no one to compare themselves to or compete against , score became less and less relevant .
This shift in mentality about score forced game design to change drastically , finding other ways to reward players for success .
Consider one of the early popular Platform Jumper games , Super Mario Bros .3
The game still has a hi-score to beat , but it was popular because if you could just get a little further , then you could see more of the game .
Score began to take a backseat to “ progression ” .
This was essentially a combination of the basic arcade formula and the more plot - oriented PC games formula .
This mix can be seen in console games ever since , and has proved successful .
Sometime in the mid-90s however , developers in almost all genres started allowing more save features in their games , sometimes allowing players to save anytime they liked .
This was especially true in the RPG genre , making it the genre with the least punishment ( assuming that you remembered to save ) .
The further introduction of the auto - save and the quick - save allowed some games to remove all in - game player punishment .
Adventure games win the prize for the most dramatic , though late - trending , turn .
Telltale Games established a new style of adventure game in 2005 with their remake of Sam & Max .
This new style incorporated a removal of irreparable failure ( the protagonist never “ dies ” ) , unfailable puzzles , and even a hint system to keep a player from getting too frustrated with any one puzzle .
This new style has been so successful that others have begun to emulate it , and most new adventure games have a much lower punishment level than adventure games only 6 years ago .
A few developers have attempted to buck this declining trend in punishment , but aside from some nostalgic releases4 , these games have been universally unsuccessful in the market .
Players are no longer accustomed to heavy penalties for failure , and are especially weary of games that force them to completely restart when they lose , which is thusly almost completely unheard of in today ’s games .
Today ’s Games
What does this all mean for modern video games ?
Well , the history speaks for itself in most cases .
Modern design shies away from punishment , especially in the form of setback .
Instead designers focus more and more on rewards for doing particularly well , like achievements5 .
Often , failure simply requires a player to retry the challenge they failed .
Even Final Fantasy , a franchise renowned for its ability to punish and frustrate , has changed their ways recently , allowing players in Final Fantasy XIII to go back to the beginning of a battle with no other consequence if they fail , or even if they just feel like they will soon fail .
The aberration here , if you refer once again to my very scientific chart above , is Massive Multi- player Online Roleplaying Games or MMORPGs ( not to be confused with Mohrgs6 ) .
When the first MMORPGs hit the market in the middle of this decade , they were about on the level with other genres for punishment , but with the release of World of Warcraft , we see an increase in punishment .
The game designers were treating death in a way we had n’t seen before .
Since the games were multi-player , and essentially “ live ” there was seemingly a worry about verisimilitude , and a need to punish players in the form of lost time .
This loss is made more stark by the fact that the time is n’t lost in the past ( like having to reload a save ) , it is lost in the future .
In many of these games , WoW included , a dead character must travel the world as an ineffective ghost for a period of time , or even if the character is allowed to return immediately , they are forced to return to the most recent encampment , so that they must endure the trek back to the battlefield — a journey that could take an hour or more in some circumstances .
Why such a harsh punishment , and why out of proportion with other genres ?
It can only be surmised that these punishments were developed because the traditional punishment for a failure in a single - player , or even just a non-massive co-operative role - playing game is to force the player to reload their game .
They must go back to a version of the world in which they have not yet failed , so that they may try again .
Instead , these new Mohrgs had to find a way to punish players that did n’t roll back the game clock .
Early experiments with XP penalties , or lost inventory proved unpopular , so the current time - wasting model has remained in vogue .
This still , however , does n’t answer the question :
Do we need to be punished ?
The thinking on this , from a Behavioral Psychology standpoint , is that players will not be able to revel in their successes nearly as well without the risk of failure7 .
If you know that no matter what you do , you will never be punished for failure , it might diminish the joy of success .
How many times have you felt the elation of finally solving a video game challenge which has punished you for hours ?
Other genres , however , are showing us that we punish ourselves enough on our own when we fail .
We are able to experience that sense of elation , even if the game does not punish us any further than simply placing us back at the beginning of the challenge , making the challenge fundamentally unfailable8 , or using social punishment .
MMORPGs , however , have not yet followed suit .
In reference to their new game , ArenaNet comes right out and says “ Defeat in Guild Wars 2 is intended to be an experience , not a punishment ” , and goes on to describe a system in which player parties do not need dedicated healers .
Players are merely “ downed ” , rather than immediately killed by monsters .
Players may even continue to join the fight with special last - ditch skills , while waiting for an ally to help them up .
All this creates a sort of meta - game out of failure and revival , which sounds a lot more fun than health - bar management .
Perhaps it ’s time for an online world in which player punishment is not so quickly doled out .
How this affects player enjoyment of the challenges is yet to be seen .
This lovely piece of rolling sculpture is the Megola Sport , and it was built in Germany in 1922 .
Aside from the extraordinary styling , the most notable thing about this machine is that the engine sits by the front wheel .
It ’s a five - cylinder , 640 cc radial — which was reportedly powerful enough for top speeds of between 85 and 140 kph ( 88 mph ) , depending on model and year .
The engine had tremendous torque , which meant that gears were not required .
It did n’t have a clutch , either : to start the bike , you put it on its stand and spun the front wheel until the engine fired up .
‘ Megola ’ is a portmanteau brand name — almost — derived from designers Meixner , Co ckerell , and La ndgraf .
Unfortunately , their motorcycle endeavours were short - lived , lasting just four years from 1921 and 1925 .
A few years later , there was an attempt to resurrect the front - engined concept , with the Killinger and Freund .
But that ’s another story .

Israeli authorities said the group had been raided in 1997 by Turkish authorities , who turned up weapons in one of their offices .
Ali Adakoglu , another board member , said there had been a raid on the house of a member in 1997 , but he argued that it was politically motivated , since that was the year of a Turkish military crackdown on Islamist groups .
He denied that weapons had been found .
“ This is an Islamist charity , quite fundamentalist , quite close to Hamas , ” said Henri J. Barkey , a professor of international relations at Lehigh University .
“ They say they do charity work , but they ’ve been accused of gunrunning and other things , and their rhetoric has been inflammatory against Israel and sometimes against Jews . ”
The organization was founded in the early 1990s , first as a charity for the poor in Istanbul , Turkey ’s largest city , and later for Bosnian war victims .
It now runs charity and relief work in more than 100 countries , including Haiti and nations in Africa , according to the deputy director , Yavuz Dede .
The Free Gaza Movement was formed in September 2006 by a group of passionate Palestinian supporters , most of whom had been barred from ever returning to Israel .
The group says it receives most of its money in donations .
“ We asked ourselves , what can we do to make a difference ? ” said Greta Berlin , the group ’s 69 - year - old co-founder and spokeswoman .
“ We said , ‘ Let ’s sail a boat to Gaza . ’
That was literally how it started . ”
At first , no one seemed to care much .
Five times the Free Gaza Movement sailed from Cyprus , where they are based , to Gaza .
Israel ultimately came to believe that a threat was evolving , fearing that ships coming into port could transport weapons .
Israeli officials said they feared the prospect of Hamas being as powerfully armed as Hezbollah in southern Lebanon .
The Free Gaza Movement has its roots in the International Solidarity Movement , another organization that sought to take direct action in defense of Palestinians , using nonviolent strategies to impede Israeli military actions in the occupied territories .

It looks like it is going to be possible to incorporate dual GF100 GPUs on a single PCB .
At least , that 's what the folks over at Galaxy Tech are dreaming up and we got a glimpse of it during Computex 2010 .
With the heat output and power requirements of NVIDIA 's GF100 graphics chip , a lot of us were skeptical there would ever be a dual GPU version of Fermi .
Imagine our surprise when this thing came out of nowhere during our tour of Galaxy 's booth .
The card we saw was home to a duo of GF100 GPUs sharing a single PCB , it measured approximately 12 " long , and featured two 8 - pin PCIe power connectors , and three dual link DVI ports .
Unfortunately , lips were sealed on any more specifics as it's merely a prototype but it looks like the dual - GPU videocard crown could could belong to NVIDIA once again .
We do n't have any more specifics just yet , but will keep you posted if we find out more .
The Rev. Paul Sawyer , a Unitarian Universalist minister and peace and social justice activist whose landmark , onion - shaped former sanctuary in the San Fernando Valley was the site of one of the Merry Pranksters ’ famous “ Acid Test ” gatherings in the 1960s , has died .
He was 75 .
Sawyer , who most recently was minister of Throop Unitarian Universalist Church in Pasadena , died June 23 at his home in Pasadena after a four - month battle with pancreatic cancer , said his wife , Susan .
FOR THE RECORD :
The Rev. Paul Sawyer :
The obituary in the July 11 California section of the Rev. Paul Sawyer , a Unitarian Universalist minister and activist who was arrested for blocking the gates of San Quentin State Prison in 2004 before the execution of convicted quadruple murderer Kevin Cooper , said that Cooper was executed in 2004 .
Just hours before his scheduled execution , Cooper won a reprieve from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on a technicality .
In November 2009 , Cooper lost his last appeal when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review his case .
He remains on death row . —
An inspiring and persuasive speaker with a deep , resonant voice , Sawyer was known as a passionate advocate for social justice who believed that one ’s values were n’t worth anything unless one was prepared to go to jail for them .
Over the last five decades , he was a leader in scores of nonviolent civil actions against war , nuclear power and the death penalty .
In the process , he frequently was arrested .
“ I stopped counting at 60 , ” his wife said .
Sawyer ’s arrests included those for blocking the gates at San Quentin State Prison for almost every execution in California since the state resumed the practice in 1992 .

“ We ’d be out here whether he was guilty or innocent , because it is wrong to take another human life , ” Sawyer told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2004 before the execution of Kevin Cooper , a quadruple murderer .
FOR THE RECORD :
The Rev. Paul Sawyer :
The obituary in Sunday ’s California section of the Rev. Paul Sawyer , a Unitarian Universalist minister and activist who was arrested for blocking the gates of San Quentin State Prison in 2004 before the execution of convicted quadruple murderer Kevin Cooper , said that Cooper was executed in 2004 .
Just hours before his scheduled execution , Cooper won a reprieve from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on a technicality .
In November 2009 , Cooper lost his last appeal when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review his case .

Paul Sawyer was a lion , he was a poet and he was an activist , and he was probably one of the most dedicated people for making the world a better place than anybody I ever knew , ” said ‘ 60s icon Wavy Gravy , a longtime friend who was arrested a number of times with Sawyer at San Quentin .
Born June 27 , 1934 , in Lynn , Mass. , and reared in Saugus , Mass. , Sawyer attended Phillips Academy in Andover before graduating from Harvard College with a degree in social psychology in 1955 .
After graduating from Starr King School for the Ministry , a Unitarian Universalist seminary in Berkeley , he became minister of the Valley Unitarian Universalist Church in Van Nuys in 1958 .

Under his leadership , the congregation participated in the founding of the Fair Housing Council in the San Fernando Valley .
During Sawyer ’s tenure , the church also built the distinctive Sepulveda Unitarian Universalist Society building in what is now North Hills .
That ’s where the Merry Pranksters arrived in their psychedelically painted , converted 1939 school bus in February 1966 .
Sawyer first met Pranksters leader Ken Kesey , the author of " One Flew Over the Cuckoo ’s Nest , ” when Kesey and the Pranksters showed up at the annual California Unitarian Church conference at Asilomar State Beach on the Monterey Peninsula .

As Sawyer recalled in his recently published book , “ Untold Story : A Short Narrative History of Our Time , ” Prankster Ken Babbs called to ask if they could put on an Acid Test at his church the next evening .
“ I said he could as long as he did n’t give out acid to the audience , ” Sawyer wrote , describing an Acid Test as “ a happening of music , dance and costuming where participants got high on LSD ( which was not yet illegal ) . ”
( Kesey was in Mexico at the time , having fled the state after a second offense for possession of marijuana and violating probation . )
In his 1968 book , “ The Electric Kool - Aid Acid Test , ” Tom Wolfe described Sawyer ’s church as a “ marvelous modern building shaped like a huge Bermuda onion ” and forming a towering dome with “ fantastic acoustics . ”

“ So the Pranksters moved in and wired and wound up the place , and hundreds arrived for the ‘ happening , ’ partaking in Prankster magic and pineapple chili , which was a concoction the Pranksters served , ” Wolfe wrote .
As Beat movement legend Neal Cassady and Wavy Gravy ( then still known as Hugh Romney ) stood at microphones and spontaneously bounced words and thoughts off one another , people were “ dancing in the most ecstatic way and getting so far into the thing , the straight multitudes even , that even they took microphones , and suddenly there was no longer any separation between the entertainers and the entertained at all , none of that well - look - at - you - startled - squares condescension of the ordinary happening , ” Wolfe wrote .
“ Hundreds were swept up in an experience , which built up like a dream typhoon , peace on the smooth liquid centrifugal whirling edge… . ”
The “ dream typhoon ” had one drawback :
The pineapple chili that Wavy Gravy ’s wife had made , he recalled , burned on “ the church ’s hot plate , and they flushed it down the toilet , and it plugged up their whole plumbing works . ”

Susan Sawyer said her husband “ was not part of the ongoing [ Pranksters ] troupe , ” but he often traveled on their bus , including going to Woodstock with them in 1969 , and remained friends with Kesey until his death in 2001 .
After he left the Valley church in 1966 , Sawyer ministered in Seattle ; Salem , Ore. ; Berkeley ; Pittsburgh ; Plainfield , N.J. ; and Pasadena .
He and his wife also established Unitarian Universalist fellowships in Moscow and St. Petersburg , Russia , in the early 1990s before Sawyer became minister at the church in Pasadena in 1996 .
He remained there until 2004 , when he became emeritus minister .
Sawyer , who was a scholar of American Transcendentalism and ancient Chinese texts , was a founder of the Interfaith Communities United for Justice and Peace .
He also served on the boards of the United Nations Assn. and the Jackie Robinson Center in Pasadena and served on the city charter reform task force .

In addition to his wife , Sawyer is survived by his children , Sharlyn , Shanda , Katherine , Adam and Alexander ; a sister , Charlotte Lacey ; and a brother , Alan .
A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Sept. 25 at Sepulveda Unitarian Universalist Society , 9550 Haskell Ave. , North Hills .

A minor party that opposes immigration says leaflets which breach electoral rules are being distributed in Western Sydney to discredit its candidates .
One pamphlet , purporting to be from the Australia First Party , portrays some African refugees as sub-human and violent .
Other anti-immigration leaflets seen by the ABC are anonymous .
The New South Wales chairman of the Australia First Party , Jim Saleam , says the pamphlets were not made by his party .
He says they are similar to dirty tricks leaflets distributed in Western Sydney in the last election .
" They take the strong argument that we put up against certain types of refugee immigration , but they add what I 'll call inflammatory , injudicious and unreasonable remarks into it with the intention of getting the party into some sort of legal trouble , " he said .
Editor 's note ( July 27 ) :
This story originally contained an image of the pamphlet which the ABC has removed because of the offensive nature of its content .
With Gav , Kenny , Jitterbug , and Jonny 5 all dropping seriously ill mixes over the last two weeks , I was feeling left out .
Summertime is in serious effect here in the Burgh with temperatures in the 80s and 90s for the past few days and the same forecast for the next week .
This kind of weather always inspires mixes for me , so I had a go at it the other day while pulling records for my monthly Love Is Wet night that went down this past weekend .
Just like always , this was done live in one shot with vinyl only in my extremely hot studio .
Most of these are tunes I ’ve been banging out in my club sets recently ; the rest are new ones I have n’t had a chance to work in yet but that I have been banging repeatedly at home .
Chase Smith kicks things off with a deep housey jam that is on Pittsburgh ’s own Technoir Audio label that is just coming out now .
I LOVE this tune , and his live set two weekends ago at the release party at Garfield Artworks ( check my Twitter feed a couple weeks back for a few pics of the ridiculous analog setup at that party with crazy turntables , records , drum machines , and synths ! ) was exceptional as well .
Another fresh new talent to check out !
Also featured is one of my favorite cuts produced by our man Scott Ferguson ( Marvin Belton ’s “ Any Day Now ” ) , as well as one of the sweetest cuts off of the ridiculously limited Theo Parrish album “ Sketches ” that I picked up in Detroit over DEMF weekend .
But all of these jams are nice , and only sound better in the hot sun …

Chase Smith “ Romance Synthetique ” Technoir Audio 12 ″
Fred P. “ On This Vibe ( Original Raw Mix ) ” Esperanza 12 ″

DCA License number : 2034167-DCA
It happened on the parking lot of grocery supermarket ( Highland Farms near Dufferin & Finch intersection in North York – Toronto , Ontario , Canada ) .
I and my wife came from the store to our car with full shopping cart through the dark parking lot ( time was ~ 10 p.m . )
One tall man of about 40 years old appeared from nowhere and asked for help starting with the phrase :
– Can you help me please ?
I ’m not a beggar !
I was ready to help , but the last two words made me very suspicious .
He spoke pretty loud and with confidence .
It looked like he was telling that for hundreds of time before .
The man told approximately the following :
– My car got stuck out of fuel on the road at Duffering and Finch .
– I left my wife and children there .
– I need some gas to put in the car …
Then I have interrupted him by telling : “ I know that story ” .
The man became very angry and disappointed at the same time and shouted loudly “ WHAT ???! ”
I just repeated “ I know that story .
Sorry , I ca n’t help ” and went away towards to our car .
The man said “ WHAT ??! ” again and continued bothering other people .
He got another turnabout from the potential victim .
It was the scam or fraud with 100 % .
It is hard to believe that someone would drive the car with his family without any money or cell phone ( to call for roadside assistance ) and almost empty fuel tank .
Leaving the family in the car on the road in dark time and going ~ 1 km away to ask for some money does not look like conscious behavior .
If it was really the case , so that man most likely would meet a police officer behind his vehicle issuing a ticket for “ out of gas on the road ” .
Our story completed successfully for us .
But how does it usually works ?
I made investigation after an incident .
There are several possible scenarios .
If the victim is in rush and really wants to help and did not recognize scam , then he will just give $ 20 to buy fuel can and some gas at the station .
Story is over .
Sometimes potential victims asking questions about family left in the car , and the fraud person lies about his daughter having fever or something and it is better to stay in the car .
Usually there is another accomplice who is so pleased to provide a fuel can to bring gas to the car , or scammer just getting the can from his own trunk when victim does not see .
When some money goes into his hands he disappears quickly .
This is how it works .
Some people who aware of this kind of fraud are trying to expose the fraud , or understand if the person really needs help .
For example , if the victim takes the cell phone from the pocket and tells “ I ’m calling for police ” , it takes away the scammer very rapidly .
If you offer to take that fuel can and fill it up at gas station by yourself , fraud man does not allow you to do so , which definitely reveals the scam .
Some people are asking to show that stuck car with the family , scammers just got angry .
There are other ways to protect yourself and make sure that it is a fraud .
The best way to avoid it is just saying “ Sorry , I ca n’t help ” and see the reaction – it will tell everything to you .
If you experienced similar fraud attempt to yourself , please share the location and approximate date to alert other people from the area .
Usually this type of scammers keep their place for days or even weeks .
Police is aware of this , but ca n’t really do anything .
Let ’s protect ourselves !
Anyone who believes that housing is on the rebound , and that now is the time to buy , should take a very hard look at the numbers I dredged up for my spring lecture and luncheon tour .
There are 140 million personal residences in the US .
Today , there are 26 million homes either directly or indirectly for sale .
According to a survey by Zillow.com , a real estate appraisal website , 20 million homeowners plan to sell on any improvement in prices .
Add to that 4 million existing homes now on the market , 1 million new homes flogged by companies like Lennar ( LEN ) and Pulte Homes ( PHM ) , and 1 million bank owned properties .
Another 8 million mortgage owners are late on their payments and are on the verge of foreclosure , bringing the total overhang to 34 million homes .
Now , let 's look at the buy side .
There are 35 million who are underwater on their mortgages and are n't buying homes anytime soon , nor are the 35 million unemployed and underemployed .
That knocks out 50 % of the potential buyers .
Here is where it gets really interesting .
There are 80 million baby boomers retiring at the rate of 10,000 a day .
Assuming that they downsize over time from an average 2,500 sq ft. home to a 1,000 sq. ft. condo , and eventually to a 100 sq. ft. assisted living facility , the total shrinkage in demand is 4.3 billion sq.ft .
per year , or 1.7 million average sized homes .
That amounts to a shrinkage of aggregate demand for a city the size of San Francisco , every year .
You can argue that the following Gen - Xer 's are going to take up the slack , but there are only 65 million of them with a much lower standard of living than their parents .
Throw in the disappearance of state and federal first time buyer tax credit .
You can count on a jump in long term capital gains taxes and state and local property taxes , further diminishing property 's appeal .
If you are looking for a final stick to break the camel 's back , how about eliminating , or substantially reducing the home mortgage interest deduction ?
Add it all up , and there is a massive structural imbalance in residential real estate that will take at least a decade more to unwind .
We could be looking at a replay of the same 26 year period from 1929 to 1955 when prices remained flat , and we are only 3 years into it !
A second down leg in the real estate market seems a no brainer to me , as is the secondary banking crisis that follows .
Perhaps that 's why hedge funds have been big sellers of the homebuilder 's ETF ( XHB ) .
What 's a poor homeowner to do ?
Do n't ask me .
I sold everything in 2005 when my research threw up these numbers , and have been happily renting ever since .
And , if the toilet blocks up , I just call the landlord .

Psst , kids : Great news !
Does n't this make you feel better ?
The 6.8 million Americans out of work for 27 weeks or longer -- a record 46 percent of all the unemployed -- are providing U.S. companies with an eager , skilled and cheap labor pool .
This is allowing businesses to retool their workforces , boosting efficiency and profits following the deepest recession since the 1930s , and contributing to a 61 percent rise in the Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index since March 2009 .
“ Companies are getting higher - productivity employees for the same or lower wage rate they were paying a marginal employee , ” said James Paulsen , who helps oversee about $ 375 billion as chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis .
“ Not only are employees higher skilled , you have a better skill match .
You have a more productive and more adaptive labor force . ”
Falling wage pressures will help keep inflation low , contributing to lower Treasury - bond yields , according to Mark Vitner , a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities LLC in Charlotte , North Carolina .
He forecasts 10 - year Treasuries will yield about 3.1 percent in the third quarter , compared with 4 percent in April .
The lack of wage pressure also “ reinforces the case for globally exposed companies ” because “ there has been better cost containment in the U.S. than in some of our competitors , ” said Ethan Harris , head of North America economics at Bank of America - Merrill Lynch Global Research in New York .
He said this would benefit businesses such as Cincinnati - based Procter & Gamble Co. , the world ’s largest consumer - products company , and Atlanta - based Coca - Cola Co. , the world ’s biggest soda maker .
Fired workers from Wall Street to South Carolina , where 58 percent of the unemployed have been without work for six months or longer , say they are networking , going back to school and retraining to stay relevant as jobs become more specialized .
Some still may not achieve comparable positions , and Federal Reserve officials say lasting joblessness may weigh on economic growth .
“ There is a structural dimension to unemployment that looks persistent , ” Neal Soss , chief economist at Credit Suisse in New York , said in an interview .
“ Regrettably , it feeds on itself .
People who have been out of work half a year or more naturally are going to have a harder time re-engaging on satisfactory terms .
Their skills can atrophy , and their attitudes toward life and work can be damaged .
It is debilitating . ”
Come on , now , Neal , use the old noodle .
You can always use them for Soylent Green , the tasty snack food !
And someone can figure out a way to desalinize and monetize the tears of the unemployed first ....
Yes , kids , this is the key to national productivity .
Stop me if you 've heard me say this before : Cheap .
Disposable .
Labor . Economist Douglas A. McIntyre at 24/7 Wall St. :
The secret to the amazing increases in productivity in the American economy is finally out .
Companies in the US are not hiring full - time workers .
They are gambling that they can keep their margins high by keeping a vast part of the workforce , perhaps millions of people , unemployed .
Unemployed people , it turns out to no one ’s surprise , will work for very little .
And , they will work without benefits , without job security , and without complaint .
According to Bloomberg , “ The 6.8 million Americans out of work for 27 weeks or longer — a record 46 percent of all the unemployed — are providing U.S. companies with an eager , skilled and cheap labor pool . ”
The development is a revelation , and a good one , for companies , municipalities , and states , all of which are tight on cash and unable to get credit at reasonable rates if at all .
The nearly 10 % unemployment rate in the US is supposed to come down late this year and early next .
This assumes that companies with improved prospects will hire full - time workers as they have for decades .
These workers have had pensions , benefits , and vacations .
That makes a person who makes $ 40,000 cost $ 50,000 or $ 60,000 .
Employers want to bring the effective cost of that same worker down to $ 35,000 or perhaps $ 30,000 .
While of course keeping the costs of housing , food , and gas up .
So it 's a win / win !
Not only are the Democratic elites not going to stop it , they 're cheering from the sidelines .
Here 's what Digby had to say about a bizarre exchange today between The Nation 's Chris Hayes and " liberal " asskisser Jonathan Alter on The Ed Show :
Keep in mind that Alter is an elite liberal villager with strong ties to the administration .
And he not only wants to lay the problem at the feet of " liberal orthodoxy " which is insane , but he 's completely delusional about the congress 's ability to pass any jobs legislation that costs money --- after all , they can't even extend unemployment benefits .
On what planet does there exist the slightest possibility of passing a direct jobs program with or without David Bacon ?
And why in the world would we want to pay people less money when the whole point is to stimulate the economy ?
We do n't want to spoil them ?
I do n't know if he 's doing some light Heritage Foundation Report reading before he goes to bed at night but I 'd guess , considering his professional and social circle , that this is reflective of the conversations that are being held among liberal Villagers , some of whom may very well be in the congress and the White House .
This dry abstraction , and the idea that we just have to " adjust " to a permanently higher unemployment rate is just offensive .
I wonder if Alter would be so sanguine about such a thing if he were among those who found themselves suddenly among the permanent underclass ?
( Not that he would --- this sort of thing does n't happen to hard working , productive people such as he ... )
And good for Hayes for saying at the end that he still believes in Davis Bacon .
The look on his face was priceless --- he kept it together nicely but was clearly gobsmacked by Alter 's bizarre outburst .
Who would n't be ?
It 's so reflexively and anachronistically thirdway / DLC that if I closed my eyes , I could see Joe Klein blathering exactly the same garbage on Meet the Press circa 1992 .
That this kind of hippie punching is still so automatic among the elites explains a lot about why we are so very , very screwed .
They just can't seem to help themselves , even if it makes no earthly sense at all .
I 'll close out with part of a post from Slacktivist 's Fred Clark , one of my very favorite bloggers :
gage skidmore / flickr
has some bad news for his adoring audience :
He may be going blind .
Beck told fans he went to the doctor because he was having trouble focusing his eyes and that the doctor " did all kinds of tests " before settling on a diagnosis of macular dystrophy .
So what exactly is macular dystrophy ?
Well , that depends , says Shantan Reddy , a retinal specialist at New York University School of Medicine .
Reddy says there are up to 100 different types of macular dystrophy — sometimes individual cases can even be impossible to classify .
" It 's basically a hodgepodge of things that affect the macula that we routinely call macular dystrophy , " Reddy says .
Ophthalmologists then make more specific diagnoses using eye - imaging technologies .
The macula , a part of the inner eye that enables people to see fine details in the center of their vision , is a yellow - pigmented spot near the center of the retina — the layer of cells in the back of the eyeball that converts light into visual information .
Damage to the macula generally impairs central vision .
Beck probably has a condition called vitelliform macular dystrophy , Reddy says , the symptoms for which often arise later in life .
It 's characterized by the appearance of a yellow , egg - yolk - colored lesion on the macula .
The disorder progresses through phases , and in the end stage the center of the retina atrophies and " starts resembling something like macular degeneration , " a more common degenerative condition that usually affects older adults , Reddy says .
There are two types of vitelliform macular dystrophy .
The more severe version , called Best 's disease , is inherited genetically — although symptoms may not become noticeable until adulthood .
A more mild form is known as adult - onset vitelliform macular dystrophy , and often shows up in patients between the ages of 30 and 40 .
If Beck 's doctor warned of severe symptoms , that might mean he has the more severe , genetically inherited Best 's disease , Reddy says .
But the only way to differentiate between the two forms is through an imaging test called electrooculogram , or EOG .
" So if his doctor did n't do an EOG , he may not even know whether this is Best 's disease or the adult - onset form , " Reddy says .
Vitelliform macular dystrophy is extremely rare , and there is currently no treatment .
Each case is different , but in general neither form progresses quickly , and total blindness is rarely an outcome .
" They rarely go legally blind in both eyes .
Usually they have some retained vision , " Reddy says .

Facebook is among the most powerful internet companies – maybe the most powerful together with Google – in the world .
It has 400 m users , 35 m of whom use it at least once a day .
It is the most visited website in the US .
Its initial public offering , which is expected within a year or two , would be the biggest Silicon Valley event since Google ’s IPO in 2004 .
Facebook is thus important not only to investors but to everyone interested in the future of the internet , which is practically all of us .
If it decides , in Google ’s phrase for deceiving or messing around with its customers , to “ be evil ” then millions feel the effects .
Unfortunately , Mark Zuckerberg , the 25 - year - old who founded Facebook as a private social network for Harvard students , has recently been displaying a disregard bordering on disdain for Facebook users ’ right to maintain control over personal information ...

As promised ... [
In reply to ] Can't Post
So , here I am again .
As promised , I am posting a longer message before the week 's end .
I have to thank those of you that have supported me from the start as well as those that converted along the way .
And even say farewell to those that never did convert or believed .
I will miss Mr. Crere , the faith of Compa and Sir DennisC , the wisdom of Voronwe , the joy of Grammaboodawg , the support of Kangi Ska and so many , many others
Now , Pasi , et al- that is what is quite uncommon even on big films .
Pete and co stuck to LOTR for years , I 've developed films for years and I have shot many a movie on location ... but rarely do you relocate for such massive amount of time specially when you have to do major ironclad agreements to put in deep freeze other contractual obligations with multiple studios .
My commitment to the project demanded enormous sacrifices both in personal and professional terms .
The consequences of which will ripple for years .
I relocated my entire life and family to New Zealand and first came on board in 2008 .
So - while the cited delays , contractual complexities or obstacles , cannot be attributed to a single event or entity - you will simply have to believe that they were of sufficient complexity and severity to lead to the current situation .
Trust me on this , Pasi - leaving NZ and the Hobbit crew is extremely painful .
As stated before - a wealth of designs , animatics , boards and sculptures is left behind representing accurately my ideas for Mirkwood , Spiders , Wargs , Stone Trolls , etc , etc and everyone ( PJ , FW , PB and myself ) has the same goal in mind : to try and ensure the best possible transition of the movie to a new director .
I believe these films will happen .
Preproduction continues as we speak .
The writing team of PJ , FW , PB and myself will keep moving the screenplays forward .
Perhaps even sooner than we may anticipate we will all look at the finished film and then - I will tear up whenever I recognize a set or a creature or a quirk created under my supervision .
Everyone on these boards will get two movies .
Me ?
I will be watching filmic family albums .
Photos of my children from far away .
I hope you will understand how delicate the subject is for me .
I will drop by now and then , I will read the boards with interest and do hope to see some of you around at SDCC and many other places .
I am not here , however , to provide a blow - by - blow of what happened , but to assure you , as I have , that it has been the toughest situation of my life .
Beyond that - I am simply no longer an official voice for these projects .
Be good , be well - and I invite you all to follow me into the next phase of my filmmaking journey .
Sincerely
GDT

What ’s going on ( or , going wrong ) with this traumatic cover ?
I ’ve got some questions to kick things off ( … then I ’m heading down to the discussion thread to see where you ’re going with this . )
1 . With her thick black hair , which looks richer for the reflective light ; her high cheekbones ; her full lips ; her receptive , more than piercing or demanding gaze ; her silvery , sequin - like dress with the exotic and stylish Oriental pattern and the not overly - modest neckline ; with the light reflecting off her left cheekbone and also reflecting off the shawl — not a hijab by the way , but worn just off her head to suggest one —
I ’m wondering ( with your eye being more distracted by the eyes , and by the light reflecting off the hair , the cheek and the rich purple shawl ) if you even attend all that much to the nose ?
2 . How much is this photo actually playing off the romanticized , and quite famous photo of Steve McCurry ’s “ Afghan Girl ” — only minus the covered head , the fierce expression and the torn clothing .
( In comparison , by the way , does Aisha look more like a model whose nose has been photoshopped away ? )
3 . Any surprise this “ tug at your heart ” cover comes out just days after Wikileak brings the failure of the Afghan campaign into the light — and just as the campaign against Wikileak and Julian Assange gets going in the MSM ?
… By the way , anyone want to ask TIME how long they had this story set - and - ready - to - go ?
4 . What happens if we leave ???
Did n’t this girl meet this fate after we ’d been there nine years ?
5 . If you happened to read Nicholas Kristof ’s fantastic NYT Op - Ed today , he argues that we could and should end our military involvement immediately , but then stay and invest a small fraction of what we were spending on soldiers and bombs to fundamentally transform Afghanistan by building hundreds of schools .
Is n’t this title , on the other hand , applying emotional blackmail and exploiting gender politics to pitch for the status quo — a continued U.S. military involvement ?

But there is something we could do to help the pill live up to its potential : let women purchase it over the counter .
A half - century of evidence shows us that it ’s safe to dispense the pill without a prescription .

The pill meets F.D.A. criteria for over - the - counter medications .
Women do n’t need a doctor to tell them whether they need the pill  they know when they are sexually active and want to avoid pregnancy .
Pill instructions are easy to follow :
Take one each day .
There ’s no chance of becoming addicted .
Taking too many will make you nauseated , but wo n’t endanger your life , in contrast to some over - the - counter drugs , like analgesics .
( There are even side benefits to taking the pill , like reduced risks of ovarian and uterine cancer . )
It ’s true that the pill could be dangerous for women with certain conditions .
Women who are 35 or older and smoke , and those with high blood pressure , are at greater risk of a heart attack or stroke if they take oral contraceptives that combine estrogen and progestin .
But these are not complicated conditions to identify ; women already have to tell their doctor about their health problems when they get a prescription , and research shows that women can screen themselves for contraindications almost as well as providers do .
Progestin - only pills , or minipills , might be an ideal option for an initial over - the - counter switch since they have fewer ( and rarer ) contraindications and potential complications .
Along with the change , the pharmaceutical company , nonprofits and the government should collaborate on an educational campaign , including pamphlets packaged with the pills and public service announcements that would give women information about how to use the pill , deal with side effects , recognize serious complications and of course remind them to get regular checkups for preventative care like Pap smears .
The United States has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the developed world , and better access to the pill is part of the solution to this problem .
During the debate leading up to F.D.A. approval of the emergency contraception pill called Plan B for over - the - counter sale , some people expressed concern about expanding access to contraception for young women without doctors ’ oversight , and they might say the same about the birth control pill .
But there are no special health risks for younger women on the pill , and sexually active women , whatever their age , should have freer access to the full range of options to prevent pregnancy .
ADELPHI , Md. - NASA on Tuesday announced three new multimillion - dollar contests to buildsmart robots and launch tiny satellites as part of a program to develop innovationsof benefit not only to the U.S. space agency but to the nation at large .
Thecontests are NASA 's newest CentennialChallenges , which offer cash prizes for technological achievements by teamswho work without government funding .
A combined prize incentive of $ 5 millionwill be split among the three competitions .
Thecompetitions call on teams to repeatedly launch miniature satellites intoorbit , develop a solar - powered rover that can run at night on stored energy , orbuild a sample - return robot that can navigate over varied terrain and retrievean identifiable object .
? NASAsponsors prize competitions because the agency believes student teams , privatecompanies of all sizes and citizen - inventors can provide creative solutions toproblems of interest to NASA and the nation , ? said Robert Braun , NASA 'schief technologist .
?
Prize competitions are a proven way to fostertechnological competitiveness , new industries and innovation across America .?
Thecontests were announced here at the Space Technology Industry Forum , hosted by NASA ?s? Office of the Chief Technologist .
The OCT is responsible for direct managementof the space agency ?s space technology programs , and for coordinating andtracking all technology investments across the agency .
Nightrovers and nanosatellites
CentennialChallenges are open to individuals , groups and companies working outside of thetraditional aerospace industry .
Monetary awards are made after solutions aresuccessfully demonstrated ; the participants maintain ownership of theirintellectual properties .
Since2005 , NASA has conducted 19 competitions in six challenge areas and has awarded $ 4.5 million to 13 different teams .
Theobjective of one of the new competitions , the Nano - Satellite Launch Challenge , is to place a small satellite into Earth orbit twice in one week .
The purposes behindthis challenge are to stimulate innovation in low - cost launch technology andencourage creation of commercial nano - satellite delivery services .
Thechallenge carries a potential prize of $ 2 million .
The Night Rover Challenge has a prize purse of $ 1.5 million .
The objective is tosupport innovations in energy - storage technologies that could prove valuable inextreme space environments , such as on the surfaceof the moon .
Technologicaladvances in this area also could have applications on Earth for electricvehicles and renewable energy systems , NASA officials said .
? Witha lot of these things , there could be tremendous spin - offs in other fields , ? said Andrew Petro , Centennial Challenges program executive .
Thethird contest , with $ 1.5 million in prize money , is ?
the Sample Return RobotChallenge .
It calls for teams to build and demonstrate a robot that can locateand retrieve geological samples from wide and varied terrain without humancontrol .
The challenge focuses on innovations in automatic navigation androbotic manipulator technologies .
? TheCentennial Challenges have been recognized by the White House and theadministration as an innovative approach to doing business , ?
Braun said .
?
It ? san approach in which we engage a wide variety of innovators across the nation .
Through the spacetechnology program , we hope to take that innovation and shine it like alaser on our space program and change the way we do business in the future .?
Pushingspace technology forward
Theprogram initiatives under the space technology program ?
including the CentennialChallenges ? are subject to Congressional approval .
The OCT has requested $ 10 million in federal funding each year through 2015 as part of the expansion ofthe Centennial Challenges .
Whilethe future of the program is contingent upon the allocation of funds in the budgetsof fiscal 2011 and beyond , officials at the Office of the Chief Technologist areconfident that NASA ?s revised space technology program can help restore thespace agency ?s cutting - edge technological prowess .
? Therehas been significant debate in Congress already for the need for a program justlike this , ?
Braun said .
?
We ?ve taken all the external input , all the criticismsfrom NASA ?s past , and from that we have shaped the space technology program .?
Meanwhile , three other Centennial Challenges are scheduled over the next year :
The Strong Tether Challenge : Teams must demonstrate a material that is at least 50 percent stronger than the strongest commercially available .
The challenge is scheduled for Aug. 13 in Seattle .
The Power Beaming Challenge : Using laser beams , teams must transmit enough power to a device for it to climb more than half a mile of vertical cable .
The challenge is planned for the fall of 2010 .
The Green Flight Challenge : Teams will try to design and fly aircraft 200 miles in less than two hours using the energy equivalent of less than one gallon of gasoline per occupant .
The challenge will be held in July 2011 .
It is expected to attract electric , hybrid and bio-fueled aircraft .
NASAis currently soliciting proposals from nonprofit organizations looking tomanage each of the three new Centennial Challenges competitions .
Afterthese partner organizations are signed , they will work in conjunction with NASAto determine the rules and details of the challenges , which are expected to beannounced later this year .
Missile attacks by US drones in Pakistan 's tribal areas have more than doubled under the Obama administration , research by the BBC Urdu service shows .
Compared with 25 drone strikes between January 2008 and January 2009 , there were at least 87 such attacks between President Obama taking office on 20 January 2009 and the end of June 2010 .
More than 700 people have been killed in such attacks under Mr Obama , compared with slightly fewer than 200 from under his predecessor , George W Bush .
The militant backlash over the same period has been even more violent .
Extremists have struck more than 140 times in various Pakistani locations , killing more than 1,700 people and injuring hundreds more , the BBC research shows .

Data from Jan 2009 to June 2010
While attacks by militants cannot be described as direct retaliation for drone strikes , they are firmly part of the battle the US and Pakistani authorities are fighting against radical Islam 's operational bases in Pakistan .
Over the same 18 - month period , many more than 2,500 people have died in offensives by the Pakistani army and fighting between troops and militants .
Exact figures are impossible to obtain .
Places such as Swat and South Waziristan which have seen offensives by the Pakistani military are virtually closed to independent media and other groups .
The increased frequency of drone strikes follows a reported shift in US policy to extend its drone operations .
It has moved from targeting al - Qaeda suspects to including Pakistani Taliban who are believed to be providing a haven for al - Qaeda leaders and operatives .
The bulk of these attacks have been in North Waziristan , with neighbouring South Waziristan the next main target .
While more than 700 people have died in these attacks , positive identification of the victims , either by Pakistani or US authorities , has been made in fewer than a dozen instances .
Continue reading the main story Areas hit by drone attacks Province No of deaths South Waziristan 279 North Waziristan 386 Bajaur 14 Bannu 5 Orakzai 8 Kurram 54 Source : BBC Urdu service .
Data from Jan 2009 to June 2010
There have been notable successes for the Americans and Pakistanis , including the killing of Taliban militant leader Baitullah Mehsud last August and several people described as senior al - Qaeda leaders .
The data collected by the BBC Urdu service shows militant attacks dipping when Mehsud was killed and then peaking last autumn when Pakistani troops launched the South Waziristan offensive .
Drone attacks reached a high when the operation was declared over and the Pakistani army refused to push on into North Waziristan as the US government wanted it to .
Pakistan has consistently argued that drone attacks are hindering rather than helping with the battle against extremism , saying they fuel public anger against the government and the US and boost support for militants .
On the other hand , the US , which does not routinely confirm drone operations , has always implied there is a tacit understanding between the two countries over the attacks .
The CIA declined to comment for this story .
The Taliban say drone attacks make them more determined to fight , but admit that they have disrupted their operations .
This data was compiled between January 2009 and July 2010 by the BBC Urdu service .
It is based on reports from BBC World Service correspondents working in Northern Pakistan and the tribal areas .
CHICAGO – Some here call it the Wal - Mart of music festivals .
Others term it Monopolooza .
In any case the three - day music fest , officially known as Lollapalooza , is expected to rock the city Aug. 6 - 8 in Grant Park and it does n’t come without controversy .
Jim DeRogatis , a cultural critic here , recently wrote on his Vocalo.org blog that promoters behind the mega-event – C3 Presents and their partners – are under investigation by Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan over anti-trust allegations .
According to DeRogatis , local bars , clubs and other concert venues have complained about restrictive clauses that C3 includes in artist contracts for Lolla ’s more than 120 acts .
Most festivals share similar rules , but critics say Lolla tops them all – its contracts say bands ca n’t play six months before and three after this event within a radius as big as 300 miles outside Chicago .
DeRogatis writes , “ Many local Chicago club owners and independent concert promoters have said that these radius clauses are decimating the local music community and significantly hurting their business for much of the year , and that they constitute unfair , anti-competitive practices . ”
Lolla promoters have said they will be lenient in the enforcement of the clause and could waive it altogether .
Meanwhile sources say subpoenas have been issued .
However DeRogatis says ties between Lolla ’s promoters and its attorney Mark Vaneko , a nephew of Mayor Richard M. Daley , run deep and also raise controversy .
( Daley by the way is a staunch supporter of bringing Wal - Mart into the city , which is opposed by labor leaders and lawmakers due to its low wages and anti-union policies . )
Lolla ’s liquor license is issued in the name of Parkways Foundation , the non-profit arm of the Chicago Park District .
Beer and hard liquor are sold to as many as 95,000 attendees daily by Lollapalooza Festival Services , a company co-owned by Kevin Killerman .
Killerman is a bar owner in Chicago ’s Wrigleyville neighborhood with dozens of complaints for underage drinking on his record , and happens to be a friend and legal client of Vaneko , reports DeRogatis .
Vaneko is the attorney and lobbyist who helped negotiate a new 10 - year contract that is expected to venue Lolla in Grant Park through 2018 .
He also represents developers , including a company that bought and sold land near the mayor ’s proposed site for a temporary Olympic stadium .
“ Twenty - one years into the second Daley administration , many Chicagoans have come to believe that any major undertaking in this city has to have been blessed by one of the most powerful mayors in U.S. history , and it probably has some business connection to his cronies , ” writes DeRogatis .
“ But even given this cynical acceptance of the way things work in the City That Works , Lollapalooza stands out . ”
For Marguerite Horberg , executive director of Porto Luz cultural venue and founder of the Hot House , it ’s precisely smaller independent and community - based arts groups that suffer from big money events like Lolla that soak up all the city ’s financial resources .
“ In a climate that is already economically stressed the city becomes an entity seeking money and little dollars are left for other organizations trying to come up , ” she said .
Advocating for radical arts programs and non-commercial town hall style meetings on the issue become stifled , said Horberg .
“ There just is n’t any democracy or transparency when it comes to the city budget , ” she said .
“ You ’re either friends with the powers that be or you ’re left alone with little support and hardly enough space to carve out . ”
Unless you have a lot of money , or investors and lawyers on your side , it becomes hard to envision democracy in this , noted Horberg .
It ’s not right that the city becomes the dominant player when it comes to promoting the arts , she said .
“ What about smaller emerging arts collectives ? ” she asked .
“ It just becomes harder and harder to start up . ”
David Lozano is the founder of Jammin For Justice , which he says is a socially conscious entertainment production group that supports local artists at concerts and venues citywide on a monthly basis .
Lollapalooza , he says , is fading these days .
Although it continues to sell out shows , the talent at Lolla has declined , he says .
“ Their opening acts are becoming their headliners . ”
Lozano says he misses the days when Lolla had big shows like Rage Against the Machine , Manu Chao , Radio Head , Lupe Fiasco , Kanye West and the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
“ These were unique and exciting groups , ” he said .
Lozano said he appreciates getting introduced to new and up - and - coming bands at Lolla , but overall they ’re just not the same anymore .
He thinks maybe it has to do with the economy .
Either way he says , “ The shows are just not affordable for everyday people throughout Chicago ’s diverse communities to take advantage of . ”

There 's a lot of talk about BP being a British company .
Actually , the ownership and control of the company is a lot more complex .
Some facts not reported in the news :
1. 29 % of BP is owned by JP Morgan and US companies own 39 % of it total
2. Halliburton , one of the main contractors on the rig , is considered the party responsible for failing to cap the well properly .
They moved their headquarters out of the US to Dubai recently .
3 . The former CEO from 1997 to 2009 who was ousted by a sex scandal was also Chairman of Goldman Sachs .
Goldman sold a massive amount of its BP holdings in early 2010 and one of its employees bragged in an e-mail in early April that they were " shorting " the Gulf and looking forward to huge profits from an environmental disaster there .

Collective punishment is sometimes too nice .
Because the Gazans voted for Hamas , says NY Senator Schumer , " to strangle them economically until they see that ’s not the way to go makes sense . "

Also calls for " regime change " in Iran , and brags that there are multiplex cinemas in the West Bank .

In 1999 , Spark director Robert Barnhoorn and founder John Bakker shared the same dream : to develop a flying car .
An innovative new vehicle that performed just as well on the road as in the air .
It became the PAL -V : Personal Air and Land Vehicle .
Making dreams come true
It is our business to develop innovative products for entrepreneurs .
Helping them to make their dreams come true .
From the outset , this special project was also our dream :
To be able to drive to a nearby – still to be built – take - off and landing strip alongside the highway , unfold the rotor and the tail , and to fly to your destination .
Emergency services
A flying car is ideal for emergency services , who need to be on the spot quickly .
Or for ( developing ) countries , where large parts of the land are not equipped with a good road network .
The PAL - V is the ultimate flexible , door - to - door transport : fly where you can , and then drive .
Fast on the road and in the air
Before we started on this challenging project , we naturally wanted to know if it was a realistic dream .
Robert : “ The feasibility study clearly showed that the vehicle is only commercially viable if it functions fully in both drive and fly ” .
We chose for the gyrocopter principle : easy to operate , safe and reliable .
Tilting principle provides stability
And we combined this with the tilting principle from one of our previous developments , the ground - breaking Carver vehicle .
In this way , we solved the long - standing stumbling block of the high centre of gravity – an automatic consequence of the folding wings – in one go .
Mock - up
Aided by numerous sketches , countless CAD - drawings , convincing visualizations to bring in funding , and piles of calculations , together with PAL-V , we developed technically complex parts such as the basic concept , rotor operating system , rotor mast , and righting mechanism .
To get a feel for measurements and sight lines , we made a ‘ mock - up ’ from PVC tubes , wood and textile ; now the centrepiece of our studio .
World news
In April 2011 , the maiden flight ( video 1 ) of the prototype of the PAL - V made world news .
It was also featured on the TV programme ' De Kennis van Nu' ( video 2 ) , nominated for the Rotterdam design prize and has appeared in numerous magazines and newspapers .
In the air soon !
Currently , PAL-V N.V. – a consortium of entrepreneurs and investors – are working hard on making the first PAL - V’s commercially available .
Tiny Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence was ruled legal today by the highest UN court – bringing clarity to a question long mired in strategic , moral , and emotional disputes .
But the non-binding decision by the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) , one of the first rulings on changing borders in modern times , may have messy political ramifications worldwide , analysts say .
The Hague judges said the ruling narrowly applied to Kosovo .
Court president Hisashi Owada said international law contains no " prohibition on declarations of independence . "
But the court ’s broader questioning of notions of “ territorial integrity ” may open a Pandora ’s box , giving heart to many non-state actors around the globe seeking to secede or declare independence .
Mark Ellis , director of the International Bar Association in London says that , “ By saying that Kosovo did not violate the privilege of ‘ territorial integrity , ’ the court creates a more vexing challenge for international law , affecting future decisions involving non-state actors living in states . ”
On Feb. 17 , 2008 , Kosovo – 93 percent Albanian , but a heartland of Serbian mythic and religious identity – declared independence , strongly supported by the US and most European states .
Serbia disputed the claim – even as Kosovo became a de facto independent state after Serb forces were driven out by NATO following a failed mass “ ethnic cleansing ” campaign by Belgrade in 1999 .
That campaign is seen as part of a attempt by Serb strongman Slobodan Milosevic to create a “ Greater Serbia ” by killing and forced relocation of non-Serbs -- that itself began with speeches by Mr. Milosevic in Kosovo in 1988 .
On Wednesday , US Vice President Joseph Biden met with Kosovo President Hashim
Thaci to affirm continued US support of Kosovo regardless of the outcome of the court ruling – continuing a US policy of rebuilding the Balkans .
The US State Department has steadily said it backs Kosovo independence as an exceptional case , and not a precedent .
Some 69 nations recognize Kosovo , now under international protection , which is short of the 100 required for UN membership .
China , Russia , and European states like Greece , Spain , and Italy have not recognized Kosovo 's independence , citing separatists within their own borders .
After the ruling , European Union foreign affairs chief Lady Catherine Ashton said the future of both Kosovo and Serbia lay in Europe , which is interpreted as a political salve to a legal opinion that did not favor Belgrade .
Serbia disappointed
Ljubica Gojgic , senior political analyst for Belgrade ’s B92 news service , found the ruling “ very disappointing . "
" I ’m amazed .... that the court based its ruling on the ‘ representatives ' of the Kosovo people .
This deteriorates the credibility and independence of the court .... T hey obviously did n’t have the strength to resist the pressure they were under , ” he says .
In Kosovo ’s capital Pristina , the ruling was received with some delight .
Agron Bajrami , chief editor of the daily Koha Ditore , says , “ This was unexpected .
We were expecting something very ambiguous , but the wording is clear .
It ’s a good development that will open a new phase for recognition and positive movement . ”
Whether by coincidence or not , a former prime minister of Kosovo , Ramush Haradinaj , exonerated by the UN war crimes tribunal at the Hague , was apprehended Wednesday and will be re-tried by the UN court on six counts of murder and torture .
The tribunal says witnesses in Mr. Haradinaj ’s original case were threatened .
The arrest will change the political landscape in Kosovo , as Haradinaj has been gaining ground as the principal opponent of Mr. Thaci .
Kosovo is devoutly remembered by Serbs as the scene of an epic struggle between Serb Prince Lazar and the Ottomans in 1389 , in which the Serb side lost heroically ; many of Serbia ’s most treasured churches are located in Kosovo .
The state is bordered by Macedonia , Serbia , and Albania , and for much of history was so sequestered that a Bulgarian geographer called it “ almost as unknown and inaccessible as a stretch of land as Central Africa . ”
While its Albanian roots are disputed by Belgrade , British scholar Noel Malcolm describes the Albanian presence there as one of the oldest in Europe .
After the UN court decision , Russia ’s response will be watched closely .
While Moscow had originally decried Western arguments for Kosovo independence , it appeared to jettison those arguments after backing the right of Abkhazia and South Ossetia to declared independence in the weeks after the 2008 war in Georgia .
Kosovo has largely been peaceful since 2008 , with few outright clashes between Serbs and Albanians .
Most Serbs live or have moved to the town of Mitrovica in the north , an area contiguous with Serbia .
The legal and political disposition of Mitrovica remains unresolved .

STRAMMER INN : California - guvernør Arnold Schwarzenegger må få kontroll på de offentlige utgiftene .

Offentlige ansatte i California må ta fri uten lønn
Californias guvernør Arnold Schwarzenegger besluttet onsdag at tusener av offentlig ansatte må ta fri uten lønn for å spare delstaten for utgifter .
Oppdatert 29 . juli 2010
Artikkelen er over ti år gammel
Schwarzenegger sa at delstaten , som står overfor et budsjettunderskudd på 19 milliarder dollar , står på randen av kollaps .
Myndighetene må kanskje begynne å utstede gjeldsbrev i august for å unngå å slippe opp for midler .
Alle offentlig ansatte må fra august ta tre dager fri uten lønn hver måned til det foreligger et nytt budsjett .
Det tilsvarer et lønnskutt på 14 prosent .
De eneste som er unntatt , er politi og brannmenn , samt ansatte i skatteetaten .
California har vært uten budsjett siden juni mens lovgiverne krangler om hvordan de skal få ned underskuddet .
Det trengs et flertall på to tredeler for å vedta budsjettet , noe som gir de mest radikale på begge sider stor innflytelse .
Schwarzenegger har truet med å avslutte sin periode som guvernør uten å undertegne et nytt budsjett , om ikke lovgiverne går med på en serie pensjons - , skatte - og utgiftsreformer .

( CNN ) -- Frustrated with the baggage fees airlines seem to be throwing at you left and right ?
UPS has introduced a new product that reminds travelers of an alternative to lugging bags .
Ship your luggage and have it waiting for you at your destination .
UPS is selling new luggage boxes that allow travelers to skip the suitcase altogether .
The luggage box is one of the three options
The UPS Store has to offer travelers who want to avoid airline baggage hassles such as lost luggage and time - consuming security checks .
Luggage can be shipped as is , placed in a traditional box or shipped sans suitcase in the new luggage box .
Shipping does come at a price , and the new box is extra .
A small , carry - on sized box runs $ 12.95 .
A larger box is $ 17.65 .
The cost of shipping is determined by weight , distance traveled and the service selected .
The boxes are reusable and cut down on shipping charges by dropping the weight of a traditional suitcase .
If a last - minute change of plan were to occur , the luggage boxes -- which meet airline standards -- can be taken aboard planes .
The smaller box meets carry - on requirements , UPS said in a news release .
UPS does not recommend this alternative to checking bags for international travel , because of duties and taxes associated with international shipments .
Although shipping luggage via air is possible , the high cost is likely to trump convenience for most travelers .
Shipping bags via UPS ground transportation is priced more competitively with airline baggage fees , although generally still more expensive .
Is shipping cheaper than airline bag fees ?
The drawback : Travelers have to plan ahead to get shipments to their destinations on time .
The bonus : Unencumbered movement through security , onto the flight and out of the airport without a stop at the baggage carousel .
U.S. airlines made $ 769 million in baggage fees from January to March this year , according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics ' 1st - Quarter 2010 Airline Financial Data .
Delta alone collected $ 217.8 million in baggage fees this quarter .
" Luggage shipping picked up when the airlines began increasing fees for checked bags and carry - ons , " said John Minetola , a UPS Store franchisee in a statement .
Shipped luggage can be tracked with UPS mobile apps for cell phones or travelers can receive e-mail shipment notifications .
Now that we ’ve figured out why the climate bill died , it ’s time to start thinking about the consequences .
The failure does n’t just mean that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions will continue inching up .
It also means that we probably wo n’t see a global climate deal anytime soon .
And that means untold years of ever - increasing emissions — and likely dire consequences for human habitation on Earth .
Think about a global climate pact from China ’s perspective .
Why should it take leadership , now that the U.S. has refused to act ?
Sure , China stands as the globe ’s most prodigious greenhouse gas emitter , and its annual emissions are growing rapidly .
But in terms of emissions per person , China stills lags behind us dramatically — the average Chinese person has less than a fourth of the carbon footprint of her U.S. counterpart .
Moreover , we prosperous consumers in the post - industrial global north are deeply implicated in China ’s voracious and growing demand for dirty fossil fuels .
According to one study , fully one - quarter of China ’s GHG emissions stem from its export trade to Europe and the United States .
Think about that next time you reel in goodies ( including iPhones and other tech gadgets ) at the nearest Big Box .
In China , the most visible consequence will likely be a growing proliferation of cars .
As Scientific American put it :
Even though China only has 24 cars for every thousand Chinese ( compared to 800 cars for every thousand Americans ) the country is on pace to become the world ’s largest purchaser of automobiles by 2020 — and this growing love affair between the Chinese and driving is a risk for the entire planet .
But the country ’s growing appetite for meat — and its rapid conversion to U.S. - style industrial meat production — may prove just as damaging .
Consumption of grain - intensive meat carries has a massive greenhouse gas footprint ( although the claim that it ’s greater than that of transportation has come into question ) .
Chinese diners still have much to learn from us in terms of gross carnivory .
As of 2002 — the last year for which I can find data — U.S. citizens were putting away 125 kg of meat per capita each year , vs. 52 kg for Chinese people .
( USDA ) As in other areas , as the nation industrializes , the meat gap is closing .
Consumption of pork , the most popular meat in China , tells the story .
According to this 2010 USDA report [ PDF ] , Chinese pork consumption jumped from 22 million tons in 1990 to more than 50 million tons in 2009 — a 127 percent increase in just 20 years .
Today , the nation consumes about half of all pork produced worldwide .
And as consumption surges , the nation ’s corn production has failed to keep up with the needs of the budding livestock industry .
And that means a massive push to import corn .
In a startling recent speech at the U.S. Grains Council — an organization that dedicates itself to “ developing export markets for U.S. barley , corn , grain sorghum , and related products ” — a prominent Chinese agribusiness analyst declared a “ new era ” in world corn markets had dawned .
According to an account of the speech on the evocatively named Agrimoney.com website , the analyst declared that Chinese corn imports will surge from zero in 2008 to 15 million metric tons by 2014 , because “ China ’s demand for corn , used largely as livestock feed , was ‘ simply outstripping ’ domestic production . ”
( A metric ton is a bit more than a U.S. ton — about 2,205 pounds . )
To put 15 million metric tons in perspective , let ’s consult the National Corn Growers Association ’s ever- useful publication , 2010 World of Corn [ PDF ] .
Last year , WOC tells us , the globe ’s nations imported a total of 85 million metric tons of corn , of which China accounted for only a tiny part .
If we add in China ’s expected 15 million - metric - ton buy in 2014 , global corn imports will surge to 100 million metric tons — an 18 percent jump in just five years .
Note that corn is a massively resource - intensive crop .
Our corn crop sucks in nearly 40 percent of all nitrogen fertilizer applied in the United States , and upwards of 30 percent of phosphorous and potash .
( Numbers crunched from USDA data , see table 2 . )
Such voracious use of fertilizers causes all manner of ecological trouble — not least of which is emissions of nitrous oxide , a greenhouse gas some 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide .
( See our recent series on nitrogen fertilizer , as well as this discussion of the ravages of phosphorous mining . )
Where will China get this massive cache of corn ?
According to WOC , the United States is by far the world ’s biggest corn exporter .
In 2009 , it exported 52 million metric tons , accounting for 60 percent of global corn exports , easily besting its two closest rivals , Argentina and Brazil , each of which accounted for about 10 percent of global exports .
But between now and 2014 , an ever - increasing share of U.S. corn will be going into ethanol production ; and U.S. farmers are already dedicating near - record amounts of land to corn .
That means that China ’s demand surge will likely be met by Argentina and Brazil , with their vast reserves of uncultivated land .
Those nations will likely convert more grassland and savanna to corn production — unleashing untold quantities of carbon in the conversion process , and subjecting millions of acres of land to a cascade of fossil fuel - derived agrichemicals .
The result will be a boon for U.S. agribusiness titans like Archer Daniels Midland , Cargill , and Monsanto , which dominate the global grain trade and provide the inputs necessary for industrial corn production .
And that wo n’t be the only way U.S. interests benefit from surging Chinese meat consumption .
The handful of companies that dominate U.S. meat production are itching for the chance to access the China market .
China has tried to be as self - sufficient as possible in meat , repeatedly shutting down its relatively modest trade with U.S. pork producers — the latest instance of which involved the 2009 swine - flu scare .
China reopened its market to U.S. pork recently — and our meat merchants fervently hope that this trade trickle will turn into a gusher .
Obama ’s U.S. Trade Office — whose agricultural operations are led by former agrich
emical - industry lobbyist Isi Sidiqqui — vigorously supports that goal .
USDA chief Tom Vilsack is on board , too .
“ When I traveled to China with U.S. Trade Representative Kirk in October , our discussions with Chinese officials laid the groundwork for reopening this market , ” Vilsack recently boasted .
He called the reopening of the China market to U.S. pork “ excellent news for American hog producers . ”
In a Reuters article on pork last spring , Iowa State economics professor Dermot Hayes laid out the scale of the China opportunity in blunt terms .
“ If China really left markets work , and gave us 5 to 10 years we could be exporting 50 percent of [ all the pork ] the U.S. produces just to that one country , ” Hayes told Reuters .
“ Long term , China is land scarce and Asian countries that are land scarce traditionally import a lot of pork , as much as 25 percent of what they consume .
Japan is up at 50 percent . ”
He added :
They [ China ] have a lot of inefficient pork production — very labor intensive — and they have a better use for those individuals in the cities at construction sites .
So as they leave the countryside , there is a huge potential for pork to replace the backyard production that will quit .
Hayes ’ remark about “ inefficient pork production ” points to a second way U.S. meat giants could benefit from the vast and growing China market .
Not only could companies like Tyson and Smithfield export enormous amounts of industrial pork to China , but they could also provide consulting services on how to wipe out millions of small - scale hog farmers and concentrate production into vast CAFOs .
That ’s the feat performed by U.S. hog giants like Smithfield in the 1990s — and it ’s precisely what China is attempting to do , working directly with U.S. meat companies .
Back in 2008 , Smithfield cemented its ties with China by selling 5 percent of its shares to the state - owned COFCO Group , China ’s largest food importer and exporter and a budding pork producer .
As part of the deal , Smithfield agreed to lend lend COFCO its industrial hog-production expertise .
Forbes reported at the time that COFCO was then slaughtering half a million hogs annually , “ under contract with small producers . ”
In partnership with Smithfield , COFCO hopes to boost production to between 10 million and 15 million hogs within three to five years .
Here the kicker : they ’ll be “ raised in accordance with standards and practices prevailing in the United States . ”
Smithfield ’s practices were aptly described in the legendary 2006 Rolling Stone article , “ Boss Hog . ”
Another Chinese company , Agfeed Industries , is also leaning on U.S. pork industry players to assemble what it calls a “ a fully integrated production system from the feed that the animals eat , to their breeding and growth , and finally to slaughter and processing . ”
To build out its “ western style farm system , ” Agfeed has tapped U.S. industry veteran Gerry Daignault as its “ Chief Operating Officer , Head of Hog Production and Strategic Development . ”
And just last week , Agfeed bought U.S. hog producer M2P2 , which raises 1.3 million hogs each year .
The purpose of the deal was to “ help AgFeed boost its hog production by implementing more efficient Western - style production methods , ” an Agfeed adviser told Associated Press .
Thus , aided by U.S. agribusiness execs and cheered on by U.S. trade officials , China looks set to dramatically ramp up pork consumption , both by importing finished product from the United States and industrializing its own production .
Mountains of corn , grown with gushers of synthetic nitrogen and other fossil fuel - related inputs , will be needed .
The climate implications are startling .
It ’s the kind of thing only a global climate deal , brokered by the U.S. , could stop .

Image caption Illegal logging is a major driver of deforestation in some countries
The European Parliament has voted to ban imports of illegal timber .
From 2012 , companies importing timber will need to prove where it came from , and will face legal sanctions if they do not comply with the new law .
The vote follows several years of wrangling over how stringent the legislation should be .
Campaigners say they are pleased that the issue is to be addressed at last .
About 20 % of timber coming into the EU is thought to be illegal .
The illegal timber trade plays a significant part in the deforestation of some tropical countries .
It helped sustain the recent Liberian civil conflict as armed factions used the revenue for arms .
This law hangs up a ' closed for business ' sign to a destructive market Sebastien Risso , Greenpeace
" At last the link between the European market and the forests around the world ravaged by illegal logging has been weakened , " said Finland 's Green MEP Satu Hassi , who has led moves within the parliament .
" For too long the EU has preached against such logging and the resulting massive deforestation while simultaneously providing one of the largest markets for illegal timber .
" As such , this agreement on the illegally sourced timber represents a major international breakthrough . "
Corporate welcome
The new law will force companies operating in the EU to produce " chain of supply " documentation so that , in principle , each piece of timber can be traced right back to its source .
Image caption Oscar winner Marion Cotillard has been highlighting the illegal timber issue
Companies that operate " responsible timber " policies have welcomed the move .
" It is good news that Europe has finally agreed to crack down on illegal timber , creating a level playing field for responsible retailers , " said Ian Cheshire , CEO of Kingfisher plc , the parent company of European DIY giants such as B & Q , Castorama and Screwfix .
" This new regulation will mean that consumers can have even greater confidence that the wood products they buy are not contributing to deforestation and climate change . "
Campaign groups working on environmental and human rights issues were also generally pleased by the move .
" This law hangs up a ' closed for business ' sign to a destructive market , " said Greenpeace EU forest policy director Sebastien Risso .
" It promises to level the playing field so legitimate companies and customers are better able to act sustainably . "
However , they were disappointed that EU member states fought for and obtained exemptions for five years on printed materials .
To a large extent , the new law replicates measures contained in the amendment to the Lacey Act passed in the US in 2008 .
Update :
To clarify , this service is not available to all users , but only to the users who are members of the partnership program .
YouTube 's movie rental service is still in its infancy , and it still only offers a small selection of films , but that could change quickly .
YouTube exec Hunter Walk told MediaPost that the site will soon offer its users the ability to charge rental fees for their uploaded videos .
For the past couple of years YouTube has been focusing on ways for its users to monetize their videos should they become very popular .
It launched the YouTube Partnership Program last year , which allows some folks with popular videos ( YouTube staff decide which ones are eligible ) to share advertising revenue with Google .
However , this new self - service rental plan will be the first opportunity YouTube users have to make money off of their videos by charging viewers instead of relying on advertising .
Details on the program are scarce — for example , we 're not sure if just any user can partake , or if the program is only available to industry professionals .
Admittedly , " industry professional " is a difficult term to define in the frontier of web video , which sees content from established companies competing directly with randomly viral videos from unexpected sources .

WASHINGTON , DC— In an 86 - 14 vote , the Senate approved legislation Monday establishing PlatinumPlus Preferred citizenship , an exciting new program offering special benefits and discounts to select members of the U.S .
President Clinton tells a group of PlatinumPlus Preferred citizens about the many benefits they will enjoy as members .

" By becoming a Platinum Plus citizen , you join an exclusive club of elite Americans , " said President Clinton , who signed the bill into law late Monday .
" And as part of that club , you 'll be eligible for many special benefits , including tax breaks , excusal from jury duty , and vacations at special PlatinumPlus Caribbean resorts , which are off - limits to ordinary , EconoBudget citizenry .
It 's our way of saying thank you to our best customers . "
" And , of course , " Clinton added , " there are never any annual fees . "
PlatinumPlus citizens — selected according to a number of demographic factors , including age , race and socio- economic status — will enjoy a wide variety of other benefits , including immunity from speeding tickets ; separate , no - wait lines at over 50,000 post - office locations nationwide ; and wider , more comfortable window seating .

PlatinumPlus citizens Connie and Russell Brodhagen of Del Mar , CA , enjoy a round of golf in a members - only , walled - in golfing facility in East Los Angeles , undisturbed by the surrounding war zone of urban poverty .
After just one year in the club , members can also begin earning extra votes for elections .
" Would n't you like to earn up to five bonus votes for the next presidential election ? " said U.S. Rep. Roger Wicker ( R - MS ) , a co-sponsor of the measure .
" With your new Platinum Plus citizenship , you can . "

According to Wicker , those at the highest level of the new program , or " Diamond Club " citizens , will enjoy additional rewards , including a pass good for acquittal from one crime ( misdemeanor or felony ) , a no-interest credit line of up to $ 500,000 and , for able - bodied male Platinum Plus members between ages 18 and 35 , excusal from the draft should a foreign war arise .
Gordon Alarie , CEO of the Dallas - based Integrated Systems Management Group , was among the first to receive a PlatinumPlus citizenship offer in the mail .
" As CEO and founder of a Fortune 500 corporation , I 've contributed a great deal to the U.S. over the years , " Alarie said .
" It 's nice to know that now , with the PlatinumPlus Preferred citizenship program , I 'll finally start getting something back . "

Rosalyn Murcheson Biddle , a Scarsdale , NY , art collector , was also extended an offer to join .
" The Platinum Plus - only express lanes on the highways are nice , and so are the unlimited drinks , " Biddle said .
" But what I really like is the program 's Gold Circle Premium Health Care package , which gets me access to the finest medical care anywhere .
It 's nice to know that if I ever get too wrapped up in a car - phone conversation and hit another vehicle , emergency workers arriving on the scene will prioritize my injuries over those of any other people who may have been hurt . "
Added Biddle : " The free cancer inoculations are a nice plus , too . "
Clinton stressed that those not eligible for PlatinumPlus citizenship will still enjoy the many benefits of regular U.S. citizenship , including one free vote in each election , a court - appointed attorney if arrested , and a number of fully guaranteed constitutional rights , including freedom of speech and the right to bear arms .

" To our nation 's EconoBudget citizens , I want to assure you that you will still get the same great service from your government that you always have , " Clinton said .
" The postal delivery , the voting , the Social Security checks — it 's all still part of the basic citizenship package .
And while , yes , a few certain special privileges will be off - limits to you , that should in no way make you feel like a second - class citizen .
Remember , we are all Americans here , no matter how poorly or well we are treated . "
The climate scientists at the centre of a media storm were today cleared of accusations that they fudged their results and silenced critics to bolster the case for man-made global warming .
Sir Muir Russell , the senior civil servant who led a six - month inquiry into the affair , said the " rigour and honesty " of the scientists at the world - leading Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) are not in doubt .
They did not subvert the peer review process to censor criticism as alleged , the panel found , while key data needed to reproduce their findings was freely available to any " competent " researcher .
The panel did criticise the scientists for not being open enough about their work , and said they were " unhelpful and defensive " when responding to legitimate requests made under freedom of information ( FOI ) laws .
The row was sparked when 13 years of emails from CRU scientists were hacked and released online last year .
Climate change sceptics claimed they showed scientists manipulating and suppressing data to back up a theory of man-made climate change .
Critics also alleged that the scientists abused their positions to cover up flaws and distort the peer review process that determines which studies are published in journals , and so enter the scientific record .
Some alleged that the emails cast doubt on the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
Announcing the findings , Russell said : " Ultimately this has to be about what they did , not what they said . "
He added : " The honesty and rigour of CRU as scientists are not in doubt ...
We have not found any evidence of behaviour that might undermine the conclusions of the IPCC assessments . "
The review is the third and final inquiry into the email affair , dubbed " climategate " , and effectively clears Professor Phil Jones , head of the CRU , and his colleagues of the most serious charges .
Questions remain over the way in which they responded to requests for information from people outside the conventional scientific arena , some of whom were long - standing critics of Jones .
" We do find that there has been a consistent pattern of failing to display the proper degree of openness , both on the part of CRU scientists and on the part of the UEA , " the report , commissioned by UEA , said .
It also criticised the CRU scientists for failing to include proper labels on a 1999 graph prepared for the World Meteorological Organisation , which was the subject of an infamous email about Jones using a " trick " to " hide the decline " .
The panel said the result was misleading , though they accepted this was not deliberate as the necessary caveats had been included in the report text .
Separately , it was announced today that Phil Jones has accepted the new post of director of research at CRU .
The vice chancellor of UEA , Professor Edward Acton , said this was " not a demotion but a shift in emphasis of role " for Phil Jones .
" CRU will be more closely integrated in the bigger school of environmental sciences and a key difference is to place some of the administrative burden that Phil had before this incident on the head of the school , " said Prof Acton .
Jones will be more free to direct and conduct his own research .
Future FOI requests for the CRU will be directed though the head of the school , Professor Jacquie Burgess , and the ultimate responsibility for such requests will lie with the vice - chancellor , as highlighted in the Russell report .

You see , there are two models of Arab governance .
The old Nasserite model , which Hamas still practices , where leaders say : “ Judge me by how I resist Israel or America . ”
And : “ First we get a state , then we build the institutions . ”
The new model , pioneered in the West Bank by Abbas and Fayyad is : “ Judge me by how I perform  how I generate investment and employment , deliver services and pick up the garbage .
First we build transparent and effective political and security institutions .
Then we declare a state .
That is what the Zionists did , and it sure worked for them . ”

The most important thing going on in this conflict today is that since 2007 the Palestinian Authority , Jordan and the U.S. have partnered to train a whole new West Bank Palestinian security force in policing , administration and even human rights .
The program is advised by U.S. Lt. Gen. Keith Dayton  one of the unsung good guys .
The Israeli Army has become impressed enough by the performance of the new Palestinian National Security Force , or N.S.F. , under Abbas and Fayyad that those forces are now largely responsible for law and order in all the major West Bank towns , triggering an explosion of Palestinian building , investment and commerce in those areas .
Here are highlights : the Jordanians have trained and the Palestinian Authority deployed and equipped five N.S.F. battalions and one Presidential Guard unit , some 3,100 men .
Plus , 65 Palestinian first - responders have been trained and are being equipped with emergency gear .
A Palestinian National Training Center , with classrooms and dorms , is nearing completion in Jericho so the Palestinians themselves can take over the training .
The Palestinian Authority is building a 750 - man N.S.F. camp to garrison the new N.S.F. troops  including barracks , gym and parade ground  near Jenin .
At the same time , the Palestinian security headquarters are all being rebuilt in every major Palestinian town , starting in Hebron .
An eight - week senior leadership training course in Jericho  bringing together the Palestinian police , the N.S.F. and Presidential Guards  has graduated 280 people , including 20 women .
A course for captains and below in how to handle everything from crowd control to elections has also begun .
The reinvigorated Palestinian Ministry of Interior is leading the Palestinian security sector transformation , and the Canadians are helping to set up Joint Operations Centers across the West Bank so all Palestinian security services can coordinate via video conferencing .
The Canadians are also helping the Palestinians to build a logistics center .
Parallel with all this , Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu has reduced Israel ’s manned checkpoints in the West Bank from 42 to 12 .
This wo n’t be politically sustainable for Abbas and Fayyad , though , unless Israel begins to turn full authority over to the Palestinians for their major cities  so - called area A  in the West Bank .
Palestinians have to see their new security services as building their state , not cushioning Israel ’s occupation .
There could be a moment of truth here for Israel soon , but at least it will be based on something real .

The study looked at common injuries in school rugby
Rugby scrums should be banned in schools to protect children involved in a sport which is " not safe enough " for them , an expert has warned .
Professor Allyson Pollock , director of Edinburgh University 's Centre for International Public Health Policy , called for the ban after research into child injuries .
The study was carried out during 190 rugby matches at five schools .
There were 37 injuries recorded , with 20 taken to accident and emergency .
Scottish Rugby said safety was an issue of the highest priority and it worked to ensure the game 's laws reflected this .
The tackle was the " commonest phase of play causing injury " with the head and face the most injured body part , along with sprains or ligament damage .
Prof Pollock , one of the study 's authors , said : " High tackles and scrums should be banned .
The sport is not safe enough for schoolchildren and not enough is being done to protect the safety of children .
If youngsters were coming back from school trips with these rates of injuries it would be enough to trigger a major inquiry Prof Allyson Pollock , Centre for International Public Health Policy
" We know that most injuries occur in tackles and the scrum so there have got to be much greater safety measures in these areas . "
She said moderating play may change rugby , but it was better to have a safe game than a dangerous one .
" Concussion is under - reported because it 's not being monitored properly .
Repeated concussions may have severe long - term consequences , " the professor added , warning that teachers and coaches have a duty of care towards children .
" If youngsters were coming back from school trips with these rates of injuries it would be enough to trigger a major inquiry . "
In the 193 matches played by 470 children in Scotland between January to April last year , the injury incidence during the match play was 10.8 injuries per 1,000 player hours .
Out of 37 rugby injuries amongst the youngsters , 29 were sustained by children aged between 14 and 17 and eight in the 11 to 13 age group .
Injury surveillance
A spinal injury was admitted overnight in hospital and the 19 other injuries seen at accident and emergency were discharged without admission .
Eight of the injuries resulted in time off school .
Five of those injured were off school for one day , one was off for three days , one for five days and the spinal injury caused the youngster to be " off school long - term " , the research said .
The study , to be published in the Journal of Public Health , also said a rugby injury surveillance system in Scottish schools should be " strongly encouraged " .
A spokesman for Scottish Rugby said : " Scottish Rugby believes player safety and welfare to be an issue of the highest priority and has been at the forefront of piloting a number of variations to the game 's laws designed to make the game safer and more enjoyable for all .
" In 2009 , Scottish Rugby was commended by Scotland 's chief medical officer , Dr Harry Burns , and the International Rugby Board ( IRB ) , for its groundbreaking introduction of the ' Are you ready to play rugby ? ' initiative . "
The Scottish government helped to fund the research .
A government spokeswoman said : " We initiated preliminary work around this study and we will now look closely at the findings of the research .
" While the Scottish government is fully supportive of school rugby , it 's very important we have accurate data about injuries sustained on the pitch to ensure that young people are not being exposed to disproportionate risks . "
If earlier this afternoon you felt a lightness in your step , if you thought you faintly heard the collective geek consciousness of the world let out a relieved sigh , we know the reason why .
Rejoice , friends , for it seems the tumult that has been plaguing the filming of The Hobbit is finally being resolved in the best of all possible ways !
Yes , word has reached us via the good folks at Sci Fi Wire , who had the news from Deadline New York , that Peter Jackson is in negotiations to take the helm of the movies ( it will be made in two parts ) .
To virtually anyone who saw the Lord of the Rings films , this can be nothing but good news .
Some of us geeks were unhappy when Guillermo del Toro quit the project , and some of us were pleased ; but all of us , I think , were nervous about who might be hired to replace him .
We can finally get the neekerbreekers out of our stomach , though , for our worries have ( it seems ) proved unfounded .
Assuming the deal gets done , of course , but it seems unlikely they'd let it leak unless it was close to signed .
Now , we just need to hold our collective breath waiting to see who 's chosen to play Bilbo .

INTERNET giant Google has announced it is now paying its gay and lesbian staff more than its heterosexual employees in the US .
The search engine is compensating same - sex partners for the higher taxes they pay on domestic partners health benefits .
The company said in its blog today that it would be grossing - up imputed taxes on health insurance benefits for all same - sex domestic partners in the US .
Same - sex couples who include domestic partners on their health insurance pay federal taxes .
Married couples do not have to pay taxes on spousal health benefits .
Google is not offering any extra pay to heterosexual domestic partners , because the company said heterosexual employees have the option of avoiding the tax by getting married .
Daryl Herrschaft , director of the Workplace Project at Human Rights Campaign , a gay rights advocacy group , said Google 's policy was a step in the right direction .
" They 're picking up the slack where the federal government has n't recognised the reality of diversity in the workforce today , " Mr Herrschaft said .
" This is eliminating existing discrimination that ... gays and lesbians face in the workplace as a result of federal law that doesnt acknowledge their families . "
But Focus on the Family , a Christian organisation aimed at providing practical help for marriage and parenting , said the policy falls short of its goal to offer equal benefits to employees .
" If Google wants to be truly fair to its employees , it should consider extra compensation to married heterosexuals who are bitten every April 15 by the marriage - penalty tax , " spokesman Gary Schneeberger said .
" How is offering more money to only one group to offset a perceived inequity not a form of discrimination against those groups not fortunate enough to receive such bonuses ? "

Apple has issued an official statement about the iPhone 4 antenna issue , attributing the problem to a mistake in the formula that calculates the number of bars to display .
Apple says that a software update will be available " within a few weeks " that will correct the issue , not only for the iPhone 4 , but also the 3GS and 3G .
" To start with , gripping almost any mobile phone in certain ways will reduce its reception by 1 or more bars .
This is true of iPhone 4 , iPhone 3GS , as well as many Droid , Nokia and RIM phones .
But some users have reported that iPhone 4 can drop 4 or 5 bars when tightly held in a way which covers the black strip in the lower left corner of the metal band , " wrote Apple .
" This is a far bigger drop than normal , and as a result some have accused the iPhone 4 of having a faulty antenna design . "
Simultaneously , Apple says it has gotten hundreds of e-mails saying that the iPhone 4 reception is better than the 3GS — this proved to be true in many cases for us during our testing of the iPhone 4 , even though we could reliably reproduce the signal dropping problem .
Apple 's explanation is that the iPhone — including 3G and 3GS — has always displayed too many bars given a certain level of signal strength .
The company plans to adopt AT&T 's recommended formula instead as part of its software update and has gone back to re-test everything .
" Upon investigation , we were stunned to find that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong .
Our formula , in many instances , mistakenly displays 2 more bars than it should for a given signal strength , " wrote Apple .
" Users observing a drop of several bars when they grip their iPhone in a certain way are most likely in an area with very weak signal strength , but they do n't know it because we are erroneously displaying 4 or 5 bars .
Their big drop in bars is because their high bars were never real in the first place . "
The bar issue can be a complicated one — we wrote a feature on the disconnect between bars and cell signal back in 2008 that still applies today — but it 's important to note that there is no industry standard for how signal translates into the bar display .
Manufacturers generally make up their own scale and assign signal values to each bar , taking into consideration noise or interference that may be occurring in your environment .
Apple 's explanation that it always used too many bars — especially for users in low signal areas — sounds like the company was n't doing enough to account for interference or the other variables that come with overall signal strength , resident Ars programmer and former GSM / RF Engineer Clint Ecker told us .
At the same time , the explanation gives us some pause — why has this problem in bar calculation only come up now and not previously if it has been in practice for two years already ?
Furthermore , Apple 's statement does n't address the very real issue of handsets losing up to 24 dB of signal strength from simple bridging two of the phone 's antennas — which is either a serious hardware flaw or another error in how the phone detunes its antennas .
Apple did n't give enough information to really know what 's going on , but we cautiously await this software update that will claim to fix everything .
Update : Readers have reminded us that Apple actually bumped up its bar display as part of the release of iPhone OS 2.1 , casting further doubt on Apple 's apparent stunned - ness at the situation .
" Improved accuracy of the 3G signal strength display " was one of the main listed features when 2.1 came out in September of 2008 .
Earth is notexactly getting its youth back , but a new study has determined that the collisionfrom which the Earth and moon were formed may have occurred much later thanpreviously thought , making our planet and moon younger than scientists hadcommonly believed .
The Earthand the moon were created as a result of a giant collision between two planetsthe size of Mars and Venus .
Until now , it was believed that the collisionoccurred when the solar system was 30 million years old ?
roughly 4.5 billion yearsago .
But , according to a new study that was recently published in the scientific journalEarth and Planetary Science Letters , the true age of the Earth and moon can bedetermined by examining the presence of certain radioactive elements in the Earth 's mantle .
The resultsof the research show that the Earth and moon must have formed much later thanpreviously thought ?
perhaps up to 150 million years after the formation of thesolar system .
That makes our home planet a bit younger than scientists thought .
" Wehave determined the ages of the Earth and the moon using tungsten isotopes , which can reveal whether the iron cores and their stone surfaces have beenmixed together during the collision , " said Tais Dahl , who conducted theresearch as his thesis project in geophysics at the Neils Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen , in collaboration with David Stevenson from the California Institute of Technology .
The theorysurrounding the formation of theplanetsin our solar system is largely a tale of cosmic bumper cars .
The planets as wesee them today were created as the result of a series of collisions betweensmall dwarf planets orbiting the newborn sun .
By slamming into each other , thesmall planets melted together and formed larger planets .
The last ofthese giant impact events was thought to be the one from which the moon formed , said Dahl .
Theplanetary bodies that collided in this impact smashed into each other at a timewhen both had a core of metal ( iron ) and a surrounding mantle of silicates ( rock ) .
It isbelieved that the collision took place in less than 24 hours , and since thetemperature of the Earth was a scorching 12,600 degrees Fahrenheit ( 7,000degrees Celsius ) , it was thought that both the rock and metal melted andemulsified together in the turbulent impact .
" Thebig question is : how do we date and determine the age of this event ?
There hasbeen a lot of discussion about that , " Dahl told SPACE.com .
Researcherspreviously believed that the rock and iron mixed completely during thecollision and subsequent planet formation , and it was therefore concluded thatthe moon was formed when the solar system was 30 million years old .
This newstudy , however , paints a different picture .
Theresearchers were able to determine the age of the Earth and moon by examining the presence of certain radioactive elements in the Earth 's mantle .
Hafnium - 182is one such radioactive substance , and it decays and is converted into theisotope tungsten - 182 .
Hafnium and tungsten have markedly different chemicalproperties , and while the tungsten isotopes prefer to bond with metal , hafniumis prone to bonding to silicates , such as rock .
It takes50 - 60 million years for all hafnium to decay and be converted into tungsten , and during the moon - forming collision , nearly all the metal sank into the Earth 's core .
Yet , researchers were unsure if the tungsten had fallen into thecore as well .
" Wehave studied to what degree metal and rock mix together during the planetforming collisions , " Dahl said .
" Using dynamic model calculations ofthe turbulent mixing of the liquid rock and iron masses we have found thattungsten isotopes from the Earth 's early formation remain in the rockymantle . "
From thesemodels , the researchers claim that the moon - forming collision occurred afterall of the hafnium had decayed completely into tungsten .
As such , the Earth andmoon must have formed much later than scientists had thought .
" Ourresults show that metal core and rock are unable to emulsify in these collisions betweenplanetsthat are greater than 10 kilometers ( 6.2 miles ) in diameter and therefore thatmost of the Earth 's iron core ( 80 - 99 percent ) did not remove tungsten from therocky material in the mantle during formation . "
Verizon has beaten this drum before , but it seems that AT&T 's move to tiered data has inspired them to cut unlimited plans as soon as this year .
It 's time to say goodbye to the all - you - can - download buffet .

The comments this time came from CFO John Killian , who came out more explicitly than past Verizon execs in favor of a tiered system in a recent Businessweek interview
" We will probably need to change the design of our pricing where it will not be totally unlimited , flat rate . "

Killian also mentioned that they 're currently in the process of finalizing new 4G data plans , so there are no specifics but they 're coming soon .
4G is again the scapegoat , as Killian mentioned that " explosions in traffic " will make unlimited , flat rate plans unfeasible .
Well , it was fun while it lasted .
At least Clearwire 's committed to keeping unlimited 4G plans alive .
For now .

" The MDC roots were in the popular challenge to ZANU - PF in the late 1990s and the social movements on which it rested . "
By Leo Zeilig
June 28 , 2010 – Zimbabwe ’s economy has been in free fall .
Between 2000 and 2005 , the economy contracted by more than 40 per cent .
Today GDP per capita is estimated to be the same as it was in 1953 .
Before the replacement of the Zimbabwe dollar with the US dollar and the South African rand in 2009 , the country had the highest inflation rate in the world , soaring to 165,000 per cent in February 2008 .
At the start of 2007 , the IMF calculated that 80 per cent of Zimbabwe ’s population lived below the poverty line .
The Consumer Council of Zimbabwe declared in September 2007 that people needed a minimum of Z$ 22 million per month to survive , far above the income of most Zimbabweans .
Schools collapsed , major hospitals suffered from basic shortages and unemployment reached an estimated 80 per cent , a situation that has not been significantly improved following the establishment of the joint Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front ( ZANU - PF ) –Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) government in 2009 . [ i ]
While much of the economic crisis was triggered by the land seizures , this explanation , favoured by capitalist media commentators and orthodox economists , gives only a fraction of the picture .
Zimbabwe has also been squeezed by the implementation of direct and indirect sanctions by Western countries .
An international legislative structure has forced the pace of this strangulation ; this has included the US Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 , which immediately cut access to international credit for the state and Zimbabwe companies .
The reduction in aid means that the country now receives less than US $ 10 aid for every HIV - infected person , compared to the regional average of $ 100 .
As international funds have dried up , the state has been largely incapacitated , with welfare provision , often in the form of food aid , now being provided by international agencies and NGOs .[ ii ]
In the face of economic collapse , the regime has been unable to sustain its attempts to capture support through a limited program of reforms .
Early this decade , ZANU - PF introduced price controls on basic commodities but was forced to suspend them as massive shortages hit most shops .
Since then the regime has swung wildly backwards and forwards between price controls and market - based approaches .
Caught in a global economic vice , the regime resorted to what it had always done .
Land and business contracts were distributed to cronies , while President Robert Mugabe mouthed platitudes about “ foreign powers ” .
ZANU - PF relied increasingly on violence , as each reform was snatched back under pressure from the economic crisis .
The regime ’s authoritarian neoliberalism has continued unabated , albeit chaotically , for years .
For the past six years Zimbabwe ’s Reserve Bank governor Gideon Gono has pursued a haphazard program of cuts in subsidies , privatisation and debt repayment . [ iii ]
Though land reform in Zimbabwe was celebrated across much of Africa as a historical blow against the legacy of colonial inequality , this was also a failure .
In 2002 , ZANU - PF stated that it intended to seize 8.5 million hectares of land before the presidential elections that year , the majority of land owned by white farmers .
They succeeded in doing this by 2003 , as the pace of land seizures and occupations came to an end . [ iv ]
Although the regime could provoke high - profile land seizures , most of the large farms went not to the Zimbabwean poor , but to leading members of the ZANU - PF regime and its elite supporters .
For those Zimbabweans who were granted small parcels of the seized land , the regime did not have the resources to provide them with the training and equipment so that they could profitably cultivate their new smallholdings .
Zimbabwe ’s intifada and civil society
There is a tendency to downplay the extent of popular unrest against the Mugabe regime , with political conflict instead portrayed as between the country ’s two dominant parties .
Yet the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , the main opposition party , has its roots in the popular challenge to ZANU - PF in the late 1990s and the social movements on which it rested .
Zimbabwe ’s biennio rosso of 1996 - 8 saw a two - year revolt by students and workers .
Strikes by nurses , teachers , civil servants and builders rippled across the country .
In January 1998 housewives orchestrated a “ bread riot ” that evolved into an uprising of the poor living in Harare ’s township .
The protests , strikes and campaigns were often explicitly against the government ’s programs of structural adjustment .
The first of these , the Economic and Structural Adjustment Program ( ESAP ) , was introduced in 1991 and was sponsored and advocated by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
The second , known as ESAP II , was introduced in 1996 .
Factories closed , workers were laid off and state funding to education was slashed .
Discontent with the results of ESAP steadily increased throughout the 1990s and was expressed by the labour and student movements , together with a range of other civil society organisations .
An important strike occurred in July 1997 in Zimbabwe ’s important clothing industry , which employed 30,000 workers , but the industry was undermined by cheap textile imports resulting from ESAP liberalisation .
The end of state support for industry and the removal of tariff barriers signalled a sharp decline for the industry . [ v ]
A pay dispute was used as an opportunity to sack thousands of workers in a range of clothing outlets .
A member of the National Union of the Clothing Industry of Zimbabwe ( NUCIZ ) , Steven Maunga , had worked for City Clothing :
We were closed out of the company and forced to go onto the streets .
We went to court and the company was ordered to reinstate all employees .
Denied by the employer , we have pursued the case until now . [ vi ]
Despite some defeats , the lesson of the period was clear , as the general secretary of the NUCIZ Joseph Tanyanyiwa explained : “ We would really control by means of workers power . ” [ vii ]
Inspired by the initially urban - based movement of anti-ESAP unrest , the rural poor , particularly veterans of the war for independence , started to invade white - owned farms .
At first the regime evicted the “ squatters ” and arrested the movement ’s leaders .
In 1998 , the University of Zimbabwe in Harare was closed for five months and students demanded that opposition forces be organised into a national political party — a workers ’ party .
Students organised protests , marching with workers .
The revolt in Indonesia in 1998 against the dictator Suharto inspired those protesting in the streets .
These years of popular mobilisation and political debate were described by one activist as a “ sort of revolution ” .[ viii ]
Eventually the revolt led to the formation of the MDC in September 1999 .
The new party was formed by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions ( ZCTU ) .
At this point the MDC was resolutely pro-poor , formed by the working class and for them .
As Job Sikhala , a founding member , explained , “ It was basically a party of the poor with a few middle class ” . [ ix ]
For many of those who had been involved in the exuberant protests that had rocked Zimbabwe , and who saw a parallel between the revolution in Indonesia and the protests in Zimbabwe , they thought new party would bring about a radical transformation .
Though the major force behind the formation of the MDC was the activism of students in the Zimbabwe National Students Union ( ZINASU ) and trade unionists led by the ZCTU , other social movement organisations played a vital role .
These were frequently organisations that had been galvanised into action by the depth of the economic crisis , and subsequently the resistance to it .
The resistance provoked by structural adjustment saw an increase in poverty and unemployment culminated in 1997 in the formation of the National Constitutional Assembly .
The NCA incorporated ZINASU , the ZCTU and women ’s organisations and sought to define a new relationship between political power and civil society by campaigning for a democratic and people - driven constitution .
After the food riots in January 1998 , a new coalition of human rights organisations came together to form the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum .
Initially formed to provide assistance to those who had suffered from government repression following the riots , the forum ’s remit quickly widened .
As the struggles against the government broadened to include new layers of society , so did the number of organisations that sought to give these groups a more coherent voice .
In June 1999 , for example , the women ’s organisations that were housed under the NCA banner formed the Constitutional Women ’s Coalition , which would later become the Women ’s Coalition .
This initiative spoke of their sense of marginalisation from both the official process of consultation by the government for a new constitution and also the NCA - led popular rejection of the government ’s constitution .
Faith - based organisations also became active , or were reenergised .
From 1995 churches encouraged and nurtured the rapid development of civil society organisations .
So a Jesuit training centre , Silveira House , started to hold critical debates about the failures of ESAP , and possible alternatives to structural adjustment .
Other church groups began to stray into the political arena , so the Zimbabwe Council of Churches ( ZCC ) trained election agents to monitor the 1995 vote .
Church groups were , in many respects , the seedbed for the development of civil society organisations .
The meetings that led to the creation of the NCA were held at Africa Synod House , home to the ZCC .
Similarly , the preparatory meetings of the MDC were in the premises of the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops ’ Conference .
After the formation of the MDC in 2000 , the ZCC organised meetings that led to the formation of the Zimbabwe Election Support Network ( ZESN ) .
The ZESN , a coalition of NGOs , would play an important role in training and monitoring the violently contested elections over the next decade .
However , many of the relationships between churches and civil society group broke down soon after they were formed .
The ZCC , so vital in the formation of the NCA , withdrew in 1999 accusing the organisation of being too political .
Nor were church groups intransigent opponents of the government , when ZANU - PF launched its own constitutional commission to challenge the NCA some church leaders decided to join .
But the trajectory was clear .
These “ mushrooming ” demands expressed the explosion of protests in the aftermath of two structural adjustment programs and eventually led to , in the words of a recent study , “ the foundation of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) at the ZCTU ’s Convention .
This was , and still is , seen as an opportune marriage between civil society and political interests . ” [ x ]
This uneasy coalition meant that the MDC would remain jostled by competing interests , which sought to influence the opposition ’s political evolution and its strategy in confronting ZANU - PF .
If the mid-1990s saw the emergence of a vibrant civil society willing to confront the government , once the MDC was formed it too was forced to contend with distinct and critical voices that could claim ownership over the party .
In the first year of its foundation the question for the MDC became which of these voices would become hegemonic . [ xi ]
ZANU - PF strikes back
The period from February 2000 , when the government lost a referendum vote on a new constitution and the first general election contested by the MDC were in June that year , was marked by a rapid escalation of state - sponsored violence .
Despite this , the MDC almost won the election in 2000 , gaining 57 seats against ZANU - PF ’s 62 .
The regime maintained its pressure on the opposition in subsequent years .
Along with the regime ’s politicisation of the war veterans it launched the National Youth Service ( NYS ) .
In 2001 the first NYS camp was opened , named after the government minister who initiated the training , Border Gezi .
One graduate described the courses as “ a combination of things but mainly Marxism , socialism and business management ” .[ xii ]
This expressed ZANU - PF ’s schizophrenic mix of state capitalism and neoliberalism , set against a background of economic crisis .
By 2006 the NYS had opened eight training centres .
In the first five years of the NYS more than 40,000 youths had completed training programs .[ xiii ]
By 2003 , the regime seemed to have gained the upper hand .
ZANU - PF increasingly sold itself internationally and at home as the true inheritors of the liberation movement .
The MDC , by contrast , seemed cowed and unable to mount a serious resistance , either politically or on the streets .
A decisive moment came in June 2003 .
The so - called “ final push ” was launched by the MDC and was meant to undermine the regime with a week - long stayaway and a march on State House .
However , no serious efforts were made to mobilise the available forces , leaving only students in Harare to organise a protest that was violently crushed .
The week gave the MDC neither its international media coup nor mass action .
The government scored another victory against the opposition and emerged stronger .
Zimbabwe ’s social movements began to suffer from “ donor syndrome ” , as foreign - funded NGOs increasingly filled the political vacuum that had been left by the failure of the opposition and the collapse in the economy .
Zimbabwe - based organisations saw a massive inflow of funds .
This distorted grassroots activism , leading to what has been described as the “ commodification of resistance ” as mobilisation is increasingly “ paid for ” from NGO funds .
In Zimbabwe the “ commodification of resistance ” is a symptom of the frustrated transition to democracy in Africa , and the decline in the movements that gave birth to the MDC .
The general effect is the massive distortion of resistance by the introduction and the distribution of donor money to activist groups and NGOs .
The result for the student movement , for example , in Zimbabwe was the “ artificial ” creation of the Zimbabwe Youth Democracy Trust in 2003 by ex-members of the executive of ZINASU .
The money for the trust was provided by the Norwegian NGO – the Students and Academics ' International Assistance Fund ( SAIH ) .
Student activists were diverted into fighting over positions in the trust and for control of the organisation .
Donor money had flowed into the ZINASU as the union is incapable of funding its own activities through student subscriptions .
In parliamentary elections in 2005 , also widely believed to have been rigged , the MDC lost 16 seats to ZANU - PF , securing the necessary two - thirds majority needed to unilaterally change the constitution .
Though the opposition had faced years of violent intimidation , the MDC was also by this stage hopelessly divided by a regime that had succeeded in outmanoeuvring it .
The MDC became a contested space , with voices and groups , many from civil society , criticising the direction of the leadership .
Munyaradzi Gwisai , a Zimbabwe socialist who was a member of the MDC until 2003 , criticised the “ hijacking of the party by the bourgeoisie , marginalisation of workers , adoption of neoliberal positions and cowardly failure to physically confront the Mugabe regime and bosses .
It is … imperative that the party moves much more leftward … in order to realign to its base ” .[ xiv ]
It was not only socialists who criticised the opposition .
In 2003 one loyal MP , Job Sikhala , explained how the MDC core had become “ really fat and thick … it is almost a party of the rich .
You can not look at a person who was with you during the foundation of the MDC as the person who is there now ” .
The disarray in the MDC eventually led to the party splitting in 2005 , with one faction now being led by Arthur Mutambara , an important student activist in the late 1980s .
Although important efforts were made to mount opposition to the ruling party after 2003 , these did not come mainly from the MDC .
New social movement organisations attempted to fill the vacuum .
Women of Zimbabwe Arise ( WOZA ) is an activist organisation that has led some of the most important protests in recent years , linking issues of violence against women to wider themes of economic and social collapse from which women suffered disproportionately .
The Zimbabwe Social Forum ( ZSF ) , formed in 2002 , became an alternative space for political discussion and a forum that has attempted to bring together those who sought to resist the regime .
Both organisations managed – in the context of a decline in MDC - led action – to inspire and train a new layer of activists .
Gender issues were an important theme for the ZSF .
Tella Barangwe explained how she was politicised through her involvement in WOZA and the ZSF :
I think here in Zimbabwe they have got a different perspective towards women , when it comes to women exercising their rights sometimes men will use mocking words to discourage us from fighting .
What we are fighting for as women .
I was a WOZA member and I was then recruited into other organisations .
From there I managed to become the gender coordinator in the ZSF and I was able to encourage women to join and become active . [ xv ]
One of the central problems that have faced by civil society – and its efforts to both influence the opposition and confront the government – has been a brain drain .
Previously active and leading members of a variety of organisations , who were often founding members of the MDC in the late 1990s , have been forced to leave the country .
The consequences of the economic and political collapse were devastating .
Two organisations illustrate the trend .
ZINASU and the International Socialists of Zimbabwe ( ISOZ ) were paralysed , at different times , by the exodus of skilled and experienced activists .
But other elements were arguably more important .
The flood of donor money ( and agendas ) distorted activists and campaigns , while the political demoralisation and failure to unseat the regime saw many activists fall away .
Engagement ?
For much of the decade Zimbabwe ’s civil society activists were faced with the question of engagement with the regime .
In 2006 the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum posed the dilemma starkly , “ to engage or not engage the government of Zimbabwe ” .
Some argued for engagement as the only way of securing concessions from the regime , while others rejected any cooperation .
ZESN , for example , was clear in 2005 that “ this was the most appropriate way of securing co-operation and concessions ” .[ xvi ]
Yet the radical women ’s organisation WOZA made non-engagement their raison d’etre , “ Our mandate is to conduct peaceful protests in defiance of unjust law that sanction our fundamental and God - given freedoms of assembly , expression and association . ” [ xvii ]
These divergent positions were challenged when the NGO Bill was almost signed into law in 2005 .
The proposed law would have made it illegal for civil society organisations to engage in questions of governance and democracy , and prevented them from receiving funding unless permitted by the state .
It was widely regarded a piece of legislation that would entirely paralyse the involvement of NGOs .
A Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO
Forum study in 2006 highlighted the “ constructive involvement ” of campaigners against the NGO Bill .
Their interviewees from civil society pointed to the success of the campaign against the Bill , which though it passed through parliament in 2005 , was never signed into law .
But the study ’s conclusions about the real benefits of engaging the regime were cautious , to say the least , “ Although there may be no immediate tangible benefit to this type of engagement , it remains strategically important for organisations to be able to counter any subsequent claims from government that they `did n’t know ’ or `were not informed ’ ” .
Asking in 2006 whether there was much point in pursuing further engagement the report ’s authors concluded on the basis of “ this experience , and in light of the government ’s preference to deny or ignore that human rights violations are an issue ( let alone a problem ) , it is highly unlikely that the government would be prepared to engage civil society on these issues in a meaningful way ” .[ xviii ]
The attitude of judicial impunity that has spread across Zimbabwe excludes any meaningful engagement .
The elections in 2008 were a major moment of “ engagement ” in the political process , by the MDC and civil society organisations .
The repression that followed the results shut down any possibility of “ constructive ” involvement by civil society .
But long before these elections ZANU - PF developed a repressive legislative architecture that worked against the involvement and influence of civil society organisations in government decision making .
The 2008 election
The most serious recent challenge to ZANU - PF came in 2008 .
The elections illustrated many of the tensions that are present in the MDC ’s relationship with allied social movements .
The election on March 29 , 2008 , tantalised Zimbabwe with the possibility of a defeat for ZANU - PF .
The opposition MDC , led by Morgan Tsvangirai , made massive gains .
According to the MDC ’s own calculations , Tsvangirai won 50.3 per cent in the presidential poll compared to Mugabe ’s 43.8 per cent .
For a week after voting had ended , Zimbabwe ’s ruling party was silent .
However , once ZANU - PF had recovered from the surprise defeat , repression against the opposition intensified .
More than 70 opposition supporters and members were killed .
Thousands more were terrorised and driven from their homes .
Students in ZINASU worked closely with the MDC .
Students became election agents and campaigners for the MDC after rural activists had been chased and beaten by ZANU - PF thugs .
Tinashe Chisaira was a law student at the University of Zimbabwe ,
We would see those who were running away from ZANU - PF – women , children , those with broken limbs , people who had seen their homes burnt and children killed .
It was a painful moment .
But instead of a coordinated and systematic defence of the results , the MDC vacillated as ZANU - PF began to unleash its reign of terror .
Chisaira remembers one moment ,
One night when we were in Harvest House there was this message that some MDC activists had been attacked and then the word came through that able - bodied people must go and defend MDC supporters .
But in the end they told us not to go .
The problem , Chisaira suggests , was complex .
So while the MDC was unable to provide consistent leadership during the post-election period it was also paralysed by a recent history of retreat from popular mobilisation .
Chisaira vividly describes :
The problem the MDC had was that it had distanced itself from those who would have fought in the trenches .
We supported the MDC but they did n’t support us .
The workers , the populace , supported the MDC but the MDC no longer trusted in the people ; no longer fully coordinated with the people .
So when people were being beaten , Tsvangirai fled to Botswana .
( Interview with author , March 19 , 2010 ) .
Zimbabwe since 2008
The MDC refused to contest the second round of the presidential election , an inevitable decision due to both the worsening election violence and the opposition ’s inability to lead a popular defence of the March 29 vote .
Mugabe was victorious and his fraudulent election confirmed ZANU - PF ’s dictatorship .
Under Western pressure protracted inter-party negotiations started soon after his inauguration .
February 2009 saw the birth of an inclusive Government of National Unity ( GNU ) , with leading members of the MDC assuming significant positions in the new parliament .
Tsvangirai became prime minster .
Tendai Biti , a longstanding member of the MDC , secured the important finance portfolio .
But other vital ministries and real power remained firmly in ZANU - PF hands .
For some social movement activists in the ZSF , ZINASU and the NCA , the GNU signalled a defeat .
But within months of the GNU becoming operational , ZANU - PF did begin to reduce the repressive apparatus of the state .
By 2010 , activists could more easily organise .
Mike Sambo , the national coordinator for the International Socialist Organisation of Zimbabwe , sees the GNU as having delivered both limited economic successes and political failure :
The most significant change that has been bought by the GNU is the availability of basic commodities which had been scarce for five years .
Right now you can go into any shop and get anything – of course only if you have dollars .
So there has been a relative return to economic stabilisation in terms of availability and also prices .
While activists celebrate the ease of organising meetings and opposition events , there is among a narrow layer of social movement activists a sense of political defeat and disorientation with the GNU , says Sambo :
People identify Mugabe as an enemy so seeing him working together with the MDC that people had given their trust somehow has the whiff of betrayal .
Everyone wanted Tsvangirai to be president , so his collaboration has led people to feel disappointed .[ xix ]
In circumstances that marginalised the political activism of the major players in Zimbabwe ’s political transition in the early 2000s , several social movements managed to keep the flame of resistance to ZANU - PF alive .
Prominent organisations who helped to defend the space for activism were WOZA , the NCA and the ZSF .
But in conditions of economic crisis these organisations suffer from a paralysing disease : the “ commodification of resistance ” . [ xx ]
Complaints have been levelled against WOZA for being heavily “ commodified ” , receiving funds and paying activists for their attendance at events .
The NCA , once the standard bearer of the struggle for democratic rights , was accused of diverting resistance to funded workshops and conferences in regional cities .
Recent reductions of donor funding have recently crippled NGOs reliant on such sources of revenue ; funds have been withdrawn due to the twin effects of the global recession and the withholding of funds by donors hostile to the GNU .[ xxi ]
The MDC is also another source of “ commodification ” , as the party supports particular factions of social movement organisations .
Tinashe Chisaira , student coordinator for the ISOZ , claims that one faction was “ heavily funded by the MDC : T - shirts , accommodation .
For their congress in December [ 2009 ] they invited students throughout Zimbabwe and those students were housed in Palm Lodge [ a comfortable hotel in Harare ] .
That funding came from the MDC and other right - wing NGOs like Crisis in Zimbabwe . ” [ xxii ]
The ZSF has been exhausted .
Its structures do not meet and it does not organise .
Broken on the anvil of ZANU - PF repression and economic hardship , many social movement organisations have had a short lease of life .
While the ZSF maintained an important presence from 2002 , mirroring the evolution and momentum of the global social forum process , it has ceased to play an active role in civil society .
However , many of the activists who animated the ZSF have shifted their strategic and organisational abilities to the official consultative process for a new constitution , due to start later in 2010 .
Funded by the German Rosa Luxemburg Foundation , the Democratic United Front for a People - Driven Constitution ( DUF ) seeks to politicise the consultative process , which is supposed to be a neutral country - wide factfinding exercise part funded by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) .
The DUF includes in its membership several unions , HIV support groups and residents ’ associations .
Through active intervention in the process , the DUF aims to drive the constitution to the left on issues such as gay rights , land and wealth redistribution and political justice .
One area of contention was ZANU - PF ’s Indigenisation Bill , conceptualised as a black empowerment initiative , that insisted on at least 51 % local Zimbabwean shareholding in foreign companies operating in Zimbabwe .
The MDC opposed the legislation as hostile to foreign investment .
Though it was liable to become a program of ZANU - PF patronage , the MDC ’s stance is indicative of their politics and cast them to the political right .
DUF activists aimed to radicialise the “ indigenisation ” debate , arguing for wealth redistribution to workers and the poor.[ xxiii ]
The MDC and social movements in perspective
The MDC has long been a curious paradox .
As the 2008 election results proved , the party maintained , and has even increased , mass support among poor Zimbabweans in conditions of astonishing hardship .
But the MDC has also oriented itself towards the most powerful Western states and has been avowedly neoliberal in its policies .
The party is advised by the International Republican Institute and Cato Institute .
In April 2008 , it was reported that an MDC government would immediately access US $ 2 billion each year in “ aid and development ” , which Patrick Bond describes as “ top - heavy with foreign debt and chock - full of conditions ” .[ xxiv ]
As with many similar organisations on the African continent , the MDC emerged out of mass popular unrest coordinated on the ground by social movements .
These protests were themselves a product of the failures of independence and governments ’ implementation of structural adjustment programs .
But these protest movements took place in the aftermath of the collapse of the regimes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union , and with them the ideological moorings for a generation of trade union bureaucrats and activists .
To many it seemed that ideas of economic adjustment and good governance – the “ Washington Consensus ” – were the best , perhaps the only , hope for Africa .
The MDC was and remains an expression of the revolt against structural adjustment programs carried out by ZANU - PF .
It was formed directly by the labour movement and supported by students who appealed openly to the trade unions for a party to confront ZANU - PF .
The MDC ’s core support came from the urban working class in the main cities of Harare , Chitungwiza and Bulawayo .
But the MDC also attracted a range of social movement groups , as we have seen , that had helped form the organisation and could claim ownership over the party .
Middle classes representing local and international business interests also quickly gathered round the leadership of the party .
As early as the parliamentary elections in 2000 workers made up only 15 per cent of candidates .
Why did the party become politically dominated by groups of the middle class that gathered in its ranks ?
Some of the answer lies in the weakness of an alternative vision that could have argued inside the new party against the reorientation towards neoliberalism .
Socialists were active in the MDC , as they were in similar organisations in other countries across the continent , but their voices were marginal .
Though the mass struggles of 1996 - 8 showed the potential power of the working class , the protests , strikes and movements often remained controlled y the trade union bureaucracy .
The MDC has broken from its original mould formed in the furnace of the late 1990s , shaped in large part by the radicalism and confidence of the working class .
Joseph Tanyanyiwa , general secretary of the National Union of the Clothing Industry of Zimbabwe , recalls :
I t was a rising giant .
People are still missing those days ...
People are always saying why ca n’t we go back to those good old days where we would really control by means of workers power .
It is still a deep conviction that we can deliver workers from the bondage of oppression . [ xxv ]
Social movements have been unable to influence the government in Zimbabwe , even in the less repressive days of the 1990s .
One effect of the social movements that rose to brief prominence in the late 1990s was to drive the regime to develop a host of repressive laws and an extrajudicial organisations ( war veterans and youth militias in particular ) to shore up their support base ; in brief the regime succeeded in constructing its own reactionary social movements from above .
In 1999 Brian Raftopoulos observed how ZANU - PF monopolisation of nationalist history had not been countered by alternative visions of Zimbabwe in the period of democratisation .
This points to an important argument , namely the failures of opposition parties and social movements on the continent to develop their own “ imagined communities ” with successful organising strategies [ xxvi ] ZANU - PF ’s authoritarian nationalism poses particular challenges to those who seek to imagine and construct an alternative future in Zimbabwe [ XXVII ] .

A Polish court ruled on Wednesday that an alleged Mossad agent tied to the killing of a Hamas leaderin Dubai should be extradited to Germany .
Uri Brodsky , an Israeli citizen , is suspected of having helped to forge a German passport used in the January assassination of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
He was detained in Poland in early June .

Brodsky showed no reaction when the ruling was announced and hid his face from reporters as he walked to the courtroom , escorted by seven anti-terrorist policemen .
The proceedings were closed to the media .
Warsaw district court Judge Tomasz Calkiewicz ordered Brodsky extradition on charges of forgery .
" The ruling means that the court partially agreed with the German Federal Republic and decided that our client can be extradited to German authorities , " said Brodsky 's lawyer ,
Krzysztof Stepinski .
Defense attorney Anna Mika - Kopec sid she did not yet know whether she would appeal the extradition before the written ruling is issued by the court next week .
Prosecutors said last month that they were not taking politics into consideration and were acting in accordance with procedure after Germany issued a European arrest warrant for Brodsky .
But Polish sources told Haaretz on Wednesday that the details of the extradition ruling represented an apparent compromise : Brodsky 's extradition on charges of forgery will allow Israel to escape the embarrassment of a high - profile espionage trial and the potential damage to Israeli - German relations if Brodsky were convicted as a spy .
Israel has spoken out against the extradition , saying the suspect should stand before an Israeli court , and Poland had reportedly been reluctant to return Brodsky to Germany for fear of offending its close ally .
But once it became clear that Brodsky would face relatively minor charges , Polish authorities were persuaded that extraditing him would have limited diplomartic consequences , the officials said .
Polish Prime Minister Donald
Tusk has said he hopes the case will not harm Polish - Israeli relations , but that European law left the court with few choices .
Germany applied for the suspect 's extradition after he was arrested on June 4 in Warsaw 's airport on an European arrest warrant .
Along with other western nations , Germany was angry that its passports were used by members of a suspected Mossad hit team that is believed to have murdered al - Mabhouh , a co-founder of Hamas ' military wing , in a hotel room on January 19 .
Apple offers free iPhone 4 cases Published duration 16 July 2010
media caption Steve Jobs promises all iPhone4 users a free case
Apple is offering a free case to every owner of its iPhone 4 .
Apple boss Steve Jobs unveiled the offer at a press conference called to tackle the ongoing speculation about the iPhone 4's antenna problem .
The case will help overcome a widely reported issue in which phone signal strength was drained when the phone was held a certain way .
Declaring " We 're not perfect " , Mr Jobs said reception problems were endemic throughout the smartphone industry .
To get their free case , owners will be able to apply via the Apple website from 22 July .
Mr Jobs said Apple could not make enough for all owners of the phone but would source a supply and offer a range of cases .
Based on retail prices of iPhone cases , supplying one to all three million customers could cost Apple about $ 180 m ( £ 118 m ) .
Apple will offer the free cases for phones purchased before 30 September .
Mr Jobs also extended an offer to iPhone 4 users to give them a full refund within 30 days if they were still unhappy with the handset 's performance .
" They had to do something , " Van Baker , research vice president at Gartner , told BBC News .
" The buzz kept getting louder and louder and louder and the evidence kept mounting more and more and more .
They just could n't ignore it . "
Brian Marshall , managing director of Gleacher & Company , said he did not think the negative headlines hurt Apple in the marketplace though he was pleased to see it take action .
" This has been blown out of proportion and is a media firestorm , " he said .
Common problem
Apple called the press conference at which the case offer was made in response to ongoing speculation about the antenna issue .
The problem is thought to be caused by the steel case of the phone which houses several of the phone 's antennas .
Holding the phone on the lower left bridges the gap between two antenna depleting the signal .
Putting a case or " bumpers " around the phone stops this gap being bridged .
Opening the conference , Mr Jobs said that the drop in signal strength was not a problem " unique " to the iPhone 4 .
" This has been blown so out of proportion , it 's incredible , " he said .
Apple had been looking closely at the issue since the first reports of problems surfaced just over three weeks ago , he said .
Videos comparing the iPhone 4 signal drop to other smartphones , such as the Blackberry Bold 9700 , were aired by Mr Jobs during the conference .
He said this was a reflection of life in the smartphone world and presented a challenge for the whole industry .
Mr Jobs said the design of the iPhone 4 , with a gap separating two sections of antenna , might have contributed to the problems as it perhaps subliminally encouraged people to touch that spot .
In the firm 's defence , he cited figures from its Apple Care service arm which showed that only 0.55 % of all iPhone 4 users have complained to the company about the issue .
" Historically for us , this is not a large number .
This does n't jibe with what you read about this problem . "
The number of phones returned to Apple was 1.7 % , less than the 6 % of 3GS models taken back to the shop by their owners .
Mr Jobs also shared data about the number of calls the iPhone4 dropped compared to the 3GS .
This revealed that the iPhone 4 drops only one call more per hundred than its predecessor .
He speculated that this was because most people who own a 3GS have a case for it .
By contrast , he said , most iPhone4s leave Apple stores without a case .
Technology reporter Maggie Shiels who attended the conference for the BBC said it was a " sterling " performance by Mr Jobs .
" For Steve Jobs to publicly apologise to customers problem was amazing to hear , " she said .
" It did n't come until 45 mins into the event but it was clear throughout that he has taken the criticism personally . "
" While he constantly underscored how hard Apple had worked to resolve the problem , he came out swinging for the fences and defended the phone to the hilt , " she said .
Plotting vs Pantsing 13 : Brett Battles
May 15th , 2010
Who ’s a sturdy enough talent to go 13th in this thread ?
Brett Battles , whose Jonathan Quinn “ Cleaner ” series is among my favorite of recent years .
Brett ’s books — THE CLEANER , THE DECEIVED , and SHADOW OF BETRAYAL , the last of which will be reincarnated in a paperback edition on May 25 — are models of the form .
The form , in this case , is the breakneck , intercontinental thriller with solid , emotionally affecting characters , a plot twist every time the reader gets comfortable , and a resolution that ’s always unexpected and , in retrospect , inevitable .
If I sound like a fan , I am .
After I read THE CLEANER , I used it as a sort of primer for pacing ( this will be news to Brett ) and I think my books are the better for it .
So here ’s where those amazing plots come from .
I ca n’t tell you how many times I ’ve had or overheard conversations about this topic .
I guess that ’s probably because it ’s a core , nuts - and - bolts part of the writing process .
It ’s funny .
Writers can be pretty vehement about their particular position .
“ Writing a detailed outline is the only way to go . ” “ Outline ?
No way .
I just write and let the story tell itself to me . ”
If you ’d asked me a few years ago where I fell , I would have said without hesitation that I was a pantser .
In fact , I was probably sitting on the Pantser ’s Board of Directors .
I was the one saying , “ I let the story tell itself to me . ”
It worked for me , but that ’s because I had all the time in the world to write a book .
But then I got my first contract .
Per that contract I had to provide a synopsis of whatever book I planned on writing to my editor .
Obviously I did n’t have to do this for my first book as it had been written prior to getting a deal .
But for the second book ?
Absolutely .
Still , I considered myself a full - fledged , card - carrying pantser .
So when I wrote my proposal for Book 2 I made my synopsis as short and as vague as possible .
( Note : I also included the first two or three chapters . )
Fine for me , I thought .
Lots of room to move around .
Thankfully , my editor went for it .
But that ’s where the problems started .
I had a year to write that second book .
It sounded like a lot of time , but at that point , in addition to being a novelist , I still had a full - time day job , so as I progressed , I realized that a year was n’t long at all .
The problem with writing without a clear idea of where you ’re going is that you can write yourself into a corner .
And that ’s pretty much what I ended up doing .
The draft that I delivered by my deadline still needed some serious work , and it took another four months before I got the book into shape .
You would have thought I would have learned my lesson from that .
But no , I still considered myself a pantser .
After all , Book 2 turned out pretty well .
So once agai , I delivered a two - page synopsis and some sample chapters , and , once again , my editor said , “ Go for it . ”
I ’m sure you can guess the result .
Once more the process of writing the book ( still with the day job ) took far too much time .
And , like before , the draft I delivered still needed some serious work .
( Thankfully , though , not as much as had been required for Book 2 . )
So when I set out to write Book 4 of my series , I vowed that I would do things differently .
This would be the first one I would write as a full - time novelist , so I wanted to off right .
But wanting and doing , as we all know , can be two different things .
The proposal I gave my editor : 2 - page synopsis and sample chaps .
The same old song .
This book , though , did go faster .
But that was a product of two things .
The first , and probably the most influential , was , as I mentioned , that I had no day job interfering with my writing schedule .
But the second was that , when I hit around pag2 250 , I stopped and took a full week to map the book out . . . where I was , where I should be going . . . from each of my characters ’ points of view .
( Not really relevant , but here ’s what I did : I went down to Office Depot and bought those gigantic post - it notes .
Seriously gigantic .
We ’re talking something like three feet by four feet .
Each central character got a note , and then , below their name , I listed out , in point form , the story from their POV .
I think I ended up having something like eight or nine of these post -its hanging on my walls .
Doing this enabled me to get a handle on where my story was going .
When I turned the book in , it was much more finished than my previous books had been .
Not perfect , but definitely closer to the finish line . )
I knew that for my next book , I was going to have to do something different .
This time I wrote a five - page synopsis along with chapters .
That might not seem like a big leap , but it was for me .
Then a funny thing happened .
My publisher asked if my fifth book , instead of being another in my Jonathan Quinn series , could be a standalone .
This prospect was exciting to me as I was feeling the itch to write a standalone .
It was n’t that I was tired of my series , far from it .
I just wanted to branch out a little .
When I sat down to figure out the proposal for the standalone , I knew that I was going to have to be more detailed than I ’d been in the past .
My problem this time was that I had more than one idea , and could n’t figure out which one to present .
So I decided , what the hell , let my publisher choose .
I wrote a synopsis for each idea , each of them between 10 and 15 pages in length .
These were much more detailed maps than I ’d ever produced before .
Oh , and I also did sample chapters for all three stories .
( I know , I know .
Overkill . )
Bantam chose one of the stories , and , in a little over two weeks , I wrote the first 150 pages of the new book .
Yes , blazing fast .
I ’d never written anything so fast .
But there was no question but that this was a direct result of those more detailed plans .
( Okay , just to make the story accurate and more complete — though , again , not necessarily relevant — at that 150 - page mark , I hit a hiccup .
I happened to read a novel by a person I respect who had set her story in the same location as I was setting mine .
Turns out that plot and the one I was working on were pretty damn close .
Too close for me to continue .
So what did I do ?
I wrote another 12 - page synopsis , keeping a few of the elements from the story I ’d been working on , but really creating something completely new .
I started at page zero again on November 4th of last year and had a rough draft just over one month later , on the 7th of December .
A month after that , I had a polished draft that was tighter and more complete than any other manuscript I ’d ever turned in . )
I was a pantser , but I am no more .
That ’s not to say that I ’m all all - out , detail - oriented outline , either .
I ’m a kind of a blend , a hybrid if you will .
My optimum working process seems to be first creating a 10 to 15 - page story map with room to expand and change , and then putting my butt in a chair and writing .
the map / outline / synopsis gives me the confidence to plow forward .
In fact , I do n’t think I looked back at my synopsis once when I was writing that last book .
But I knew in my mind that I ’d figured it all out , so I knew how far I could stray .
The bottom line is that each writer has a different way of writing .
But what I think we need to do is periodically evaluate whether those methods are helping us be our best .
This is not some static , forever kind of thing .
For a long time writing by the seat of my pants worked well for me .
It was really the only way I could do it .
But then things changed , so I changed .
And who knows , in the future I may change again .

A leggere oggi i verbali e le interviste dei " quattro sfigati " e dei loro amici , pare di trovarsi di fronte a una scolaresca di seconda media finita dal preside dopo una gita scolastica in cui ne hanno fatte di tutti i colori : ognuno dà la colpa a quell ' altro e si stupisce che se la prendano proprio con lui .
Prendete Ugo Cappellacci , il bravo signor Nessuno elevato a governatore della Sardegna per soffocare sul nascere le ambizioni nazionali di Soru : beccato nella compagnia , ora sostiene di essere « solo un babbeo » .
La qual cosa , onestamente , era sospettabile da tempo , ma ci sarebbe piaciuto se questo coming out fosse avvenuto già in campagna elettorale , in modo da aiutare i sardi nelle loro scelte .
Un altro della ' simpa compa ' , Pasquale Lombardi , minimizza il suo ruolo ammettendo solo di aver fatto mandare dell ' olio di oliva a un giudice : il particolare grottesco è che per procurargli questa " piccola regalia " ( come la chiama lui ) fa arrivare il bidoncino colmo in Cassazione , scomodando un carabiniere all ' uopo .
Secondo Lombardi , il racconto sull ' extravergine dovrebbe minimizzare i danni , far intendere che erano solo piccoli scambi di derrate fra amici .
Io invece pagherei per poter pubblicare la foto , infinitamente metaforica , della tanichetta sgocciolante caricata nel bagagliaio per ungere il magistrato con l'auto che procede verso il Palazzaccio sul lungo
Tevere , attraversando con il suo prezioso carico gli epicentri del potere romano .
Infine , dopo il babbeo e l'untore , c'è il molestato , la vittima di stalking : il povero sottosegretario Giacomo Caliendo , che a Repubblica spiega di essere stato solo vittima di telefonate indesiderate , gente che lo chiamava e a cui lui non metteva giù solo per cortesia , perché essendo un gentiluomo risponde sempre a tutti .
Per la precisione , aggiunge , rispondeva di sì proprio per toglierseli di torno , quei molestatori .
E qui siamo veramente al tripudio , perché è meraviglioso pensare che in mezzo secolo tra magistratura e politica , nessuno abbia mai spiegato al cortese Caliendo che per togliersi dalle palle i molestatori basta rispondergli ( sempre educatamente ) di no .
“ Everybody knew there was a lot of debt out there , ” said Nick Matthews , senior European economist at Royal Bank of Scotland and one of the authors of the report that tallied up Greek , Spanish and Portuguese debt .
“ But I think the extent of the exposure was a lot higher than most people had originally thought . ”
Concern has quickly spread beyond just the sovereign bonds issued by the three countries as well as by Italy and Ireland , which are also seriously indebted .
Private - sector debt in the troubled countries is also becoming an issue , because when governments pay more for financing , so do their domestic companies .
Recession , along with higher interest payments , could lead to a surge in corporate defaults , the European Central Bank warned in a report on May 31 .
Hypo Real Estate has hundreds of millions in shaky real estate loans on its books , as well as toxic assets linked to the subprime crisis in the United States .
In the first quarter , it set aside an additional 260 million euros to cover potential loan losses , bringing the total to 3.9 billion euros .
But that amount is a drop in the bucket , a mere 1.6 percent of Hypo ’s total loan portfolio .
Hypo has not yet set aside anything for money lent to governments in Greece and other troubled countries , arguing that the European Union rescue plan makes defaults unlikely .

The European Central Bank estimates that the Continent ’s largest banks will book 123 billion euros ( $ 150 billion ) for bad loans this year , and an additional 105 billion euros next year , though the sums will be partly offset by gains in other holdings .
Analysts at the Royal Bank of Scotland estimate that of the 2.2 trillion euros that European banks and other institutions outside Greece , Spain and Portugal may have lent to those countries , about 567 billion euros is government debt , about 534 billion euros are loans to nonbanking companies in the private sector , and about 1 trillion euros are loans to other banks .
While the crisis originated in Greece , much more was borrowed by Spain and its private sector — 1.5 trillion euros , compared with Greece ’s 338 billion .
Beyond such sweeping estimates , however , little other detailed information is publicly known about those loans , which are equivalent to 22 percent of European G.D.P .
And the inscrutability of the problem , as serious as it is , is spawning spoofs , at least outside the euro zone .
A pair of popular Australian comedians , John Clarke and Bryan Dawe , who have created a series of sketches about various aspects of the financial crisis , recently turned their attention to the bad - debt problem in Europe .
After grilling Mr. Clarke about the debt crisis in a mock quiz show , Mr. Dawe tells Mr. Clarke that his prize is that he has lost a million dollars .
“ Well done , ” says Mr. Dawe .
“ That ’s an extraordinary performance . ”
COSTA MESA – Longtime community activist Amin David turned the tables Sunday on the Anti-Defamation League of Orange County and Long Beach .
David took the stage at the group ’s annual awards brunch to receive the Leader of Distinction Award award for helping bring together the Latino and Jewish communities , but he deflected credit to the ADL itself .
“ You invited me here to honor me , but I come to honor you , ” said David , who then referred to more than 60 instances of Jews reaching out to Latinos , as documented in a new book on California Latino politics .
David ’s take on the event was one way for him to handle something he ’s not fully at ease with .
“ I ’m not comfortable with all the honoring , ” he said in an interview before the event .
The 74 - year - old Catholic from Anaheim is best known as the founder of Los Amigos , a group of businesspeople , educators and community leaders that since 1978 has met weekly to discuss problems facing the Latino community – and to address them .
When somebody presents a problem to the group , they ’re expected to help find a solution .
“ If you plead it , you lead it , ” is a refrain you ’ll hear often at the group ’s meetings .
His other activities have included involvement with the Orange County Human Relations Commission , the Orange County Community Housing Corp. and United Way .
But the reason he won an award Sunday – amid a list of honorees who otherwise were all Jews – is his work bridging the Jewish and Latino communities .
He helped found Anti-Defamation League ’s Jewish Latino Roundtable as a result of anti-Latino sentiment that arose during the contentious 1996 congressional race between Bob Dornan and Loretta Sanchez .
“ I went and knocked on ( ADL ’s ) door and they were eager to help , ” David said .
“ And we began working on issues together and came to the understanding that there are similarities in their concerns and those of the Latino community . ”
David went on to help establish the Jewish Latino Passover Seder .
“ In Latin American countries , there ’s an old prejudice that the Jews killed Jesus , ” David said .
“ This is an effort to clear up this misunderstanding . ”
David , who owns a plumbing parts business , said that while some of his colleagues enjoy leisure activities like golf , he gets more satisfaction from community activism .
And he said that while Orange County grows more diverse , he sees increasing unity among different communities .
“ It ’s unfortunate that the voices that get heard are the few dissidents , ” he said .
“ In the not - too - distant future , ( Latinos ) are going to be the largest ethnic group here and we need to be prepared . ”
Recipients of the Anti-Defamation League awards
The Anti-Defamation League of Orange County / Long Beach honored the following folks Sunday .
Hetty Goslins and the late Herman Goslins received the Jerry Schwartz Community Service Award .
The Netherlands natives – who later moved to Newport Beach – were long active with the Anti-Defamation League as well as groups that support Jewish survivors of the Holocaust .
Anne Licht of Huntington Harbour also received the Schwartz Community Service Award .
She is a longtime activist and leader in local and national Jewish service groups .
Amin David of Anaheim received the Leader of Distinction Award .
He ’s the founder of the Los Amigos community activist group and has helped build alliances between the Latino and Jewish communities .
Stefanie and Josh Kaplan of Long Beach received the Young Leadership Award .
The couple has worked extensively to battle anti-Semitism ; Stefanie also works on children ’s issues .

When you get called into the supervisor 's office , and the HR manager is in the room ( and seated ) when you get there , it 's never a good thing .
I was told by my manager that she was sorry - she had overshot her projections on new product introductions this year , and that there was n't enough work to keep everyone in the department going through the end of the year .
So in a recent restructuring ( that 's been going on behind the scenes , apparently ) they decided to eliminate my job .
Now here 's what got me going in the aftermath .
Four people were hired into the department after me , all of them well under 30 .
I trained two of those folks .
Out of 120 people in the company , this 56 year old guy was the only one whose job was eliminated .
Sound a bit fishy ?
Maybe .
I 'm going to be following up on that angle .
I was offered a lousy severance package that I have a few weeks to accept or reject .
If I reject the package I 'm free to follow up with an age discrimination inquiry .
But if I take the package which offers two lousy weeks of pay , I 'm barred from any other remedy .
But anyway .
I 'm still in shock , I guess .
I was just starting to get back on my feet after an extended period of unemployment basically destroyed me financially .
And now this .
The only good thing ( if there is an upside ) is that I put in enough weeks to fully qualify again for unemployment , and I do n't have to reopen my earlier claim .
The clock is reset to 26 weeks .
One thing I do know : I can not possibly weather another 15 months of unemployment , financially or psychologically .
That knowledge scares the living crap out of me tonight .
It 's going to be difficult to sleep .
Update :
The outpouring of good wishes , compassion , and advice regarding my situation has been nothing short of heart rendering .
I very sincerely thank everyone for their kind thoughts , legal input , and alternative late - career suggestions .
I 'll be revisiting all of the comments in the morning .
As an update , just a couple of general comments :
There are no skeletons in my situation with my ex-employer .
Heck , I was n't there long enough . :)
About a month back , I received a great interim performance evaluation , and actually thought there might be a promotion in the near future .
Ah , well .
Anyway , there 's not much more to the employment story other than what I 've described above .
There are a couple of pieces of advice that resonate with me , and that I was already planning to pursue in a manner of speaking .
I have a fee free consultation on Thursday with a labor attorney who does nothing but discrimination suits .
We spoke on the phone for about 1/2 hour this afternoon , and he wants to review the severance agreement .
Additionally , prior to the lawyer 's appointment , I 'm going to be going to the Philly EEOC offices ( they take walk ins starting at 8:30 ) .
I 've already filled in an intake form which is available online .
One piece of advice in several of the comments really stood out : just the threat of an EEOC claim may make them move on the severance .
I sent a very nice note to the HR manager indicating that I had taken the recommendation of the ADAE paragraph of the severance letter , and spoken to an attorney ( the underlying implication being that I was prepared to go to the mattresses on this claim ) .
I believe they know they 're on thin ice , and that at a minimum , I 'll get a much better severance offer .
So , I will report back in the near future on how things went .
And I will keep my chin up every day , and come back and read the empowering comments below on days when it 's difficult to maintain a positive attitude .
Again , my heartfelt thanks to everyone in this great community .

Street - name plaque , with the GNOME software logo repeated around the border
Free Software Street ( Catalan : Carrer del Programari Lliure ) is a street in the town of Berga in Catalonia , Spain .
It is the first street in the world dedicated to the free software movement .
It was officially opened on 3 July 2010 . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
The street is about 300 metres ( 980 ft ) long and is located in a newly redeveloped area known as Pla de l'Alemany in the southwestern part of town .
It is a mixed - use street , with a large hotel ( the Berga Park ) , a school , [ 3 ] a police station , [ 4 ] some offices , [ 5 ] a parkland , and some undeveloped plots .
History [ edit ]
In June 2009 , Albert Molina , Xavier Gassó and Abel Parera from Berga Telecentre organized the first Free Software Conferences to be held in town .
After the conference , they noted the possibility of naming a street in honor of free software so that they applied for it to the Berga Town Council .
In January 2010 , the second edition of the Free Software Conferences was being organized and it was decided to invite the Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman to participate in the planned events , including the naming ceremony of the street .
At the same time , the contacts with the politicians from the town council were being successfully concluded .
On 10 June , the renaming of the street as " Carrer del Programari Lliure " ( " Free Software Street " ) was officially approved during a plenary session at the town hall with 14 votes in favor and 2 abstentions . [ 6 ]
On 3 July 2010 at 20:00 CET ( 19:00 UTC ) , the Mayor of Berga Juli Gendrau and Richard Stallman finally inaugurated the street .

Apple this Friday will hold a press conference on its Cupertino - based campus to discuss the iPhone 4 and , presumably , the growing array of allegations from the media over the handset 's reception woes .
No further details about the event , first reported by The Wall Street Journal 's All Things D blog , were made available .
Apple simply notified members of the press Wednesday evening that it would hold the event this Friday , July 16 , at 10 a.m. Pacific Time .
The announcement comes as a firestorm of publicity has surrounded the iPhone 4 , and its propensity for some users to lose reception and sometimes drop calls when held in the lower left corner .
Though coverage of the issue has persisted since the handset launched in late June , it reached a boiling point earlier this week when Consumer Reports did a 180 - degree turn on its stance on the iPhone 4 , and announced that it could not recommend the device to consumers because of the antenna issues .
The matter has been a popular topic in the media , tipping over into the mainstream and even becoming the subject of an entire Top 10 list from late night talk show host David Letterman this week .
Competitors have also seen the coverage as an opportunity to capitalize , with Verizon , Nokia , and Microsoft all taking shots at Apple .
Throughout the growing bad publicity , Apple , as it notoriously does , has stayed quiet .
A day after the iPhone 4 launched , the company issued a statement in which it said that all mobile phones experience some reception issues when held improperly .
Days later , as complaints about the physical antenna continued , the company said it would issue a software fix for a separate problem , in which the handset would incorrectly report the bars of reception currently available .
Speculation on how Apple will handle the issue has largely fallen under three schools of thought : do nothing , give away free bumper cases to shield the external antenna band from skin contact , or issue a complete product recall .
Obviously the last option would be the costliest , with one analyst predicting it would cost Apple $ 1.5 billion .

I ’ve always had ambivalent feelings about Polaris .
Formerly “ Toronto Trek ” , one of the huger local cons , it changed its name a few years back and started featuring sf novelists in an attempt to expand into the literary end of the sf pool .
Their media roots have always remained front and center , though .
When I appear it ’s always as one of their token literary types , and none of my panels tend to focus on written sf ; offhand I do n’t think any of this year ’s panels did .
If there ’s a criticism here , it ’s only that Polaris should n’t try to be something it ’s not .
There ’s nothing wrong with cons that cater to fans of Doctor Who and Stargate — movies and television , after all , have far broader appeal than does science fiction in its written form .
Of course , the larger your audience , the more difficult it gets to avoid offending all of them .
The more people in attendance , the greater the odds that some will collapse into apoplectic hysteria the moment Janet Jackson ’s nipple makes an unscheduled split - second appearance on national television .
I had my own personal nipple moment at Polaris this past weekend , delivered unto me by a woman who — well , some of you may remember a distant post in which I modestly proposed that the parents of young children should not be allowed to vote , on the grounds that parenthood causes a form of mild retardation .
This woman exemplified that argument so powerfully that I ’m now almost willing to take it seriously .
It began at “ Avatar : the Theory of Pandora ” , a productive hour of freewheeling bullshit , retconning , and evolutionary brainstorming between myself , Karl Schroeder , and a supporting cast of dozens .
At some point I — as is my wont — used the word “ fucking ” as an adjective .
Exhibit A sat in the front row , two sprogs in tow ( one 5 - 10 , one possible preteen — my expertise in the age - determination of human larvae is not all it could be ) .
She took strong exception : “ Could we keep this PG ?
There are children in the audience , and if I hear that again I ’m out of here . ”
I explained that the word “ fuck ” has a 900 - year history , throughout most of which it was considered completely inoffensive .
“ It only became offensive 100 - 200 years ago , when a bunch of bible - thumping prudes who could n’t get laid decided to stigmatize anything with an orifice . ”
Sadly , this cut no ice : “ Well , I find it offensive . ”
Ceiling
Cat help me , I actually reined in my language for a bit there .
Forced my tongue to articulate “ ass - kicker ” when it wanted to say “ motherfucker ” , that kind of thing .
And those of you who ’ve been making comments in past postings will be pleased to note that we covered a lot of ground : Pandora as an engineered construct , the obvious retcon represented by the prolemurs glimpsed briefly in the movie , Cameron ’s famous admission that the Na’vi “ had to have tits ” .
Karl and I and our supporting cast covered it all , and inevitably found ourselves dealing with the anomalous fact that the Na’vi are biped tetrapods when everything else on the planet is hexapodal .
Ms. Virgin - Ears 2010 piped up that “ Earth people ca n’t breathe the air on Pandora , so maybe there ’s something magical in the atmosphere that makes the Na’vi look like us . ”
I realized at this point that the loss of this woman ’s voice would not significantly diminish the quality of the conversation .
I do n’t know if that had a significant impact on the degree of my self - censorship ; I can only say that shortly after the dawning of this insight , my tongue felt the urge to form the phrase “ shit - kicked ” , and my brain did not override .
True to her word , the woman in the front row gathered up her sprogs and left the room , and something in me heaved a small sigh of relief .
I did n’t even wonder too much when three or four different con officials dropped in at various points throughout the rest of the panel , only to hover briefly at the back of the room and drift out again .
The remainder of the hour went smoothly — so smoothly that , when Karl wound up the session by remarking that he would rather see design than natural selection in the biology of Pandora , I felt no hesitation in responding “ What are you , a creationist ? ”
And then , a moment later : “ Actually , since the front row seems to have bailed :
What are you , a fucking creationist ? ”
It got a big laugh .
We packed up .
Someone wanted me to sign a book .
I told him he ’d have to wait until I found a urinal , which I did ; the men ’s washroom was down at the end of a long white deserted hallway .
And when I emerged a minute later , four red shirts were standing in the hall to block passage .
Four .
We ’d like to talk to you , Mr. Watts .
Someone has lodged a formal complaint about your language during the panel .
My unspoken reaction was WTF ?
My spoken one , I think , was “ Tough shit . ”
Or maybe just “ tough . ”
Either way , it did n’t seem to soothe the redshirt who ’d called me out , since she added that I ’d also been charged with being inebriated while on the panel .
“ Do I seem inebriated to you ? ” I asked .
“ Am I slurring my words , having any trouble expressing coherent thoughts ? ”
She told me she was n’t buying that because — I shit you not — writers are well - known for being able to speak coherently while drunk .
Which was such a delightful self - contradiction I knew then and there I was going to really enjoy the rest of the conversation .
I trotted out the usual arguments .
There are people who find gay marriage offensive .
There are those who are offended by the concept of evolution .
Will we be taking their hurt feelings seriously as well ?
Well , no , of course not , but the issue is there were children in the room .
So a parent drags her sprog out into the big bad world and the world is now obligated to accommodate her particular standards of morality ?
Because yes , you have every right to remove yourself from settings you find offensive ; but having done so , the issue is resolved .
Lodging a formal complaint is tantamount to stating that you get to order the rest of the world how to behave , that your personal outrage is legitimate grounds for censure ; and really , in a free society1 , is there an inalienable right to never be offended ?
Well , we do advertise ourselves as a PG con , one of the redshirts replied , at which point another — name of Declan , I know him slightly , seems nice — pointed out that swearing is actually quite common in PG movies .
By now it was pretty evident that these people did not want to be here .
They ’d all checked out my panel performance in the wake of the complaint , after all , and seen nothing of concern ; I had n’t been spewing alcoholic vomit into the front row or insulting the audience .
I obviously was n’t anywhere close to inebriation .
One of them even described my thumbnail history of the word “ fuck ” as “ awesome ” .
But a complaint had been lodged , and they were obligated to interview me because there are two sides to every story ( “ No , ” I protested , “ there are n’t two sides , she ’s completely right !
I did use vulgar language !
And I will fucking well continue to use it , not because I ’m trying to offend but because that ’s just the way I happen to talk … ” ) .
I volunteered to withdraw from the rest of the con if they had a problem with this , no hard feelings whatsoever , an option they unanimously rejected .
As far as they were concerned , nothing had happened .
The complaint was without merit .
We shook hands .
Declan even invited me to the after - con party on Sunday night , which I would have attended if not for a previous engagement .
Everything ’s cool .
I did , however , notice a shiny new sign outside the room when I showed up for my Sunday panel : CAUTION : ADULT LANGUAGE .
Which , yes , I really should have grabbed and had framed .
Oh , and that guy who wanted me to sign his book ?
He waited for me , book in hand : the alternate - history anthology ReVisions , edited by Julie Czerneda .
And the story I wrote for that antho , the one I belatedly scribbled my signature across ?
“ A Word for Heathens . ”
Which pretty much sums it up , leaving only the obligatory wail of anger and impotent frustration :
Connnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn !!!!
P.S. You wo n’t be hearing from me much the rest of the week .
Maybe a comment or two , but probably no other posts unless I feel inspired to upload pictures of the local cats .
I ’m out at the annual island writing retreat ; gotta read about twenty - five thousand words of other people ’s writing every damn day , plus write two thousand words of my own .
Pray for me .

Reporters covering this month ’s G20 and G8 summits in Ontario will be able to take a break at an artificial lake , without leaving the air conditioned splendour of the media centre in Toronto .
It ’s part of what summit organizers call the “ Canadian corridor , ” described as a “ powerful exhibit ” that will showcase Canadian investment opportunities and local points of interest .
Design photos show a lake surrounded by fake canoes and lawn chairs while another exhibit in the corridor shows a mock TSX .
According to a document from summit organizers , the rustic northern scene is a way to showcase Ontario ’s Muskoka region , where the G8 is being held , to the many reporters who wo n’t get out of the Toronto media centre .
The document estimates the price tag for the project at $ 1.9 million , jointly funded by the federal and Ontario governments .
According to the document , reporters will be treated to the fake lake because the media has a crucial influence over the government ’s primary target audience , senior business decision makers .
“ It is therefore very important that we seize this unique opportunity to convey our message about Canada ’s resilient business environment , ” the document says .
The G8 and G20 summits run from June 24 - 26 .
Hundreds of journalists are expected to cover the summits , but access to the Huntsville resort will be limited to fewer than 200 reporters and photographers , forcing the rest of the journalists to rely on a host broadcaster to pipe the events into the media centre in Toronto .
The cost of the two summits is running at roughly $ 1.2 - billion , an amount that has the opposition and many Canadians pointedly questioning the federal Tories about where all the money is going .
Touchscreen computing device costing just £ 23 to be rolled out first to 110 million schoolchildren
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
India has developed the world 's cheapest laptop – a touchscreen device which resembles Apple 's wildly popular iPad but will cost just £ 23 .
The prototype was unveiled today by Kapil Sibal , the country 's human resource development minister , who said 110 million Indian schoolchildren would be the first recipients .
Then , from next year , the device – designed to bridge the digital divide and boost India 's economy – will become available to students in higher education .
Sibal said : " The solutions for tomorrow will emerge from India .
We have reached a stage that today , the motherboard , its chip , the processing , connectivity , all of them cumulatively cost around $ 35 [ £ 23 ] , including memory , display , everything . "
Past low - cost technologies produced by the country include the £ 1,450 Tata Nano car and a mobile phone costing less than £ 11 .
The iPad retails at about £ 429 in the UK – 18 times the cost of the Indian laptop .
The tablet computer , developed by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi and the Indian Institute of Science in Bengalooru , will eventually be made available to the public .
It will run on an open source Linux operating system with Open Office software and can be powered by solar panel or batteries as well as mains electricity .
It will have no hard drive but users will have access to a USB port , 2GB of memory and a video - conferencing facility , internet browsing .
Sudhir Dixit , director of Hewlett - Packard 's Indian research division , welcomed the announcement .
He said : " This is a very strong move with good potential .
Previous initiatives with these aims have had laptops priced at around $ 100 , so it is a development .
" The interesting thing is that slate devices are expected to come into the market and cut into sales of laptops and netbooks .
The predictions are that slate devices will do to netbooks and laptops what netbooks and laptops did to desktop PCs .
It gives people mobility .
" Access to IT in the education system is growing very rapidly .
Because of the government 's great push forward in IT , every school will have computers and , at some stage , every person will have access to IT . "
More than 62 m PCs are expected to be sold in India this year and the figure is predicted to top 100 m in 2013 .
The first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of 2010 saw a 72 % growth in netbook sales .
Dixit said : " This year the IT market has begun growing very rapidly after a slump last year . "
The device forms part of the Indian government 's commitment to an across - the - country satisfactory standard of education by 2010 .
According to 2001 census figures , literacy levels in India are at 63 % , lagging behind most other developing nations , including China – where the figure is 93 % .
There are 60 million registered internet users in India , a country with a population of 1.2 billion .
Earlier this year HP Labs India announced a move to bring tens of millions of people online in the country , enabling users of low - end mobile phones to complete simple functions on websites .
The HP innovation could potentially open the customer market for small businesses from the 60 million registered internet users to the 600 million owners of mobile phones .
The two - seater Transition can use its front - wheel drive on roads at ordinary highway speeds , with wings folded , at a respectable 30 miles per gallon .
Once it has arrived at a suitable take - off spot - an airport , or adequately sized piece of flat private land - it can fold down the wings , engage its rear - facing propellor , and take off .
The folding wings are electrically powered .
It ’s enough to give environmentalists fits .
Richard Pombo is back .
For 14 years , Pombo held a special place in the hearts of America ’s environmental movement somewhere next to Capt .
Joseph Hazelwood of the Exxon Valdez and the hunter who shot Bambi ’s mother .
A Tracy cattle rancher whom President George W. Bush nicknamed “ The Marlboro Man , ” from 1993 to 2007 Pombo represented the 11th Congressional District , which runs from Morgan Hill to Danville along the east side of I -680 and includes farm towns like Manteca and Lodi .
He introduced bills to expand offshore oil drilling , rewrite the Endangered Species Act , increase logging on public lands and limit federal agencies from restricting pesticides .
He advocated more commercial whale hunting , and famously wrote in a 1996 book that environmental regulation “ owes more to communism than to any other philosophy . ”
After environmentalists spent more than $ 1 million to help Democrat Jerry McNerney , a former wind energy executive , upset Pombo in 2006 , green groups thought he was done .
But this week Pombo , 49 , is sprinting to the finish line in a race to resurrect his political career .
He ’s running in the Republican primary in what may be California ’s hottest congressional race of the June 8 election — a four - man contest to succeed retiring Rep.
George Radanovich , R - Mariposa , in the 19th district .
The district includes Yosemite National Park and the fields of the San Joaquin Valley , along with the Sierra Foothills , the north side of Fresno , parts of Modesto and Gold Rush towns like Jamestown and Sonora .
It ’s a solidly Republican area , and the winner of the primary is expected to cruise to Washington , D.C. , in November .
Pombo and the other three candidates , state Sen.
Jeff Denham , R - Merced ; former Fresno Mayor Jim Patterson ; and Fresno City Councilman Larry Westerlund , have similar positions on the issues .
They all want lower taxes , an overturn of President Barack Obama ’s health care law , and new rules to waive the Endangered Species
Act to allow more water to be pumped to farmers from the Sacramento - San Joaquin River Delta .
But Pombo , in his familiar cowboy hat , argues that if elected , he ’d not only start with 14 years ’ seniority , but with insight into how Congress works , particularly when it comes to water and wildlife laws .
If the GOP wins back the House in November , he notes that by January he could be chairman again of the powerful House Natural Resources Committee , pushing for the interests of farmers and other rural Americans .
“ This is a tight race , ” he said .
“ The state , the Central Valley , does n’t have a lot of time .
We ’re in trouble .
We need somebody who is going to be effective immediately .
That ’s what I bring to the table . ”
Environmentalists have energetically responded .
The Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund has spent at least $ 65,000 on radio ads calling Pombo “ another corrupt politician . ”
The Humane Society Legislative Fund has distributed thousands of mailers .
And the League of Conservation Voters put Pombo on its “ Dirty Dozen List , ” normally reserved for sitting members of Congress .
“ Having Pombo represent a district that includes Yosemite National Park is like electing Godzilla as mayor of Tokyo , ” said Warner Chabot , CEO of the California League of Conservation Voters .
Pombo , who was named an “ eco- thug ” by the Sierra Club in 1996 , shrugs off the opposition .
“ It just shows I was the most effective fighting against them , ” he said .
The race has split the state ’s GOP establishment .
Denham has the endorsement of Radanovich .
Patterson has the backing of the Central Valley Tea Party .
Pombo is supported by Rep. Tom McClintock , R - Granite Bay , and Rep. Devin Nunes , of neighboring Visalia .
Denham , 42 , is an almond grower from Atwater who served 16 years in the Air Force and whose state Senate district runs from Salinas to Hollister to Modesto .
He said he ’ll represent voters without the drama that Pombo brings .
During the campaign , Pombo has caught controversy for once taking money from disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff and also for billing taxpayers $ 5,000 after taking his family in 2003 on an RV trip of national parks .
“ Democrats have not had the baggage or the ammunition to run against me , ” Denham said .
“ Richard Pombo has certainly given them a lot of material over the years . ”
Neither Denham nor Pombo lives in the district .
The Constitution only requires House members live in the state they represent .
Both have raised about $ 600,000 .
Pombo ’s major donors include Exxon - Mobil , BP , Arch Coal , the Safari Club and the head of Westlands Water District .
Denham ’s include various Indian tribes , and prominent farm leaders like George Tanimura and Rick Antle of Salinas , and John Harris of Harris Ranch in Coalinga .
A SurveyUSA poll May 18 had Patterson at 29 percent , Denham at 28 , Pombo at 18 and Westerlund at 6 .
Pombo said his polls show it closer .
“ I would not dismiss Pombo , ” said Tom Holyoke , an associate professor of political science at California State University - Fresno .
“ He may have a chance .
It would be wrong to count him out . ”

A giant panda eats bamboo--REUTERS / Stringer
This just might be the saddest news you will hear today — a giant panda , living in China ’s Jinan Zoo , died after accidently being gassed with carbon monoxide and chlorine .
An autopsy released on Tuesday revealed that the 21 - year - old panda , Quan Quan , inhaled the gases that were being used to disinfect a nearby former air raid shelter .
The toxic gases caused her lungs to collapse and despite attempts to save her , Quan Quan died in the hospital .
( See TIME ’s photo essay on panda Tai Shan ’s journey to China )
Zoo officials say that the gases had come through ventilation pipes that the zoo shared with the raid shelter .
Activists are already pointing to Quan Quan ’s death as another indication of how zoos should improve their treatment of animals in captivity .
( See the viral sneezing panda clip in TIME ’s 50 best YouTube videos )
“ These pandas are being bred for a life in captivity , ” said Kati Loeffler , a veterinary advisor for the International Fund for Animal Welfare .
“ Why are they being bred ?
Just so they can circulate through zoos and live next to old air raid shelters ? ”
As pandas are on the endangered species list , Quan Quan was reportedly considered a “ heroic mother ” in China , because she has given birth to seven cubs .

Posted on June 4 , 2010 , Ron Whitaker Blizzard and Glider Return to Court Monday
Back in January of 2009 , Blizzard won a court case against MDY , the makers of the Glider ‘ bot ’ that players can use to automate gameplay in World of Warcraft .
Not only did the judge award Blizzard summary judgment on several issues , he also held that MDY ’s founder , Michael Donnelly , was personally liable for the actions his company took .
There ’s been a lot of talk concerning that ruling , and the repercussions it has for future cases if Blizzard is successful .
Not being a lawyer , I wo n’t pretend to know the ins and outs of the judgment , I ’ll just point you to Ars Technica so you can see what went on there .
I can hear you now .
“ So what if Blizzard gets sued ?
They have tons of money ! ”
Well apparently , this lawsuit could have a very lasting effect on how games are played , marketed , and run online for a long time after this case ends .
Monday marks the return of this case to a courtroom , as MDY ’s appeal is being heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals .
This impact of this case could be felt all over the software world , and not just in gaming .
As Tim Lee notes in the Ars article referenced above ,
Blizzard argued , and Judge Campbell agreed , that when users violated the World of Warcraft EULA , they no longer had a license to play the game and were therefore guilty of copyright infringement .
As Siy noted in a blog post last year , Blizzard ’s theory , if taken literally , would mean that violating any of the rules in the EULA and Terms of Service , such as choosing a screen name that did n’t meet Blizzard ’s guidelines , would be an act of copyright infringement .
And distributing software that helps users infringe copyright itself constitutes secondary copyright infringement , which could expose MDY to copyright law ’s draconian “ statutory damages ” of $ 150,000 per act of infringement .
The law gives aggrieved parties to contract disputes much less potent powers .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation is also opposed to the ruling made in Blizzard ’s favor , and they have posted a lengthy discourse describing why on their site .
Basically , this case will determine the enforceability of all those EULAs that you just click through without reading , and whether or not you own the program you purchased , or just a license to use it .
I know legal proceedings can be as boring as watching paint dry , but the implications this particular case has for the gaming industry mean it is definitely one to watch come Monday .
The Quran states that men and women were created to be equal parts of a pair .
Muhammad said that the rights of women are sacred and that they are the “ twin halves of men ” .
Considering women in Britain received the right to vote , inherit and own property thirteen centuries later , Muhammad ’s campaigns were both radical and revolutionary .
Muslim women gained full ownership over their money , while husbands had the responsibility to provide for them even if their wives were wealthier than them .
Women had the right to divorce instantly on returning the dowry , something other religions do n't allow .
One duty enjoined upon them was that of education .
Early Islamic history saw the establishment of Muslim women as scholars , politicians , businesswomen , jurists and doctors .
Fatima al Firhi founded the first university in 859 in Fez , Morocco ; Razia al Din ruled the Delhi Sultanate in India in 1236 ; Umm Darda , a scholar from Syria , taught imams , jurists and even had the 5th Umayyad caliph who ruled from Spain to India as her student .
In fact some eight thousand accounts of Muslim female scholars have been documented , many of whom in addition to theology and jurisprudence , were skilled in calligraphy and philosophy , women who not only contributed to their society but actively shaped it .
The fruits of Muhammad ’s reforms are as visible now as they have been throughout history .
Today , Muslim women in Britain are achieving positions of status and respect as police officers , lawyers , entrepreneurs , medics , social activists , MPs and peers in the House of Lords .
Remaining true to the ideals cemented 1,430 years ago , Muslim women were and still are role models for future generations .
Sultana Tafadar
“ Working as a barrister at a leading human rights firm , I often get asked the question : how are you able to reconcile your choice of profession with Islam ’s views regarding the role of women ?
The question usually stems from the false presumption that Islam sees women as unequal to men .
This could not be further from the truth .
My answer is that there is no conflict to reconcile .
Rather my choice of profession is entirely in sync with , and indeed promoted , by Islam .
If you study the rights and status of women in Islam , it is easy to conclude that the laws and practices put in place by Prophet Muhammad were , and still are , revolutionary .
He brought recognition to their rights in both the private and public spheres in a society which inflicted the worst kinds of degradations on women .
His reforms continue to be revolutionary in that they do not regard men as being the comparator or the benchmark by which equality is measured .
Whilst Islam promotes the notion that men and women are spiritual and intellectual equals , it also gives value to the differences between the sexes as strengths rather than weaknesses .
From an Islamic perspective , women are regarded as being particularly suited to engaging in the legal arena .
This is not only because we are intellectual equals to men , but also because we were more likely to introduce a level of empathy and thereby give recognition to the human dimensions of justice .
I certainly try to adopt this approach in my work .
I believe that a return to the Prophetic legacy would further empower women .
We will see the valuable roles we have to perform more clearly , and that to be equal is not to be ‘ the same as a man ’ , but to be a woman . ”
Freaking tired of performing for hungry Sushi eating Japanese , a False Killer
Whale escapes his enclosure by just jumping over it during one of its shows .
The " Ohhh " and " Ahhhs " you hear from the crowd as the Whale slides out , translated from Japanese means , " Dinner is served " To the sadness of the crowd , a crane arrives .
No Sushi for you is heard of the loudspeaker .
Sadly , 2 Japanese Fathers watching the show later participated in ritualSeppuku after losing face with their families on not delivering up fresh Sushi .
Very Sad.
Moral to this story is , " Do n't make promises you cannot keep "

The economy lost 125,000 jobs in June , driven primarily by the elimination of 225,000 temporary Census positions .
In just the private sector , payrolls increased by 83,000 , a modest gain over employment in May .
The chart above shows job changes in this recession compared with recent ones , with the black line representing the current downturn .
The line has ticked upward since last year , but still has a long way to go before the job market fully recovers to its pre-recession level .
Since the downturn began in December 2007 , the economy has shed , on net , about 5.4 percent of its nonfarm payroll jobs .
And that does n’t even account for the fact that the working - age population has continued to grow , meaning that if the economy were healthy we should have more jobs today than we had before the recession .
The unemployment rate ( measured by a different government survey , and based on how many people are without jobs but are looking for work ) edged downward to 9.5 percent in June , from 9.7 percent in May .
The story of the Palestinian popular protest against Israel in several West Bank villages has recently garnered worldwide praise .
However , as with any other massive movement , the popular protest too has its darker sides .
The Palestinian Authority , as well as the leaders of the Palestinian popular protests in villages such as Bil'in , Na'alim , Umm Salmuna , have been trying to keep the following story away from both public knowledge and the media 's eye :
One of the more prominent Umm Salmuna activists – a village south of Bethlehem , long entrenched in a battle against the West Bank separation fence – is suspected of the attempted rape of an American peace activist who had been residing in the village as part of her support of the local protest .
Omar Aladdin , who had been arrested three months ago over suspicions he had attempted to rape the U.S. citizen , was subsequently released after agreeing to apologize to the young woman .
However , Haaretz had learned that representatives of both the popular protest movement and the PA have since applied pressure on the American peace activist as to prevent her from making the story public .
The incident allegedly took place last April , as Aladdin , who had served a term in the Israeli jail in the past , arrived one evening at the guest house in which many of the foreign peace activists were staying .
The European and American female activists reportedly agreed to let Aladdin stay with them after he had told them he feared the Israel Defense Forces were on his tail , adding that he had been severely beaten at an IDF checkpoint only a week before .
During his stay Aladdin allegedly attempted to rape a Muslim - American woman , nicknamed " Fegin " by fellow activists .
The woman escaped , later accusing the popular protest man of the attempt .
One villager who had encountered the American following the incident said she had been in a state of shock .
Aladdin then refused to apologize for the incident , when news of it reached the village 's popular committee , the popular protests ' governing body , allegedly saying that the incident had been marginal and normal .
The American activist then asked the committee to notify authorities of the attempted rape , a request which resulted in the man being arrested by security forces in Bethlehem .
After agreeing to apologize for the incident , Aladdin was released from custody by the PA police .
The U.S. citizen was then convinced to retract her complaint , as to avoid tainting the image of the popular protest , which had attracted praise from around the world in recent months .
However , the Umm Salmuna case is not the only one .
Separation fence activists know of other incidents in which Palestinians molested and sexually assaulted foreign peace activists , a subject which was apparently raised in the discussions of the various popular committees .
Foreign female peace activists regularly participate in protests in the villages of Bil'in , Na'alin , and others , where the activists stay in separate houses .
Some villagers do not agree with these housing arrangements , claiming that the villages ' youth , who frequently visit the activists , are corrupted by the young women .
One villager said the female activists bring a different " culture with them , western , too open .
The young people , especially from the villages , arent used to stay near other girls , they do not know their culture , certainly when its a young woman staying with other women in a strange house .
They misinterpret it . "
Mahmoud Zwahara , the popular committee 's coordinator for the Umm Salmuna and Ma'sara region , said in response that " the struggle against the separation fence is a joint fight , which does not target Israeli identity or Jews .
We hope that our activity will show the Israeli soldiers that they must cease their actions against us as well as human rights violations . "
Two years ago , an Air Force A - 10 pilot used flares , infrared cameras , his 30 - millimeter gun , some quick thinking , and his huge gonads to save the lives of a German reconstruction team pinned down in a dangerous Afghan valley in the dead of night .
For that , Capt . Brian Erickson was awarded a much - deserved Distinguished Flying Cross .
It was no isolated incident .
Some of the most heroic teamwork in Afghanistan involves A - 10 " Warthog " pilots and grunts on the ground .
Earlier this year , Staff Sergeant Robert Gutierrez , a radio - equipped air controller , was caught in an ambush with his Special Forces team during a mission to capture an insurgent leader , according to the Air Force .
" Cut off from the heavy weapons in their convoy and pinned down by insurgent fire , " and with two teammates wounded , Gutierrez killed four attackers with his rifle while calling in an A - 10 for eight strafing runs .
But that was only the beginning :
Consolidating the team 's position , Sergeant Gutierrez then directed more than 70 close air support strikes over the next five plus hours while repelling numerous attempts by insurgents to overrun their position .
His focus and technical battlefield expertise were deciding factors to the team 's survival .
As many as 240 insurgents were " incapacitate[d ] , " including the targeted leader .
My only question : where 's this guy 's medal ?

Editorial by Ivan Trembow
Note :
This editorial was written specifically for Ivan 's Blog .
Also , the opinions expressed in this editorial are those of Ivan Trembow , and with the exception of the specific quotes in this article , these statements do not necessarily reflect the opinions of anyone else .
Within seconds of UFC 60 going on the air on May 27th , Zuffa put its well - respected play - by - play man , Mike Goldberg , in one of the most uncomfortable positions that any announcer can find themselves in .
He was , through no fault of his own , put in a position to be deceptive .
In this case , it was about the show being " sold out . "
Goldberg and Joe Rogan did a good job on commentary throughout the evening , as they normally do , but anyone who has been following the sport in recent months is fully aware of the fact that UFC 60's ticket sales came nowhere close to Zuffa 's publicly expressed expectations .
Any other UFC event with the same level of attendance would be viewed as a huge success at the live gate , but it 's a different story altogether when you have an event that UFC president Dana
White repeatedly said would break the all - time attendance records , and it winds up not coming close to doing so .
The event was not " sold out , " as Goldberg said .
Whether UFC management simply told Goldberg that the event was sold out and he repeated it , or whether he was specifically told to say that the event was sold out even though it was n't , it 's generally not an accident when an announcer says , " We 're sold out ! " several times during a broadcast .
The high ticket prices for UFC 60 were slashed several weeks before the event , and even then , free " comp " tickets were still being given away en masse , in an attempt to make it look good for the cameras .
There were promotions such as the one on the KROQ radio station where you did n't even have to be the X numbered caller to get free tickets , as is normally the case with ticket give - aways .
Anyone who called got free tickets because there were so many of them to give away .
As recently as the Hughes - Gracie countdown show on Spike TV shortly before UFC 60 , White was saying that there would be " over 20,000 fans " in the building , which would have been an extremely difficult task , given the fact that it was configured to hold 16,947 fans .
Zuffa claimed after the event to have sold 14,802 tickets , which is also false .
The legitimate attendance numbers for UFC 60 were 10,347 paid tickets and 4,418 free tickets .
The total attendance was 14,765 , and approximately one - third of those people got into the show for free .
Zuffa also floated the ridiculous claim both before and after the event that UFC 60 had a live gate approaching $ 9 million , which is only a correct statement if you consider $ 2,900,090 ( the actual live gate ) to be " approaching $ 9 million . "
The actual live gate was , as Dave Meltzer put it , " less than one - third of the numbers that the company had thrown around in the media leading into the show . "
I do n't know the specific reason that UFC management gave the directive to say that the event was " sold out , " but whatever the reason , it was unnecessary .
Is it not enough to talk about how far the sport has come , and point out that it would have been unthinkable just six years ago when the UFC was barely alive to suggest that the UFC would be having a big show at the Staples Center ?
Is it not enough to pan the crowd and make it look impressive to the average PPV viewer without feeling the need to have your play - by - plan man lie about the place being sold out ?
Is it not enough to say that you had a gigantic live gate of $ 2.9 million rather than floating the ridiculous $ 9 million figure ?
Unfortunately , this is just a small part of a much bigger trend of deception .
On the subject of attendance , Zuffa said that UFC 59 in Anaheim sold 17,000 tickets in just a few days , and it still says on the UFC web site that the event had over 17,000 fans in attendance .
The legitimate attendance , as released by the California State Athletic Commission and the arena , was a sellout of 13,814 , which is also a very impressive figure .
Again , is it not impressive enough to sell out an arena configured for 13,814 seats ?
Why is there a perceived need to lie and claim that you sold over 17,000 tickets ?
The Undefeated Royce Gracie ?
The same sentiment applies to the much more blatant lie about Royce Gracie 's " MMA record " of 11 - 0 .
When the UFC first started up with the false advertising in countless commercials on Spike TV in the weeks before UFC 60 , I thought it was just a mistake .
After all , the original UFC 60 commercials on Spike TV made it a point to say that Royce Gracie was " undefeated in the Octagon , " which is a way of suggesting that he has never lost a fight without actually saying it , and there 's nothing wrong with that .
That is simple " slight of hand marketing " and is done all the time .
That would n't be all that big of a deal .
It crossed the line into being some of the most blatant false advertising in recent memory when the updated commercials that the UFC ran on Spike TV simply referred to Royce as " the undefeated Royce Gracie . "
Again , one could think that it might be a mistake and not intentional , but it ended up being a conscious effort to deceive people , because Royce Gracie was repeatedly listed as having an " MMA record " of 11 - 0 on the UFC 60 PPV broadcast .
Everyone else on the card had their MMA records listed , but Royce had his UFC record listed , while still having it called his MMA record ( and it was n't even his accurate UFC record ) .
For a large percentage of viewers who are n't knowledgeable enough about the sport to know any better , they probably believed it , and that was the whole point of doing it .
If a certain percentage of the viewing audience does n't know any better , you can often get away with deceiving them .
Zuffa is very much in the business of trying to control the flow of information ( actual Dana
White quote regarding web site traffic in a recent newspaper interview : " Our web site is a real machine for us .
We get a lot of hits .
They can't go anywhere else to read it , so they come to us . " )
Part of the advantage of trying to control the flow of information is that you can often re-write history and get away with it .
Vince McMahon has done it for years in WWE in many different ways , and the UFC has moved closer and closer to McMahon 's less - than - pleasant image by re-writing history in any way that they see fit .
The convenience must be wonderful .
Are you on bad terms with Tito Ortiz for a while ?
Just delete him from the UFC's history , then add him back when he signs another contract with you .
Are you on bad terms with Frank Shamrock ?
Just delete him from the UFC's history , too , and pretend with a straight face at a " Top 10 " ceremony that he 's not one of the top ten fighters in UFC history .
( A couple years later , after he breaks the North American MMA attendance record , keep it on the down - low when you offer him a big - money contract to return to the UFC . )
Is it more convenient for you to lie and say that Royce Gracie is undefeated than it is to display his actual MMA record ?
Just write your own history and declare that his MMA record is now 11 - 0 .
This will make it look like Matt Hughes was the first man to ever beat Royce , even though that 's a complete farce .
The fact of the matter is that in reality , Royce Gracie 's MMA record going into the Hughes fight was 13 - 1 - 3 , and that 's if you do n't count his first fight with Hidehiko Yoshida since it was n't fought under MMA rules ( the rules in that fight limited striking ) , or the so - called loss to Harold Howard in the fight that never happened at UFC 3 .
In addition to his one previous loss , Royce has had three draws in his career , all in bouts where it was agreed before the fight that there would be no judges ' decision if the fight went to the time limit .
Royce fought to a draw with Ken Shamrock way back in 1995 ( which Shamrock would have won if there were judges ) , and he fought to a draw with Yoshida in 2003 ( which Gracie would have won if there judges ) .
Most recently , Gracie fought to a draw ( which could have gone either way if there were judges ) last December in a fight where Gracie weighed - in at 190 pounds and his opponent , Hideo Tokoro , weighed - in at 152 pounds .
Far more significant than the three draws on Gracie 's record is the one previous defeat on his legitimate MMA record of 13 - 1 - 3 going into the Hughes fight .
That one previous loss came against Kazushi Sakuraba in an epic 90 - minute fight , in front of a massive crowd at the Tokyo Dome , in one of the most historically significant MMA matches of all time .
In other words , I 'm pretty sure that it happened and that I did n't imagine it .
Despite this , there were countless TV commercials referring to Royce as " the undefeated Royce Gracie , " and it repeatedly said on the screen during UFC 60 , " MMA Record : 11- 0 . "
Just because the UFC made the choice not to acknowledge Royce 's previous loss in the lead - up to his fight at UFC 60 does not mean that the previous loss does n't exist , especially given that his previous loss took place in one of the most famous MMA matches of all time .
If anyone wants to try to correct me on a technicality by saying , " But his UFC record really was 11 - 0 ! " then that could easily be countered by three points .
One , his previous UFC record was not 11 - 0 ; it was 11 - 0 - 1 . Second , it specifically said during UFC 60 on a repeated basis that 11 - 0 was his " MMA record , " as opposed to his " UFC record . "
Third , with the logic that 11 - 0 really was his UFC record , then why is it that every other fighter in recent UFC history has had their overall MMA record displayed on the screen instead of just their UFC record ?
If you 're only displaying UFC records , should n't Assuerio Silva 's record have been listed as 0 - 1 going into his fight against Mike Swick at UFC 60 ?
While trying to establish the UFC as a real sport , things this like only serve to make Zuffa look bush league , which is the exact opposite of the image that they want to project .
As Dave Meltzer wrote in the Wrestling Observer , " Royce 's history was rewritten to where his most famous matches were suddenly no longer part of his story , and the term ' undefeated ' constantly being used was not just misleading , but outright deceptive ...
As much as the UFC wants to be taken seriously as a real sport , Major League Baseball does n't erase its own history , make up team records or individual player records during the World Series , have commentators change the results of famous games , or claim sell - outs that are n't so .
Even boxing , a sport that the UFC compares itself with and talks about being the more honest version of , does n't do that .
HBO
Boxing does n't pretend fights that did n't air on HBO actually did n't happen .
Even WWE , with its decades long history of dishonesty , does n't even do that anymore . "
What causes the " Royce Gracie is undefeated " lie to make such little sense is that it was completely unnecessary .
Zuffa could have just as easily pushed to new viewers and reinforced to long - time viewers that Royce Gracie is a legend in the sport who changed the entire perception of fighting in the United States , and they could have sold the fight just as well in doing so without lying about his MMA record .
Instead , they lied in order to enhance something that did n't necessarily need to be enhanced .
Zuffa Pays TUF Winners Six -Figure Salaries ?
The same can be said about the so - called " six - figure " contracts that are awarded to the winners of The Ultimate Fighter .
If you say to the average person that you 're making " six figures " in salary from a particular employer , that is widely regarded to mean that you are making in excess of $ 100,000 per year from that employer ( hence the actual phrase " six figures " ... this concept is not rocket science ) .
Zuffa 's use of the phrase " six figures " is misleading and has been since the first season , when it was specifically said by Zuffa ( and reported at the time ) that the TUF winner 's contracts were for three years and $ 350,000 .
In reality , the winner 's contracts for the first three seasons have the following terms .
The TUF winner 's contracts bind the fighter exclusively to the UFC for three years , with three fights per year .
In the first year , the salary for each fight is $ 12,000 to fight and an additional $ 12,000 to win .
Fighting income for the year would range from $ 36,000 to $ 72,000 , depending on wins and losses .
In the second year , it 's $ 16,000 and $ 16,000 per fight , meaning that fighting income for the year would range from $ 48,000 to $ 96,000 .
In the third year , it 's $ 22,000 and $ 22,000 per fight , meaning that fighting income for the year would range from $ 66,000 to $ 122,000 .
That is actually a six - figure income in one year out of three , or zero years out of three , depending on wins and losses .
Total fighting income paid to the fighter by Zuffa over the course of the three - year contract would range from $ 150,000 to $ 300,000 , depending on wins and losses , and would only hit the $ 300,000 mark if the fighter went 9 - 0 in his first nine UFC fights .
The UFC could just as easily say that the winners of TUF get " UFC contracts " or even " big UFC contracts , " and they would still have an attractive prize for TUF .
There is no need to be so misleading about the terms of the deal .
This is straight out of the WWE playbook , where there was a so - called " Million Dollar Tough Enough competition " that was won by MMA fighter Daniel Puder , and the reality of the contract was actually , " It 's four years at $ 250,000 per year , and only the first year is guaranteed , and you 're very likely to be released after one year . "
One area in which Zuffa may have actually topped McMahon on the classless scale is in the percentage of revenue that goes to the talent , which I have written about extensively in the past and once again this past week with a series of articles looking at the UFC's PPV sales , live gate revenue , and fighter salaries .
One example from earlier this year is that UFC 59 generated a total of over $ 18 million in gross revenue , and yet there were still six different fighters on the UFC 59 card who made $ 5,000 or less ( which is less than the cost of a 60 - second commercial on The Ultimate Fighter ) .
The top fighters are now making more money due to the huge explosion in revenue that started in early 2005 .
However , the UFC fighters who fill out the prelims and even the main cards are still getting paychecks that should be embarrassing for any self - respecting businessman to be paying fighters , given the company 's huge revenue streams and its desire to be seen as a major - league sport .
Even if it 's basic capitalism to pay as little as possible , the UFC 's pay scale is not doing the company any favors if Zuffa wants the UFC to be seen as a major - league sport , as opposed to a bush - league sport whose athletes have to get side jobs to support themselves , or a sport like boxing with a trashy mainstream media image .
Zuffa Added Most of the Rules and Regulations ?
When it comes to talking to mainstream media reporters , lying is the norm rather than the exception for Zuffa , and there is a mountain of evidence to back up that assertion .
Again , on the issue of re-writing history , what do you do if you 're Zuffa and you want to inflate your place in the history of the sport ?
Just tell mainstream media reporters who do n't know any better that it was only since 2001 , when Zuffa started running things , that the UFC added things like weight classes ( actually 1997 ) , multiple judges scoring a fight if it goes the distance ( 1995 ) , doctors at ringside ( 1993 ) , medical exams of fighters ( 1993 ) , time limits ( 1995 ) , gloves ( 1995 ) , multiple timed rounds ( 1999 ) , the banning of groin strikes ( 1994 ) , the ability of the referee to stop the fight ( 1994 ) , and whatever else you can get them to believe .
The mainstream media reporters wo n't bother to do five minutes of research to correct you , and it'll seem like you took the sport directly from a no-rules street fighting contest into a civilized affair !
You wo n't be directly quoted , but the same series of lies will just happen to appear in most mainstream media articles about the UFC in which you 're quoted talking about other things .
You want examples ?
There are literally far too many to list , so let 's focus on some of the more recent and high - profile examples .
In the high - profile trade journal MultiChannel News in June , the author of an article about the UFC happened to write this immediately after quoting Dana White about something else : " Once Zuffa purchased the franchise from [ Bob ] Meyrowitz , it immediately imposed rules to make the sport more appealing to state athletic commissions and cable operators .
The sport has outlawed such moves as eye gouging , biting and kicks to the crotch .
Much like boxing , the UFC emphasized weight classes and allowed referees to stop matches at their discretion .
In 2001 , Zuffa was able to convince boxing - friendly athletic associations in New Jersey and Nevada to sanction UFC fights . "
Besides the usual lies about when various rules were implemented ( seriously , eye gouging and biting ? ) , the MultiChannel News article also repeated Zuffa 's oft - mentioned claim that it got the UFC sanctioned in both Nevada and New Jersey .
In reality , before Zuffa ever bought the UFC , it was sanctioned and regulated by the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board , which was widely regarded as the second most important sanctioning body in the country .
The " old UFC " also ran fully sanctioned UFC events in states such as Iowa , Louisiana , and Mississippi , but it was New Jersey that was regarded as having the second - biggest sanctioning body ( behind only Nevada 's ) in terms of importance and prestige .
In addition to getting fully sanctioned in New Jersey , the previous owners of the UFC also made an unsuccessful attempt to get sanctioned in Nevada shortly before selling the UFC to Zuffa for $ 2 million , which means that it 's complete BS whenever you read that the previous owners " ran from regulation " or " ran from sanctioning . "
There was a flood of poorly - researched hack - jobs about Zuffa 's history in early July , which coincided with a flood of Dana White interviews in mainstream newspapers , and this kicked off with an article in the Las Vegas Review - Journal .
The article repeatedly misspelled the name of former UFC president Bob Meyrowitz , which shows how much research was done for the article , and the author of the article wrote that Meyrowitz " kept conducting UFC cards in states without athletic commissions that would not regulate it , which only fueled the sport 's outlaw reputation and further angered McCain . "
Immediately before that point in the article , Dana White is quoted as saying , " I could see that if this was done the right way , if someone did n't run away from regulation but embraced it , if someone cleaned it up and shined it a little , this thing could be huge . "
Shortly after the line about Meyrowitz and his non-existent rebel UFC events in states that specifically banned MMA , White is quoted again , this time saying , " We all felt if we made some changes and embraced regulation , this had the potential to just go crazy . "
Again , that is re-writing history at best , and lying through your teeth at worst .
The previous owners did not " run away from regulation . "
They sought sanctioning and actually got it in New Jersey , and then shortly before selling the UFC to Zuffa , the previous owners tried unsuccessfully to get it sanctioned in Nevada .
The article in the Las Vegas Review - Journal added the following , just in case any knowledgeable readers were still wondering if the article was a hack - job : " White traveled the country like a carnival barker ...
It was n't long before New Jersey and Nevada approved the UFC and agreed to allow mixed martial arts fights , leading to nearly every major boxing state approving it . "
Even the Washington Post , which normally does a good job with basic fact - checking , fell for this line of BS in a July 8th article that also happened to quote Dana White about Zuffa 's purchase of the UFC in 2001 .
The author of the article wrote , " UFC President Dana White and Zuffa LLC took over in 2001 and since then the UFC has tightened its rules and restrictions .
It banned elbowing , head - butting and knee strikes to the head while on the ground , introduced weight classes and implemented various other protections , such as referee training , and mandatory fight doctors . "
We 've already gone over the timeline of when those things were actually implemented ( much earlier than 2001 ) .
Several days after the Washington Post story was published , a much longer article ( which also quoted Dana White about Zuffa 's purchase of the UFC ) appeared in the Boston Globe , and it repeated an even more brazen set of lies .
The author of the Globe article actually wrote that Zuffa " resurrected UFC from the scrap heap of bad marketing and no-holds - barred mayhem when they bought the company name from Bob Meyrowitz for around $ 160,000 .
At the time ultimate fighting had a sullied reputation .
No state would sanction its bouts because it had no rules and boasted of its refusal to cooperate with state regulatory bodies . "
Zuffa bought the UFC for $ 160,000 ?
No state would sanction UFC bouts in 2001 ?
The UFC had no rules in 2001 ?
The previous owners boasted of their refusal to cooperate with state regulatory bodies ?
I think the Boston Globe may have set a new record for " most factually incorrect information ever fit into a few sentences , " but it fits right in with the kinds of things that Zuffa would like everyone to believe .
But wait , the Boston Globe did n't also repeat the lies about Zuffa creating all of the rules , right ?
No , they did that , too : " By 1997 , no - holds - barred events had been relegated to smoke - filled rooms in unregulated states ... but by using Lorenzo Fertitta ’s connections as a former Nevada boxing commissioner , doors began to open within the regulatory community when UFC came up with a set of rules .
Where once anything was allowed , turning events into bloody barroom brawls without the cocktail glasses , [ Dana ]
White and his associates added strict adherence to such things as weight classes , five - minute rounds , judges , and mandatory drug testing ... [ Zuffa ] embraced regulatory bodies in states such as Nevada , New Jersey , and California , which had refused to acknowledge UFC . "
The Wrestling Observer responded to the Boston Globe story by writing , " The story features the same b.s. about how in 2001 , no state would sanction MMA when Bob Meyrowitz owned it and how the old UFC refused to cooperate with state athletic commissions .
The truth is the exact opposite ...
Yes , another story about how the new owners added rules , and embraced regulation .
It ’s almost sickening how much this crap gets propagated and nobody does one iota of research to see how bogus it is . "
Regarding one specific similarity to Vince McMahon 's similar pattern of propaganda , Meltzer wrote , " Old - time wrestling fans will love this one .
The old UFC was held in ' smoke - filled rooms in unregulated states ' [ according to the Boston Globe article ] .
That was the old Vince McMahon line about taking pro wrestling out of smoke filled arenas ... what took both out of smoke - filled arenas was the creation of indoor smoking laws , not promoters . "
One interesting side note to the Boston Globe article is that White also acknowledged in the article , " If there was no Web when we started , we would n't have been able to sustain it .
UFC stayed alive on the Web . Our [ demographic ] could never have found out about us without it because the mainstream media was ignoring us . "
So , just to clarify , it 's not what White is n't aware that the Internet kept the UFC alive for a time .
He 's fully aware of that ; it 's just not going to stop him from trying to control the flow of information and crack down on any form of independent , MMA - dedicated media .
In the biggest coup of all from a spreading of misinformation standpoint , an Associated Press reporter bit on the BS - bearing hook and included the same kind of factually incorrect in an AP news story about the UFC .
As an AP article , it appeared in the majority of major ( and minor ) newspapers across the United States , as well as huge web sites throughout the world , including ESPN.com .
The story claimed that when Zuffa bought the UFC and got it sanctioned in Nevada in 2001 , " Out went bloody head butts and other vicious blows that could cause serious harm .
In came a skilled and conditioned fighter . "
With the exception of the lie about the previous owners " running from sanctioning , " White is usually bright enough to not actually be quoted on the record repeating these lies .
They just happen to show up in every mainstream article that quotes him talking about other topics .
But in a very brazen example just this week on ESPNews '
The Hot List ,
White flat - out lied , on the record , for everyone to see on national television .
On The Hot List ,
White said that the UFC " was n't sanctioned by any of the major athletic commissions " before Zuffa bought it .
This is not a matter for debate .
It 's just flat - out factually incorrect , as I 've already detailed in this article .
Dana
White also said on The Hot List , " When we first bought the sport , not only was it not in any of the major venues here in the United States , but it also was n't on pay - per-view .
We were on DirecTV , but we were n't on any of the cable pay - per - view systems . "
While I was n't aware that Zuffa " bought the sport , " White 's statement about the PPV situation is absolutely correct .
However , his statement about major venues is once again factually incorrect , unless the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City is not considered a " major venue . "
White knew better than to repeat the lies about Zuffa adding all of the rules on national television .
Interestingly , Dave Meltzer noted in the Observer several months back that when longtime Observer subscriber Dave Doyle ( who writes about MMA for Fox ) was talking to White for an interview , White dropped any signs of trying to pretend that Zuffa added most of the UFC 's rules ... as soon as it became clear in the conversation that Doyle was a longtime MMA fan who knew the history of the sport and would be able to tell the difference between reality and BS ( as opposed to mainstream media reporters who know nothing about MMA and will repeat anything that you tell them because they do n't know any better and generally wo n't bother to do five minutes of research ) .
Regarding the specific line that the previous owners of the UFC " ran from sanctioning , " which is one line that Dana White does not have a problem giving on - the - record in any mainstream media interview , the previous owners did not " run from sanctioning , " and Zuffa knows that based on the circumstances of how Zuffa bought the UFC .
In fact , one of the last things that the previous owners did before selling the UFC to Zuffa was to try unsuccessfully to get the UFC sanctioned in Nevada .
Here 's the actual story about how SEG came to sell the UFC to Zuffa , gathered from multiple issues of the Wrestling Observer , with edits made in brackets to fill in context or correct grammar , and with a timeline clarification courtesy of Whaledog.com : " Meyrowitz [ former UFC president Bob Meyrowitz ] would go to InDemand [ the PPV company ] and ask what he needed to do to get back on InDemand , and they said the UFC needed to get sanctioned [ by a major sanctioning body ] .
He got sanctioned in New Jersey , and was basically told that he needed to get it sanctioned in Nevada , as that was the most influential athletic commission in the country .
[ Meyrowitz ] set up a meeting in Las Vegas , and at the time , sanctioning was going to happen based on what inside sources were telling both Meyrowitz and InDemand .
Suddenly , the night before the approval that was going to be the step to put the UFC back on the map , Meyrowitz was told that he was going to be voted down [ the next day , when his request was scheduled to be voted on by the members of the Nevada State Athletic Commission ] .
He did n't have the votes .
He was also told that if he followed through the next day , and was voted down , he would never have an opportunity to be sanctioned .
So , he pulled out , they created some cover reason as to why he was pulling his attempt at sanctioning , and basically he was screwed .
Lorenzo Fertitta [ the current co-owner of the UFC ] was an influential member of the Nevada commission at the time .
[ Approximately one year later ] , Fertitta purchased the UFC [ for $ 2 million ] , then got sanctioning in Nevada , and then got on PPV . "
There are dozens and dozens more examples of mainstream articles that quote Dana White as part of the article , and also just happen to keep giving Zuffa far more credit than is deserved for adding all of the rules , along with repeating the same set of lies about the previous owners of the UFC .
This particular set of deceptions and distortions , constantly repeated to mainstream media members who print them without knowing any better , is also completely unnecessary .
Zuffa legitimately did a lot of great things for the sport in the aforementioned time period ( and also has in the years since then ) , such as getting sanctioning in Nevada , unifying the rules between Nevada and the pre-existing New Jersey sanctioning , and getting back on cable PPV , so there 's no need to lie about it .
The truth is flattering enough .
There 's no valid reason for continuing to propagate these lies , and yet it keeps happening .
MMA is Merging with Pro Wrestling
It should also be troubling to any hardcore fan of MMA that the direction of the UFC is becoming increasingly similar to pro wrestling .
Keep in mind , this is coming from someone who is actually a fan of pro wrestling , butalso wants MMA to be more of a " real sport " than what it is becoming .
This trend towards a pro wrestling - like product should be a lot more upsetting to you if happen to be one of the many MMA fans who dislike pro wrestling .
It 's also important to note that I still find the UFC product to be enjoyable even in its current form , and there are still a decent amount of quality fights to be found in the UFC .
There 's just nowhere near as many as there would be if the current UFC product actually had anything to do with determining who the best fighters are ( you know , like how every season of the NFL determines who the best football team is , and every season of the NBA determines who the best basketball team is ) .
I have written previously about the worked pull - aparts between Tito Ortiz and Ken Shamrock on The Ultimate Fighter 3 , and have explained exactly what I mean by the phrase " worked pull - aparts . "
Ken Shamrock was even kind enough to add more pro wrestling terminology into the hype during the ridiculous Episode 12 pull - apart .
An interesting note to add on that front is that when TUF 3 contestant Tait Fletcher was asked in an interview with Jason Milloff about the interaction between Ortiz and Shamrock , Fletcher said , " It was a joke .
It was comedy .
Again , you could probably see me laughing ... when Ken goes off into his pro wrestling / WWE mode , does he really expect anyone to take him seriously ?
That ’s kind of hard to do . "
But I 'm not just talking about the worked pull - aparts and other nonsense such as having a fighter on TUF 3 who has a losing record in MMA .
I 'm also talking about the fact that it is now considered commonplace for the UFC to book squash matches in PPV main events just to elevate someone or pop a PPV buyrate .
Make no mistake about it , Pride does this all the time as well .
The difference is that Pride has been , from its very inception , rooted in the tradition of pro wrestling , since it was originally born out of the UWFI , a " strong - style pro wrestling " company .
On the other hand , the UFC has always vehemently claimed to be above this kind of thing , and has always balked at any pro wrestling comparisons , actually going so far as to deny the viewership crossover between UFC programming and pro wrestling on Spike TV ( even when overwhelming evidence shows that the two audiences are , in large part , the same people ) .
There 's a name for something where you match people against each other to draw money and you know the outcome ahead of time .
It 's called pro wrestling .
The only difference between pro wrestling and the UFC in this particular area is that the match outcomes themselves are pre-determined in pro wrestling , whereas the best they can possibly do in the UFC is to manipulate the matchmaking in order to create main event fights where they can have 90 % or higher certainty that a particular fighter is going to win .
( Think Matt Hughes vs. Royce Gracie , or Tito Ortiz vs. Ken Shamrock , which was indeed the " main event " of UFC 61 since it was given the vast majority of the hype going into the event . )
Bruce Mitchell recently wrote a column in the Pro Wrestling Torch about the UFC 's trend to be more like pro wrestling , focusing specifically on TUF 3 .
This is just an excerpt from a much larger column : " Years ago , fans thought WWF wrestling was real conflict .
Today they do n't .
They still buy tickets based on how the McMahon family manipulates the circumstances around the fighters to get the fans excited enough to buy things ...
Dana
White does the same thing that Vince McMahon and [ TNA booker ] Jeff Jarrett do .
Do you think he chose Tito Ortiz or Ken Shamrock as coaches for Ultimate Fighter because they were the best instructors he could find to teach apprentice fighters , or because their hatred for each other makes good TV ?
Do you think UFC chose those apprentices solely based on their potential as fighters , like that 33 year old big mouth , or because they 'd make good TV personalities ?
Do you think he 's promoting Ortiz vs.
Shamrock as a big time main event because they 're the two best fighters in the Octagon , or is it because they 're two marketable personalities who know how to present themselves and their enmity in charismatic ways ?
Hell , Shamrock is 42 years old and has n't won a big match in years . "
The UFC 's pro wrestling - like direction goes further than the Ortiz - Shamrock dynamic that Mitchell wrote about .
For every PPV main event on the UFC 's 2006 schedule that is legitimately a championship - level fight , featuring one fighter who is a champion against another fighter who deserves a title shot ( like Matt Hughes vs. Georges St. Pierre , Chuck Liddell vs. Renato Sobral , and hopefully Liddell vs. Wanderlei Silva ) , there 's another PPV main event on the schedule that exists for the sole purpose of drawing money and / or elevating someone with a huge mismatch ( like Hughes vs. Gracie , or Ortiz vs. Shamrock ) .
Of course , the actual fights are not fixed , and I am not suggesting for a second that they are .
Zuffa can never know for sure if the fighter who they expect to win is going to win .
Three examples : Rich Franklin still had to go out there and actually win the fight against Ken Shamrock , but the fight was a mismatch that was ultimately booked to draw money and give Franklin a big win over a big name .
The same statement applies to Hughes vs. Gracie ( White even said before UFC 60 in a media conference call that he would be " pretty screwed " if Gracie won ) , and it also applies to Ortiz vs.
Shamrock , which was always regarded as a fight that was overwhelmingly likely to give Ortiz a big win over a big name before his tentatively planned Light Heavyweight title shot .
It 's generally not a good sign if you paid $ 40 for a PPV main event ( like Hughes vs. Gracie ) and it would be completely accurate for you to think , " That fight was booked specifically for Fighter A to destroy Fighter B , and everyone involved knew that it was overwhelmingly likely to happen , and that is exactly what did happen , and now Fighter A's standing in the sport has been elevated , and that 's why exactly the fight was booked in the first place . "
That 's how pro wrestling is booked , with the only difference being that the promoters can be 100 percent certain of the results in pro wrestling , while MMA promoters can only be 90 + percent certain with mismatched shoot fights .
One product is a work and the other is a shoot , but they are becoming increasingly similar .
When Vince McMahon recently said in a MultiChannel News article that the people at Zuffa " do n't quite know what they 're doing in terms of building characters , " the author of the article asked Dana White about the subject of bringing new stars into the UFC .
The author of the article then wrote , " White said UFC 's momentum wo n't be pinned down by a lack of star power anytime soon .
He added the Ultimate Fighter reality series will continue to unveil up and coming superstars , whose careers fans will be able to track through its live events . "
In other words , the new stars in the UFC 's future will not be the top free agents from around the world .
Sure , some of them will be , and there will also be inter-promotional deals like the one with Pride to bring in Wanderlei Silva for what White described as " probably " a three - fight deal at the UFC 61 post - fight press conference .
But with the exception of a few cases like this , the " new stars " in the UFC 's future will primarily be TUF contestants .
There would n't necessarily be anything wrong with that if TUF really was an outlet for the top up - and - coming MMA fighters in the world to get a shot in the UFC , but that is not the case .
If you look at the fighters who were on the second and third seasons of TUF , the amount of people who had no business being on the show given their lack of MMA experience was actually larger than the amount of people who could be accurately described as " up - and - coming MMA fighters . "
On the upcoming fourth season , there will be 16 former UFC fighters , exactly two of whom have winning records in the UFC .
Far from being " former top fighters who just got off - track , " which is how this season of TUF is being sold by the UFC , the combined UFC record of the eight welterweights on the fourth season of TUF is 16 wins and 17 losses .
The combined UFC record of the middleweights on TUF 4 is four wins and 15 losses ( total combined UFC record for both weight classes : 20 - 32 ) .
Regarding the UFC 's trend towards a pro wrestling - like product , the UFC's own Heavyweight Champion , Tim Sylvia , said this in a Las Vegas Review - Journal article about UFC 61 : " The only reason he [ Ken Shamrock ] is fighting is because he's got a mouth and he likes to do that wrestling [ talk ] , that WWE stuff . "
Sylvia added , " We do n't need that .
We are world - class athletes , and we need to let our talents make the case for us .
People who really know the sport know that , but we 're still growing , and we need to represent ourselves a certain way . "
In response to that statement by Sylvia , Jeff Thaler wrote the following on Whaledog.com : " Sylvia raises a good point , but the reason Shamrock is headlining [ UFC 61 ] is easy to explain .
The UFC likes Ken Shamrock because it promotes itself more like a professional wrestling promotion than a sport - promoting its brand first , its president second , and actual athletes last .
Manufactured hype is more important to Zuffa than the quality of athletes or fights . "
As Dave Meltzer recently wrote in the Wrestling Observer , " The UFC ... would rather try to create their own stars [ on The Ultimate Fighter ] than pay huge money for people they do n't believe have name recognition past the Internet crowd .
The truth is , the UFC has never been , at any point in its existence , about trying to find out who the best fighters in the world are . "
I can't call that an inaccurate statement , but is n't " finding out who the best are " supposed to be what a real sport is all about when it comes down to it ?
If there 's a situation such as the 2005 NBA Playoffs where the two teams meeting in the NBA Finals are viewed as being an undesirable TV ratings match - up , the NBA does n't decide to put Kobe Bryant and the Lakers in the Finals .
The top two teams play , regardless of whether it 's going to draw the biggest business .
It 's a real sport , and that 's how it works .
Similarly , if two of the smallest - market teams in the NFL make it to the Super Bowl next season , the NFL is not going to decide to bump one of them for the star power of Peyton Manning and the Colts .
The emphasis in the UFC is not on who the best fighters are .
Who cares about that , right ?
( Apparently not Dana
White , who recently said in an interview that he does n't know too much about Fedor Emelianenko , who is almost universally regarded as the most dominant MMA fighter in the world . )
The emphasis is purely on who can draw money , and who can be elevated by a fight in order to draw money in subsequent fights .
It does n't have to be that one - sided , nor does it have to be completely in the opposite direction .
It 's actually quite possible for the UFC to have entertaining fighters and entertaining fights , while still ultimately trying to match up the best fighters .
The proposed Liddell - Silva fight is an excellent example , but that kind of thing is the exception rather than the norm in today 's UFC .
Just looking at the UFC 60 card , the same card that was headlined by the Hughes - Gracie farce , one can clearly see that it 's possible for certain fights to deliver on both sides of this coin , and there 's no reason that the main events can't do this more often as well .
Looking at the UFC 60 card , you 've got the Hughes - Gracie squash match , where Zuffa got the exact result that it expected , not unlike a lamb being led to slaughter ( which is sad , given all that Royce Gracie has done for the sport of MMA ) .
On the other hand , just look at the Mike Swick and Brandon Vera fights ( Swick fought Hoe Riggs , and Vera fought Assuerio Silva ) .
Swick and Vera are generally entertaining , charismatic fighters .
Sure , Zuffa probably hoped that Swick and Vera would each win their respective fights because they are both potential future stars , but were Swick and Vera given opponents that were almost certain to result in easy victories for them ?
No , they were n't .
Swick and Vera were matched up against Joe Riggs and Assuerio Silva , respectively .
Riggs and Silva are tough opponents , and either of them could very well have beaten Swick or Vera .
In the end , Swick and Vera won fights against tough opposition , and they earned the boost in stature that they got from doing so .
This is the kind of balance that Zuffa should be trying to have in more of its main events as well .
For the PPV main events in particular , is it really too much to ask when you 're paying $ 40 to have one fighter who is a champion going up against another fighter who deserves a title shot ?
I 'm not suggesting that the UFC should be completely antiseptic or sterile , but it would be nice if the UFC resembled a " real sport " more than it resembled a shoot form of pro wrestling .
Editorial by Ivan TrembowNote :
This editorial was written specifically for Ivan 's Blog .
Also , the opinions expressed in this editorial are those of Ivan Trembow , and with the exception of the specific quotes in this article , these statements do not necessarily reflect the opinions of anyone else .
Within seconds of UFC 60 going on the air on May 27th , Zuffa put its well - respected play - by - play man , Mike Goldberg , in one of the most uncomfortable positions that any announcer can find themselves in .
He was , through no fault of his own , put in a position to be deceptive .
In this case , it was about the show being " sold out . "
Goldberg and Joe Rogan did a good job on commentary throughout the evening , as they normally do , but anyone who has been following the sport in recent months is fully aware of the fact that UFC 60's ticket sales came nowhere close to Zuffa 's publicly expressed expectations .
Any other UFC event with the same level of attendance would be viewed as a huge success at the live gate , but it 's a different story altogether when you have an event that UFC president Dana
White repeatedly said would break the all - time attendance records , and it winds up not coming close to doing so .
The event was not " sold out , " as Goldberg said .
Whether UFC management simply told Goldberg that the event was sold out and he repeated it , or whether he was specifically told to say that the event was sold out even though it was n't , it 's generally not an accident when an announcer says , " We 're sold out ! " several times during a broadcast .
The high ticket prices for UFC 60 were slashed several weeks before the event , and even then , free " comp " tickets were still being given away en masse , in an attempt to make it look good for the cameras .
There were promotions such as the one on the KROQ radio station where you did n't even have to be the X numbered caller to get free tickets , as is normally the case with ticket give - aways .
Anyone who called got free tickets because there were so many of them to give away .
As recently as the Hughes - Gracie countdown show on Spike TV shortly before UFC 60 , White was saying that there would be " over 20,000 fans " in the building , which would have been an extremely difficult task , given the fact that it was configured to hold 16,947 fans .
Zuffa claimed after the event to have sold 14,802 tickets , which is also false .
The legitimate attendance numbers for UFC 60 were 10,347 paid tickets and 4,418 free tickets .
The total attendance was 14,765 , and approximately one - third of those people got into the show for free .
Zuffa also floated the ridiculous claim both before and after the event that UFC 60 had a live gate approaching $ 9 million , which is only a correct statement if you consider $ 2,900,090 ( the actual live gate ) to be " approaching $ 9 million . "
The actual live gate was , as Dave Meltzer put it , " less than one - third of the numbers that the company had thrown around in the media leading into the show .
" I do n't know the specific reason that UFC management gave the directive to say that the event was " sold out , " but whatever the reason , it was unnecessary .
Is it not enough to talk about how far the sport has come , and point out that it would have been unthinkable just six years ago when the UFC was barely alive to suggest that the UFC would be having a big show at the Staples Center ?
Is it not enough to pan the crowd and make it look impressive to the average PPV viewer without feeling the need to have your play - by - plan man lie about the place being sold out ?
Is it not enough to say that you had a gigantic live gate of $ 2.9 million rather than floating the ridiculous $ 9 million figure ?
Unfortunately , this is just a small part of a much bigger trend of deception .
On the subject of attendance , Zuffa said that UFC 59 in Anaheim sold 17,000 tickets in just a few days , and it still says on the UFC web site that the event had over 17,000 fans in attendance .
The legitimate attendance , as released by the California State Athletic Commission and the arena , was a sellout of 13,814 , which is also a very impressive figure .
Again , is it not impressive enough to sell out an arena configured for 13,814 seats ?
Why is there a perceived need to lie and claim that you sold over 17,000 tickets ?
The same sentiment applies to the much more blatant lie about Royce Gracie 's " MMA record " of 11 - 0 .
When the UFC first started up with the false advertising in countless commercials on Spike TV in the weeks before UFC 60 , I thought it was just a mistake .
After all , the original UFC 60 commercials on Spike TV made it a point to say that Royce Gracie was " undefeated in the Octagon , " which is a way of suggesting that he has never lost a fight without actually saying it , and there 's nothing wrong with that .
That is simple " slight of hand marketing " and is done all the time .
That would n't be all that big of a deal .
It crossed the line into being some of the most blatant false advertising in recent memory when the updated commercials that the UFC ran on Spike TV simply referred to Royce as " the undefeated Royce Gracie . "
Again , one could think that it might be a mistake and not intentional , but it ended up being a conscious effort to deceive people , because Royce Gracie was repeatedly listed as having an " MMA record " of 11 - 0 on the UFC 60 PPV broadcast .
Everyone else on the card had their MMA records listed , but Royce had his UFC record listed , while still having it called his MMA record ( and it was n't even his accurate UFC record ) .
For a large percentage of viewers who are n't knowledgeable enough about the sport to know any better , they probably believed it , and that was the whole point of doing it .
If a certain percentage of the viewing audience does n't know any better , you can often get away with deceiving them .
Zuffa is very much in the business of trying to control the flow of information ( actual Dana
White quote regarding web site traffic in a recent newspaper interview : " Our web site is a real machine for us .
We get a lot of hits .
They can't go anywhere else to read it , so they come to us . " )
Part of the advantage of trying to control the flow of information is that you can often re-write history and get away with it .
Vince McMahon has done it for years in WWE in many different ways , and the UFC has moved closer and closer to McMahon 's less - than - pleasant image by re-writing history in any way that they see fit .
The convenience must be wonderful .
Are you on bad terms with Tito Ortiz for a while ?
Just delete him from the UFC's history , then add him back when he signs another contract with you .
Are you on bad terms with Frank Shamrock ?
Just delete him from the UFC's history , too , and pretend with a straight face at a " Top 10 " ceremony that he 's not one of the top ten fighters in UFC history .
( A couple years later , after he breaks the North American MMA attendance record , keep it on the down - low when you offer him a big - money contract to return to the UFC . )
Is it more convenient for you to lie and say that Royce Gracie is undefeated than it is to display his actual MMA record ?
Just write your own history and declare that his MMA record is now 11 - 0 .
This will make it look like Matt Hughes was the first man to ever beat Royce , even though that 's a complete farce .
The fact of the matter is that in reality , Royce Gracie 's MMA record going into the Hughes fight was 13 - 1 - 3 , and that 's if you do n't count his first fight with Hidehiko Yoshida since it was n't fought under MMA rules ( the rules in that fight limited striking ) , or the so - called loss to Harold Howard in the fight that never happened at UFC 3 .
In addition to his one previous loss , Royce has had three draws in his career , all in bouts where it was agreed before the fight that there would be no judges ' decision if the fight went to the time limit .
Royce fought to a draw with Ken Shamrock way back in 1995 ( which Shamrock would have won if there were judges ) , and he fought to a draw with Yoshida in 2003 ( which Gracie would have won if there judges ) .
Most recently , Gracie fought to a draw ( which could have gone either way if there were judges ) last December in a fight where Gracie weighed - in at 190 pounds and his opponent , Hideo Tokoro , weighed - in at 152 pounds .
Far more significant than the three draws on Gracie 's record is the one previous defeat on his legitimate MMA record of 13 - 1 - 3 going into the Hughes fight .
That one previous loss came against Kazushi Sakuraba in an epic 90 - minute fight , in front of a massive crowd at the Tokyo Dome , in one of the most historically significant MMA matches of all time .
In other words , I 'm pretty sure that it happened and that I did n't imagine it .
Despite this , there were countless TV commercials referring to Royce as " the undefeated Royce Gracie , " and it repeatedly said on the screen during UFC 60 , " MMA Record : 11- 0 . "
Just because the UFC made the choice not to acknowledge Royce 's previous loss in the lead - up to his fight at UFC 60 does not mean that the previous loss does n't exist , especially given that his previous loss took place in one of the most famous MMA matches of all time .
If anyone wants to try to correct me on a technicality by saying , " But his UFC record really was 11 - 0 ! " then that could easily be countered by three points .
One , his previous UFC record was not 11 - 0 ; it was 11 - 0 - 1 . Second , it specifically said during UFC 60 on a repeated basis that 11 - 0 was his " MMA record , " as opposed to his " UFC record . "
Third , with the logic that 11 - 0 really was his UFC record , then why is it that every other fighter in recent UFC history has had their overall MMA record displayed on the screen instead of just their UFC record ?
If you 're only displaying UFC records , should n't Assuerio Silva 's record have been listed as 0 - 1 going into his fight against Mike Swick at UFC 60 ?
While trying to establish the UFC as a real sport , things this like only serve to make Zuffa look bush league , which is the exact opposite of the image that they want to project .
As Dave Meltzer wrote in the Wrestling Observer , " Royce 's history was rewritten to where his most famous matches were suddenly no longer part of his story , and the term ' undefeated ' constantly being used was not just misleading , but outright deceptive ...
As much as the UFC wants to be taken seriously as a real sport , Major League Baseball does n't erase its own history , make up team records or individual player records during the World Series , have commentators change the results of famous games , or claim sell - outs that are n't so .
Even boxing , a sport that the UFC compares itself with and talks about being the more honest version of , does n't do that .
HBO
Boxing does n't pretend fights that did n't air on HBO actually did n't happen .
Even WWE , with its decades long history of dishonesty , does n't even do that anymore .
" What causes the " Royce Gracie is undefeated " lie to make such little sense is that it was completely unnecessary .
Zuffa could have just as easily pushed to new viewers and reinforced to long - time viewers that Royce Gracie is a legend in the sport who changed the entire perception of fighting in the United States , and they could have sold the fight just as well in doing so without lying about his MMA record .
Instead , they lied in order to enhance something that did n't necessarily need to be enhanced .
The same can be said about the so - called " six - figure " contracts that are awarded to the winners of The Ultimate Fighter .
If you say to the average person that you 're making " six figures " in salary from a particular employer , that is widely regarded to mean that you are making in excess of $ 100,000 per year from that employer ( hence the actual phrase " six figures " ... this concept is not rocket science ) .
Zuffa 's use of the phrase " six figures " is misleading and has been since the first season , when it was specifically said by Zuffa ( and reported at the time ) that the TUF winner 's contracts were for three years and $ 350,000 .
In reality , the winner 's contracts for the first three seasons have the following terms .
The TUF winner 's contracts bind the fighter exclusively to the UFC for three years , with three fights per year .
In the first year , the salary for each fight is $ 12,000 to fight and an additional $ 12,000 to win .
Fighting income for the year would range from $ 36,000 to $ 72,000 , depending on wins and losses .
In the second year , it 's $ 16,000 and $ 16,000 per fight , meaning that fighting income for the year would range from $ 48,000 to $ 96,000 .
In the third year , it 's $ 22,000 and $ 22,000 per fight , meaning that fighting income for the year would range from $ 66,000 to $ 122,000 .
That is actually a six - figure income in one year out of three , or zero years out of three , depending on wins and losses .
Total fighting income paid to the fighter by Zuffa over the course of the three - year contract would range from $ 150,000 to $ 300,000 , depending on wins and losses , and would only hit the $ 300,000 mark if the fighter went 9 - 0 in his first nine UFC fights .
The UFC could just as easily say that the winners of TUF get " UFC contracts " or even " big UFC contracts , " and they would still have an attractive prize for TUF .
There is no need to be so misleading about the terms of the deal .
This is straight out of the WWE playbook , where there was a so - called " Million Dollar Tough Enough competition " that was won by MMA fighter Daniel Puder , and the reality of the contract was actually , " It 's four years at $ 250,000 per year , and only the first year is guaranteed , and you 're very likely to be released after one year .
" One area in which Zuffa may have actually topped McMahon on the classless scale is in the percentage of revenue that goes to the talent , which I have written about extensively in the past and once again this past week with a series of articles looking at the UFC's PPV sales , live gate revenue , and fighter salaries .
One example from earlier this year is that UFC 59 generated a total of over $ 18 million in gross revenue , and yet there were still six different fighters on the UFC 59 card who made $ 5,000 or less ( which is less than the cost of a 60 - second commercial on The Ultimate Fighter ) .
The top fighters are now making more money due to the huge explosion in revenue that started in early 2005 .
However , the UFC fighters who fill out the prelims and even the main cards are still getting paychecks that should be embarrassing for any self - respecting businessman to be paying fighters , given the company 's huge revenue streams and its desire to be seen as a major - league sport .
Even if it 's basic capitalism to pay as little as possible , the UFC 's pay scale is not doing the company any favors if Zuffa wants the UFC to be seen as a major - league sport , as opposed to a bush - league sport whose athletes have to get side jobs to support themselves , or a sport like boxing with a trashy mainstream media image .
When it comes to talking to mainstream media reporters , lying is the norm rather than the exception for Zuffa , and there is a mountain of evidence to back up that assertion .
Again , on the issue of re-writing history , what do you do if you 're Zuffa and you want to inflate your place in the history of the sport ?
Just tell mainstream media reporters who do n't know any better that it was only since 2001 , when Zuffa started running things , that the UFC added things like weight classes ( actually 1997 ) , multiple judges scoring a fight if it goes the distance ( 1995 ) , doctors at ringside ( 1993 ) , medical exams of fighters ( 1993 ) , time limits ( 1995 ) , gloves ( 1995 ) , multiple timed rounds ( 1999 ) , the banning of groin strikes ( 1994 ) , the ability of the referee to stop the fight ( 1994 ) , and whatever else you can get them to believe .
The mainstream media reporters wo n't bother to do five minutes of research to correct you , and it'll seem like you took the sport directly from a no-rules street fighting contest into a civilized affair !
You wo n't be directly quoted , but the same series of lies will just happen to appear in most mainstream media articles about the UFC in which you 're quoted talking about other things .
You want examples ?
There are literally far too many to list , so let 's focus on some of the more recent and high - profile examples .
In the high - profile trade journal MultiChannel News in June , the author of an article about the UFC happened to write this immediately after quoting Dana White about something else : " Once Zuffa purchased the franchise from [ Bob ] Meyrowitz , it immediately imposed rules to make the sport more appealing to state athletic commissions and cable operators .
The sport has outlawed such moves as eye gouging , biting and kicks to the crotch .
Much like boxing , the UFC emphasized weight classes and allowed referees to stop matches at their discretion .
In 2001 , Zuffa was able to convince boxing - friendly athletic associations in New Jersey and Nevada to sanction UFC fights .
" Besides the usual lies about when various rules were implemented ( seriously , eye gouging and biting ? ) , the MultiChannel News article also repeated Zuffa 's oft - mentioned claim that it got the UFC sanctioned in both Nevada and New Jersey .
In reality , before Zuffa ever bought the UFC , it was sanctioned and regulated by the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board , which was widely regarded as the second most important sanctioning body in the country .
The " old UFC " also ran fully sanctioned UFC events in states such as Iowa , Louisiana , and Mississippi , but it was New Jersey that was regarded as having the second - biggest sanctioning body ( behind only Nevada 's ) in terms of importance and prestige .
In addition to getting fully sanctioned in New Jersey , the previous owners of the UFC also made an unsuccessful attempt to get sanctioned in Nevada shortly before selling the UFC to Zuffa for $ 2 million , which means that it 's complete BS whenever you read that the previous owners " ran from regulation " or " ran from sanctioning .
"
There was a flood of poorly - researched hack - jobs about Zuffa 's history in early July , which coincided with a flood of Dana White interviews in mainstream newspapers , and this kicked off with an article in the Las Vegas Review - Journal .
The article repeatedly misspelled the name of former UFC president Bob Meyrowitz , which shows how much research was done for the article , and the author of the article wrote that Meyrowitz " kept conducting UFC cards in states without athletic commissions that would not regulate it , which only fueled the sport 's outlaw reputation and further angered McCain .
" Immediately before that point in the article , Dana White is quoted as saying , " I could see that if this was done the right way , if someone did n't run away from regulation but embraced it , if someone cleaned it up and shined it a little , this thing could be huge . "
Shortly after the line about Meyrowitz and his non-existent rebel UFC events in states that specifically banned MMA , White is quoted again , this time saying , " We all felt if we made some changes and embraced regulation , this had the potential to just go crazy .
" Again , that is re-writing history at best , and lying through your teeth at worst .
The previous owners did not " run away from regulation . "
They sought sanctioning and actually got it in New Jersey , and then shortly before selling the UFC to Zuffa , the previous owners tried unsuccessfully to get it sanctioned in Nevada .
The article in the Las Vegas Review - Journal added the following , just in case any knowledgeable readers were still wondering if the article was a hack - job : " White traveled the country like a carnival barker ...
It was n't long before New Jersey and Nevada approved the UFC and agreed to allow mixed martial arts fights , leading to nearly every major boxing state approving it .
" Even the Washington Post , which normally does a good job with basic fact - checking , fell for this line of BS in a July 8th article that also happened to quote Dana White about Zuffa 's purchase of the UFC in 2001 .
The author of the article wrote , " UFC President Dana White and Zuffa LLC took over in 2001 and since then the UFC has tightened its rules and restrictions .
It banned elbowing , head - butting and knee strikes to the head while on the ground , introduced weight classes and implemented various other protections , such as referee training , and mandatory fight doctors . "
We 've already gone over the timeline of when those things were actually implemented ( much earlier than 2001 ) .
Several days after the Washington Post story was published , a much longer article ( which also quoted Dana White about Zuffa 's purchase of the UFC ) appeared in the Boston Globe , and it repeated an even more brazen set of lies .
The author of the Globe article actually wrote that Zuffa " resurrected UFC from the scrap heap of bad marketing and no-holds - barred mayhem when they bought the company name from Bob Meyrowitz for around $ 160,000 .
At the time ultimate fighting had a sullied reputation .
No state would sanction its bouts because it had no rules and boasted of its refusal to cooperate with state regulatory bodies .
" Zuffa bought the UFC for $ 160,000 ?
No state would sanction UFC bouts in 2001 ?
The UFC had no rules in 2001 ?
The previous owners boasted of their refusal to cooperate with state regulatory bodies ?
I think the Boston Globe may have set a new record for " most factually incorrect information ever fit into a few sentences , " but it fits right in with the kinds of things that Zuffa would like everyone to believe .
But wait , the Boston Globe did n't also repeat the lies about Zuffa creating all of the rules , right ?
No , they did that , too : " By 1997 , no - holds - barred events had been relegated to smoke - filled rooms in unregulated states ... but by using Lorenzo Fertitta ’s connections as a former Nevada boxing commissioner , doors began to open within the regulatory community when UFC came up with a set of rules .
Where once anything was allowed , turning events into bloody barroom brawls without the cocktail glasses , [ Dana ]
White and his associates added strict adherence to such things as weight classes , five - minute rounds , judges , and mandatory drug testing ... [ Zuffa ] embraced regulatory bodies in states such as Nevada , New Jersey , and California , which had refused to acknowledge UFC .
" The Wrestling Observer responded to the Boston Globe story by writing , " The story features the same b.s. about how in 2001 , no state would sanction MMA when Bob Meyrowitz owned it and how the old UFC refused to cooperate with state athletic commissions .
The truth is the exact opposite ...
Yes , another story about how the new owners added rules , and embraced regulation .
It ’s almost sickening how much this crap gets propagated and nobody does one iota of research to see how bogus it is .
" Regarding one specific similarity to Vince McMahon 's similar pattern of propaganda , Meltzer wrote , " Old - time wrestling fans will love this one .
The old UFC was held in ' smoke - filled rooms in unregulated states ' [ according to the Boston Globe article ] .
That was the old Vince McMahon line about taking pro wrestling out of smoke filled arenas ... what took both out of smoke - filled arenas was the creation of indoor smoking laws , not promoters .
" One interesting side note to the Boston Globe article is that White also acknowledged in the article , " If there was no Web when we started , we would n't have been able to sustain it .
UFC stayed alive on the Web . Our [ demographic ] could never have found out about us without it because the mainstream media was ignoring us . "
So , just to clarify , it 's not what White is n't aware that the Internet kept the UFC alive for a time .
He 's fully aware of that ; it 's just not going to stop him from trying to control the flow of information and crack down on any form of independent , MMA - dedicated media .
In the biggest coup of all from a spreading of misinformation standpoint , an Associated Press reporter bit on the BS - bearing hook and included the same kind of factually incorrect in an AP news story about the UFC .
As an AP article , it appeared in the majority of major ( and minor ) newspapers across the United States , as well as huge web sites throughout the world , including ESPN.com .
The story claimed that when Zuffa bought the UFC and got it sanctioned in Nevada in 2001 , " Out went bloody head butts and other vicious blows that could cause serious harm .
In came a skilled and conditioned fighter .
" With the exception of the lie about the previous owners " running from sanctioning , " White is usually bright enough to not actually be quoted on the record repeating these lies .
They just happen to show up in every mainstream article that quotes him talking about other topics .
But in a very brazen example just this week on ESPNews '
The Hot List ,
White flat - out lied , on the record , for everyone to see on national television .
On The Hot List ,
White said that the UFC " was n't sanctioned by any of the major athletic commissions " before Zuffa bought it .
This is not a matter for debate .
It 's just flat - out factually incorrect , as I 've already detailed in this article .
Dana
White also said on The Hot List , " When we first bought the sport , not only was it not in any of the major venues here in the United States , but it also was n't on pay - per-view .
We were on DirecTV , but we were n't on any of the cable pay - per - view systems . "
While I was n't aware that Zuffa " bought the sport , " White 's statement about the PPV situation is absolutely correct .
However , his statement about major venues is once again factually incorrect , unless the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City is not considered a " major venue .
" White knew better than to repeat the lies about Zuffa adding all of the rules on national television .
Interestingly , Dave Meltzer noted in the Observer several months back that when longtime Observer subscriber Dave Doyle ( who writes about MMA for Fox ) was talking to White for an interview , White dropped any signs of trying to pretend that Zuffa added most of the UFC 's rules ... as soon as it became clear in the conversation that Doyle was a longtime MMA fan who knew the history of the sport and would be able to tell the difference between reality and BS ( as opposed to mainstream media reporters who know nothing about MMA and will repeat anything that you tell them because they do n't know any better and generally wo n't bother to do five minutes of research ) .
Regarding the specific line that the previous owners of the UFC " ran from sanctioning , " which is one line that Dana White does not have a problem giving on - the - record in any mainstream media interview , the previous owners did not " run from sanctioning , " and Zuffa knows that based on the circumstances of how Zuffa bought the UFC .
In fact , one of the last things that the previous owners did before selling the UFC to Zuffa was to try unsuccessfully to get the UFC sanctioned in Nevada .
Here 's the actual story about how SEG came to sell the UFC to Zuffa , gathered from multiple issues of the Wrestling Observer , with edits made in brackets to fill in context or correct grammar , and with a timeline clarification courtesy of Whaledog.com : " Meyrowitz [ former UFC president Bob Meyrowitz ] would go to InDemand [ the PPV company ] and ask what he needed to do to get back on InDemand , and they said the UFC needed to get sanctioned [ by a major sanctioning body ] .
He got sanctioned in New Jersey , and was basically told that he needed to get it sanctioned in Nevada , as that was the most influential athletic commission in the country .
[ Meyrowitz ] set up a meeting in Las Vegas , and at the time , sanctioning was going to happen based on what inside sources were telling both Meyrowitz and InDemand .
Suddenly , the night before the approval that was going to be the step to put the UFC back on the map , Meyrowitz was told that he was going to be voted down [ the next day , when his request was scheduled to be voted on by the members of the Nevada State Athletic Commission ] .
He did n't have the votes .
He was also told that if he followed through the next day , and was voted down , he would never have an opportunity to be sanctioned .
So , he pulled out , they created some cover reason as to why he was pulling his attempt at sanctioning , and basically he was screwed .
Lorenzo Fertitta [ the current co-owner of the UFC ] was an influential member of the Nevada commission at the time .
[ Approximately one year later ] , Fertitta purchased the UFC [ for $ 2 million ] , then got sanctioning in Nevada , and then got on PPV .
" There are dozens and dozens more examples of mainstream articles that quote Dana White as part of the article , and also just happen to keep giving Zuffa far more credit than is deserved for adding all of the rules , along with repeating the same set of lies about the previous owners of the UFC .
This particular set of deceptions and distortions , constantly repeated to mainstream media members who print them without knowing any better , is also completely unnecessary .
Zuffa legitimately did a lot of great things for the sport in the aforementioned time period ( and also has in the years since then ) , such as getting sanctioning in Nevada , unifying the rules between Nevada and the pre-existing New Jersey sanctioning , and getting back on cable PPV , so there 's no need to lie about it .
The truth is flattering enough .
There 's no valid reason for continuing to propagate these lies , and yet it keeps happening .
It should also be troubling to any hardcore fan of MMA that the direction of the UFC is becoming increasingly similar to pro wrestling .
Keep in mind , this is coming from someone who is actually a fan of pro wrestling , butalso wants MMA to be more of a " real sport " than what it is becoming .
This trend towards a pro wrestling - like product should be a lot more upsetting to you if happen to be one of the many MMA fans who dislike pro wrestling .
It 's also important to note that I still find the UFC product to be enjoyable even in its current form , and there are still a decent amount of quality fights to be found in the UFC .
There 's just nowhere near as many as there would be if the current UFC product actually had anything to do with determining who the best fighters are ( you know , like how every season of the NFL determines who the best football team is , and every season of the NBA determines who the best basketball team is ) .
I have written previously about the worked pull - aparts between Tito Ortiz and Ken Shamrock on The Ultimate Fighter 3 , and have explained exactly what I mean by the phrase " worked pull - aparts . "
Ken Shamrock was even kind enough to add more pro wrestling terminology into the hype during the ridiculous Episode 12 pull - apart .
An interesting note to add on that front is that when TUF 3 contestant Tait Fletcher was asked in an interview with Jason Milloff about the interaction between Ortiz and Shamrock , Fletcher said , " It was a joke .
It was comedy .
Again , you could probably see me laughing ... when Ken goes off into his pro wrestling / WWE mode , does he really expect anyone to take him seriously ?
That ’s kind of hard to do .
" But I 'm not just talking about the worked pull - aparts and other nonsense such as having a fighter on TUF 3 who has a losing record in MMA .
I 'm also talking about the fact that it is now considered commonplace for the UFC to book squash matches in PPV main events just to elevate someone or pop a PPV buyrate .
Make no mistake about it , Pride does this all the time as well .
The difference is that Pride has been , from its very inception , rooted in the tradition of pro wrestling , since it was originally born out of the UWFI , a " strong - style pro wrestling " company .
On the other hand , the UFC has always vehemently claimed to be above this kind of thing , and has always balked at any pro wrestling comparisons , actually going so far as to deny the viewership crossover between UFC programming and pro wrestling on Spike TV ( even when overwhelming evidence shows that the two audiences are , in large part , the same people ) .
There 's a name for something where you match people against each other to draw money and you know the outcome ahead of time .
It 's called pro wrestling .
The only difference between pro wrestling and the UFC in this particular area is that the match outcomes themselves are pre-determined in pro wrestling , whereas the best they can possibly do in the UFC is to manipulate the matchmaking in order to create main event fights where they can have 90 % or higher certainty that a particular fighter is going to win .
( Think Matt Hughes vs. Royce Gracie , or Tito Ortiz vs. Ken Shamrock , which was indeed the " main event " of UFC 61 since it was given the vast majority of the hype going into the event . )
Bruce Mitchell recently wrote a column in the Pro Wrestling Torch about the UFC 's trend to be more like pro wrestling , focusing specifically on TUF 3 .
This is just an excerpt from a much larger column : " Years ago , fans thought WWF wrestling was real conflict .
Today they do n't .
They still buy tickets based on how the McMahon family manipulates the circumstances around the fighters to get the fans excited enough to buy things ...
Dana
White does the same thing that Vince McMahon and [ TNA booker ] Jeff Jarrett do .
Do you think he chose Tito Ortiz or Ken Shamrock as coaches for Ultimate Fighter because they were the best instructors he could find to teach apprentice fighters , or because their hatred for each other makes good TV ?
Do you think UFC chose those apprentices solely based on their potential as fighters , like that 33 year old big mouth , or because they 'd make good TV personalities ?
Do you think he 's promoting Ortiz vs.
Shamrock as a big time main event because they 're the two best fighters in the Octagon , or is it because they 're two marketable personalities who know how to present themselves and their enmity in charismatic ways ?
Hell , Shamrock is 42 years old and has n't won a big match in years .
" The UFC 's pro wrestling - like direction goes further than the Ortiz - Shamrock dynamic that Mitchell wrote about .
For every PPV main event on the UFC 's 2006 schedule that is legitimately a championship - level fight , featuring one fighter who is a champion against another fighter who deserves a title shot ( like Matt Hughes vs. Georges St. Pierre , Chuck Liddell vs. Renato Sobral , and hopefully Liddell vs. Wanderlei Silva ) , there 's another PPV main event on the schedule that exists for the sole purpose of drawing money and / or elevating someone with a huge mismatch ( like Hughes vs. Gracie , or Ortiz vs. Shamrock ) .
Of course , the actual fights are not fixed , and I am not suggesting for a second that they are .
Zuffa can never know for sure if the fighter who they expect to win is going to win .
Three examples : Rich Franklin still had to go out there and actually win the fight against Ken Shamrock , but the fight was a mismatch that was ultimately booked to draw money and give Franklin a big win over a big name .
The same statement applies to Hughes vs. Gracie ( White even said before UFC 60 in a media conference call that he would be " pretty screwed " if Gracie won ) , and it also applies to Ortiz vs.
Shamrock , which was always regarded as a fight that was overwhelmingly likely to give Ortiz a big win over a big name before his tentatively planned Light Heavyweight title shot .
It 's generally not a good sign if you paid $ 40 for a PPV main event ( like Hughes vs. Gracie ) and it would be completely accurate for you to think , " That fight was booked specifically for Fighter A to destroy Fighter B , and everyone involved knew that it was overwhelmingly likely to happen , and that is exactly what did happen , and now Fighter A's standing in the sport has been elevated , and that 's why exactly the fight was booked in the first place . "
That 's how pro wrestling is booked , with the only difference being that the promoters can be 100 percent certain of the results in pro wrestling , while MMA promoters can only be 90 + percent certain with mismatched shoot fights .
One product is a work and the other is a shoot , but they are becoming increasingly similar .
When Vince McMahon recently said in a MultiChannel News article that the people at Zuffa " do n't quite know what they 're doing in terms of building characters , " the author of the article asked Dana White about the subject of bringing new stars into the UFC .
The author of the article then wrote , " White said UFC 's momentum wo n't be pinned down by a lack of star power anytime soon .
He added the Ultimate Fighter reality series will continue to unveil up and coming superstars , whose careers fans will be able to track through its live events .
"
In other words , the new stars in the UFC 's future will not be the top free agents from around the world .
Sure , some of them will be , and there will also be inter-promotional deals like the one with Pride to bring in Wanderlei Silva for what White described as " probably " a three - fight deal at the UFC 61 post - fight press conference .
But with the exception of a few cases like this , the " new stars " in the UFC 's future will primarily be TUF contestants .
There would n't necessarily be anything wrong with that if TUF really was an outlet for the top up - and - coming MMA fighters in the world to get a shot in the UFC , but that is not the case .
If you look at the fighters who were on the second and third seasons of TUF , the amount of people who had no business being on the show given their lack of MMA experience was actually larger than the amount of people who could be accurately described as " up - and - coming MMA fighters .
"
On the upcoming fourth season , there will be 16 former UFC fighters , exactly two of whom have winning records in the UFC .
Far from being " former top fighters who just got off - track , " which is how this season of TUF is being sold by the UFC , the combined UFC record of the eight welterweights on the fourth season of TUF is 16 wins and 17 losses .
The combined UFC record of the middleweights on TUF 4 is four wins and 15 losses ( total combined UFC record for both weight classes : 20 - 32 ) .
Regarding the UFC 's trend towards a pro wrestling - like product , the UFC's own Heavyweight Champion , Tim Sylvia , said this in a Las Vegas Review - Journal article about UFC 61 : " The only reason he [ Ken Shamrock ] is fighting is because he's got a mouth and he likes to do that wrestling [ talk ] , that WWE stuff . "
Sylvia added , " We do n't need that .
We are world - class athletes , and we need to let our talents make the case for us .
People who really know the sport know that , but we 're still growing , and we need to represent ourselves a certain way .
"
In response to that statement by Sylvia , Jeff Thaler wrote the following on Whaledog.com : " Sylvia raises a good point , but the reason Shamrock is headlining [ UFC 61 ] is easy to explain .
The UFC likes Ken Shamrock because it promotes itself more like a professional wrestling promotion than a sport - promoting its brand first , its president second , and actual athletes last .
Manufactured hype is more important to Zuffa than the quality of athletes or fights .
" As Dave Meltzer recently wrote in the Wrestling Observer , " The UFC ... would rather try to create their own stars [ on The Ultimate Fighter ] than pay huge money for people they do n't believe have name recognition past the Internet crowd .
The truth is , the UFC has never been , at any point in its existence , about trying to find out who the best fighters in the world are .
" I can't call that an inaccurate statement , but is n't " finding out who the best are " supposed to be what a real sport is all about when it comes down to it ?
If there 's a situation such as the 2005 NBA Playoffs where the two teams meeting in the NBA Finals are viewed as being an undesirable TV ratings match - up , the NBA does n't decide to put Kobe Bryant and the Lakers in the Finals .
The top two teams play , regardless of whether it 's going to draw the biggest business .
It 's a real sport , and that 's how it works .
Similarly , if two of the smallest - market teams in the NFL make it to the Super Bowl next season , the NFL is not going to decide to bump one of them for the star power of Peyton Manning and the Colts .
The emphasis in the UFC is not on who the best fighters are .
Who cares about that , right ?
( Apparently not Dana
White , who recently said in an interview that he does n't know too much about Fedor Emelianenko , who is almost universally regarded as the most dominant MMA fighter in the world . )
The emphasis is purely on who can draw money , and who can be elevated by a fight in order to draw money in subsequent fights .
It does n't have to be that one - sided , nor does it have to be completely in the opposite direction .
It 's actually quite possible for the UFC to have entertaining fighters and entertaining fights , while still ultimately trying to match up the best fighters .
The proposed Liddell - Silva fight is an excellent example , but that kind of thing is the exception rather than the norm in today 's UFC .
Just looking at the UFC 60 card , the same card that was headlined by the Hughes - Gracie farce , one can clearly see that it 's possible for certain fights to deliver on both sides of this coin , and there 's no reason that the main events can't do this more often as well .
Looking at the UFC 60 card , you 've got the Hughes - Gracie squash match , where Zuffa got the exact result that it expected , not unlike a lamb being led to slaughter ( which is sad , given all that Royce Gracie has done for the sport of MMA ) .
On the other hand , just look at the Mike Swick and Brandon Vera fights ( Swick fought Hoe Riggs , and Vera fought Assuerio Silva ) .
Swick and Vera are generally entertaining , charismatic fighters .
Sure , Zuffa probably hoped that Swick and Vera would each win their respective fights because they are both potential future stars , but were Swick and Vera given opponents that were almost certain to result in easy victories for them ?
No , they were n't .
Swick and Vera were matched up against Joe Riggs and Assuerio Silva , respectively .
Riggs and Silva are tough opponents , and either of them could very well have beaten Swick or Vera .
In the end , Swick and Vera won fights against tough opposition , and they earned the boost in stature that they got from doing so .
This is the kind of balance that Zuffa should be trying to have in more of its main events as well .
For the PPV main events in particular , is it really too much to ask when you 're paying $ 40 to have one fighter who is a champion going up against another fighter who deserves a title shot ?
I'm not suggesting that the UFC should be completely antiseptic or sterile , but it would be nice if the UFC resembled a " real sport " more than it resembled a shoot form of pro wrestling .

MALMO , SWEDEN —
At some point , the shouts of Heil Hitler that often greeted Marcus Eilenberg as he walked to the 107 - year - old Moorish - style synagogue in this port city forced the 32 - year - old attorney to make a difficult , life - changing decision : Fearing for his familys safety after repeated anti-Semitic incidents , Eilenberg reluctantly uprooted himself and his wife and two children , and moved to Israel in May .
Sweden , a country long regarded as a model of tolerance , has , ironically , been a refuge for Eilenbergs family .
His paternal grandparents found a home in Malmo in 1945 after surviving the Holocaust .
His wifes parents came to Malmo from Poland in 1968 after the communist government there launched an anti-Semitic purge .
But as in many other cities across Europe , a rapidly growing Muslim population living in segregated conditions that seem to breed alienation has mixed toxically with the anger directed at Israeli policies and actions by those Muslims — and by many non-Muslims — to all but transform the lives of local Jews .
Like many of their counterparts in other European cities , the Jews of Malmo report being subjected increasingly to threats , intimidation and actual violence as stand - ins for Israel .
I didnt want my small children to grow up in this environment , Eilenberg said in a phone interview just before leaving Malmo .
It wouldnt be fair to them to stay in Malmo .
Malmo , Swedens third - largest city , with a population of roughly 293,900 but only 760 Jews , reached a turning point of sorts in January 2009 , during Israels military campaign in Gaza .
A small , mostly Jewish group held a demonstration that was billed as a peace rally but seen as a sign of support for Israel .
This peaceful demonstration was cut short when the demonstrators were attacked by a much larger screaming mob of Muslims and Swedish leftists who threw bottles and firecrackers at them as police seemed unable to stop the mounting mayhem .
I was very scared and upset at the same time , recalled Jehoshua Kaufman , a Jewish community leader .
Scared because there were a lot of angry people facing us , shouting insults and throwing bottles and firecrackers at the same time .
The sound was very loud .
And I was angry because we really wanted to go through with this demonstration , and we werent allowed to finish it .
Alan Widman , who is a strapping 6 - foot - tall member of parliament and a non-Jewish member of the Liberal Party who represents Malmo , said simply , I have never been so afraid in my life .
The demonstrators were eventually evacuated by the police , who were not present in sufficient numbers to protect their rally .
But some participants complained that the polices crowd - control dogs remained muzzled .
The Eilenbergs are not particularly religious , but they have a strong Jewish identity and felt unable to live in Malmo as Jews after this episode .
Eilenberg said he knows at least 15 other Jewish families that are thinking about moving away .
Anti-Semitism in Europe has historically been associated with the far right , but the Jews interviewed for this article say that the threat in Sweden now comes from Muslims and from changing attitudes about Jews in the wider society .
Saeed Azams , Malmos chief imam , who represents most of the citys Muslims , is quick to disavow and condemn violence against Malmos Jews .
Recently , he , along with Jewish leaders , have been participating in a dialogue group organized by city officials that seeks to address the issue .
But Azams also downplayed the seriousness of the problem , saying there were not more than 100 people , most under 18 years old , who engage in violence and belong to street gangs .
There are some things I cant control , he said .
There are an estimated 45,000 Muslims in Malmo , or 15 % of the citys population .
Many of them are Palestinians , Iraqis and Somalis , or come from the former Yugoslavia .
But the problem is not just Muslims , and not just Malmos .
A European Problem
A continentwide study , conducted by the Institute for Interdisciplinary Research on Conflict and Violence at the University of Bielefeld in Germany , released in December 2009 , found that that 45.7 % of the Europeans surveyed agree somewhat or strongly with the following statement : Israel is conducting a war of extermination against the Palestinians .
And 37.4 % agreed with this statement : Considering Israels policy , I can understand why people do not like Jews .
[ There is ] quite a high level of anti-Semitism that is hidden beneath critics of Israels policies , said Beate Kupper , one of the studys principal researchers , in a telephone interview with the Forward , citing this data and a tendency to blame Jews in general for Israels policies .
Kupper said that in places where there is a strong taboo against expressions of anti-Semitism , such as Germany , Criticism of Israel is a great way to express your anti-Semitism in an indirect way .
According to Bassam Tibi , professor emeritus of international relations at the University of Goettingen in Germany , and author of several books on the growth of Islam in Europe , Muslims form a significant subset of this problem .
The growth of the Muslim diaspora in Europe is affecting the Jews , Tibi said .
Among some Muslim populations in Europe — though not all — every Jew is seen as responsible for what Israel is doing and can be a target .
In Malmo , this populations role in the problem is seen as significant .
Most of Malmos Muslims live in Rosengard , the eastern part of this de facto segregated city , where the jobless rate is 80 % .
Satellite dishes dot the high - rise apartments to receive programming from Al - Jazeera and other Arabic - language cable networks that keep Malmos Muslims in constant touch with the latest Arab - Israeli developments .
Sylvia Morfradakis , a European Union official who works with the chronically unemployed , those who have been without work for 10 to 15 years , said that the main reason that 80 % to 90 % of Muslims between the ages of 18 and 34 cant find jobs is that they cant speak Swedish .
Swedish employers insist workers know Swedish well , even for the most menial jobs , Morfradakis said .
She added ,
The social welfare concept for helping without end does not give people the incentive to do something to make life better .
But Per Gudmundson , chief editorial writer for Svenska Dagbladet , a leading Swedish newspaper , is critical of politicians who blame anti-Semitic actions on Muslim living conditions .
He said that these politicians offer weak excuses for Muslim teenagers accused of anti-Semitic crimes .
Politicians say these kids are poor and oppressed , and we have made them hate .
They are , in effect , saying the behavior of these kids is in some way our fault , he said .
According to Gudmundson , some immigrants from Muslim countries come to Sweden as hardened anti-Semites .
The plight of the Jews worries Annelie Enochson , a Christian Democrat member of the Swedish Parliament .
If the Jews feel threatened in Sweden , then I am very frightened about the future of my country , she said in an interview with the Forward .
A Chabad rabbis experience
Because he is the most visible Jew in Malmo , with his black fedora , tzitzit and long beard , Malmos only rabbi , Shneur Kesselman , 31 , is a prime target for Muslim anti-Jewish sentiment .
The Orthodox Chabad rabbi said that during his six years in the city , he has been the victim of more than 50 anti-Semitic incidents .
An American , Kesselman is a soft spoken man with a steely determination to stay in Malmo despite the danger .
Two members of the American Embassy in Stockholm visited him in April to discuss his safety .
From Keselmans account , they had good reason to worry .
The rabbi recalled the day he was crossing a street near his house with his wife when a car suddenly went into reverse and sped backward toward them .
They dodged the vehicle and barely made it to the other side of the street .
My wife was screaming , the rabbi said .
It was a traumatic event .
Local newspapers report that the number of anti-Semitic incidents in Malmo doubled in 2009 from 2008 , though police could not confirm this .
Meanwhile , Fredrik Sieradzki , spokesman for the Malmo Jewish community , estimates that the already small Jewish population is shrinking by 5 % a year .
Malmo is a place to move away from , he said , citing anti-Semitism as the primary reason .
The community was twice as large two decades ago .
The synagogue on Foreningsgatan , a fashionable street , has elaborate security .
Reflecting the level of fear , the buildings glass is not just bullet - proof , Jewish communal officials say ; its rocket - proof .
Guards check strangers seeking to enter the synagogue .
Some Jewish parents try to protect their children by moving to neighborhoods where there are fewer Muslims in the schools so that confrontations will be minimized .
Six Jewish teenagers interviewed recounted anti-Semitic abuse from Muslim classmates .
According to their families , though the incidents were reported to the authorities , none of the perpetrators was arrested , much less punished .
One victim was Jonathan Tsubarah , 19 , the son of an Israeli Jew who settled in Sweden .
As he strolled through the citys cobble - stoned Gustav Adolph Square on August 21 , 2009 , three young men — a Palestinian and two Somalis — stopped him and asked where he was from , he recalled .
Im from Israel , Tsubarah responded .
Im from Palestine , one assailant retorted , and I will kill you .
The three beat him to the ground and kicked him in the back , Tsubarah said .
Kill the Jew , they shouted .
Now are you proud to be a Jew ?
No I am not , the slightly built teenager replied .
He said he did this just to get them to stop kicking him .
Tsubarah plans to go to Israel and join the army .
Weak government response
Many Jews fault Swedish police for not cracking down on anti-Semitism .
Most hate crimes in Malmo are acts of vandalism , said Susanne Gosenius , head of the newly created hate crime unit of the Malmo Police Department
These include painted swastikas on buildings .
According to Gosenius , police do not give priority to this type of crime .
Its very rare that police find the perpetrators , she said .
Swedes dont understand why swastikas are bad and how they offend Jews .
According to Gosenius , 30 % of the hate crimes in the Malmo region are anti-Semitic .
Members of Parliament have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved , and the rhetoric was often anti-Semitic — not just anti-Israel .
But such public rhetoric is not branded hateful and denounced , said Henrik Bachner , a writer and professor of history at the University of Lund , near Malmo .
Sweden is a microcosm of contemporary anti-Semitism , said Charles Small , director of the Yale University Initiative for the Study of Anti-Semitism .
Its a form of acquiescence to radical Islam , which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for .
A dialogue initiative
The situation has generated some points of potential light .
Recently , Ilmar Reepalu , the mayor of Malmo , convened a dialogue forum that includes leaders of the Jewish and Muslim communities , as well as city officials , to improve social relations in the city and the city governments response to conflicts .
During an interview in his office , Imam Saeed Azams said it was wrong to blame Swedish Jews for Israels actions .
The wheelchair - bound Azams stressed the importance of teaching young Muslims to stop equating the Jews of Malmo with Israel .
But this seemed to include an assumption that Jews , in turn , should not permit themselves to be seen as pro-Israel .
Because Jewish society in Sweden does not condemn the clearly illegal actions of Israel , he said , then ordinary people think the Jews here are allied to Israel , but this is not true .
The imam is an advocate of dialogue with Jewish leaders , and welcomed the creation of the dialogue forum .
Reepalu , Malmos mayor , has appointed Bjorn Lagerback , a psychologist , to take charge of the newly formed forum .
And Sieradzki , the Jewish community leader , was optimistic about its prospects to eventually improve relations .
Reepalu created the forum in the wake of last years violence against the Jewish demonstrators and his own controversial remarks that angered Jews .
Saying that he condemned both Zionism and anti-Semitism , Reepalu criticized Malmo Jews for not taking a stand against Israels invasion of Gaza .
Instead , he said , they chose to arrange a demonstration in the center of Malmo , a demonstration that people could misinterpret .
Interviewed at Malmos city hall , Lagerback acknowledged an awful situation in Rosengard , where fire trucks and ambulances are often stoned by angry Muslim youth when the emergency vehicles go there .
But like the imam , he hastened to add that those engaging in violence were a small number of young people .
He attributed such behavior to living conditions of poverty , overcrowding and unemployment , as well as to cultural differences .
Swedish experts agree that integration of Muslims into Swedish society has failed , and this undermines the development of a more diverse society .
Many pupils in heavily Muslim schools reject the authority of female teachers .
We are Swedish but second - or third - class citizens , said Mohammed Abnalheja , vice president of the Palestinian Home Association in Malmo .
The organization teaches children of Palestinian descent about their bond to a Palestinian homeland .
We have a right to our country , Palestine , he said .
Palestine is now occupied by Zionists .
Abnalheja was born to Palestinian parents in Baghdad and came to Malmo with his parents in 1996 .
He has never been to the place he calls Palestine .
Meanwhile , 86 - year - old Judith Popinski says she is no longer invited to schools that have a large Muslim presence to tell her story of surviving the Holocaust .
Popinski found refuge in Malmo in 1945 .
Until recently , she told her story in Malmo schools as part of their Holocaust studies program .
Now , some schools no longer ask Holocaust survivors to tell their stories , because Muslim students treat them with such disrespect , either ignoring the speakers or walking out of the class .
Malmo reminds me of the anti-Semitism I felt as a child in Poland before the war , she told the Forward while sitting in her living room , which is adorned with Persian rugs and many paintings .
I am not safe as a Jew in Sweden anymore , a trembling Popinski said in a frail voice .
But unlike others , she intends to stay in Sweden .
I will not be a victim again , she said .

There is a huge disturbance in the Force , at least as sensed by the Jedi of FireDogLake , Democratic Underground , AMERICAblog , and OpenLeft , which is to say among the Obama - skeptics of the Left .
The substance is this , in a last minute move prior to adjournment Nancy Pelosi pushed through the rule for handling the recommendations of the Obama Deficit Commission , and on the surface they mirror that of Cooper - Wolff or its Senate counterpart Conrad - Gregg , that any recommendations coming out of the Deficit Commission has to be voted up or down without amendments .
The actual language is here :
“ Commits the House to vote on any Senate - passed recommendations of the bipartisan Fiscal Commission and that net savings from any Commission recommendations will go to deficit reduction . ”
Meaning on the FDL reading that any Commission proposal focusing heavily on Social Security benefit cuts can simply sail through with Republican and Blue Dog support .
Simple sell - out right ?
Well maybe .
But whatever the intent of the players , including Pelosi , the effect might be much different .
Because despite strong and deliberate similarities the Obama Deficit Commission is NOT the same as either Cooper - Wolff or Conrad - Gregg .
Argument below the fold .
The entire Peter G Peterson backed argument as manifested in both Cooper - Wolff and Conrad - Gregg is that the major threat to the economy going forward is long - term deficits , that the major cause of those deficits are projected to be entitlements , and that the only solution is major cuts to those benefits .
In this vision the disease and the medicine are determined beforehand and the whole purpose of the Commissions is to give bi-partisan cover backed up by a requirement that any proposal coming out of such a Commission is subject to an non-amendable up or down vote .
And if this vision was still controlling the entire debate then this would look like total surrender by Pelosi .
But I argue that it is n’t , that the Obama Commission was formally given a much different mission , and one that in the end conflicts and subverts that of PGP .
The main impetus for the Obama Commission was not the structural long - term deficits seen as the result of ‘ unsustainable ’ entitlements , instead it was the very large , as in more than a trillion a year , deficits starting with FY 2009 as a result of the worldwide economic crisis , that is the crisis is not defined as intergenerational but instead in the here and now with the main expressed fear is that without action the Invisible Bond Vigilantes and the Chinese Central Bank will stop buying our debt .
Well I ’ll leave that bigger argument to Prof K , the result was that the Obama Commission was given a specific charter , that of getting the deficit down to 3 % of GDP by 2015 .
And the problem in a nutshell is that you ca n’t get there via benefit cuts to Social Security , one because Social Security is not actually projected to contribute to the deficit over that time period and two because even the most draconian proposals do n’t start operating by then .
It has been an accepted principle since the Leninist Strategy of 1983 that benefit cuts should n’t come at the expense of people in or nearing retirement , a principle that was also the first one listed by Bush ’s CSSS ( Commission to Strengthen Social Security ) in 2001 , and followed by the various proposals fronted by Alan Simpson , the Ryan Roadmap , and even Michelle Bachmann .
Each would give varying periods of grace ranging from seven years ( Simpson ) to not effecting people over 55 ( Ryan Roadmap ) to as much as 20 years .
But what all share in common is that none of them show any savings under CBO scoring prior to the mandated target of 2015 , they simply CAN ’T bend the short term deficit path .
It is not clear that any of PGP , the Obama Commission , or Speaker Pelosi quite get this because the whole argument has been framed in terms set by the Social Security and Medicare Trustees where the score is generally expressed over the 75 year actuarial window , or since 2003 over the Infinite Future Horizon .
Under those long - term scoring windows new revenues or benefit cuts get scored in the current year even if the actual incidence of the tax increase or benefit cut does n’t occur for years or even decades .
Well all of that is fine in its own place but it does n’t cut any ice when it comes to projected deficits in 2015 , when CBO scores whatever recommendations come out of the Commission , 2015 wo n’t ( or should n’t ) get credit for savings that wo n’t be seen until 2030 and later .
Now the argument can and will be made that future cuts add current confidence to those nervous ( but as yet invisible ) Bond Vigilantes , but at most the real effects in 2015 could only be seen in lower interest rates , and those rates are rock bottom now .
How does this play out in practice ?
Assume the worst , that the real intent of the Catfood Commission is to slash entitlements and particularly Social Security , the question is whether they can present a package that does that yet does n’t do anything for 2015 ’s bottom line ?
Can they get away with putting forth a ‘ deficit reduction ’ proposal that under CBO scoring does n’t actually lower the deficit by 2015 or within the standard 10 year scoring window ?
Well I do n’t see that they can , not without revealing their true colors .
And this is where the Pelosi Rule might actually work to protect Social Security .
Cooper - Wolf and Conrad - Gregg were both to be established pretty much openly as ‘ Entitlements Commissions ’ along the lines of the 1994 Kerrey - Danforth ‘ Entitlement and Tax Reform Commission ’
http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/KerreyDanforth/KerreyDanforth.htm , a package entirely focused on entitlements would not only not be surprising but expected giving the framing .
But the Obama Commission has a different framing , that of near term deficits , requiring a different approach , the Commission has to at least present some measures that will actually address their charter of reducing the 2015 deficit .
Which means revenue enhancements and spending restraint OUTSIDE of Social Security .
( Or just biting the bullet and cutting current SS benefits , something most concede would be political suicide ) .
Now the examples of the Stimulus and HCR Bills tells us how this could work , the Commission introduces a balanced proposal of short and long term revenue increases and cuts with a focus on both 2015 and 2083 and that proposal gets whittled down bit by bit ostensibly to gain the votes of Conservadems and Blue Dogs , but really just to eliminate any tax increases or defense cuts leaving only entitlement ‘ reform ’ intact .
The Pelosi Rule , by intent or not , prevents that whittling process .
Seen in this light Pelosi would be simply calling the Blue Dogs bluff , is it really about deficit reduction ?
or about slicing away at the social safety net ?
I do n’t believe the Commission can get away with a package that only slashes future entitlement payments but does nothing about near term deficits , it would just be too raw in light of their mandate .
Yet the more cover they add in the way of truly bi-partisan measures to increase revenue and cut discretionary spending , including military , the more support will bleed from Conservadems and Blue Dogs , to say nothing of Republicans , while Progressives are not going to jump on board an entitlements cut only program .
Where they might have gotten away with a straight out Entitlements Commission whose focus was on 75 year and Infinite Future savings , they are handcuffed by a 2015 target and attendant CBO scoring .
My opinion anyway .
For anyone else , well that is what comments are for .
Politician 's false teeth were so important for his speech he had several sets made , one of which is expected to fetch thousands
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Winston Churchill 's false teeth are to be auctioned for an estimated £ 5,000 .
The unlovely but beautifully made set of dentures helped the British prime minister and second world war icon overcome terrible dental problems since childhood and deliver some of the most famous speeches of the 20th century .
He was so anxious about losing them and being unable to speak that he always kept a spare set , which is why several survive .
He valued so highly the skill of his dentist , Wilfred Fish , that he nominated him for a knighthood .
They are being sold by the son of Derek Cudlipp , the technician who made them , at an auction on 29 July at Keys auction rooms in Aylsham , Norfolk , which recently sold a butter dish used by Churchill as an ashtray , and a stubbed - out cigar of his for £ 4,500 .
Auctioneer Andrew Bullock said they were so unusual they could go well over the estimate .
" The teeth are set in dentist 's gold but I think it is safe to say they wo n't be sold for their scrap value . "
The same sale will have two more cigars , carefully kept by a woman who is now 87 , who once nursed Churchill in hospital , when he gave her the cigars , asking if her father smoked .

April Fools ' day is canceled .
Seriously .
April Fools ' jokes are not happening around the world today , as they have for centuries .
The holiday is over .
So , without any April Fools ' pranks today , let 's remember the best from past years .
Ever hear about the April Fools ' prank that Uday pulled on his dad Saddam Hussein ?
Or how about the time a Boston University professor pranked the entire American media into believing he 'd discovered the origins of April Fools ' Day ?
And do n't forget how the BBC in 1965 claimed someone had invented of “ smellovision , ” which allowed TV - viewers to interact with their noses .
IN PICTURES : April Fools ' 2010 : Around the world
Here ’s our list of Top 10 April Fools ’ pranks from around the world , much of it inspired by the Museum of Hoaxes website .
10 . ENGLAND : 1957 : A BBC news show announced Swiss farmers had grown spaghetti , showing footage of peasants pulling spaghetti down from the trees .
Viewers believed it , calling into the BBC to ask how they could enjoy their own spaghetti crop .
The BBC replied , “ place a sprig of spaghetti in a tin of tomato sauce and hope for the best . ”
9. SWEDEN : 1962 : The sole television channel in Sweden was still black - and - white , but on April 1 it announced that viewers could easily convert to color .
The station 's technical expert , Kjell Stensson , said to pull a nylon stocking over the box .
Supposedly , thousands of people actually tried .
8. UNITED STATES : 1992 : National Public Radio announced that Richard Nixon , after living nearly two decades in disgraced retirement , was running again for president .
His new campaign slogan was , according to NPR , " I did n't do anything wrong , and I wo n't do it again . "
7. AUSTRALIA : 1975 : A TV news program says Australia will convert to “ metric time , ” making 100 seconds to the minute , 100 minutes to the hour , and 20 hours to the day .
Seconds would become millidays , minutes would become centidays , and hours would become decidays .
6. FRANCE : 1986 : A newspaper , the Parisien , reports the Eiffel Tower will be deconstructed and rebuilt in the new Disney World opening in Paris .
5. GREECE : 1995 : Socrates , the obstinate old philosopher who drank hemlock poison rather than curtail his free speech , is buried in an unknown place .
In 1995 the Greek Ministry of Culture said it found his tomb near the base of the Acropolis during excavation for the Athens metro system .
A vase containing traces of hemlock was reportedly in the tomb , too .
The French news wire Agence France - Presse reported the prank as news .
4. ITALY : 1919 : Venice woke one April 1 to find horse manure littering the streets , odd since the city of canals had few horses .
The British prankster Horace de Vere Cole , who was honeymooning in Venice , had transported a load of manure from the mainland the night before with the help of a gondolier and had then deposited small piles of it throughout the Piazza .
3. CHINA : 1993 : Getting in on the liberal fun , state newspaper The China Youth Daily announced those with doctorate degrees were exempt from one - child limits .
According to an article , doctorates ’ children would reduce the need for foreign experts .
As with the joke in Greece , the news wire Agence France - Presse reported it as true .
The next day , a Beijing newspaper ran an editorial stating that April Fools ' jokes " are an extremely bad influence . "
2. GERMANY : 1915 : In the midst of World War I , a French plane flew over the Germans and dropped what appeared to be a huge bomb .
Rightfully alarmed , the German soldiers fled .
But instead of an explosion , there was a bounce .
The Germans crept back to the load and discovered it was a football with a note that read , " April Fool ! "
( We can't find any source aside from the Museum of Hoaxes for that last one – if you can shed any light on it , please send us a comment . )
1. IRAQ : 1998 : Even in Iraq they celebrate April Fools ' Day , calling it Kithbet Neesan , or April Lie .
When Saddam Hussein was still in power , an Iraqi newspaper owned by his son , Uday , declared on its front page that President Clinton said '' it was time for lifting the sanctions . ''
( The UN had imposed sanctions after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 . )
Saddam was probably not amused .

This is something I 've been tracking for years ... the first graph shows existing home sales ( left axis ) and new home sales ( right axis ) through May .
This graph starts in 1994 , but the relationship has been fairly steady back to the '60s .
Then along came the housing bubble , and the " distressing gap " ( due partially to distressed sales ) .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
Initially the gap was caused by the flood of distressed sales .
This kept existing home sales elevated , and depressed new home sales since builders could n't compete with the low prices of all the foreclosed properties .
The two spikes in existing home sales were due primarily to the first time homebuyer tax credit ( the initial credit last year , followed by the extension to April 30th / close by June 30th ) .
There were also two smaller bumps for new home sales related to the tax credit .
Since new home sales are reported when contracts are signed , the 2nd spike for new home sales was in April and then sales collapsed in May .
The second graph shows the same information as a ratio - new home sales divided by existing home sales - through May 2010 .
The ratio decreased because the expiration of the tax credit impacts new home sales first .
This is the all time low for the ratio ( due to timing issues ) , and the ratio will increase somewhat as existing home sales collapse in July .
I expect that eventually this ratio will return to the historical range of new home sales being around 15 % to 20 % of existing home sales .
However that will only happen after the huge overhang of existing inventory ( especially distressed inventory ) is significantly reduced .
Several months before signing SB 1070 , Governor Jan Brewer accepted hundreds of dollars in " seed money " for her clean elections campaign from corporate executives and others with a possible stake in Arizona 's " papers please " legislation becoming law .
In all , seven executives with the Tennessee - based private prisons giant Corrections Corporation of America contributed $ 980 for the governor 's start - up fund with Arizona 's clean elections system .
A warden for one of CCA 's Arizona prisons gave $ 100 .
A CCA shareholder gave $ 140 .
Lobbyists listed with the state of Arizona as having CCA as a client gave another $ 560 , for a total of $ 1,780 .
In addition , CCA has contributed a whopping $ 10,000 to the campaign for Prop 100 , the one cent sales tax heavily promoted by Brewer , which is up for approval by voters today .
The success of Prop 100 is considered by many to be the linchpin for a Brewer victory in November .
How does CCA stand to gain from SB 1070 ?
CCA , which houses 75,000 offenders and detainees in more than 60 facilities nationwide , operates six prisons in Arizona , three of which list U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as a client : Florence , Eloy , and the Central Arizona Detention Center .
If SB 1070 is not stopped by a federal court injunction before it goes into effect late July , as a recently filed ACLU lawsuit aims to accomplish , all Arizona law enforcement will be required to check the immigration status of those they have " reasonable suspicion " of being in the country illegally .
This , during any lawful stop , detention , or arrest .
So the law could potentially mean a boon in warm bodies for CCA prisons , as those aliens turned over to ICE might find themselves in CCA facilities , even if for a short stay .
" The more folks that get pulled over and detained , the more money CCA makes , " said Monica Sandschafer , executive director of the Phoenix immigrant rights group LUCHA , which stands for Living United for Change in Arizona .
" It 's a pretty disturbing connection between Brewer and this company . "
But Brewer campaign flack Doug Cole scoffed at the suggestion that there was anything nefarious about the connection between Brewer and CCA , referring to CCA as a " good corporate citizen " and denying that CCA 's contributions to Brewer in any way affected her decision to sign the controversial law .
" People contribute to political campaigns , in my experience , because they want to be part of the process , " said Cole , speaking in general .
" Oh , so we 're talking a thousand dollars here now , " he harrumphed at one point .
Asked if the money might have influenced Brewer to sign SB 1070 , he stated emphatically , " Absolutely not . "
Todd Lang , executive director of Arizona 's Citizens Clean Elections Commission contended that Brewer had violated no rules in taking the money from CCA , even if CCA stood to benefit from Brewer 's actions as governor .
" Anyone can give to anyone , " said Lang of the so - called " seed money , " which is limited to a $ 51,250 cap .
" The restriction Clean Elections puts in place is how little money those guys can give .
The theory is that this restricts their influence . "
Clean Elections holds contributors to the initial seed money fund to a $ 140 per person limit .
Participating gubernatorial candidates must also raise thousands of $ 5 individual contributions .
If they obey these dictates , they are rewarded with public funds : $ 707,447 for the primary campaign , and $ 1,061,171 for the general election .
However , Sandschafer pointed out that each of the CCA executives and lobbyists in question gave the maximum amount allowed , save for the warden of the Eloy Detention Center Charles DeRosa , who gave $ 100 .
" These are the people who stand to profit from this horrible racist legislation , " Sandschafer asserted .
CCA execs contributing to Brewer include the company 's top brass : Damon Hininger , CCA President and CEO ; " senior administrator " Anthony Grande ; Gustavus Puryear , at one time CCA 's general counsel ; Todd Mullenger , executive VP and chief financial officer ; and so on .
Louise Grant , a CCA spokeswoman based in Tennessee , claimed that the contributions to Brewer , which were made in November of 2009 , were not intended to influence public policy , and that the $ 10 K contribution to the Yes on 100 fund , dated April 5 , 2010 , was made because CCA wanted what was best for its employees in Arizona .
Grant also stated that under Brewer , CCA had lost two contracts with a total of 3,000 prisoners involved .
She said that the main facility they use for ICE detainees is Eloy , the warden for which gave $ 100 to Brewer 's start up fund .
She denied SB 1070 would be a good thing for CCA , or that CCA had any influence over the law itself .
" CCA has had no involvement whatsoever with this legislation , SB 1070 , " she said .
" And we will not have any involvement with it . "
She said the company had made no statement for or against the legislation .
There ’s big news on the late night TV battlefront today :
The late - night ratings for Q2 – the first full quarter since Leno came back as host after Conan O’Brien was dumped – are in , and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno posted its lowest - rated Q2 since the Late Show with David Letterman launched on CBS in 1993 .
Additionally , Late Show delivered its most competitive finish against The Tonight Show in viewers and key demographics since 1995 .
Still , Leno topped Letterman comfortably in the ratings during their first quarter in 9 months as late - night rivals , by 23 % in both total viewers and adults 18 - 49 .
The Tonight Show averaged 4.0 million viewers and a 1.1 / 4 in adults 18 - 49 , down 20 % in viewers and 31 % in adults 18 - 49 from last year ’s second quarter , which was inflated by the big ratings for Leno ’s sign - off and Conan O’Brien ’s debut .
It was the lowest - rated second quarter for The Tonight Show in total viewers , adults 18 - 49 , and adults 25 - 54 since 1993 .
The Tonight Show with Jay Leno is now tracking at demo levels comparable to where the show was with O’Brien as host .
Meanwhile , Late Show too had its smallest audience since 1993 .
It drew 3.3 million viewers and a 0.9/4 in 18 - 49 , down 7 % in viewers and even in 18 - 49 .
It was Late Show ’s most competitive 2Q position against The Tonight Show in viewers ( - 746,000 ) and adults 18 - 49 ( - 0.2 ) since 1995 .
So the old guard late - night hosts are losing ground , with Nightline ( 3.7 million , up 2 % ) , once in danger of cancellation by ABC when the network was pursuing Letterman , comfortably ahead of the CBS host and closing in on Leno .
We ’ve been working on this one for quite some time ( over six months , actually ) and are excited to announce the upcoming release of the iPad version of Osmos !
As I mentioned in a previous post , we learned a lot from the development – and feedback !
– from the PC / Mac / Linux versions of Osmos , and have reworked the “ i ” Versions from the ground up : new game structure , sweet multitouch controls , more levels , difficulty curve smoothed out , new menus , everything tweaked for the screen size and processing power of the device , etc .
We ’re very happy with the results , and friends who are familiar with the game are saying this may be the “ definitive version ” of Osmos !
Here ’s the original Osmos trailer , which is still totally relevant to the new version ( it contains all the levels seen in the video )
And here ’s a little hands - on sneak - peak of Osmos HD on the iPad
The iPhone version will come roughly a month after the iPad version , but the latter was so strong we decided to focus on it first .
So for those of you with an iPad , mark July 8th on your gaming calender .
We think you ’ll be pleased !
The Case for a Creator , Closing Thoughts
It ’s been said that one of science ’s greatest virtues is that it ’s not dictated by a tyranny of the majority or guided by irrational human whims .
After all , science is the search for the true nature of reality , and reality is n’t decided by our preferences .
No matter how many people prefer an experiment to turn out one way , it may in fact turn out another , and the scientific community will just have to accept that result .
There ’s certainly much truth to this .
But of course , in another sense , scientific debates are settled by majority vote , because science is done by humans , and how else can a community of humans conduct business other than by consensus ?
When the evidence is unclear or lacking , we have no choice but to rely on the judgment of experts .
The theory that wins the majority ’s support , by definition , will attract the most research , the most funding , and the most talent .
There ’s truth in both these views , but the reality is that they usually converge .
Science works – it discovers verifiable truth about the world – and the implication is that , in any given dispute , the theory which attracts the most support from the majority of practicing , credentialed scientists is more likely than its competitors to be true .
This is even more true of ideas that have survived decades of rigorous experimental tests .
I do n’t know of a single case where a scientific theory that reigned for so long was utterly falsified and overthrown .
Far more often , we just discover that although the old theory holds true in most cases , there are special circumstances where it does n’t ; and it then becomes an approximation of its more precise successor .
The reason for this whole digression is that , in The Case for a Creator ‘s appendix , Strobel offers a summary of his apologetics work in The Case for Christ .
He summarizes one chapter as follows :
“ Gregory Boyd … offered a devastating critique of the Jesus Seminar , a group that questions whether Jesus aid or did most of what ’s attributed to him .
He identified the Seminar as ‘ an extremely small number of radical - fringe scholars who are on the far , far left wing of New Testament thinking . ' ” [ p.295 ]
This is extremely perilous ground for Strobel to tread on .
If some group ’s belonging to the “ radical fringe ” is a reason to reject their ideas , does n’t that apply all the more to the ideas presented in this book ?
After all , the theory of evolution has the support of the overwhelming majority of the scientific community : state , national , and international scientific societies and academies ; the biology faculties of dozens of accredited colleges and universities ; and , of course , over a thousand scientists named Steve .
By contrast , the intelligent - design movement is sorely lacking in intellectual firepower .
As I ’ve pointed out , the intellectual well of creationism is so shallow that Strobel was forced to pad out a ten - chapter book with theologians , philosophers and professional Christian debaters , and even then , he had to interview one of his subjects twice !
This lack of depth speaks to the true nature of the creationist movement : not a robust academic community doing real scientific research , but a small number of pundits , lawyers and religious evangelists underwritten by right - wing Christian groups for ideological and propaganda reasons .
The difference between them is the difference between an ocean and a puddle .
Given Strobel ’s dismissive description of the Jesus Seminar , would n’t it also be appropriate to identify the Discovery Institute as “ an extremely small number of radical - fringe creationists , most of whom are on the far , far right wing of religious thinking , and – to top it off – most of whom lack credentials in any scientific field related to evolution ” ?
( This is in contrast to the the Jesus Seminar , whose members , no matter how bitterly Strobel denigrates them , have legitimate credentials in textual criticism , ancient languages , and biblical studies . )
Strobel relies on the argument from authority when it ’s convenient , but disregards it when it ’s not convenient .
Granted , a Christian apologist might think to make this argument cut both ways – how can we atheists reject the Bible when so many prominent biblical scholars believe it ’s true ?
– but there are obstacles to doing so .
First of all , many of the theologians who express belief in biblical historicity and inerrancy work not for secular universities where the expression of diverse views is protected by tenure , but by religious schools and seminaries which force their members to affirm a statement of faith and cast out those who express unorthodox thoughts .
This artificial barrier , which has no equivalent in the scientific community , makes it much more difficult for anyone who dissents in any significant way to express an opinion .
( That said , there ’s a lot more diversity of opinion in the biblical studies community than most lay believers realize , and there ’s certainly no widespread agreement on the tenets of fundamentalism .
The Jesus Seminar is just the most visible expression of methods and conclusions that have been established in the field for decades . )
Second , even disregarding the dogma and doctrinal vows , the mission of a religious college is fundamentally different .
Science rewards people whose discoveries bring us closer to the truth of the world , even if those discoveries overturn established wisdom .
But the purpose of religious groups is to maintain continuity – to defend orthodoxy , defend the creed , defend the beliefs that have always been held .
There ’s no reward for those who challenge conventional wisdom .
In religion , unlike in science , you can build a career on nothing but reiterating the thoughts of your predecessors .
The absence of any method of self - correction means that in religion , unlike in science , we ’d be well advised to listen to the so - called radical fringe .
They ’re most likely to be the people who are on to something .

Editor ’s note :
For more from Oliver Stone about his new documentary and clips from “ South of the Border , ” click here .
The following letter was sent to The New York Times :
Larry Rohter attacks our film , “ South of the Border , ” for “ mistakes , misstatements and missing details . ”
But a close examination of the details reveals that the mistakes , misstatements , and missing details are his own , and that the film is factually accurate .
We will document this for each one of his attacks .
We then show that there is evidence of animus and conflict of interest , in his attempt to discredit the film .
Finally , we ask that you consider the many factual errors in Rohter ’s attacks , outlined below , and the pervasive evidence of animus and conflict of interest in his attempt to discredit the film ; and we ask that The New York Times publish a full correction for these numerous mistakes .
1 ) Accusing the film of “ misinformation , ” Rohter writes that “ A flight from Caracas to La Paz , Bolivia , flies mostly over the Amazon , not the Andes… . ”
But the narration does not say that the flight is “ mostly ” over the Andes , just that it flies over the Andes , which is true .
( Source : Google Earth )
2 ) Also in the category of “ misinformation , ” Rohter writes “ the United States does not ‘ import more oil from Venezuela than any other OPEC nation , ’ a distinction that has belonged to Saudi Arabia during the period 2004 - 10 . ”
The quote cited by Rohter here was spoken in the film by an oil industry analyst , Phil Flynn , who appears for about 30 seconds in a clip from U.S. broadcast TV .
It turns out that Rohter is mistaken , and Flynn is correct .
Flynn is speaking in April 2002 ( which is clear in the film ) , so it is wrong for Rohter to cite data from 2004 - 2010 .
If we look at data from 1997 - 2001 , which is the relevant data for Flynn ’s comment , Flynn is correct .
Venezuela leads all OPEC countries , including Saudi Arabia , for oil imports in the U.S. over this period .
( Source : US Energy Information Agency for Venezuela , http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MTTIMUSVE2&f=A, and Saudi Arabia , http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MTTIMUSSA2&f=A)
3 ) Rohter tries to discredit the film ’s very brief description of the 1998 Venezuelan presidential race :
“ As ‘ South of the Border ’ portrays it , Mr. Chávez ’s main opponent in his initial run for president in 1998 was “ a 6 - foot - 1 - inch blond former Miss Universe ” named Irene Sáez , and thus “ the contest becomes known as the Beauty and the Beast ” election .
“ But Mr. Chávez ’s main opponent then was not Ms. Sáez , who finished third , with less than 3 percent of the vote .
It was Henrique Salas Romer , a bland former state governor who won 40 percent of the vote . ”
Rohter ’s criticism is misleading .
The description of the presidential race in the film , cited by Rohter , is from Bart Jones , who was covering Venezuela for the Associated Press from Caracas at the time .
The description is accurate , despite the final results .
For most of the race , which began in 1997 , Irene Sáez was indeed Chavez ’s main opponent , and the contest was reported as “ Beauty and the Beast . ”
In the six months before the election , she began to fade and Salas Romer picked up support ; his 40 percent showing was largely the result of a late decision of both COPEI and AD ( the two biggest political parties in Venezuela at the time , who had ruled the country for four decades ) to throw their support behind him .
( See , for example , this 2008 article from BBC , which describes the race as in the film , and does not even mention Salas Romer : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7767417.stm.)
Rohter ’s description makes it seem like Saéz was a minor candidate , which is absurd .
4 ) Rohter tries to frame the film ’s treatment of the 2002 coup in Venezuela as a “ conspiracy theory . ”
He writes :
“ Like Mr. Stone ’s take on the Kennedy assassination , this section of ‘ South of the Border ’ hinges on the identity of a sniper or snipers who may or may not have been part of a larger conspiracy . ”
This description of the film is completely false .
The film makes no statement on the identity of the snipers nor does it present any theory of a “ larger conspiracy ” with any snipers .
Rather , the film makes two points about the coup : ( 1 ) That the Venezuelan media ( and this was repeated by U.S. and other international media ) manipulated film footage to make it look as if a group of Chavez supporters with guns had shot the 19 people killed on the day of the coup .
This manipulation of the film footage is demonstrated very clearly in the film , and therefore does not “ [ rely ] heavily on the account of Gregory Wilpert ” as Rohter also falsely alleges .
The footage speaks for itself .
( 2 ) The United States government was involved in the coup ( see http://southoftheborderdoc.com/2002-venezuela-coup/ and below ) .
Ironically , it is Rohter that relies on conspiracy theories , citing one dubious account in particular that he argues we should have included in the film .
5 ) Rohter accuses us of “ bend[ing ] facts and omit[ ting ] information ” on Argentina , for allowing “ Mr. Kirchner and his successor — and wife — Cristina Fernández de Kirchner to claim that “ we began a different policy than before . ”
“ In reality , Mr. Kirchner ’s presidential predecessor , Eduardo Duhalde , and Mr. Duhalde ’s finance minister , Roberto Lavagna , were the architects of that policy shift and the subsequent economic recovery , which began while Mr. Kirchner was still the obscure governor of a small province in Patagonia . ”
This criticism is somewhat obscure and perhaps ridiculous .
The Kirchners were in the presidency for five out of the six years of Argentina ’s remarkable economic recovery , in which the economy grew by 63 percent .
Some of the policies that allowed for that recovery began in 2002 , and others began in 2003 , and even later .
What exactly are the “ bent facts ” and “ omitted information ” here ?
6 ) Rohter tries to make an issue out of the fact that the logo of Human Rights Watch appears for a couple of seconds on the screen , during a discussion of Washington ’s double standards on human rights .
The film does n’t say or imply anything about HRW .
Most importantly , in his interview with Rohter , HRW ’s Americas director José Miguel Vivanco backs up exactly what the film does say , that there is a double standard in the U.S. that focuses on allegations of human rights abuses in Venezuela while ignoring or downplaying far graver , far more numerous , and better substantiated allegations about human rights abuses in Colombia : “ It ’s true that many of Chávez ’s fiercest critics in Washington have turned a blind eye to Colombia ’s appalling human rights record , ” says Vivanco .
7 ) Rohter attacks co-writer Tariq Ali for saying that “ The government [ of Bolivia ] decided to sell the water supply of Cochabamba to Bechtel , a U.S. corporation . ”
Rohter writes : “ In reality , the government did not sell the water supply : it granted a consortium that included Bechtel a 40 - year management concession … . ”
Rohter is really reaching here .
“ Selling the water supply ” to private interests is a fair description of what happened here , about as good for practical purposes as “ granting a 40 - year management concession . ”
The companies got control over the city ’s water supply and the revenue that can be gained from selling it .
Rohter ’s animus and conflict of interest :
We gave Rohter an enormous amount of factual information to back up the main points of the film .
He not only ignored the main points of the film , but in the quotes he selected for the article , he picked only quotes that were not fact related that could be used to illustrate what he considered the director ’s and co-author ’s bias .
This is not ethical journalism ; in fact it is questionable whether it is journalism at all .
For example , Rohter was presented with detailed and documentary evidence of the United States ’ involvement in the 2002 coup .
( See http://southoftheborderdoc.com/2002-venezuela-coup.)
This was a major point in the film , and was backed up in the film by testimony from then Washington Post foreign editor Scott Wilson , who covered the coup from Caracas .
In our conversations with Rohter , he simply dismissed all of this evidence out of hand , and nothing about it appears in the article .
Rohter should have disclosed his own conflict of interest in this review .
The film criticizes the New York Times for its editorial board ’s endorsement of the military coup of April 11 , 2002 against the democratically elected government of Venezuela , which was embarrassing to the Times .
Moreover , Rohter himself wrote an article on April 12 that went even further than the Times ’ endorsement of the coup :
“ Neither the overthrow of Mr. Chavez , a former army colonel , nor of Mr. Mahuad two years ago can be classified as a conventional Latin American military coup .
The armed forces did not actually take power on Thursday .
It was the ousted president ’s supporters who appear to have been responsible for deaths that numbered barely 12 rather than hundreds or thousands , and political rights and guarantees were restored rather than suspended . ”
– Larry Rohter , New York Times , April 12 , 2002
These allegations that the coup was not a coup – not only by Rohter — prompted a rebuttal by Rohter ’s colleague at the New York Times , Tim Weiner , who wrote a Sunday Week in Review piece two days later entitled “ A Coup By Any Other Name . ” ( New York Times , April 14 , 2002 )
Unlike the NYT editorial board , which issued a grudging retraction of their pro-coup stance a few days later ( included in our film ) , Rohter seems to have clung to the right - wing fantasies about the coup .
It is not surprising that someone who supports the military overthrow of a democratically elected government would not like a documentary like this one , which celebrates the triumphs of electoral democracy in South America over the last decade .
But he should have at least informed his readers that the New York Times ’ was under fire in this documentary , and also about his own reporting : in 1999 and 2000 he covered Venezuela for the Times , writing numerous anti-Chavez news reports .
The media ’s biased and distorted reporting on Latin America is a major theme of the documentary , one which Rohter also conveniently ignores in his 1,665 - word attempt to discredit the film .
We spent hours with Rohter over the course of two days and gave him all the information he asked for , even though his hostility was clear from the outset .
But he was determined to present his narrative of intrepid reporter exposing sloppy filmmaking .
The result is a very dishonest attempt to discredit the film by portraying it as factually inaccurate — using false and misleading statements , out - of - context , selective quotations from interviews with the director and writers , and ad hominem attacks .
The Times should apologize for having published it .
Sincerely ,
Oliver Stone

A huge inflatable vehicle as long as a 23 - floor skyscraperis tall has become the world 's largest airship in its bid to serve as a stratosphericsatellite , or " stratellite , " according to its developers .
The 235 - foot ( 72 m ) long airship , known as the Bullet 580 , hasa top speed of 80 mph ( 129 km /h ) and can serve as a high - flying sentinel thatstays aloft for long periods of time .
Getting the new sky behemoth inflatedrequired six hours inside Garrett Coliseum in Montgomery , Ala .
" Our airships are radically different designs that movebeyond the performance limitations of traditional blimps or zeppelins bycombining advanced technology with simple construction and the ability to fuelwith algae , protecting our environment , " said Michael Lawson , chairman and CEO of E - Green Technologies .
The airship is designed to carry payloads of up to 2,000 pounds ( 907 kg ) at altitudes of 20,000 feet ( 6,096 m ) .
Any cargo aboard theairship would sit within an outer envelope made from a new type of Kevlar , orthe same material used to build bulletproof vests .
That allows the envelope tohave a width just one - sixteenth of an inch thick , but still be 10 timesstronger than steel .
Airships have undergone aresurgence of interest as both military and civilian operators eye theircost - efficient operations compared to traditional fixed - wing aircraft .
But eventhe modern record - holder for size dwindles in comparison to airships back intheir heyday , such as the 804 - foot ( 245 m ) Hindenberg .
E - Green Technologies considers the Bullet 580 as the firstin a wave of airships in production for commercial use .
It acquired theairship 's developers , 21st Century Airships , in November 2009 .
Military and civilian versions of the airship might take onroles for battlefieldsurveillance , missile defense warning , electronic countermeasures , weaponsplatforms , Global Positioning Satellite ( GPS ) services , weather monitoring , broadcast communications and communications relays .
A maiden flight scheduled for later this year would carry anexperimental payload jointly developed by NASA and Old Dominion University inNorfolk , Va .
The agricultural and geophysical experiment is designed to measuremoisture content in the soil .
Getting commercialairship production up and running is expected to create hundreds of textileindustry jobs in Alabama , according to a statement by E - Green Technologies .
Itmight also lead to aerospace and aviation jobs in Central Florida and NorthernCalifornia , where the company hopes to set up operational centers .

The November issue of Shooting Illustrated published a letter from a reader who suggested Taurus make a carbine version of their Judge revolver and name it the “ Supreme Court Judge ” .
Gary from Oklahoma has had his wish come true .
The new Taurus Circuit Judge is a revolver carbine that can chamber .410 shotshells ( 2.5 ″ and 3 ″ ) and .45 Long Colt .
The design is very similar to the Russian KBP MTs 225 revolver shotgun .
The Circuit has a very attractive Monte Carlo stock ( I guess a synthetic stock will be introduced at a later date ) .
A cylinder guard on the left side of the gun prevents gas and flames from scorching your arm .
Specifications Caliber .45 Long Colt , .410 2.5 ″ and 3 ″ shells Capacity 5 rounds Action SA / DA Finish Wood / Blue Barrel 18.5 ″ Overall Length 38 ″ Weight 4.75 lbs Front Sight Fiber optics Rear Sight Fiber optic MSRP ( Price )
Not yet announced .
The Circut Judge will be avalible with either a rifled barrel or a smoothbore barrel .
The smoothbore version will only be able to fire .410 rounds .
I really look forward to shooting the new Judge .
It looks nice , feels nice and I am sure is a lot of fun to shoot .

The Crown of the Sun
Credit & Copyright : Alain Maury , Jean - Luc Dauvergne
Explanation : During a total solar eclipse , the Sun 's extensive outer atmosphere , or corona , is an inspirational sight .
Subtle shades and shimmering features that engage the eye span a brightness range of over 10,000 to 1 , making them notoriously difficult to capture in a single photograph .
But this composite of 7 consecutive digital images over a range of exposure times comes close to revealing the crown of the Sun in all its glory .
The telescopic views were recorded from the Isla de Pascua ( Easter Island ) during July 11 's total solar eclipse and also show solar prominences extending just beyond the edge of the eclipsed sun .
Remarkably , features on the dim , near side of the New Moon can also be made out , illuminated by sunlight reflected from a Full Earth .
New Orleans , Louisiana ( CNN ) -- BP says it has placed a new containment cap on its crippled well in the Gulf of Mexico that 's been gushing oil since an explosion and fire April 20 .
The company hopes the new cap will be able to completely contain the leaking oil , but tests are still needed to determine its effectiveness .
Video supplied by BP showed robotic arms gingerly lowering the new 18 - foot , 150,000 - pound cap over the well .
For now , some oil continues to gush from the upper section of the new cap .
That was expected and will continue until BP begins " well integrity tests " Tuesday , BP said .
The process could take anywhere from six hours to two days .
If the new cap does not completely contain oil from the crippled well , some may have to be brought to the surface to waiting containment ships .
But under a worst - case scenario , there could be new damage to blowout preventer .
BP said in a statement Monday night that , " It is expected , although cannot be assured , that no oil will be released to the ocean for the duration of the test .
This will not however be an indication that flow from the well bore has been permanently stopped . "
It said information gathered during the test will be reviewed with relevant government agencies .
The company said it 's possible the tests might be extended even further .
Retired Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen , the man in charge of the federal response , said Monday scientists will be checking the pressure inside the well , and then determining whether the cap is holding the oil in or if crews will need to continue siphoning oil .
A critical step is making sure there 's no hydrate buildup , according to BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles .
In the best - case scenario , the containment cap would have the ability to close down the valves and slowly contain all the oil , Allen said .
But if oil collection were still necessary , over the next two to three weeks , 60,000 to 80,000 barrels ( 2.52 million to 3.36 million gallons ) a day could be collected as part of the containment process , according to BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells .
That 's because the new containment cap would eventually allow four collection ships to access the well , rather than the maximum of three allowed by the old cap , Allen said earlier .
While robots worked to replace the old cap , crude oil continued to leak out .
Scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil have spewed daily from BP 's breached well .
Now , even if oil does have to be sent to the surface , BP said it has more resources at its disposal .
The oil - gathering ship , the Helix Producer , was put in place Monday to recover oil , joining the Q4000 , which is already active .
Between the two ships , crews should be able to collect up to 33,000 barrels of oil per day , Suttles said .
Meanwhile , as efforts to place the containment cap on the well were unfolding , the U.S. Interior Department said Monday it is issuing a new moratorium order in a second effort to block deepwater oil and natural gas projects .
But the was opposition from a key Democratic senator and even some drilling companies that limit their activities close to shore .
The government said the new moratorium is to " protect communities , coasts , and wildlife " while oil and gas companies implement safety measures to reduce the risks of blowouts and oil spills associated with deepwater drilling .
The ban will be in effect through November 30 , 2010 , or until Interior Secretary Ken Salazar determines that deepwater drilling operations can proceed safely .
It would prevent further deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico until officials determine what went wrong in the April 20 explosion and fire at an oil rig that led to oil gushing into the ocean 5,000 feet below the surface .
A previous six - month ban issued in the wake of the Gulf oil disaster was thrown out by a federal judge in New Orleans .
Last week , a federal appeals panel rejected the government 's request to overturn the lower court judge 's decision .
The new Interior Department order supersedes the old one .
" More than eighty days into the BP oil spill , a pause on deepwater drilling is essential and appropriate to protect communities , coasts , and wildlife from the risks that deepwater drilling currently pose , " Salazar said in a statement .
" I am basing my decision on evidence that grows every day of the industry 's inability in the deepwater to contain a catastrophic blowout , respond to an oil spill , and to operate safely . "
He added , " I remain open to modifying the new deepwater drilling suspensions based on new information . "
But Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana called the moratorium " unnecessary , ill - conceived and a second economic disaster for the Gulf Coast . "
She spoke before a presidential commission , tasked with reviewing the response to the oil spill and making recommendations about the future of offshore drilling .
Landrieu called the BP oil spill the " exception instead of the rule " and said the deepwater drilling moratorium will kill jobs .
The National Oil Spill Commission is holding meetings in New Orleans Monday and Tuesday .
" Whether you call it a moratorium , a suspension or a pause , the result will still be a substantial loss of jobs , " Landrieu said .
" Even the revised moratorium will force thousands of hard working Louisianians and others in the Gulf Coast to the unemployment line .
So I strongly urge this commission to take a quick and decisive action to immediately lift moratorium to save our business and our economy . "
Cherri Foytlin , whose husband works for a firm that supplies tools to drilling companies , agreed .
" What I want the commission to walk away with is that we are people down here , and the moratorium and the oil spill affects people and not just big companies .
When you rage against big oil like BP and Exxon , you 're really raging against me , " she said .
Shallow water drilling activities can continue to move forward , under the Interior Department 's order , if operators comply with all safety and environmental requirements .
The department said that 's because they do n't present the same type or level of risks that deepwater drilling operations can , it said .
But some concerns are being expressed even by firms that limit their drilling activities to shallow water .
Randy Stilley , president and chief executive officer of Seahawk Drilling , said in a statement that while shallow water drilling supposedly is being allowed under the new order , " the reality is that permits for shallow water drilling are not proceeding despite the widespread efforts being made by the industry to honor the letter and spirit of new Interior regulatory standards . "
Jim Noe , senior vice president and general Counsel of Hercules Offshore , added , " To date , and despite assurances from the White House and the Interior Department , about one - third of the shallow water fleet has been idled by the application of what can only be called a de facto moratorium . "
As efforts continued Monday to get the new cap in place , Allen and BP executives emphasized that work was also continuing on two relief wells , which he called " the final solution " to shutting down the leaking well .
The first relief well is now five feet away from the main well and , at 17,840 feet deep , it 's 30 feet above the hoped - for final casing point , BP 's Suttles said Monday .
That 's where BP will run additional tests , then aim for the final intersection point .
Given the closeness to the target , he said that BP was estimating " kill " operations to shut down the main well could take place at the end of the month .
The second relief well , which has been drilled as a redundancy measure at the behest of the Obama administration , is now at 15,874 feet deep , Suttles said .
He added that BP is going to stop drilling that well farther unless it ends up being needed .
" If the relief wells for whatever reason happen to fail , the other option we are working on how do we install what I will call a permanent collection system , which is where we 're working on pipelines to other facilities , " BP 's senior vice president , Kent Wells , told the National Oil Spill Commission on Monday .
While response crews were hard at work over the weekend , seven members of the National Oil Spill Commission visited different areas of the Gulf Coast affected by the oil disaster ahead of their meetings in New Orleans .
Committee co-chairman William K. Reilly , a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator , went to Gulfport , Mississippi , to talk with disaster victims and inspect recovery efforts .
The visits and meetings will help the presidential commission " begin to lay the groundwork for our efforts going forward , to determine what really to concentrate on and where to put our priorities and , very importantly , what the people most affected by all of this think about how effective the response has been , " Reilly said .
President Barack Obama established the bipartisan commission last month and gave members six months to investigate the oil catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico .
The panel will listen to public comments and official testimony from BP , the U.S. Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on the recovery efforts .
CNN 's John King , Kim Segal , Vivian Kuo , John Lisk and Shelby Lin Erdman contributed to this report .
Hoping to regain control of the Los Angeles medical marijuana industry , officials have enacted a new city ordinance that will force more than 400 dispensaries to shut down .
Last year , L.A. became the " epicenter " of a marijuana dispensary boom that erupted after the Obama administration announced it would not prosecute operators of medical marijuana stores that abide by state laws .
" Although the city had a [ 2007 ] moratorium on new dispensaries , " reports the Los Angeles Times , " it failed to enforce the ban and hundreds opened with no oversight , triggering complaints from neighborhood activists . "

A team of researchers led by the University of Colorado at Boulder believe a dry powder , inhalable vaccine developed for measles prevention and slated for human clinical trials later this year in India will lead to other inhalable , inexpensive vaccines for illnesses ranging from tuberculosis to cervical cancer .
The inhalable measles vaccine , developed by a team led by CU - Boulder chemistry and biochemistry Professor Robert Sievers , involves mixing " supercritical " carbon dioxide with a weakened form of the measles virus .
The process produces microscopic bubbles and droplets that are dried to make the inhalable powder , which is dispensed into the mouths of patients using a small , cylindrical plastic sack with an opening like the neck of a plastic water bottle .
According to the World Health Organization , measles is one of the leading causes of death among young children .
In 2008 there were an estimated 164,000 measles deaths in children worldwide -- nearly 450 deaths a day -- and India accounts for about two - thirds of global measles deaths in infants and children .
" Clinical trials are the next vital step in making this vaccine widely available , " he said .
" One of our primary goals of this project is to get rid of needles and syringes , because they frighten some people , they hurt , they can transmit diseases and there are issues with needle disposal , " he said .
With the new technology , the inhaled powder is sent directly into the lungs , a good target since measles attacks through the respiratory tract , said Sievers .
" A person taking a deep breath from the sack is effectively vaccinated . "
Sievers will give a presentation on the subject at the Eighth European Conference on Supercritical Fluid Applications to be held May 9 - 12 in Graz , Austria .
Phase
One of the clinical trials to test the safety and efficacy of the measles inhalant product are slated to start this summer in Pune , India , and will involve about 180 people , said Sievers .
Phase
Two of the India clinical trials are expected to involve a larger number of patients .

Sievers , also a fellow at CU 's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences , said the measles vaccine development idea grew out of atmospheric chemistry research he and his students were conducting .
The team was attempting to determine the chemistry of specific air pollutants in particular regions of the world and how people inhale and process tiny airborne droplets of pollutants .
As part of the measles project , Sievers and his students and colleagues invented and patented a device known as the Carbon Dioxide Assisted Nebulization with a Bubble Dryer , or CAN - BD , in which two mixed streams of fluid are rapidly expanded to atmospheric pressure where the tiny bubbles and droplets are dried by mixing them with warm nitrogen .
The resulting , inhalable - sized vaccine bits are embedded in micro-particles of sugars and amino acids , he said .
Aktiv - Dry is a Boulder spinoff company Sievers co-founded in 2002 with Professor John Carpenter of the University of Colorado School of Pharmacy and Brian Quinn , current president of Aktiv - Dry .
The company , which employs about 10 people including former CU - Boulder students , currently is developing CAN - BD for the marketplace .
" This project came out of the University of Colorado , and Aktiv - Dry is partially owned by the university through the University of Colorado Technology Transfer Office , " said Sievers .
" I 've had 40 CU - Boulder students who have earned their doctorates under me through the years , and it was those students and their work that really positioned us at the right time to gain significant funding for this project . "
The $ 20 million Aktiv - Dry research effort is funded by the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative , which was created by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the Foundation for The National Institutes of Health .
Sievers ' project addresses one of the 14 Grand Challenges -- the needle - free administration of vaccines by pulmonary or nasal aerosols .

David H. McAdams , a CU - Boulder doctoral student in the chemistry and biochemistry department working with Sievers , said he switched his academic focus from atmospheric chemistry particle analytics to participate in the measles project .
" I saw an opportunity to use the analysis of such particulates to benefit mankind and to help save children by using inhalable vaccines . "
The CU team recently tested the durability of the inhalant vaccine by shipping a batch from the Serum Institute of India to CU - Boulder , then shipping the same batch two months later to the East Coast and back to Boulder .
The vaccine proved to be stable throughout the shipping process , indicating it likely would be effective under challenging environmental conditions encountered in developing nations , Sievers said .
The cost of an inhalant dose for measles developed by Sievers and his team is about 26 cents -- roughly the cost for an injectable form of the dose .
As a practical matter , said Sievers , the treatment of patients with novel technologies should not be more expensive than standard treatment costs .
The new technology could potentially be used to deliver tiny antibiotics particles to treat people with multi-resistant tuberculosis , said Sievers .
While the antibiotic inhalant would likely be combined with oral doses and injections , the use of CAN - BD would direct the antibiotic directly to the lungs where the disease is focused , said Sievers .
Another potential use for the CAN - BD technology is treating human papilloma virus , a sexually transmitted disease that causes cervical cancer .
" More women in India today die of cervical cancer than from breast cancer , which is a much bigger killer in the United States , " he said .
Current treatment for papilloma virus is a three - dose injection regimen that costs about $ 300 -- a cost Sievers and his group would like to lower significantly for it to be distributed to women who need it in developing nations .
Collaborators on the measles project include scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver , Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , the University of Kansas , the Serum Institute of India in Pune , BD Technologies in Research Triangle Park , N.C. , and Seattle Genetics in Seattle .
A Japan - like outcome is a big risk for the developed world with deflation a big danger , he said .
Recent figures show that the recovery is sputtering in the US while China 's booming growth has slowed down slightly , as Beijing unwinds stimulus measures .
The Bank of Japan revised upwards is economic forecast but reiterated it will maintain its easy money policy .
In his new book " SuperCycles " Motianey says the world has managed to recover from a number of shocks since the Latin American debt crisis , but getting over the financial crisis will be much harder .
" The global rebalancing mechanism through flexible exchange rates is not working as well as it should , " Motianey said .
" Many emerging markets are resisting changes in nominal exchange rates .
Higher inflation is causing some correction in real terms but it is too little and may turn out to be too late , " he added .
China is the key to correcting this problem , according to Motianey .
He warned that the challenges facing the developed world look even more problematic .
" Financial markets have become intolerant about governments acting as a source of final demand in the developed market , " he said .
" We are seeing this most dramatically in the European sovereign debt crisis that is now mutating into a European bank crisis . "
With both these factors hitting growth , the threat of the world economy folding in on itself is now ever - present , Motianey said .
According to the BLS , only 497,000 teens ( ages 16 to 19 ) found jobs in June 2010 NSA ( June is the key months for summer employment ) .
This is the fewest teen jobs added in June since 1951 .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
This graph shows the number of teens looking for work ( lowest since 1954 ) and the number of teens found jobs in June ( data is not seasonally adjusted ) .
This partially explains the large drop in participation rate in June - an extremely low number of teenagers joined the workforce , and this resulted in 256,000 teens leaving the workforce on a seasonally adjusted basis - of the total 652,000 total people leaving the workforce ( seasonally adjusted ) .
Teens not looking for jobs - because the job market is so bad - actually helped push down the unemployment rate !

Soweto , South Africa ( CNN ) --
It 's the iconic image that grabbed the world 's attention and helped change the course of South African history .
Thirty - four years ago Wednesday , on June 16 , 1976 , thousands of black school children in Soweto , South Africa , took to the streets to protest the apartheid education system that obliged them to be taught in Afrikaans .
It was supposed to be a peaceful protest , but the students were met with police gunfire and at least 23 of them were killed .
One of the first youths to be killed was 12 - year - old Hector Pieterson .
His death was captured in a photograph that came to define South Africa 's liberation struggle .
In the image a fellow student carries Hector , with his 17 - year - old sister Antoinette Sithole at his side .
For Sithole , the events of that day are still fresh in her memory .
" The demonstration was meant for high school and secondary schools only , not the younger ones , " Sithole told CNN .
" But on the day , as we 're protesting with pride , holding placards , singing and chanting , at some point we find younger ones .
" All of a sudden there was a shot .
Everybody ran amok in confusion , running for cover , dashing into other people 's homes .
During that hide - and - seek I saw my younger brother on the opposite side of the pavement .
" There was another shot , so we had to go back into hiding and unfortunately we went two separate ways .
When I came back to the pavement he was nowhere to be seen . "
Inside Africa : Uganda 's AIDS funding fight
Then , Sithole saw a crowd of students gathered around a man who was carrying a child .
" The first thing that I spotted was my brother 's shoes , so I quickly ran to the scene and joined them in running , " she said .
" So we 're running and I 'm trying to explain myself : ' This is my brother , who are you ?
Where are you taking him ? '
The man never said anything .
" Then I saw blood coming from the side of the mouth and I panicked .
My voice was harder -- ' who are you , ca n't you see my brother 's head ? '
He never said anything , just keep running . "
The shooting sparked off days of protests known as the Soweto uprisings , which many regard as the beginning of the end of the apartheid regime .
June 16 is now a national holiday in South Africa , known as Youth Day .
Now a guide at the Hector Pieterson memorial in Soweto , Sithole hopes to teach visitors about the sacrifices made there .
" Most people know our history , but do n't fully know it , " she told CNN .
" So they 're coming here and we sort of embrace with them what really happened because they 'll be seeing people like me , other people sharing the same story .
" It makes us proud and brave to talk about our history .
And the very same history brought the World Cup today . "
For Sithole , talking about the past is n't a burden , but rather a responsibility she feels compelled to take on .
" I sometimes feel like what happened to me was fate .
Maybe I was left to keep on telling what happened on that day .
" At first , I just felt like it was a death like any other death -- why should people comment so much ?
" I never really understood -- it took me years -- but now I 'm proud standing here .
Maybe it 's like I 'm a channel of the ancestors .
I was left behind to tell the story . "

The images showed chemical reactions in leaves that were not exposed to light
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Researchers in Poland say plants are able to remember and react to information on light intensity and quality by transmitting information from leaf to leaf .
The scientists , led by Professor Stanislaw Karpinski of the Warsaw University of Life Sciences , used fluorescence imaging to view the response of specimens of the Arabidopsisa plant to light shone on them .
They found that when light was shone on one leaf at the bottom of the plant the entire plant responded .
The response , in the form of a cascade of chemical reactions induced by the light , continued even after the light source was removed , suggesting the plant was remembering the information contained in the light .
Karpinski and colleagues discovered that when light is shone on a leaf a chemical reaction begins in one leaf cell and the reaction is immediately signaled to the rest of the plant by photo - electro - physiological signals ( PEPS ) from specialized cells called bundle sheath cells .
Karpinski said the cells function in a similar way to a nervous system in animals .
Professor Karpinski said animals have a “ network of neurons , synapses , electro - physiological circuits and memory , but plants have their network of chloroplasts ( connected by stromules ) , photo - electro - physiological signals transduced by bundle sheath cells , and cellular light memory . ”
Another discovery made by the team was that the plants responded differently to red , white and blue light .
Karpinski thought the different responses might produce chemical reactions that protected the plant against disease .
To test this idea the team shone light on the plant for an hour and then infected it with either bacteria or viruses .
The results showed that if plants were infected before having the light shone on them there was no resistance to the disease , but if the light was shone on them for an hour and then they were infected 24 hours later , the plants did resist the infection .
Karpinski said this demonstrated exposure to the light built up the plant ’s immunity to pathogens , and that they were able to adjust to varying light conditions .
Karpinski said that the quality of light varies from season to season and it appears the plants might use the information in the light to determine the season and immunize themselves against diseases prevalent at that time of year .
The findings were presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Experimental Biology in Prague , Czech Republic .

Tea Party Nation convention in Vegas postponed
By Amy Gardner
Tea Party Nation , the conservative organizer that put on the first big tea party convention in Nashville earlier this year , has postponed its upcoming convention in Las Vegas , which had been scheduled for mid-July .
Judson Phillips , the founder of Tea Party Nation , said the group will try to reschedule the convention in October .
He said many activists were interested in attending , but many also said they would not be able to come in July , when Las Vegas is likely to be baking in 100 - degree - plus weather .
( On Tuesday , Vegas was expected to hit a high of 106 degrees .
But remember , it 's a dry heat ! )
Phillips would not say how many people signed up to attend the convention , to which he'd hoped to attract as many as 2,000 participants .
He said it would be inaccurate to say that the convention was being canceled due to lack of interest .
Among the speakers who had been booked for the event were Andrew Breitbart , Lou Dobbs , Sharron Angle , Laura Ingraham and Tom Tancredo .
" The interest was there , but not for this particular window , " Phillips said .
" We looked at the ultimate goal , which was to drive up unity and turnout in advance of the election .
Coming up closer to the election , we 'll just have more of an impact . "
The group 's Nashville convention drew criticism both inside and outside the tea party movement in part because the cost to participate was high ( $ 549 , plus fees , hotel and transportation ) and in part because of the exorbitant speaking fee given to former Alaska governor Sarah Palin ( $ 100,000 ) .
Another tea party organizer , FreedomWorks , chose not to participate in the July convention in part because of that controversy .
It is unknown whether Freedomworks will partner with Tea Party Nation if the convention is held in October .
Flight of the Conchords stars Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie declined to return for a 3rd season of the HBO series , but they have been touring around the world and selling out most venues .
Which bodes well for Jermaine now that he ’s tuning up to play the villainous Yaz in Men in Black III , the sequel that is being fast - tracked by Columbia Pictures .
Will Smith stars with Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin , and Barry Sonnenfeld directs .
Clement will next be seen co-starring with Steve Carell in Dinner For Schmucks , the Jay Roach - directed DreamWorks comedy that Paramount distributes July 23 .
Both films are produced by Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald , who saw what work Clement was doing on Schmucks and lobbied for him to join MIB3 .

Not all child - development experts think smartphone and laptop use by parents is necessarily a bad thing , of course .
Parents have always had to divide their attention , and researchers point out that there ’s a difference between quantity and quality when it comes to conversations between parents and children .
“ It sort of comes back to quality time , and distracted time is not high - quality time , whether parents are checking the newspaper or their BlackBerry , ” said Frederick J. Zimmerman , a professor at the University of California , Los Angeles , School of Public Health who has studied how television can distract parents .
He also noted that smartphones and laptops may enable some parents to spend more time at home , which may , in turn , result in more , rather than less , quality time overall .
There is little research on how parents ’ constant use of such technology affects children , but experts say there is no question that engaged parenting  talking and explaining things to children , and responding to their questions  remains the bedrock of early childhood learning .
Betty Hart and Todd R. Risley ’s landmark 1995 book , “ Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children , ” shows that parents who supply a language - rich environment for their children help them develop a wide vocabulary , and that helps them learn to read .
The book connects language use at home with socioeconomic status .
According to its findings , children in higher socioeconomic homes hear an average of 2,153 words an hour , whereas those in working - class households hear only about 1,251 ; children in the study whose parents were on welfare heard an average of 616 words an hour .
The question is : Will devices like smartphones change that ?
Smartphone users tend to have higher incomes ; research from the Nielsen Company shows that they are twice as likely to make more than $ 100,000 a year than the average mobile subscriber .
If increased use of technology encroaches on the time that well - to - do families spend communicating with their children , some could become the victims of successes originally thought to help them .
[ This editorial originally appeared in issue 207 of Game Informer and is written by Ken Levine , a founding member of Irrational Games and one of the minds behind BioShock . ]
Since Roger Ebert wrote a post a few weeks ago entitled " Video Games Can Never Be Art , " the game - o- sphere has been abuzz with a broad range of rebuttals , assents , teeth - gnashing , and spleen venting .
Ebert spends several thousand words making it very clear that video games are n't worth his time .
Even the developer Ebert name checks in his article ( Kellee Santiago from thatgamecompany ) gets in on the act .
The very first line of her response proclaims " Roger Ebert wrote an article about me . "
Now excuse me for asking , Kellee , but you are an accomplished game developer .
You are a USC alum .
You are feted by your peers and your fans .
You are coming off Flower , an impressive release that garnered the attention of the entire industry .
You 're giving speeches at TED .
You 're a star .
And now you 're telling me that a watermark in your career is that Roger frigging Ebert deigned to slow down his chariot long enough to notice you ?
And not simply notice , but vigorously endeavor to establish that your career , your work , and your passion are essentially beneath his notice .
I read another thoughtful open letter to Mr. Ebert on a prominent gaming blog that , before getting around to effectively saying , " You sir , are a film critic , not a game critic , so piss off ! " spends several paragraphs name - dropping great filmmakers , as if to say , " See , Ebert ?
I know film , so I 'm worthy of your respect .
Take me seriously ! "
Jesus , Mary , and Miyamoto !
How insecure are we as an industry that we rush to seek validation not from our own peers , not even from creatives in other fields , but from critics in other fields , to tell us if what we 're doing is worthy of notice ?
Look , I was in high school once .
I spent the entire four years trying to match up with what I thought other people thought was cool and worthwhile .
And I was miserable because the things I loved were not deemed valuable .
Dungeons and Dragons ?
Lame !
Video games ?
Nerdy !
Comic books ?
Pathetic !
And so I hid my passions .
I tried to fit in .
I played sports and was terrible at them .
I tried to make friends with a collection of people whose only interests in the world amounted to Molly Hatchet records and Marlboro Lights .
I tried to make myself a part of things I did n't care about and sought the approval of people who looked down on me .
And I was miserable .
The sad truth is that once a new form of media shoots out of the womb , one of the first impulses it seeks to fulfill is validation .
Like me !
Approve of me !
Respect me !
Hey , I get it .
I went to Vassar .
I like a vigorous round of Socratic wankery as much as the next liberal arts undergrad .
But what I can't stand is the insecurity .
Are games art ?
Will they become art ?
What stage of development are we in as an art form ?
Are they more akin to George Melies ' A Voyage to the Moon or Welles ' Citizen Kane ?
What methodologies should we investigate to make a proper determination between the state of video games , Aristotelian aesthetics , and Robert McKee 's definition of good writing ?
Here 's my answer in three simple steps :
Remove the beret from the top of your head .
Throw said beret out the window .
Light a fire .
Into that fire toss your copy of Aristotle 's Poetics .
Crack open a two liter of Mountain Dew .
Snap into a Slim Jim .
Proceed to Xbox Live and shoot your best friend in the head with an M - 16 .
You 're a gaming geek .
Be proud of that .
You do n't need the " by your leave " of Roger Ebert , your loving parents , or the Library of Congress to validate your passion .
The world is changing .
I 've spent some time around Hollywood people lately , and I 've even thought of trying my hand at screenwriting again .
( I was a film scribe back in , oh , 1871 or so . )
But many studio exec types have told me that their dream is to have some big film director work with me to make a video game .
My response was , " Why on Earth would I want to do that ? "
The notion is as ridiculous as me calling up an established film director and saying , " Hey pal .
I 've never directed a film before , but how about I show up on set tomorrow and take you to school ? "
Do you really want two egos like me and some hotshot film director butting heads over health station recharge rates or jump heights ?
Honestly , I 'd expect that 10 minutes into the first meeting they 'd start to look like somebody who realizes they just mistakenly got on the wrong -- and very lengthy -- inter - continental flight .
Consider last E3 , when James Cameron spoke at the Ubisoft event .
Now , I love James Cameron .
He 's the man along with George Lucas who really created 90 percent of the methodologies for telling nerdy stories in big budget movies .
I constantly name check him and reference his work in story meetings at Irrational .
You put him and the Coen brothers in a room , and I 'd have trouble deciding which one I 'd want to make out with first .
But why was he pitching the Avatar game and not the guy who actually built the d**n thing ?
Look , if a BioShock movie gets made , I 'm sure there might be some people who would be interested in what I have to say about it .
But the focus would rightly be on the folks who made the frigging movie .
Why does the rest of the media world put the gaming baby in a corner ?
Because the game industry has an inferiority complex .
We know that the movie , television , book , and even comic book guys look at us like we 're some kind of junior varsity version of themselves .
" Hey , video games !
Are n't they cute ?
We should make one of them ! "
And why do they think of us this way ?
Because we encourage them to .
" The New York Times ran a page 37 story on GDC .
Somebody call my parents ! "
" Roger Ebert said we 're not art .
Get me my smelling salts ! "
Do games owe a debt to popular culture ?
Absolutely .
I can say that I am the biggest media w***e who ever walked this green Earth .
But popular culture today is gaming culture .
The social networks and forms of interaction of the Internet did n't gestate at some university or film studio .
The language of today 's youth was n't created by the Beatles or Public Enemy .
The ways people connect to each other through extended networks were n't conceived by some genius at General Electric .
No .
All of these things sprang from the nerd - o - scape .
They grew up on Usenet and tech blogs .
They sprung to life alongside headshots and tea -bagging .
They evolved naturally through a group of lonely dorks looking for people who shared their nerdy interests .
We do n't owe anything to anybody .
The future of entertainment is being envisioned not just by the games industry , but by a confluence of developers and gamers who 've interacted on BBSes and the Net since our hobby began .
And we 're just getting started .
Wait until we have had the time to develop that film and television had .
We 'll either be ruling the world , or we 'll be the Eberts , writing dismissive essays about the newest kind of media , which of course will be irrelevant and shallow .
That is something that we must not do , because that kind of thinking is the first step on the path to irrelevance .
But today is not that day .
Today is our time to realize the power of the medium we all love so much .
To paraphrase the elder Lebowski :
The revolution is over , Mr. Ebert .
The nerds won .
very well

Space : to President Obama , it 's an opportunity for nations to join gloved hands and perform a glorious multinational spacewalk , all for the good of science .
But he 's not ready to rule it out as a potential battlefield , either .
In the just - released National Space Policy for the United States of America ( PDF ) , Obama laid out a vision of a harmonious celestial order based around international cooperation for the advancement mutual interests – scientific research chief among them .
Space is treated as a heavenly commons , and access to it is , accordingly , not for any nation to deny to any other .
" As established in international law , there shall be no national claims of sovereignty over outer space or any celestial bodies , " the strategy reads .
So think of it as a document that lays out some intentions for how the U.S. – and other nations – ought to behave and not behave in space .
No intergalactic empires !
Sound bland ?
It should .
It represents a long tradition of U.S. presidential attitudes toward the celestial commons stretching back at least to the Carter era , as the Union of Concerned Scientists helpfully notes .
Well , with one big exception : George W. Bush .
Bush 's space strategy from 2006 was less about what all nations ought to do in space than what other nations better not stop the U.S. from doing in space .
" The United States rejects any claims to sovereignty by any nation over outer space or celestial bodies , or any portion thereof , and rejects any limitations on the fundamental right of the United States to operate in and acquire data from space , " it read .
And it was also less concerned with scientific research than it was with the national - security implications for the U.S. of access to space .
So that 's out .
But do n't get too excited , hippie .
The new strategy is less Federation of Planets and more Jedi .
It does n't explicitly reject the militarization of space , as many left - of - center policy analysts had hoped it might .
Instead , it views military aspects of space in a defensive context .
( And remember , there 's a classified annex to this paper . )
" The United States will employ a variety of measures to help assure the use of space for all responsible parties , and , consistent with the inherent right of self - defense , deter others from interference and attack , defend our space systems and contribute to the defense of allied spacesystems , and , " it reads , " if deterrence fails , defeat efforts to attack them . "
Still , that 's good enough for long - time space policy analyst Theresa Hitchens , who likes the new strategy 's return to the less - aggressive approach of 20th Century administrations .
" While the new Obama space policy does not directly support a treaty banning weapons in space as many in the international community have hoped , it does – in a 180 degree turn from the Bush administration policy – re-commit the United States to the open consideration of space arms control in language similar to the Reagan , Bush 1 and Clinton space policies .
This is a positive move . "
And the plan satisfies Defense Secretary Robert Gates , too , who praised it as presenting " the right space policies and priorities for our nation , and is also a pledge that the United States will maintain the leadership and capabilities in space imperative for our national security . "
So it 's like the conception of the Jedi from the Prequels .

Good afternoon everybody .
Never mind Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems , Roberto Martinez and Wigan Athletic take on the mantle of king - makers in the UK this afternoon .
Win or draw against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge this afternoon and they 'll leave the door ajar for Manchester United to barge through with victory over Stoke City at Old Trafford .
Lose and Chelsea will be crowned champions for the fourth time in their history , enabling John Terry to end his season horribilus on an upbeat note by hoisting the Premier League trophy skywards as his team - mates spray each other with champagne and pogo enthusiastically on a hastily erected plywood advertising hoarding .
Despite Wigan 's 3 - 1 win over Chelsea in September , the bookies do n't give them a prayer this afternoon ; they 're 25 - 1 shots to win today and 11 - 1 to draw .
Stranger things have happened , but top mathematicians have announced it would take a big - game choke of ( Zlatan Ibrahimovic + Thierry Henry ) x ( John Terry In The 2008 Champions League Final Penalty Shoot - Out + Greg Norman ) proportions for Carlo Ancelotti's merry men to mess up this afternoon .
As weirdness goes , it would be straight from David Lynch 's subconscious .
For the neutrals among us , it would also be very funny .
They 've won six of their last seven games , scoring 25 goals in the process , with their only reverse coming at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 17 April .
The teams
Chelsea ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : Cech , Ivanovic , Alex , Terry , Ashley Cole , Lampard , Ballack , Malouda , Kalou , Drogba , Anelka .
Subs : Hilario , Joe Cole , Zhirkov , Paulo Ferreira , Sturridge , Matic , Belletti .
Wigan ( 4 - 1 - 4- 1 ) : Pollitt , Melchiot , Gohouri , Caldwell , Figueroa , Boyce ,
McCarthy , Watson , Diame , N'Zogbia , Rodallega .
Subs : Stojkovic , Thomas , Scharner , Scotland , Moses , Cywka , Mostoe .
Referee : Martin Atkinson ( W Yorkshire )
Meanwhile on Sky Sports :
Over a bespoke commentary from Channel 4 racing 's Derek " Tommo " Thompson , they 're showing a montage featuring clips from assorted Manchester United and Chelsea matches throughout the season , cutting occasionally to footage of two racehorses galloping upsides each other neck - and - neck .
It 's been a two - horse race , see ?
See ?
Meanwhile in Italy : It 's Bologna 1 - 1 Catania with two minutes to go .
The draw on that game was priced up at 1 - 3 ( it would normally be about 5 - 2 or 3 - 1 ) and the 1 - 1 draw was even - money ( it would normally be 7 - 1 or 8 - 1 ) .
For all the Premier League 's shortcomings , if a fix like that took place there 'd be uproar , followed by investigations , inquiries and suspensions / bans .
In Italy it 's so routine such results are greeted with shoulder - shrugs all round .
Not long now :
The teams are lined up in the tunnel , awaiting the call to arms .
Chelsea 's players are wearing their customary home strip of blue shirts and shorts , with white socks .
Wigan 's wear orange shirts and socks , with black shorts .
How they 'll line up : Expect Chelsea to play a 4 - 3 - 3 with Michael Ballack in the centre of midfield flanked by Frank Lampard on the right and Florent Malouda on his left .
Ahead of this trio , Didier Drogba will be supported by Salomon Kalou on the right wing and Nicolas Anelka on the left .
Wigan will play a 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 , with Steve Gouhouri patrolling the area in front of the back four and James McCarthy and Charles Nzogbia bookending Ben Watson and Mohamed Diame in a midfield four supporting lone frontman Hugo Rodallega .
1 min : Game on .
Forget what I said about Wigan 's line - up , they 're playing three across the back : Gohouri , Boyce and Caldwell , with right - back Mario Melchiot and left - back Maynor Figueroa playing high up the field .
2 min : Nothing much of note happening at the moment , with most of the play taking place in the middle third as both teams pass , probe and prod in a bid to see what the lie of the land is early doors .
3 min : Michael Ballack steps in to intercept a wayward long pass out of defence from Emmerson Boyce , but then gives away possession himself .
Chelsea win it back and Salomon Kalou goes on a storming run before getting brought down by Mohamed Diame about seven or eight yards outside the Wigan penalty area .
Free - kick for Chelsea .
GOAL ! Chelsea 1 - 0 Wigan ( Anelka 6 ) Drogba fires the free - kick into the wall , it ricochets up in the air , Lampard heads it back into the mixer where Florent Malouda does well to hold off Gary Caldwell and chest the ball down for Nicolas Anelka to smash a volley past Pollitt from about eight yards out .
8 min :
Any nerves Chelsea might have had going into this game must surely have been dissipated by that early goal .
This could turn into a rout .
9 min :
In all the excitement I forgot to mention that Malouda was offside when Lampard headed that rebound into the edge of the six - yard box in the build - up to the goal .
It should n't have stood .
10 min : Wigan have responded well to their early setback .
First Charles Nzogbia curls a shot high and wide , then they win a corner .
It 's pulled back to Maynor Figueroa who tries to dink it into the box .
Alex clears .
11 min : " Here 's how China sees things , " writes Martin Stannard .
" Chelsea are almost certain to win the title today , but rather than show that happen , Chinese TV is showing Manchester United v. Stoke .
The word ' marketing ' comes to mind . "
14 min : Michael Ballack has a very frank exchange of views with the linesman patrolling the Chelsea half of the field , almost going nose to nose with him when the official has the temerity to award Wigan a free - kick instead of Chelsea the throw - in the German felt they deserved .
The ball 's sent into the mixer , a brief game of head tennis ensues and eventually it goes wide .
15 min : John
Terry goes close when a long - range free - kick floated into the Wigan penalty area by Frank Lampard dropped kindly , but not quite kindly enough , for him .
He stuck out a toe to try and prod it goalwards but the ball was this much out of reach .
Wigan clear .
18 min : Possession stats : Wigan 57 % - 43 % Chelsea .
No , really .
19 min : Wigan win a throw - in on the edge of the final third and pass their way backwards into their own half .
Like a stoner who 's run out of Rizlas , they 've lots of possession , but are n't sure what to do with it .
20 min : Ben Watson plays Hugo Rodallega through on goal with a defence - splitting pass from about 25 yards out , but the Colombian is correctly flagged for offside .
22 min : Without a shadow of a doubt , it 's all Wigan Athletic at the moment .
They 're bossing Chelsea in the possession stats , they 're stroking the ball around admirably and are just one or two decent killer passes away from restoring parity .
24 min : " Perhaps there 's more United fans in China ? " asks Adam Walker in response to Martin Stannards email , not exactly blowing the theory that marketing is the main motivation for it being broadcast over there .
" Perhaps they realise the Utd game has a better chance of being entertaining ( which at this moment , it 's pretty high octane and very entertaining ) while Chelsea games have a tendency to bore people to sleep ? "
26 min : Drogba charges down the inside right channel before pulling a cross back from the touchline .
Wigan goalkeeper Pollitt blocks the ball at his near post and puts it out for a corner from which nothing comes .
Drogba 's momentum carries him into and over an advertising hoarding behind the goal , where he has a brief chat and a laugh with a nice lady in whose lap he landed .
28 min : From the left wing , Anelka squares a ball across the edge of the six - yard box where Ashley Cole and Drogba are waiting .
At the near post , the unmarked Cole tries to back - heel it home with his left foot a la Joe Cole - against - Manchester United but makes a pig ear of his effort , then behind him Drogba misses it completely .
29 min : Penalty for Chelsea after Frank Lampard is dragged to ground in the box by Gary Caldwell .
Red card for Caldwell and a spot - kick for Lampard .
GOAL ! Chelsea 2 - 0 Wigan Athletic ( Lampard 32 ) Lampard shoots a low , unstoppable outswinger into the bottom left - hand corner .
All is not well on Planet Chelsea , however : Didier Drogba has his big sulky - head on because he was n't allowed to take it .
He and Wayne Rooney are level on 26 goals each in the race to the golden boot , with Darren Bent two behind on 24 .
34 min : On Sky , match analyst and self - confessed Premier League cheerleader Andy Gray is saying that Frank Lampard was right not to let Drogba take the penalty , because it was more important " to get the game won " than help the Ivorian win the golden boot .
The way he 's going on you 'd swear Drogba was some sort of uncoordinated halfwit who 's incapable of putting one foot in front of the other without falling over ( insert gag about diving here ) , as opposed to one of the world 's greatest strikers who 's probably more than capable of beating Wigan 's third - choice goalkeeper with a dead ball from 12 yards out .
39 min : Branislav
Ivanovic slaloms down the right flank , beating three of Wigan 's 10 men before losing his balance and falling over .
That was a waste of time .
39 min : " I beg to differ with Martin Stannard , " writes Aelred Doyle , determined to prolong what is arguably the most tedious , pointless debate in the history of minute - by - minute reporting .
" I 'm here in Shanghai watching Chelsea v Wigan on the Shanghai sports channel .
CCTV5 , the national sports channel , is showing Inter Milan on tape delay .
Is he watching on a sneaky illegal satellite rather than actual Chinese television ? "
41 min :
The camera pans to Didier Drogba , who is quite clearly continuing to simmer and seethe over not being allowed to take that penalty .
Once Lampard had put it away he ran over to his team - mate , cupped his face in his hands and said something to him .
I 'm no lip - reader , but I could definitely make out the word " promise " - he 's obviously given Drogba dibs on any future penalties Chelsea get .
43 min : Mohamed Diame takes the ball off Ballack in midfield and bursts through the middle , only for his momentum to get the better of him and force him into a speed - wobble that gives Ballack time to recover and avert the danger before the Wigan midfielder can unleash a shot .
44 min : Booking I have n't got around to mentioning yet : Steve Gohouri for a foul on Salomon Kalou .
44+3 min: Mike Pollitt launches the ball down the field , prompting the referee to blow for half - time .
Premier League champions elect Chelsea are 2 - 0 up against 10 - man Wigan Athletic at home .
Could we not just hand John
Terry the trophy now so we can all get on with our lives ?
Incidentally , my colleague Rob Smyth reckons
Terry will go up to receive the trophy shirtless , all the better to show off his only remaining captain 's armband .
He 's a very cynical man , is Rob .
Half - time
Oh dear , oh dear : I 've just seen what is probably the most corporate shill - tastic lager advert ever made .
Those shamelessly taking the C******* g dollar : Jack Charlton , Kelly Holmes , Phil Taylor , Steve Davis , Trevor Brooking , Stuart Pearce , Nigel Benn , Clive Woodward , Steve Redgrave , the guitarist from Kasabian , Ian Botham , Bobby Robson 's estate and Ellen MacArthur .
A lot of knights and dames of the realm in there - I wonder does that push their fee up ?
It 's all very grubby .
Half - time comments
" It 's good of the Premier League to allow Martin Atkinson to ref at Stamford Bridge today , " says Leon Davies .
" Is this so he can join in the celebrations and collect the winners medal he earned in the two decisive games against United . "
" Is it just me , or could these flag - waving pre-world cups ads with various notables giving up their dignity for coin have the capacity to become tiresome ? " asks Tom Hopkins .
" If marketing is the explanation for why Manchester United is on Chinese television ( and I do n't disagree ) then what 's the explanation for the fact that here in the US on ESPN we 're watching West Ham vs. Man City ? " asks JOhn Speranza , before inviting readers to " Insert joke about ESPN 's football savvy here . "
" If Wigan are like stoners without a Rizla then Chelsea must be a bunch of nervous , sweaty smackheads who keep having to score , " writes Ben Bamford .
Second half : Chelsea 's 45 - minute victory parade is underway .
It would , after all , be completely unthinkable for Wigan to come back from 2 - 0 down against a Big Four side to draw or even win , eh Arsenal fans ?
47 min :
The ball 's crossed into the Wigan Athletic box , where Frank Lampard ( toe ) and Nic Anelka ( head ) combine to steer it on to the Wigan crossbar .
Even if they 'd scored , it would n't have counted .
Anelka was offside .
48 min :
It will be interesting to see whether Didier Drogba brought the childish petulant hissy - fit that hampered his performance in the last 15 minutes of the first half into this period or left it in the dressing room .
He 's a great player , [ minute - by - minute commentator adopts most pompous tone ] but one who 's in danger of spoiling his legacy by being remembered as a big baby .
51 min : Kalou charges down the inside right channel and shoots from a narrow angle when he probably should have crossed to Drogba at the far post .
Wide .
Moments previously , Charles Nzobia got booked for a pull on Ashley Cole 's shirt .
53 min : " Is newly confirmed Chelsea fan and prime minister in waiting Dave Cameron at the match ? " asks our old friend Alison Jeeves , who ( wo ) mans the turnstiles at London 's O2 Arena .
" Surely he will want to hand over the trophy , should it come to that .
There is a joke about crosses in boxes somewhere but I can't locate it . "
GOAL ! Chelsea 3 - 0 Wigan Athletic ( Kalou 54 ) Salomon Kalou peels off his shirt and sprints off in celebration after starting and finishing a marvellous move in which Frank Lampard 's role was pivotal .
Kalou charged down the right channel , played the ball out to Lampard on his left and then continued his into the box to pick up the return pass and slot the ball into the bottom left - hand corner from about 14 yards out .
GOAL ! Chelsea 4 - 0 Wigan Athletic ( Anelka 55 min )
That 's a great goal .
A corner 's played short ( ish ) to Branislav Ivanovic , who sends a sweeping cross - field pass to Anelka at the far post , about 15 yards out .
He swivels , putting his foot through the ball and volleying a shot into the ground and up past Mike Pollitt in the Wigan goal .
58 min : Chelsea substitutions : Joe Cole and Juliano Belletti on , Salomon Kalou and Branislav Ivanovic off .
59 min : Didier Drogba blows an excellent chance to make the Golden Boot his own , but miscontrols a marvellous long pass into the Wigan penalty area from - I think - Frank Lampard in midfield .
The ball squirts away from him when a more deft touch would almost certainly have resulted in a goal .
60 min : Joe Cole splits the Wigan defence with a pass up the right flank , releasing Drogba .
He shoots diagonally across the face of goal and wide of the far post .
61 min : Chelsea take their foot of the gas for long enough for me to inform you that ( a ) Manchester United are 3 - 0 up against Stoke City , for all the good it will do them and ( b ) Salomon Kalou got booked after scoring his goal for removing his shirt , despite referee 's assistant John Terry putting in a good word for him .
GOAL ! Chelsea 5 - 0 Wigan Athletic ( Drogba 62 ) Drogba perks up considerably after putting himself in the box - seat to win the Golden Boot , heading home a looping cross to the far post from Frank Lampard from all of three feet out .
It was unfrotunate for Wigan goalkeeper Mike Pollitt , who had saved sensationally from a Drogba bicycle - kick seconds previously .
The ball was n't cleared , ended up with Lampard at the far post and he put it on a plate for his sulky team - mate .
That 's Chelsea 's 100th goal of this Premier League campaign .
66 min : Penalty for Chelsea .
Ashley Cole goes down in the box under a challenge from ... somebody .
Apologies , I did n't see who .
GOAL ! Chelsea 6 - 0 Wigan Athletic ( Drogba 68 ) Drogba smashes the ball home off the left upright , showing Sky experts Andy Gray , Glenn Hoddle , Jamie Redknapp and Richard Keys that he's not the liability they seem to have him pegged for when it comes to taking penalties .
If it had been John Terry who'd been wailing and moaning about not being allowed to take one they might have had a point .
70 min : Chelsea substitution : youthful Serbian midfield playmaker Nemanja Matic on , excitable German ref-botherer Michael Ballack off .
71 min : Wigan substitution : Paul Scharner on for his last Wigan appearance , I did n't see who was granted a merciful release from the last 20 minutes .
73 min : " John Terry can accept the trophy naked as far as I care .
100 goals , what has your team done , then ? " asks Damien Neva .
Apart from scoring 100 league goals in one season well over a century before Chelsea managed it , my team has n't done much .
Sunderland do n't follow precedents , they set them .
75 min : Didier Drogba 's just been booked for persistant fouling .
At Old Trafford , Wayne Rooney 's just been substituted , which means Drogba will definitely win the Golden Boot unless Darren Bent 's banged in five or six for Sunderland against Wolves .
I 'm going to go out on a limb and guess that has n't happened .
77 min : Joe Cole helps a Florent Malouda cross from the left on its way to Didier Drogba at the far post , but the Ivorian miscontrols , possibly because there 's a bit too much spin on the ball after Cole 's intervention .
78 min : Please
God let somebody have got a photo of that .
The electrics in one of the linesmens ' flags went on the blink , which meant a replacement had to be relayed across the pitch by assorted Chelsea players .
John
Terry carried it on the final leg of its journey , waving it for yuks as he approached the linesman .
It quite suited him .
GOAL ! Chelsea 7 - 0 Wigan Athletic ( Drogba 79 ) Matic charges down the right , crosses to Joe Cole at the far post , who sends it back across the face of goal for Drogba to poke home from about six yards out .
This is brutal .
Drogba sprints over and starts strumming the corner flag like it was a guitar , while Florent Malouda stands behind him playing imaginary drums .
It 's probably fair to say that 's the title wrapped up .
84 min : Wigan substitution : Victor Moses on , I have no idea who went off .
It 's difficult to keep up here , to be honest .
84 min : " I 'd assumed a Chelsea player had the linesman 's flag from the 1st minute , seeing a replay of their opening goal , " writes Adam Walker .
85 min : Victor Moses brings a top - drawer save out of Petr Cech with a long - range surface - to - air screamer that the Chelsea goalkeeper is forced to tip over his own crossbar .
86 min : Chelsea leave three players on the halfway line for the ensuing corner , forcing Wigan to leave three of their nine available outfield players back marking them .
That 's just bullying , like kicking a blind man 's stick .
89 min : Assorted Chelsea players Chelsea stroke the ball around as they await the final whistle which will confirm their status as champions .
GOAL ! Chelsea 8 - 0 Wigan Athletic ( A Cole 90 )
But there 's still time for one more goal as Ashley Cole smashes home a 20 yard left - foot volley after getting on the end of a cross from his namesake Joe , who performed heroics to keep the ball in play down by the touchline adjacent to the right upright before providing the assist .
That 's a marvellous goal .
Full - time :
It 's all over - having scored seven goals three times this season , Chelsea mark the occasion of winning their fourth league title by going one better and scoring eight - that 's an emphatic victory , to say the least .
They win the 2009 - 10 Premier League title by one point from Manchester United , scoring 103 goals in the process - a fair old achievement by any standards .
Post - match niceties :
As One Step Beyond by Madness blares out over the Tannoy , Stamford Bridge starts rocking in full - on party mode as a couple of lads on quad bikes tow the constiuent parts of a giant plywood Barclays advert out into the centre - circle on trailers .
As difficult as it might seem to believe , some uncharacteristically exuberant Chelsea fans are singing , stamping their feet and waving their scarves .
The presentation
As some remarkably ugly Chelsea fans spot themselves on the big screen and begin celebrating effusively , the Premier League trophy and a big tray of medals are brought on to the pitch by some men dressed in military uniforms .
Unlike the man in military uniform who was accompanying BNP leader Nick Griffin as he campaigned before the General Election , I think these lads are actual soldiers .
Here we go : Assorted coaching staff , kitmen , tea ladies Nemanja Matic ( he has n't made enough appearances to win a medal ) get their handshakes and take their bow , before the Chelsea senior squad , led by manager Carlo Ancelotti , emerge from the tunnel and receive their winners ' medals .
Didier Drogba tries to hog the limelight as much as possible by hanging back until third last , then ducking out of line to kiss the trophy on his way to the rostrum .
Next up is vice - captain Frank Lampard , followed by captain John Terry , who is wearing a shirt .
They grab a handle each and hoist the Premier League trophy skywards , prompting an explosion of ticker - tape and the usual champagne - spraying and pogoing behind the obliogatory Barclaycard hoarding .
Didier Drogba 's determination to make this afternoon all about him shows no sign of letting up .
He sprints across the field with jeroboam of champagne in hand and clambers / is dragged into the warm embrace of the crowd .
After being fished out by Fun Police constables in official Chelsea fluorescent jackets , he stretches out in front of the Barclaycard hoarding , hogging the limelight while his team - mates jump up and down behind it .
Anyway , that 's another league season over , Chelsea are champions and Didier is the winner of the Golden Boot , so he has every right to be pleased with himself .
That 's all from me - enjoy what 's left of your weekend ... unless you 're reading this on Monday and it 's already over .

Android SurfaceFlinger Tricks for Fun and Profit Thursday July 1 , 2010
Some Android phones are now shipping with OLED displays , such as Nexus One , the Droid Incredible , and the Samsung Galaxy .
Organic LED displays have separate pixel elements for each color channel ( red , green , and blue ) , and each channel has a different efficiency .
Take , for example , the Nexus One .
If powering only the red pixels at full intensity draws a current “ i ” , then powering all green pixels draws “ 1.5i ” , and all blue pixels “ 2i ” .
( These ratios are derived from empirical measurements , and do n’t hold in all cases . )
Also , it ’s worth noting that OLED displays do n’t have backlights like LCD , meaning that darker colors draw less power .
If you could power only the red pixels you could save quite a bit of power .
So I started poking around SurfaceFlinger , the low - level window compositer on Android .
I brushed off my OpenGL skills and after a few hours I had simple proof - of - concept .
A couple hours later I had several filters between red-only and full - color :
I plugged the phone into an industrial power meter which takes very accurate current measurements , and started looking at the power needed for various color modes :
Baseline ( mA ) Default ( mA ) Red-only ( mA ) Green - only ( mA ) Blue- only ( mA ) Amber ( mA ) Salmon ( mA ) Launcher 86.4 148.4 40.0 58.4 86.5 64.3 66.3 Browser 86.4 344.5 96.7 145.2 194.0 156.5 148.7 Maps 86.4 286.5 95.1 131.9 156.7 139.0 132.9 Settings 86.4 41.0 14.3 19.1 19.9 20.3 20.5 Email 86.4 337.1 94.4 142.4 187.1 153.6 146.2 Gallery 86.4 140.4 78.6 83.1 90.1 90.3 87.8 Average % of Default , OLED - only 35 % 46 % 56 % 49 % 48 % Best - case % of Default , including overall system baseline 42 % 54 % 65 % 56 % 55 %
All measurements taken in airplane mode with GPS disabled .
“ Baseline ” is the current used when showing Launcher with a SurfaceFlinger mask causing all pixels to be rendered black .
( That is , everything along the pipeline was being exercised except the actual OLED pixels . )
Filtering to show only red pixels only requires 35 % of the original baseline OLED panel current , on average .
Adding back the baseline current , the best case overall is about 42 % of the original system current , effectively doubling the battery life .
Also , showing only red pixels doubles as an awesome night vision mode , perfect for astronomy . 🙂
If you ’d like some other colors added back in , the amber and salmon filters can help , while still offering about 56 % of the original system current .
It ’s also worth noting that the Nexus One OLED display uses a PenTile pixel layout , giving it twice as many directly - addressable green pixels as red and blue .
Thus the Green - only filter results in the visually sharpest text .
The actual SurfaceFlinger patch is straightforward , mostly living in LayerBase ::drawWithOpenGL ( ) .
There is another patch to Development that adds options in Dev Tools for controlling it at runtime .
It also reads from the sf.render_effect system property at boot .
The patches are contributed to the AOSP under the Apache 2.0 license , and cleanly apply to the freshly released froyo branch .
Feel free to integrate them into your own tree to experiment , but note that you ’ll need SurfaceFlinger to render in OpenGL mode , which might not be possible without specific hardware drivers .
The phone is n’t any less responsive when using these filters , but visually it can take time for your eyes to adjust .
It ’s more of a geeky hack , but hopefully you ’ll find it useful .
Here ’s a rather remarkable story , courtesy of Eurosport :
North Korean flops shamed in public North Korea ’s football squad have been subjected to a public humiliation in the wake of their World Cup failure .
The team lost all three games in South Africa , where they were making their first World Cup finals appearance since 1966 .
They took the stage at the People ’s Palace of Culture in the capital Pyongyang while 400 students subjected them to a six - hour reprimand .
Reports claim coach Kim Jong - Hun was made to work on a building site and expelled from the Workers ’ Party of Korea .
He was blamed for “ betraying the trust of Kim Jong - Un ” , one of dictator Kim Jong - Il ’s sons , after the country went into the tournament with high hopes of qualifying from the so - called ‘ Group of Death ’ .
The criticism was led by Ri Dong - Kyu , a commentator for state TV , which made the 7 - 0 drubbing at the hands of Portugal its first ever live sports broadcast .
The decision to show the game live came in the wake of an encouraging 2 - 1 defeat to Brazil .
North Korea lost their final game 3 - 0 to Ivory Coast .
Radio Free Asia claimed the dressing - down took place on July 2 , but news only leaked out of the famously secretive country this week .
Japanese - born pair Jong Tae - Se and An Yong - Hak escaped censure , flying straight to Japan from South Korea .
A source from South Korea ’s intelligence community told the Chosun Ilbo newspaper : “ In the past , North Korean athletes and coaches who performed badly were sent to prison camps .
Considering the high hopes North Koreans had for the World Cup , the regime could have done worse things to the team than just reprimand them for their ideological shortcomings . ”
Apparently this took place on July 2 , when I was actually in North Korea ( I was n’t in Pyongyang , though ) .
Needless to say , the topic of their national team ’s dismal performance in the World Cup was not a welcome topic of conversation with our official minders .
I particularly like the part in the article about the two Japanese - born Koreans being smart enough to fly back home to Japan directly .
Good call .
But as strange as it may seem , this odd story is not without serious import .
Note that the report says the team ” betrayed the trust of Kim Jong - Un ” — the son of current ( and ailing ) leader Kim Jong - Il , who is being set up to succeed him .
That ’s something you never would have heard before .
Until very recently , Kim Jong - Il ’s sons were never mentioned publicly , in fact North Koreans were never even told , in any official propaganda , that he even had any offspring at all .
The fact that this public “ shaming ” was done in the son ’s name , not the father ’s , is actually a very significant political message meant to solidify the anticipated succession , and signal that a changing of the guard is underway .
The other hint that a passing of the torch is imminent is a huge bronze statue of Kim Jong - Il that was recently unveiled .
Until now , Kim Jong
- Il has not allowed any public statues of himself , only of his own father Kim Il - Sung ( who founded the North Korean regime , and died in 1994 ) .
During both of my visits to the DPRK , I only saw one statue of Kim Jong - Il , in the huge underground vault devoted to displaying all the diplomatic gifts he has received ( there ’s another , even larger vault dedicated to his father ’s gifts ) .
Professor Toshimitsu Shigemura , an expert on North Korean politics at Tokyo ’s Waseda University , told the Telegraph that “ this statue means that Kim Jong - Il is passing into history and legend in North Korea and I ’m more convinced than ever that his successor will be announced soon . ”
The official naming of Kim Jong - Un as the heir apparent is expected to take place at a big party meeting in September .
Jong - Un , who reportedly attended school in Switzerland under an assumed name , is only 27 or 28 years old , and if his father were to die , would become the world ’s youngest head of state .

As announced last week , Alaskan wireless carriers ACS and GCI today made the Android 2.1 upgrade available for their respective customers to download through their websites .
Before jumping on the bandwagon , you may want to ask " what 's new " and is the upgrade worth it ?
According to ACS , these are some of the things you 'll find in 2.1 : For now , both companies require that a Windows machine is used for the upgrade .
ACS also offers in - store assistance for those that need help with the upgrade .
To download the respective updates , visit the below pages :
If you 're one of those that do n't have access to a Windows computer and do n't feel like going to a store , here 's a suggestion for how to install the ACS update no matter what computer you have :

Some of the biggest Internet brands have declared their love for BitTorrent in recent months .
Both Facebook and Twitter are using BitTorrent to update their networks and not without success .
In Twitter 's new setup the BitTorrent - powered system has made their server deployment 75 times faster than before .
Large scale web - services such as Twitter need thousands of servers to manage the flow of updates sent out by their millions of users .
As a result , keeping all these servers updated with the latest data can be time and resource intensive .
To improve the deployment of files across their servers , Twitter recently called in the help of BitTorrent .
After having considered several scalable deployment options , BitTorrent turned out to be the only candidate that met their standards .
“ It was time for something completely different , something decentralized , something more like ..
BitTorrent .. running inside of our datacenter to quickly copy files around , ” Twitter engineer Larry Gadea explains .
With BitTorrent , Twitter hoped to distribute files faster and more efficiently , saving time and precious resources while improving the scalability of Twitter ’s operation .
Earlier this year the new BitTorrent - powered system was rolled out and did n’t fail to impress .
“ Using the file - sharing protocol , we launched a side - project called Murder and after a few days ( and especially nights ) of nervous full - site tinkering , it turned a 40 minute deploy process into one that lasted just 12 seconds , ” Gadea commented .
Twitter ’s Goes BitTorrent
BitTorrent is 75 times faster when compared to the old server deployment system , reducing deployments across thousands of servers to just a few seconds .
With BitTorrent , every server not only downloads the new files , but also becomes a distribution point that helps to spread it to others .
Larry Gadea , who says he’s an avid BitTorrent user himself with experience of downloading tons of Linux ISOs , named Twitter ’s new deployment system ‘ Murder ’ after a flock of crows .
The code is based on the BitTornado BitTorrent client and available to the public and licensed under the free software Apache License .
The BitTornado client was chosen as the base code for its openness , Gadea explained , so Twitter can redistribute their code to other developers without running into licensing issues .
It ’s beginning to look like BitTorrent may become the standard for large - scale networks wanting to update their machines quickly and efficiently .
With huge brands such as Facebook and Twitter adopting it , we can only expect that others will follow their lead .
Twitter ’s Larry Gadea explains a bit more about the Murder setup in the presentation he gave at the Canadian University Software Engineering Conference earlier this year .
CBS , NBC ( Rightly ) Reject “ Ground Zero ” Mosque Ad
Doug Mataconis · · No comments
CBS and NBC are refusing to air an ad against the building of a Muslim cultural center that some are , incorrectly , calling simply a mosque in downtown Manhattan :
CBS and NBC have refused to air a provocative ad from the confrontational , well - funded National Republican Trust PAC that calls on Americans to oppose the building of a mosque two blocks from the World Trade Center site .
The ad — which has about 100,000 views on YouTube — intersperses some of the most horrifying images from the Sept. 11 attacks with the sounds of Muslim prayer and images of Muslim militants .
It focuses on what ’s become a divisive — and partisan — issue in New York state , the erection of a Muslim cultural center on Park Place , in the neighborhood near the fallen towers .
“ On Sept. 11 , they declared war against us , ” the ad ’s narrator says .
“ And to celebrate that murder of 3,000 Americans , they want to build a monstrous 13 - story mosque at ground zero . ”
In her letter rejecting the spot , NBC Universal advertising standards manager Jennifer Riley wrote : “ An ad questioning the wisdom of building a mosque at ground zero would meet our issues of public controversy advertising criteria .
However , this ad which ambiguously defines ‘ they ’ as referenced in the spot makes it unclear as to whether the reference is to terrorists or to the Islamic religious organization that is sponsoring the building of the mosque .
Consequently , the ad is not acceptable under our guidelines for broadcast . ”
The ad , which alternates between various images of the September 11th attacks and other acts of terrorism and refers to both the terrorists and the people building the center as “ they ” is below :
As a matter of law , of course , the networks are perfectly within their rights to reject any ad for any reason — with certain legal limitations that require them to accept ads from political candidates — but in this particular case I think the decision was entirely appropriate .
The campaign against this center , Mosque , or whatever you want to call it has been tinged with anti-Muslim rhetoric from the beginning and this ad plays that bigotry to the hilt .
It ’s not even accurate to call this a “ Ground Zero ” mosque , of course , because the building in question is several blocks away from site of the former World Trade Center .
From my perspective , the answer to the question about whether or not the mosque should be built is simple —
Do they own the property ?
If they do , they should be free to do whatever they wish with it .
Too bad the right ’s adherence to property rights is so selective .

Good evening .
This is a special night for me .
Exactly 3 years ago , on July 15 , 1976 , I accepted the nomination of my party to run for President of the United States .
I promised you a President who is not isolated from the people , who feels your pain , and who shares your dreams and who draws his strength and his wisdom from you .
During the past 3 years I 've spoken to you on many occasions about national concerns , the energy crisis , reorganizing the Government , our Nation 's economy , and issues of war and especially peace .
But over those years the subjects of the speeches , the talks , and the press conferences have become increasingly narrow , focused more and more on what the isolated world of Washington thinks is important .
Gradually , you 've heard more and more about what the Government thinks or what the Government should be doing and less and less about our Nation 's hopes , our dreams , and our vision of the future .
Ten days ago I had planned to speak to you again about a very important subject - energy .
For the fifth time I would have described the urgency of the problem and laid out a series of legislative recommendations to the Congress .
But as I was preparing to speak , I began to ask myself the same question that I now know has been troubling many of you .
Why have we not been able to get together as a nation to resolve our serious energy problem ?
It 's clear that the true problems of our Nation are much deeper - deeper than gasoline lines or energy shortages , deeper even than inflation or recession .
And I realize more than ever that as President I need your help .
So , I decided to reach out and listen to the voices of America .
I invited to Camp David people from almost every segment of our society - business and labor , teachers and preachers , Governors , mayors , and private citizens .
And then I left Camp David to listen to other Americans , men and women like you .
It has been an extraordinary 10 days , and I want to share with you what I 've heard .
First of all , I got a lot of personal advice .
Let me quote a few of the typical comments that I wrote down .
This from a southern Governor : " Mr. President , you are not leading this Nation - you 're just managing the Government . "
" You do n't see the people enough any more . "
" Some of your Cabinet members do n't seem loyal .
There is not enough discipline among your disciples . "
" Do n't talk to us about politics or the mechanics of government , but about an understanding of our common good . "
" Mr. President , we 're in trouble .
Talk to us about blood and sweat and tears . "
" If you lead , Mr. President , we will follow . "
Many people talked about themselves and about the condition of our Nation .
This from a young woman in Pennsylvania : " I feel so far from government .
I feel like ordinary people are excluded from political power . "
And this from a young Chicano : " Some of us have suffered from recession all our lives . "
" Some people have wasted energy , but others have n't had anything to waste . "
And this from a religious leader : " No material shortage can touch the important things like God 's love for us or our love for one another . "
And I like this one particularly from a black woman who happens to be the mayor of a small Mississippi town : " The big - shots are not the only ones who are important .
Remember , you can't sell anything on Wall Street unless someone digs it up somewhere else first . "
This kind of summarized a lot of other statements : " Mr. President , we are confronted with a moral and a spiritual crisis . "
Several of our discussions were on energy , and I have a notebook full of comments and advice .
I 'll read just a few .
" We can't go on consuming 40 percent more energy than we produce .
When we import oil we are also importing inflation plus unemployment . "
" We 've got to use what we have .
The Middle East has only 5 percent of the world 's energy , but the United States has 24 percent . "
And this is one of the most vivid statements : " Our neck is stretched over the fence and OPEC has a knife . "
" There will be other cartels and other shortages .
American wisdom and courage right now can set a path to follow in the future . "
This was a good one : " Be bold , Mr. President .
We may make mistakes , but we are ready to experiment . "
And this one from a labor leader got to the heart of it : " The real issue is freedom .
We must deal with the energy problem on a war footing . "
And the last that I 'll read : " When we enter the moral equivalent of war , Mr. President , do n't issue us BB guns . "
These 10 days confirmed my belief in the decency and the strength and the wisdom of the American people , but it also bore out some of my longstanding concerns about our Nation 's underlying problems .
I know , of course , being President , that government actions and legislation can be very important .
That 's why I 've worked hard to put my campaign promises into law - and I have to admit , with just mixed success .
But after listening to the American people I have been reminded again that all the legislation in the world can't fix what 's wrong with America .
So , I want to speak to you first tonight about a subject even more serious than energy or inflation .
I want to talk to you right now about a fundamental threat to American democracy .
I do not mean our political and civil liberties .
They will endure .
And I do not refer to the outward strength of America , a nation that is at peace tonight everywhere in the world , with unmatched economic power and military might .
The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways .
It is a crisis of confidence .
It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will .
We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our Nation .
The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America .
The confidence that we have always had as a people is not simply some romantic dream or a proverb in a dusty book that we read just on the Fourth of July .
It is the idea which founded our Nation and has guided our development as a people .
Confidence in the future has supported everything else - public institutions and private enterprise , our own families , and the very Constitution of the United States .
Confidence has defined our course and has served as a link between generations .
We 've always believed in something called progress .
We 've always had a faith that the days of our children would be better than our own .
Our people are losing that faith , not only in government itself but in the ability as citizens to serve as the ultimate rulers and shapers of our democracy .
As a people we know our past and we are proud of it .
Our progress has been part of the living history of America , even the world .
We always believed that we were part of a great movement of humanity itself called democracy , involved in the search for freedom , and that belief has always strengthened us in our purpose .
But just as we are losing our confidence in the future , we are also beginning to close the door on our past .
In a nation that was proud of hard work , strong families , close - knit communities , and our faith in God , too many of us now tend to worship self - indulgence and consumption .
Human identity is no longer defined by what one does , but by what one owns .
But we 've discovered that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning .
We 've learned that piling up material goods cannot fill the emptiness of lives which have no confidence or purpose .
The symptoms of this crisis of the American spirit are all around us .
For the first time in the history of our country a majority of our people believe that the next 5 years will be worse than the past 5 years .
Two - thirds of our people do not even vote .
The productivity of American workers is actually dropping , and the willingness of Americans to save for the future has fallen below that of all other people in the Western world .
As you know , there is a growing disrespect for government and for churches and for schools , the news media , and other institutions .
This is not a message of happiness or reassurance , but it is the truth and it is a warning .
These changes did not happen overnight .
They 've come upon us gradually over the last generation , years that were filled with shocks and tragedy .
We were sure that ours was a nation of the ballot , not the bullet , until the murders of John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King , Jr . We were taught that our armies were always invincible and our causes were always just , only to suffer the agony of Vietnam .
We respected the Presidency as a place of honor until the shock of Watergate .
We remember when the phrase " sound as a dollar " was an expression of absolute dependability , until 10 years of inflation began to shrink our dollar and our savings .
We believed that our Nation 's resources were limitless until 1973 , when we had to face a growing dependence on foreign oil .
These wounds are still very deep .
They have never been healed .
Looking for a way out of this crisis , our people have turned to the Federal Government and found it isolated from the mainstream of our Nation 's life .
Washington , D.C. , has become an island .
The gap between our citizens and our Government has never been so wide .
The people are looking for honest answers , not easy answers ; clear leadership , not false claims and evasiveness and politics as usual .
What you see too often in Washington and elsewhere around the country is a system of government that seems incapable of action .
You see a Congress twisted and pulled in every direction by hundreds of well - financed and powerful special interests .
You see every extreme position defended to the last vote , almost to the last breath by one unyielding group or another .
You often see a balanced and a fair approach that demands sacrifice , a little sacrifice from everyone , abandoned like an orphan without support and without friends .
Often you see paralysis and stagnation and drift .
You do n't like it , and neither do I .
What can we do ?
First of all , we must face the truth , and then we can change our course .
We simply must have faith in each other , faith in our ability to govern ourselves , and faith in the future of this Nation .
Restoring that faith and that confidence to America is now the most important task we face .
It is a true challenge of this generation of Americans .
One of the visitors to Camp David last week put it this way : " We 've got to stop crying and start sweating , stop talking and start walking , stop cursing and start praying .
The strength we need will not come from the White House , but from every house in America . "
We know the strength of America .
We are strong .
We can regain our unity .
We can regain our confidence .
We are the heirs of generations who survived threats much more powerful and awesome than those that challenge us now .
Our fathers and mothers were strong men and women who shaped a new society during the Great Depression , who fought world wars , and who carved out a new charter of peace for the world .
We ourselves are the same Americans who just 10 years ago put a man on the Moon .
We are the generation that dedicated our society to the pursuit of human rights and equality .
And we are the generation that will win the war on the energy problem and in that process rebuild the unity and confidence of America .
We are at a turning point in our history .
There are two paths to choose .
One is a path I 've warned about tonight , the path that leads to fragmentation and self - interest .
Down that road lies a mistaken idea of freedom , the right to grasp for ourselves some advantage over others .
That path would be one of constant conflict between narrow interests ending in chaos and immobility .
It is a certain route to failure .
All the traditions of our past , all the lessons of our heritage , all the promises of our future point to another path , the path of common purpose and the restoration of American values .
That path leads to true freedom for our Nation and ourselves .
We can take the first steps down that path as we begin to solve our energy problem .
Energy will be the immediate test of our ability to unite this Nation , and it can also be the standard around which we rally .
On the battlefield of energy we can win for our Nation a new confidence , and we can seize control again of our common destiny .
In little more than two decades we 've gone from a position of energy independence to one in which almost half the oil we use comes from foreign countries , at prices that are going through the roof .
Our excessive dependence on OPEC has already taken a tremendous toll on our economy and our people .
This is the direct cause of the long lines which have made millions of you spend aggravating hours waiting for gasoline .
It 's a cause of the increased inflation and unemployment that we now face .
This intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very security of our Nation .
The energy crisis is real .
It is worldwide .
It is a clear and present danger to our Nation .
These are facts and we simply must face them :
What I have to say to you now about energy is simple and vitally important .
Point one : I am tonight setting a clear goal for the energy policy of the United States .
Beginning this moment , this Nation will never use more foreign oil than we did in 1977 - never .
From now on , every new addition to our demand for energy will be met from our own production and our own conservation .
The generation - long growth in our dependence on foreign oil will be stopped dead in its tracks right now and then reversed as we move through the 1980's , for I am tonight setting the further goal of cutting our dependence on foreign oil by one - half by the end of the next decade - a saving of over 4 1 / 2 million barrels of imported oil per day .
Point two :
To ensure that we meet these targets , I will use my Presidential authority to set import quotas .
I 'm announcing tonight that for 1979 and 1980 , I will forbid the entry into this country of one drop of foreign oil more than these goals allow .
These quotas will ensure a reduction in imports even below the ambitious levels we set at the recent Tokyo summit .
Point three :
To give us energy security , I am asking for the most massive peacetime commitment of funds and resources in our Nation 's history to develop America 's own alternative sources of fuel - from coal , from oil shale , from plant products for gasohol , from unconventional gas , from the Sun .
I propose the creation of an energy security corporation to lead this effort to replace 2 1/2 million barrels of imported oil per day by 1990 .
The corporation will issue up to $ 5 billion in energy bonds , and I especially want them to be in small denominations so that average Americans can invest directly in America 's energy security .
Just as a similar synthetic rubber corporation helped us win World War II , so will we mobilize American determination and ability to win the energy war .
Moreover , I will soon submit legislation to Congress calling for the creation of this Nation 's first solar bank , which will help us achieve the crucial goal of 20 percent of our energy coming from solar power by the year 2000 .
These efforts will cost money , a lot of money , and that is why Congress must enact the windfall profits tax without delay .
It will be money well spent .
Unlike the billions of dollars that we ship to foreign countries to pay for foreign oil , these funds will be paid by Americans to Americans .
These funds will go to fight , not to increase , inflation and unemployment .
Point four : I 'm asking Congress to mandate , to require as a matter of law , that our Nation 's utility companies cut their massive use of oil by 50 percent within the next decade and switch to other fuels , especially coal , our most abundant energy source .
Point five :
To make absolutely certain that nothing stands in the way of achieving these goals , I will urge Congress to create an energy mobilization board which , like the War Production Board in World War II , will have the responsibility and authority to cut through the redtape , the delays , and the endless roadblocks to completing key energy projects .
We will protect our environment .
But when this Nation critically needs a refinery or a pipeline , we will build it .
Point six : I 'm proposing a bold conservation program to involve every State , county , and city and every average American in our energy battle .
This effort will permit you to build conservation into your homes and your lives at a cost you can afford .
I ask Congress to give me authority for mandatory conservation and for standby gasoline rationing .
To further conserve energy , I 'm proposing tonight an extra $ 10 billion over the next decade to strengthen our public transportation systems .
And I 'm asking you for your good and for your Nation 's security to take no unnecessary trips , to use carpools or public transportation whenever you can , to park your car one extra day per week , to obey the speed limit , and to set your thermostats to save fuel .
Every act of energy conservation like this is more than just common sense - I tell you it is an act of patriotism .
Our Nation must be fair to the poorest among us , so we will increase aid to needy Americans to cope with rising energy prices .
We often think of conservation only in terms of sacrifice .
In fact , it is the most painless and immediate way of rebuilding our Nation 's strength .
Every gallon of oil each one of us saves is a new form of production .
It gives us more freedom , more confidence , that much more control over our own lives .
So , the solution of our energy crisis can also help us to conquer the crisis of the spirit in our country .
It can rekindle our sense of unity , our confidence in the future , and give our Nation and all of us individually a new sense of purpose .
You know we can do it .
We have the natural resources .
We have more oil in our shale alone than several Saudi Arabias .
We have more coal than any nation on Earth .
We have the world 's highest level of technology .
We have the most skilled work force , with innovative genius , and I firmly believe that we have the national will to win this war .
I do not promise you that this struggle for freedom will be easy .
I do not promise a quick way out of our Nation 's problems , when the truth is that the only way out is an all - out effort .
What I do promise you is that I will lead our fight , and I will enforce fairness in our struggle , and I will ensure honesty .
And above all , I will act .
We can manage the short - term shortages more effectively and we will , but there are no short - term solutions to our long - range problems .
There is simply no way to avoid sacrifice .
Twelve hours from now I will speak again in Kansas City , to expand and to explain further our energy program .
Just as the search for solutions to our energy shortages has now led us to a new awareness of our Nation 's deeper problems , so our willingness to work for those solutions in energy can strengthen us to attack those deeper problems .
I will continue to travel this country , to hear the people of America .
You can help me to develop a national agenda for the 1980s .
I will listen and I will act .
We will act together .
These were the promises I made 3 years ago , and I intend to keep them .
Little by little we can and we must rebuild our confidence .
We can spend until we empty our treasuries , and we may summon all the wonders of science .
But we can succeed only if we tap our greatest resources - America 's people , America 's values , and America 's confidence .
I have seen the strength of America in the inexhaustible resources of our people .
In the days to come , let us renew that strength in the struggle for an energy secure nation .
In closing , let me say this : I will do my best , but I will not do it alone .
Let your voice be heard .
Whenever you have a chance , say something good about our country .
With God 's help and for the sake of our Nation , it is time for us to join hands in America .
Let us commit ourselves together to a rebirth of the American spirit .
Working together with our common faith we cannot fail .
Thank you and good night .
Gary Lineker has quit his weekly column in the Mail on Sunday in protest at the newspaper 's publication of Lord Triesman 's secretly recorded conversation on Sunday .
The story led to Triesman 's immediate resignation as the chairman of the FA and of its bid to host the 2018 World Cup , and has forced the bid team into a frantic operation to re-establish its credibility .
Lineker , the former England international and World Cup star turned BBC presenter , is an official ambassador of the bid and believes the Mail on Sunday 's story had little merit but did potentially serious damage to the effort to bring the 2018 tournament to this country .
" The story itself , the circumstances surrounding it and the actions of the Mail on Sunday in publishing it have undermined the bid to bring the World Cup to England in 2018 , " Lineker said .
" I wholeheartedly support the bid , because I believe that hosting the tournament would be brilliant for the country , and I am an official ambassador for it .
I have therefore taken the view that I cannot continue as a columnist for the Mail on Sunday . "
Lineker has been writing the weekly column in the Mail on Sunday for six months following the death of Sir Bobby Robson , who wrote previously in that slot .
Lineker 's long - term agent , Jon Holmes , was severely critical of the paper , saying that he and Lineker had quickly formed the view that Lineker should sever his involvement with the paper .
" The story showed crass judgment , " Holmes said .
" It had dubious journalistic merit , was clearly obtained by entrapment , and was timed to do the maximum damage to the World Cup bid , which Gary and all football fans in this country passionately support .
We wanted to make our position clear and to do all we can now to help persuade Fifa that England is the best country to host a great World Cup in 2018 . "
The newspaper ran on Sunday the comments made by Triesman , 66 , during a private dinner with a friend , Melissa Jacobs , 37 , who , unknown to him , was recording it .
She then sold her story to the Mail on Sunday , which is understood to have paid £ 75,000 for it , with the publicist Max Clifford representing Jacobs .
Triesman 's remarks , particularly his casual claim that the Spanish and Russian football authorities are considering bribing referees at this summer 's World Cup , led to his resignation .
In his statement , he complained of " entrapment " by the Mail on Sunday .
The 2018 bid team , fresh from an overwhelmingly positive trip to deliver the bid document to Fifa last week , are now working flat out on a salvage operation .
Letters of apology were faxed to Madrid , Moscow and the Fifa offices in Zurich as early as Saturday night , a new bid chairman , Geoff Thompson , was appointed , and now Fifa 's ethics committee is investigating the claims and the surrounding circumstances .
Fifa 's general secretary , Jerome Valcke , said he expected the inquiry to be finished before the World Cup , which starts on 11 June .
Public reaction , gauged by responses to phone-ins and online coverage of the story , including the Mail on Sunday 's own website , has been dominated by fury at the newspaper for publishing the secret recording , rather than at Triesman for making the comments .
Malcolm Clarke , the chairman of the Football Supporters Federation , said in a joint statement with Supporters Direct : " The Mail on Sunday has grievously endangered the bid with the worst sort of journalism .
All involved at the Mail should hang their heads in shame .
Many football supporters will think long and hard before buying the Daily Mail or The Mail on Sunday . "
After being told of Lineker 's decision to cease working with the Mail on Sunday , the 2018 World Cup bid team said in a statement : " We would like to thank Gary for his support which is greatly appreciated .
He has been a fantastic ambassador for the bid until now and will continue to be so until the end of the campaign .
" We have had many messages of support over the last few difficult days and are grateful for all of them .
It is clear that the public is totally behind both the bid and the England team going to South Africa this summer . "
Jacobs is understood to have further comments from Triesman on tape and the Mail on Sunday is considering whether to run them as a second instalment .
In a statement , the paper defended its story on Triesman .
" This story concerns very serious allegations of corruption at the highest level of sport , made by the man who was leading the England World Cup bid .
The public are clearly entitled to know about such allegations , which are quite rightly now the subject of a FIFA investigation .
We would also like to make it clear that Melissa Jacobs put details of her relationship with Lord Triesman on the internet , and made her recording of her conversation with him , without the knowledge or involvement of The Mail on Sunday .
There is no question of entrapment , the paper was simply reporting events that had already taken place .
" We made it absolutely clear to Gary Lineker that he could express his views about this story in his column with complete freedom .
We regret that he turned down this offer .
The Mail on Sunday gives its full support to the England 2018 bid , and notes that many commentators believe its chance of success is as strong as ever . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
An extensive study into the merits of screening men between the ages of 50 and 65 for prostate cancer has found it can cut death rates from the disease by as much as half , Swedish scientists said Thursday .
But the findings do n’t necessarily mean nationwide prostate screening programs should introduced , experts said , since they run the risk of significant overdiagnosis of tumors in men who would not have suffered any harm from their cancer .
Researchers from the University of Gothenburg conducted a trial involving 20,000 men who were divided equally into a group that was offered prostate screening and a group that was not .
The screening method used was so - called prostate - specific antigen ( PSA ) testing , which is widely used in the United States and other developed countries to detect early signs of tumors .
Over 14 years of follow - up , prostate cancer death rates were cut almost by half in the screening group compared with the non-screening group , as men were diagnosed and treated in time to stop the cancer from killing them .
Jonas Hugosson , who led the study , said the results showed that PSA screening of all men this age group “ can result in a relevant reduction in cancer mortality . ”
Screening for cancer -- or for clues such as pre-cancerous cells -- is strongly encouraged in wealthy nations as a way of improving public health .
But there are growing doubts about whether the screening ’s benefits always outweigh the negatives , with the main concerns centering on the risk of overdiagnosis .
A large U.S. study published last year found that routine prostate screening has resulted in more than 1 million American men being diagnosed with tumors who might otherwise have suffered no ill effects from them .
In that study , researchers said that around 20 men had to be diagnosed and treated for every one who benefited .
In the Swedish study , which was published in The Lancet medical journal Thursday , the researchers said the risk of overdiagnosis was less , but still 12 men needed to be diagnosed to save one life .
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men after lung cancer , killing around 254,000 men a year around the world .
U.S. doctors have routinely recommended PSA screening in men over 50 based on the assumption that early diagnosis and treatment is better than standing by and doing nothing .
But fears about overdiagnosis , which can lead to treatments such as surgery , radiation or hormone therapy that can cause serious side - effects such as impotence and incontinence , have so far dissuaded many European countries from nationwide screening .
A similar debate over breast cancer screening is also raging among doctors in Europe and United States , with critics of national mammography screening programs saying they needlessly harm thousands of women ’s lives by picking up tumors that would otherwise not have caused a problem .
In a commentary on the Swedish study , David Neal from Britain ’s Cambridge University , said it showed that “ in certain circumstances , PSA testing and early diagnosis reduces death from prostate cancer . ”
But he added : “ It does not imply that PSA screening programs should now be introduced internationally . ”

Computerized chess has been around for at least a few centuries now ( okay , so maybe " score " is more accurate ) , but if you thought an IBM supercomputer dominating one of the planet 's brightest humans was gnarly , have a gander at this .
One determined modder has whipped up what may very well be the most impressive way to engage in online chess ever , as the DIY Internet Chess Table turns an on - screen opponent into an on - table opponent .
Put simply ( or as simply as possible ) , the multitouch table uses a projector to beam a chessboard onto an opaque surface , and moves are captured via webcam and sent back to an internet server .
The human 's moves are recognized and countered , and then that same human is told where to move the computer 's piece via on - screen arrows .
Trust us -- it 's worth your while to hop on past the break and mash play for a video demonstration .
To clarify , the table syncs up to play matches over freechess.org , but as far as your Feng Shui is concerned , it 's still a single player in your room .
too bad they did not have something like these in Oblivion or have something similar in Skyrim , but i think the game dynaics are a little different so they had to come up with a faster way to quick travel , whereas now you just basically teleport from anywhere outside and its a different time as if you had traveled , and before you had to run to one of these and hop on to go really far .
It would probably be a cool way to travel in any DLC they add to Skyrim !
Can chance make you a killer ?
Can chance make you a killer ?
In his regular column , Michael Blastland invites you to try the deadly Go Figure Chance Calculator .
Imagine you are a hospital doctor .
Some patients die .
But how many is too many before you or your hospital are labelled killers ?
We 've devised a chance calculator to simulate this scenario .
It is set up so that you are innocent of any failing .
But bad luck might convict you all the same .
In the real world all kinds of factors make a difference , like surgical skill .
But in the calculator , every patient in every hospital has exactly the same chance of dying and every surgeon is equally good .
This is to show what chance alone can do , even when the odds are the same all round .
The calculator ( below ) shows 100 hospitals each performing 100 operations
The probability that a patient dies is initially fixed at five in 100
The government , meanwhile , says death rates 60 % worse than the norm are unacceptable ( in red )
So any hospital which has eight deaths or more out of 100 ops - when the expected average is only five - is in trouble .
We 've assigned one hospital to you , with a box around it - it could come out green or red .
Start the calculator by clicking on the slider itself and see whether your hospital - the boxed one - is safe or deadly .
Click " recalculate " , in the lower right - hand corner of the module , a few times to see how you and others do .
Here 's what happened when I ran the calculator a few times .
First , some hospitals look dodgy , others brilliant .
In this example ( see image , right ) , one surgeon or hospital had 14 deaths ( that 's the red H out on its own beneath the big cluster ) , 1,300 per cent higher mortality than some others , who had only one , a huge disparity .
Mine - boxed - was one of the unacceptables .
So sack me .
But remember , these results are pure chance , computer - generated , based on exactly the same risk for every patient .
So hospitals are not really good or bad , it 's just chance , lucky or unlucky .
That sounds odd .
The calculator seems to show fatal incompetence or maybe even - let 's speculate what goes through the public mind - murder at one , medical genius at another .
Keep recalculating and sometimes only a few are unacceptable .
The example above left has five " bad " surgeons .
Roll the dice again and it comes up with a shocking 20 that failed to meet the standard .
Next , move the slider up to , say , a 12 % death rate .
This imagines a more dangerous operation .
But now there are fewer unacceptables as there tends to be relatively less variation around bigger numbers .
Finally , move the slider right down to a 1 % death rate .
Now , still using the 60 % threshold , a huge number of hospitals are often unacceptable .
That 's because there tends to be relatively more variation around smaller numbers .
The same applies to the number of ops performed .
Do more , and the variation tends to be relatively smaller .
Do only a few and the results are more likely to be - relatively - all over the shop .
The government says it would like to publish results right down to the level of the individual surgeon .
Chance v skill
Note that chance does not mean without cause .
Every death has a cause , but sometimes these come together more often in certain places at certain times in ways that have nothing to do with anything we know or that can currently be known about the patient or the surgeon .
Continue reading the main story
Think of it like this ...
Think of a bag of 100 balls , five of them red .
Pull a red ball from the bag and it means a death .
What if you pull 100 balls from the bag , each time putting the ball back ?
Your chance - and it is only chance - of pulling a deadly ball is 5 in 100 , or one in 20 , or 5 % .
But it 's easy now to imagine that you might draw 14 red balls or more in 100 attempts , or none , purely by chance .
This is the same as the simulation in our calculator ; every time you run it , it is like imagining that 100 hospitals dip into the bag 100 times each .
Does all this mean that every hospital mortality rate is pure chance ?
Of course not .
There can be what 's called special - cause variation - in contrast to the common - cause variation in our calculator .
Special - cause variation is when something like surgical skill is the real reason for 15 deaths .
The big problem - bigger than many people think - is how to tell the difference .
So what about a hospital like Mid Staffs , where hundreds are thought to have died unnecessarily ?
That 's an example - probably - of special - cause variation , not chance .
There 's to be more of this kind of measurement as the government says the effort must shift from setting targets for how much work is done to judging how well it 's done .
That probably means more emphasis on counting bodies .
In practice , regulators who make calls about standards perform many hard judgments and calculations to work out what 's chance and what 's not .
But because chance has such a variable effect , they will often be unsure , even about the kind of huge differences we see in the calculator .
Anyone thinking raw data is all we need , beware .
Before naming the good or bad , we need to understand the extent to which chance can make the innocent appear dangerous and make heroes of the ordinary .

Lineout action at the seventh annual nude rugby international , at Logan Park , Dunedin , on Saturday .
Photo by Jane Dawber .
A lack of practice did not stop the Nude Blacks and Welsh Leeks putting on a good show , complete with streaker and brawl , in the seventh annual nude rugby international match , played in clear conditions in Dunedin on Saturday .
About 1500 people lined the pitch as the two teams , captained by nude rugby stalwart Dave Bourke and newcomer Johnny Morris , battled it out for the Innes - Jones - Davies trophy .
Dunedin students made up the bulk of the Nude Blacks team , which was obvious when one had to leave halfway through the match to sit an exam , while the Welsh players were mostly tourists .
Pre-match warm -ups , including press-ups and knee - ups , delighted the crowd .
The haka was also a hit , especially when the Welsh danced and threw leeks in response .
Refereed by former All Blacks John Timu and Richard Lowe , the Nude Blacks opened the scoring in the tightly contested match .
Highlights included players getting up close and personal with spectators in some overly eager sideline tackling , a fight , and the brazen introduction of a female streaker .
She distributed hugs , took part in a lineout and scored a try before exiting the field , only to return , police hat in tow , to arrest a clothed " streaker " later in the match .
Watch more about the Roma 's plight on CNN International World 's Untold Stories on June 26 at 1630 GMT , and June 27 at 1100 GMT , 1830 GMT .
Vitkov , Czech Republic ( CNN ) -- Natalka Kudrikova is a bright - eyed , three - year - old girl recovering from the severe burns she suffered when far - right extremists threw a Molotov cocktail into her home .
Her family and authorities say she was targeted because they are Roma , or gypsies .
Natalka lost 80 percent of her skin , two fingers ( a third was later amputated ) and spent months lying in an induced coma following the attack last year in Vitkov , in the Czech Republic .
She is still recuperating after 14 major surgeries .
In May , Natalka returned to Ostrava Hospital for rehabilitation sessions so that one day she may be able to get around without support .
" I 'd rather not take her back to the hospital , " said her mother , Anna Sivakova , " but if she must return , my dream is that she learns how to walk without any help . "
The very next day , four young men accused of attacking Natalka , filed into Ostrava District Court to hear the indictment : a racially motivated attempted murder .
According to the prosecutor , the attack was planned for the 120th anniversary of Adolf Hitler 's birth .
Court experts confirmed swastikas and other Nazi memorabilia were found in the defendants ' homes .
In court , Ivo Muller and Vaclav Cojocaru described their coordinated Molotov cocktail attack .
Their only excuse -- they said they thought they were attacking an empty storehouse of stolen goods .
Under cross-examination , Muller and Cojocaru admitted attending anti-Roma demonstrations organized by right wing extremists .
The other defendants , Jaromir Lukes and David Vaculik , did not take the stand .
Lukes is accused of being the ringleader , a claim his defense counsel strongly denies although he concedes Lukes drove the getaway car .
His lawyer also vehemently denies there was any racial motivation to the attack .
An anti-fascist website published a photo of Lukes walking next to the leader of the far - right Workers ' Party .
Another photo showed Vaculik wearing the armband of the Workers ' Party , the public face of the Czech far right .
The leader of the now banned Workers ' Party , Tomas Vandas , denied any involvement .
" Yes , we may have used those people as organizers of our public meetings but how could we know they would commit a crime ? " said Vandas .
" I hope Natalka gets better soon , " he added .
Miroslav Mares , from Masaryk University in Brno , is the leading academic specialist on Czech extremist groups .
He thinks it 's unlikely that the Workers '
Party was directly involved in the arson attack , but he says they were responsible " for inflaming anti-Roma sentiment . "
" Maybe some youngsters from the neo - Nazi scene said to themselves , ' If the whole population is against Romas we are justified in carrying out such attacks , ' " he said .
And surveys do show anti-Roma sentiment is widespread .
The European Union EURoma website says Czech Romas endure extremely high unemployment rates , low educational standards , isolation , and the prejudices of the majority population .
" In regions with high unemployment and poor social conditions , the rise of extremism is popular with unemployed young men but we can see more and more women on the neo - Nazi scene , " Marek said .
Lucie Slegrova , 20 , is a flag - waving militant of the now renamed Workers ' Social Justice Party .
She denies her party is inspired by Hitler 's Nazi ideology .
Instead , she says , they follow their own nationalist ideas .
" The Czech Republic should be for people who know how to behave .
If the gypsies do n't want to follow the rules , they 're free to leave , " she said .
Only one percent of Czech voters supported the Workers ' Social Justice Party in the last elections , but Czech Prime Minister Jan Fischer worries that 7 percent of Czech students voted for the far - right party , according to an unofficial nationwide poll .
" A lot of people are frustrated with politicians , and have troubles due to the crisis and recession .
My message to them is please think it over and do n't believe these very bad prophets , " Fischer said .
The far - right movement has made bigger gains in neighboring Hungary where 17 percent of voters chose the Jobbik party in the last elections .
Violence has been much worse as well .
In the last two years , nine Roma have been killed in Hungary in unprovoked night - time attacks , according to the European Roma Rights Centre ( ERRC ) .
Roma bashing also became an issue in the Slovakian election campaign .
The far right Slovak National Party commissioned billboards showing a dark - skinned man with tattoos and an inflammatory message : " Vote SNS so we do n't feed those who do n't want to work . "
In eastern Slovakia many Roma live in segregated communities like the village of Ostrovany where municipal authorities spent some $ 16,000 to build a wall separating the Roma from their white neighbors , because of fears of " alleged Roma crime , " said Stanislav Daniel from ERRC .
" To me the wall is a symbol of segregation because public finances were used to target a stereotype , not what 's real , " Daniel said .
The wall separates a tidy town from a rural slum .
Roma , living right next to the wall , have no sewage or garbage collection and there 's just one tap with drinking water for dozens of families .
Back in the Czech Republic , Natalka 's father , Pavel Kudrik , has chosen to stay in the region and rebuild a comfortable home for his wife and four daughters .
After police asserted that Natalka 's family were victims of a racist attack , many Czechs opened their wallets and their hearts .
Prime Minister Fischer 's wife and son spearheaded a nationwide campaign to help them -- a move that led to the Fischer family having full - time police protection after they received anonymous death threats .
But the current climate is not the only reason Fischer wants to clamp down on right wing extremism .
Everyone in his family died in the Holocaust except for his father and grandmother .
" Sixty - five years after WWII , the societal memory is getting weak , " he said .
And Roma activists complain that recognition of their sacrifices under the Nazis has never been properly acknowledged .
Half - a- million Roma perished in what they call the " Devouring " -- Hitler 's campaign to eliminate them as a people .
Last May , several hundred Czech Roma gathered at a memorial for the victims of the Lety concentration camp .
Hundreds of Czech Roma children died there and are buried nearby in a mass grave .
Jan Vrba is one of the camp 's last survivors .
He was born there .
His sister perished there .
" What happened in Vitkov made me cry " , said Jan .
" Little Natalka reminded me of my sister who died in this camp . "
A good Friend of Unfair Park , through a friend of a friend of a friend , just shot us this extraordinary video captured early yesterday morning at Dallas - Fort Worth International Airport .
Took place at the north toll plaza , which served as a launching ramp for one drunk driver trying to exit the airport in a hurry .
DFW spokesman David Magana confirms : " The driver was , as you might guess , suspected of inebriation and investigated for such and arrested for such . "
We also have fiery post - crash pics after the jump -- because after the driver went all General Lee , she got out and made a call on her cell , at which point the vehicle went boom .
Hard to believe the " driver only suffered minor injuries , " as Magana puts it .
Oh -- and the toll - booth operator was n't injured at all .
Update at 11:37 a.m.
Thursday :
The driver 's name is Yasmine Villasana .
And here 's the whole police report .

Best Solar Panels for home
By Eco Guy
We look at what are the best solar panels for home use
Location , location , location
Visibility to the Sun throughout the whole day , and ;
That visibility is not obstructed by trees , poles , buildings , etc
Before you think of going down the solar powered route you need to consider exactly where you want to put the solar panels ...
Remember , companies will quite happily sell you solar panel systems regardless of whether they will actually generated the stated power output or not and a lot of this depends on where you put the solar panels in the first place .
Solar panels , by their nature need clear and unobstructed access to the Sun .
Note : by clear we mean absolutely clear .
Unlike solar hot water heaters , partially obscured solar power panels will produced drastically less power .
This is due to the way solar panels are constructed , they are not made from one massive solar panel , rather a whole set of smaller panels wired in series - now if just one of those smaller solar panels is in the shade , it acts as a block to the power being generated by all the rest .
Therefore for maximum power generation potential you want a location which has :
Now for most people this is achieved by putting the solar panels on the roof ; although for this to be perfect the roof in question needs to be on the solar East / West line ( i.e. the ridge follows this line ) - that way the panel will get the most amount of sun without needing to track the sun across the sky .
As for working out the power you could generate , see the Solar Power Calculator
As for what is the best solar panel ; the best are Mono - crystalline as they are most efficient , but they are not cheap .
If you have plenty of space to put up a solar panel system you should go for Poly - crystalline instead .
See this article on Solar Power Systems for more details .
Also if you are not in a hurry , there are some interesting technology developments on the way .
FOR the “ bitter ” Americans Barack Obama accused in 2008 of “ clinging ” to their guns ( and religion ) , this has been a sweet week .
In June of that year five of the nine justices on the Supreme Court ruled in DC v Heller that the right to bear arms set out in the second amendment really did apply to individuals and not just to the “ well regulated militia ” in the arguably ambiguous sentence that ends by saying “ the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . ”
Now , almost exactly two years later , and again by five votes to four , the court has ruled , in McDonald v Chicago , that this right must be acknowledged by state and local governments and not only by the federal one .
The two findings , taken together , represent a big step forward for the gun lobby .
Heller ruled that the second amendment should be construed as a personal right to keep and bear arms for lawful purposes , most notably for self - defence within the home .
It struck down a handgun ban in Washington , DC , as unconstitutional .
But because the capital is an enclave of the federal government , the ruling did not resolve the status of similar bans elsewhere .
Otis McDonald and his fellow plaintiffs in McDonald wanted to keep handguns for protection but were prohibited from doing so by ordinances in Chicago .
The court has now ruled that under the “ due process ” clause of the 14th amendment the right to bear arms cannot be infringed by either the states or the federal government .
Alan Gottlieb , vice - president of the Second Amendment Foundation , said that as a result of McDonald “ the right of the individual citizen to have a gun is constitutionally protected in every corner of the United States . ”
He says that his organisation is preparing challenges against restrictive anti-gun laws across the country , in order to “ win back our firearms freedoms one lawsuit at a time ” .
The National Rifle Association says that it , too , is planning legal challenges to gun laws across the country ; it claims there are 20,000 of these .
And yet campaigners for gun control have not been cast into utter gloom .
They are consoled by the fact that in this week 's ruling Justice Samuel Alito , writing for the majority , made a point of repeating something else the court said in Heller : the right to keep and bear arms is not “ a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose ” .
The court emphasised two years ago that it was not questioning longstanding regulations such as preventing felons and the mentally ill from owning guns , or keeping guns out of sensitive places such as schools or government buildings .
“ We repeat those assurances here , ” wrote Mr Alito in the new opinion .
The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , a bipartisan movement that advocates gun control , did its best to put on a brave face , claiming to welcome the court 's rejection of the gun-lobby argument that its “ any gun , for anybody , anywhere ” agenda was protected by the constitution .
Paul Helmke , the campaign 's president , noted that the court had again recognised that the second amendment allowed “ for reasonable restrictions on firearms , including who can have them and under what conditions , where they can be taken , and what types of firearms are available . ”
Criminal - background checks , which states or cities can require , are rising ( see chart ) .
But who is to decide which restrictions are reasonable and which offend against what the Supreme Court has now declared to be a fundamental right ?
That battle will now return to the lower courts .
Blanket or near - blanket bans on the possession of handguns , such as those in Chicago and the adjacent city of Oak Park , will almost certainly be struck down .
But these are very rare .
In the case of most other regulations McDonald offers little guidance .
Can assault weapons be banned ?
Can guns be banned from public places ?
Should there be rules on how they are stored at home ?
Should they be registered ?
In a dissenting opinion , Justice Stephen Breyer berated the majority for setting the judges on lower courts a “ mission - almost - impossible ” .
If the jurisprudence of gun control is treacherous , the politics are a nightmare .
In an average year more than 100,000 Americans are shot by guns , more than 30,000 fatally .
And yet support for stricter gun controls is declining — from 59 % in 1994 to 40 % last April , according to a CBS News poll last April .
Gun-control regulations tend to be popular in cities and unpopular , often deeply so , in rural areas .
For that reason , the Democrats may be pleased that the Supreme Court has at last entrenched the second amendment so firmly .
This makes it harder for Republicans to scare voters into believing that a Democratic president intends to take their guns away .
The sale of guns surged after Mr Obama 's election , perhaps because the clingers believed they had to stock up while they still could .
Harry Reid , the Democratic majority leader in the Senate , who faces a tough re-election battle in Nevada in November , was quick to give the McDonald ruling a warm welcome .
“ The right to bear arms ” , he said , “ is one of the essential freedoms on which our country was founded . ”
And it will be earning money for lawyers for years to come .
NEW ORLEANS ( PAI ) – The National Education Association is openly splitting with the Democratic Obama administration over federal education law , shining a national spotlight on a dispute between the president and the nation ’s largest union that has persisted even before Obama took over the Oval Office .
In a July 3 keynote speech to the 3.2 - million - member union ’s annual Representative Assembly here , NEA President Dennis Van Roekel criticized the administration ’s continued use of student test scores to measure schools .
He called on the 9,000 delegates to pressure lawmakers to rewrite federal law to let other factors to be considered in determining if a school gets federal education aid .
The NEA opposed the current incarnation of federal education law , GOP President George W. Bush ’s No Child Left Behind ( NCLB )
Act , even before it was passed in 2001 , and since then as well .
NEA also unsuccessfully sued Bush ’s government for funds the law promised .
NCLB is up for renewal this year .
Van Roekel says not only is the law flawed , but the funds are still lacking , too .
The teacher union says the law relies too much on standardized tests , forces teachers to “ teach to the test , ” shortchanges anything other than math and English , and makes it too easy to cut off federal funds to public schools and shift them – via vouchers – to private schools , a key right - wing cause .
The NEA also says the law ’s measures of adequate yearly progress ( AYP ) are so rigidly pass - fail that schools that make tremendous progress but do n’t reach the mark in a particular year automatically flunk – even if the only reason is student absences on test - taking day .
If a school flunks , state officials can take it over and turn it over to private companies , fire everyone , divert its money to private schools or all of the above .
Obama Education Secretary Arne Duncan has kept the basics of AYP and the “ pass - fail ” aspect of NCLB , Van Roekel , a Phoenix teacher , told his delegates .
“ While we applaud the administration for its commitment to fund education , our members are frustrated by the disconnect between what they need each day to support their students and schools and the federal policies that hold up struggling students as products to be tested , ” he said .
“ Tell Congress the reauthorization ” of the NCLB “ should include real funding and not require us to compete for resources , ” Van Roekel said .
“ Tell them it should scrap AYP and instead actually support student learning !
Tell them to replace NCLB ’s mind - numbing , high - stakes , pass - fail testing system with a system of multiple measures and focus on student growth . ”

The first fully production - ready nonrelational , or NoSQL , database , called CouchDB , has been released , the corporate sponsor of the project , Couchio , announced on Wednesday .
Two major enhancements to CouchDB make it 1.0 - worthy , said Chris Anderson , the chief financial officer and a founder of Couchio .
One is the fact that performance of the software has been greatly improved .
The other is its ability to work on Microsoft Windows machines .
A lot of work was also put into stabilization of the software .
Performance - wise , the new version has demonstrated a 300 percent increase in speed in reads and writes , as judged by internal benchmarking tests done by Couchio .
The performance improvements were gained by optimizing the code , Anderson said .
This is also the first release of CouchDB that can fully run on Windows computers , either the servers or desktops , Anderson said .
Previous versions could run on Linux , and there is a version being developed for the Google Android smartphone operating system .
CouchDB , an Apache Foundation project , is a nonrelational database that stores data as simple key - value pairs .
Data is stored using Javascript Object Notation ( JSON ) and can be queried using HTTP requests .
" It allows you to build Web applications without a middle tier .
Instead of a database , a Java stack and then a browser , you just have HTTP and the browser , " Anderson said .
Web application developers may find the technology interesting in that it allows for off - line storage of data , which can be useful when designing Web applications for devices not always connected to the Internet .
" Off - line replication support is really unique to CouchDB , especially in the open - source space , " Anderson said .
" If you have a workgroup , then everyone in that workgroup can have a copy of the data , and it can be synchronized . "
For developers , CouchDB may be easier to use than relational databases because it does not require them to understand how to create SQL queries to write to or draw data from a database .
An implementation of Google MapReduce is used for queries .
" You can do complex queries .
Pretty much any kind of query you can do in SQL you can do in CouchDB , though you may have to think about how to write the query differently , " Anderson said .
Work on CouchDB began in 2005 at IBM as a Lotus Notes project to help with off - line replication of data .
It became an independent open - source project in 2008 .
Couchio offers commercial support for the software .

One U.S. official quoted by the Wall Street Journal said , " A lot of this looks like our tax dollars being stolen . " $ 3 billion .
Consider this as the American people sweat out an extension of unemployment benefits .
Last week , the BBC reported that " the US military has been giving tens of millions of dollars to Afghan security firms who are funneling the money to warlords . "
Add to that a corrupt Afghan government underwritten by the lives of our troops .
And now reports indicate that Congress is preparing to attach $ 10 billion in state education funding to a $ 33 billion spending bill to keep the war going .
Back home millions of Americans are out of work , losing their homes , losing their savings , their pensions , and their retirement security .
We are losing our nation to lies about the necessity of war .
Bring our troops home .
End the war .
Secure our economy .

News on TAM 8 !
Lots of changes !
The schedule is packed , and has changed considerably since its first incarnation .
Speakers have been added , including comedian Paul Provenza , skeptic blogger Julia Galef , astronomical podcaster and skeptic Pamela Gay , and many others .
We have a total of five panels this year , and Sunday 's events have expanded to include more papers , a panel on the skeptical community 's responsibility regarding global warming , and an afternoon Million Dollar Challenge presentation .
And there are two workshops in the afternoon after the main event : Skepticism and Sexuality and Grassroots Skepticism .
The Committee for Scientific Investigation and the Skeptic Society are co-sponsoring TAM this year , which is an exciting development .
They are joining the JREF to put on the Thursday night reception that 's become an event unto itself .
With live music and a special presentation , be sure to attend and arrive early !
And do n't forget the expanded workshop offerings earlier in the day .
There are eight of them total , six on Thursday and two on Sunday , and they run two at a time concurrently .
With the All Workshop Pass , you can attend any combination of our workshops for only $ 100 .
In past years , TAM attendees have received tote bags , sharpies and even laser pointers .
This year , we are excited to announce that you 'll receive a limited edition piece of technology that will actually enhance your memory .
This is one you 'll want to keep with you always .
Our book tables have expanded with many more titles and other items of interest , and they 'll be open during the entire conference .
While the special lunches with James Randi and Richard Dawkins and other speakers on the program have completely sold out , you 'll still have plenty of opportunity to interact with guests throughout the conference .
TAM has always been a place where the speakers are accessible to all , and that tradition continues this year .
Also , we 'll be having a silent auction that may provide even more opportunities to enjoy private meals and shows with select guests and presenters , as well as other unique items .
While Martin Gardner passed away before he could make an appearance at TAM , be assured that he will be there in spirit as well as in video form .
And not to be outdone , a tribute to Jerry Andrus will bring back the magic that graced nearly every skeptical gathering for the last two decades .
Technical and logistic realities prevent us from streaming this year 's TAM live .
We regret this , but we will be videorecording the event , and the DVDs that follow will be expanded to include exclusive interviews and other interesting content .
And for the first time ever , entire TAM Talks will be released on the Internet , with special content available for members of the JREF .
TAM is nigh , and this is the one not to miss .
I can announce this now : it looks very likely that TAM 8 will sell out .
If you 're thinking of coming , right now is the time to register .
Visit http://www.amazingmeeting.com today and reserve your space at the largest and most exciting skeptic and critical thinking conference ever .
In 2001 , the United Nations created the “ Programme of Action to Prevent , Combat , and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects ” ( PoA ) .
The PoA is not a treaty .
Rather , it is a mechanism for encouraging voluntary cooperation .
The fourth biennial meeting on the PoA took place June 14 – 18 , 2010 .
In 2008 , the U.N. Secretary - General stated that the PoA ’s results as of that date were not “ substantive . ” [ 1 ]
As a voluntary mechanism , the PoA posed few dangers and offered the hope of modest gains in cooperation to address illicit arms trafficking .
The 2010 biennial meeting demonstrated that these hopes are unlikely to be fulfilled .
The better facets of the PoA are being weakened , while its worst aspects are receiving additional emphasis .
The United States should not yet withdraw from the PoA , but it should watch the PoA with care and be ready to withdraw if its unacceptable drift continues .
This drift should be a warning to the U.S. as it embarks on the treaty process for the U.N. ’s Arms Trade Treaty .
The PoA Is Going off the Rails
For believers in responsible diplomacy , the 2010 biennial meeting of the PoA was not a success .
It raised dangers that the U.S. , and Congress in particular , should watch with care .
The Danger of the PoA as a Treaty .
The U.N. wants to turn the PoA into a binding treaty .
In 2008 , the Secretary - General identified as the PoA ’s first weakness the fact that it “ is not a legally binding instrument . ”
In his opening remarks at the 2010 meeting , the High Representative for Disarmament Affairs , Sergio Duarte ( Mexico ) regretted that the PoA “ proposes neither benchmarks nor cut - off dates … [ and ] does not provide a specific framework to facilitate international assistance and cooperation . ” [ 2 ]
If the PoA were to become a treaty , all of its existing flaws would become much more dangerous .
The Danger to the Second Amendment .
The PoA ’s focus on “ illicit manufacturing ” parallels that of Inter - American Convention Against the Illicit Manufacture of and Trafficking in Firearms , negotiated under the auspices of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) . [ 3 ]
The convention poses serious dangers to the Second Amendment because it defines “ manufacturing ” in such as a way as to require nearly every gun owner to obtain a “ manufacturing ” license .
If the PoA were to become a treaty , it could pose similar dangers .
Moreover , the PoA continues to ignore — and by implication to denigrate — the existence of constitutions in three dozen nations that guarantee the right to arms , the right of self - defense , or the right to resist tyranny . [ 4 ]
The Danger to the First Amendment .
The 2010 meeting resulted in an agreement to emphasize “ the importance of promoting dialogue and a culture of peace . ”
A U.N. discussion paper argued that “ promoting a culture of peace ” requires , among other items , “ [t ] he reduction of violence in the media and in video games ” as well as “ [ s ] ustained efforts at re-education and reorientation of [ member state ] citizens . ”
In the U.S. , such efforts would be unacceptable on First Amendment grounds , as they would mandate government suppression of speech that is deemed politically incorrect by the U.N .
The Danger of Using U.S. Funding to Subsidize Terrorist States .
Much of the 2010 meeting centered on what the U.N. described as “ the need for resources . ”
This is a plea for additional funding to be distributed to member states through the U.N.
The U.S. rightly provides funding for many bilateral and multilateral programs that address illicit trafficking .
But it was clear that the U.N. wants to replace the PoA with a treaty in part because this would , in Duarte ’s words , provide a “ specific framework to facilitate international assistance and cooperation . ”
It is likely that , under such a treaty , dues would be apportioned on the same basis as they are for the U.N. ’s regular budget , meaning that the U.S. would be asked to pay 22 percent of the total .
At the 2010 meeting , Iran was particularly insistent in its demand that “ the weapon producers provide the assistance . ”
Any process that sought to force the U.S. to subsidize Iran , or other dictatorships that supply arms to terrorists , would be utterly unacceptable .
The Danger That the PoA Will Lead to Other Commitments .
The PoA ’s supporters are also the principal backers of the U.N. ’s Arms Trade Treaty , which poses many threats to U.S. interests .
[ 5 ]
Though the PoA and the Arms Trade Treaty processes are legally separate , the fact that they are closely linked in practice implies the danger that one process will be used to achieve or reinforce the aims of the other .
Moreover , in a remark the U.N. thought important to quote verbatim , the U.S. representative at the 2010 meeting stated that the U.S. “ agreed with and supported ‘ virtually everything ’ ” in one of the working papers . [ 6 ]
This paper endorsed both the OAS ’s convention , which the Senate has not ratified , and the OAS ’s model legislation for the convention , which imposes an even more onerous set of requirements , including registration of all firearms and ammunition . [ 7 ]
In short , the Administration is using the PoA to make commitments that are contingent upon the advice and consent of the Senate .
What the U.S. Should Do
The PoA is becoming a dangerous failure .
Like many international initiatives for conventional arms control , it is being hijacked by true believers who refuse to distinguish between arms used for aggression and arms used for legitimate self - defense .
As a result , the PoA ’s modest potential for good is disappearing .
This is a warning sign that the U.S. should heed as the Arms Trade Treaty process begins .
As long as the PoA ignores the fact that many U.N. member states approve of the transfers they pretend to condemn , the PoA — and especially a treaty based on it — will be counterproductive :
It will limit the defensive arms of the law - abiding , while law - breaking states continue to supply arms to their proxies .
The U.S. should resist all efforts to turn the PoA into a treaty .
If preparations for the 2012 meeting show that these efforts are continuing or that the PoA will persist in wasting time on broad , controversial , or unrelated items , the U.S. should withdraw from the PoA process .
If it participates , it should keep the focus on using voluntary cooperation between law - abiding democracies to facilitate control of illicit arms trafficking .

I ’m sure most web designers would love to get more done in a given day .
Those that do n’t probably wish they could get the work they do have done faster , giving them more free time .
The good news is that you can do both : shorten your work day and get more done .
There are hundreds of articles out there that talk about how to be more productive .
Most offer the same kinds of advice : cut distractions , stop procrastinating , and stick to a regular schedule .
But those things alone wo n’t make your more productive ( and they ’re all harder than they sound ) .
The tips below , however , will make you more productive .
1. Cut Your Hours
A lot of times , when people feel like they need to get more done , they extend the number of hours they work .
And while this seems logical , it often works against you .
If you really want to increase your productivity and the amount of work you get done in a day , decrease the number of hours you work .
If you commonly work an eight hour day , cut it to four or five hours .
If you normally work ten or twelve hours , try working for only six or eight instead .
Give yourself a set start and end time and stick to it .
If you know you have a deadline looming , you ’ll be more efficient .
You ’ll stop surfing news sites or checking the stock market ( or Facebook and Twitter ) .
You might opt to work right through lunch rather than going out to eat .
But that ’s okay , since you ’ll have an extra three to five hours at the end of the day in which to relax .
Cutting your hours takes some discipline at first .
The first couple of days , you might not get everything done .
Resist the urge to keep working .
If you do get everything done , you might get the urge to just keep working , since you ’ve got time left in the day .
Resist that urge , too .
Once you ’re at the point where you ’re consistently working shorter , more productive days , then you can occasionally stay a bit longer to finish things up .
Until that point , stick to your reduced - hour schedule .
2. Turn Off Your Computer
Computers are the primary tool of designers and developers .
Without our computers , we could n’t finish ( or sometimes even start ) our work .
So it seems counter - intuitive to turn off your computer to get more done .
When you ’re in the early stages of a project , you often spend a lot of time gathering materials and finding inspiration .
But there are so many possible sources of inspiration online that it can work against you .
Instead , turn off your computer and pick up a pen and paper .
Brainstorm about possibilities .
Create mind - maps .
Beyond that , go outside and look for some inspiration .
Or pick up a book or magazine ( better yet : go to your local library or bookstore and peruse the stacks there ) .
Find things to inspire and motivate you offline .
In many cases , you can come up with a more directed vision for the project if you get rid of distractions .
3. Let Your Designs Sit for Awhile
This is advice often given to writers .
When you finish a first draft of something , put it aside before you go on to editing and revising .
The same applies to design .
Once you have your design figured out , set it aside for a bit before you start coding .
This serves a two - fold purpose .
First of all , when you ’ve just finished a design , of course you think it ’s wonderful .
You might think it ’s the best design you ’ve ever done .
You might even think it ’s the best design anyone ’s ever done .
You might be right , but chances are , it could be better .
By putting it aside for a few days or a week , you can come back to it with more objective eyes .
You may see places where you want to tweak the design .
While this does lengthen your design process a bit , it also can result in much better finished products .
The other reason you want to step back is that it can often give you insight into any issues you might have had with the design .
Maybe you were n’t crazy about how one client problem or another was solved .
If you step back , you can often come up with better solutions than those that originally presented themselves .
4. Work When You ’re Most Productive
There are certain times during the day when some people are more productive than others .
For many people , first thing in the morning is their most productive time of day .
For others , it might be after lunch , or in the evening , or even at three in the morning .
Try working at different times of the day and see when you ’re most productive .
Just because standard business hours are 9 to 5 does n’t mean that ’s when you have to work .
Even if you ’re not a freelancer , you may be able to adjust your workday to better accommodate your naturally productive times ( just talk to your boss about it , making sure to cite that you get way more done at a certain time of day ) .
5. Always Be Ready for Inspiration
One of the biggest hindrances to productivity is not having the right ideas at the right time .
We know there ’s a solution to whatever problem is ailing us , but we just ca n’t seem to find it .
Then it hits us when we ’re out at the post office , or sitting down to dinner at a restaurant , or otherwise unable to actually do anything with that sudden breakthrough .
This is why it ’s vital that you always have something available to record these bits of inspiration and out - of - the - blue ideas .
Most designers probably have a smart phone , so make sure you download an app or two that will let you either make voice recordings or sketch ideas or take notes .
Alternatively , carry a small notebook and pen with you wherever you go .
Something like the squared Moleskine pocket - size notebooks are perfect ( the pages are graph paper , so they ’re perfect for everything from writing to mind - mapping to wireframing ) .
6. Standardize Your Process
Having a standardized process for your website projects can make a huge difference in your productivity .
Figure out the steps you normally take when designing a site ( everything from fact - finding to wireframing to coding and everything in between ) and write them down .
Then , whenever you have a new project , pull out your list of normal steps and make a schedule based on them .
If you have to , just keep track of everything you do for one or two projects .
There are almost always things that come up unexpectedly , but for the most part , many web design projects resemble each other quite closely , at least as far as the process goes .
Another hint here is to batch process items .
While designs are n’t necessarily conducive to batch processing , other aspects of your business might be .
Dealing with email is one of the most obvious .
Instead of dealing with email as it comes in , check your email only a couple times a day and deal with it all at once .
Same goes for preparing proposals , invoices , or other paperwork - related tasks .
Often , these things can be done during your non-peak productive hours , as they often do n’t require as much creativity and thought as actual design tasks .
7. Use Music as a Tool
Music can be a great motivator if you use it properly .
Fitting the music you ’re listening to to your project is a great way to stay on focus and really capture the mood of the project .
You can also listen to music that increases your energy levels and gets you pumped up .
Fast - paced music can often make you work faster without even realizing it .
Your body ’s natural rhythm will adjust itself to your surroundings .
Surround yourself with upbeat , high - energy sounds , and you ’ll be more upbeat and high - energy , and therefore more productive .
Remember that the opposite is also true .
If you ’re listening to something that ’s slow or melancholy , you ’re likely to see your productivity levels drop .
Save music like that for after work .
8. Choose Better Projects
Many designers do n’t have to take every job that comes their way .
This allows you to pick and choose which projects you want to work on .
Rather than focusing solely on the most profitable projects , make sure you ’re choosing some that you really want to work on .
If you ’re enjoying the site you ’re working on , you ’re more likely to get it done faster .
You wo n’t dread starting work in the morning , and you wo n’t drag your feet as the project progresses .
Some people feel like if you hate a project , you ’ll be more motivated to get it over with , but that ’s rarely the case in practice .
Enthusiasm breeds a lot more productivity than dread does .
If you love what you ’re doing , you ’ll put that much more energy into it .
If you hate what you ’re working on , you ’ll find all sorts of ways to procrastinate .
And procrastination is the enemy of productivity .
So if you find yourself putting off projects , try to figure out if there ’s a way you can hand them off to someone else , so you can get back to the projects you ’re enjoying .
Even if that means outsourcing part of a project .
9. Get Help if You Need It
Sometimes you ’re going to get stuck on projects .
This might be because you just do n’t have the necessary skills , or because you ’ve lost motivation and developed a mental block .
In either case , you need to know when it ’s time to call in outside help .
Outside help does n’t necessarily mean you need to outsource to some faceless company .
You probably have friends who are designers or developers who might want to pick up the extra work .
Give some of them a call and see if they ’d be willing to be a sub- contractor for that particular project .
Even if it ’s a friend , make sure you get everything in writing , including how and when they ’ll be paid .
Consider doing this on a regular basis , too .
Maybe you hate scripting , or converting your designs to HTML , or whatever .
Find someone who enjoys that work ( and is good at it ) and make arrangements to outsource that work to them on a regular basis .
It ’ll result in better designs , and you ’ll be less likely to procrastinate or get burned out .
10 . Make an Effort to Keep Your Stress Levels Low
Stress is one of the biggest hindrances to productivity and creativity out there .
When you ’re stressed , whether it ’s because of work or life , you ’ll have a harder time finishing projects in a productive and efficient manner .
Plus , high stress levels are very unhealthy and can lead to getting sick more often .
And if you ’re out of work sick , you ’re certainly not being productive .
There are some simple things you can do that will lower your stress levels , even if you do n’t remove the things that are stressing you out .
Eating healthy and exercising are the two biggest ones .
Skip the double - quarter - pounder with cheese and bring a bag lunch instead .
Take a walk on your lunch break or when you get up in the morning , even if it ’s just for fifteen minutes .
Doing these things will help reduce your stress levels regardless of the things causing you stress .
Another great stress - reliever is a good hobby .
Find something you enjoy doing and that relaxes you , and make time for it in your schedule .
This could be anything from playing chess to reading a good book to paragliding .
It does n’t matter what it is , as long as it ’s something you enjoy and something that makes you feel better .
Conclusion
Getting more done does n’t have to lead to longer hours .
All you need to do is maximize your productivity and efficiency in the time you want to spend working .
The tips above can help you do just that .

A man with some things on / in his mind .

This piece originally ran in 2010 .
We are republishing it on the occasion of the film ’s 10th anniversary , ahead of the expected release of Christopher Nolan ’s latest tale of corporate espionage , Tenet .
As pretty much everyone knows by now , Inception ’s titular concept is the placement of an idea into a character ’s subconscious — a notion that the film presents as being more or less unprecedented .
And the plot mostly concerns the efforts of our heroes , led by master dream extractor Dom Cobb ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) to somehow convince Fischer ( Cillian Murphy ) , the heir to a major energy titan , to split up his father ’s empire , without realizing that the idea came from them .
But since this is a Christopher Nolan movie , we ’re not convinced it ’s all that simple ; the director ’s films almost always turn in on themselves .
We think there might be another inception going on in Inception .
Needless to say , there are spoilers here , so you should probably not read this if you have n’t seen the film .
( Though if you have n’t seen the film , you probably wo n’t know what the hell we ’re talking about anyway . )
The process of inception works , we ’re told , by placing the simplest form of an idea deep into a character ’s subconscious as they ’re dreaming , through a series of suggestions that effectively lead the character to “ give himself the idea ” ( in the words of Tom Hardy ’s master forger Eames ) .
And the subconscious , we ’re told , is motivated by emotion , not reason , and that a positive emotion trumps a negative one .
The very deepest level of the subconscious is represented by a safe or a vault , inside which the mind keeps its most private thoughts and / or memories .
“ Do you want to become an old man , filled with regret , waiting to die alone ? ”
These words ( or something close to them ) are uttered three times in the film .
The first time , the words are those of Saito ( Ken Watanabe ) , in his helicopter in Kyoto , when he first approaches Cobb about the possibility of inception .
The second time , it ’s in the first level of Fischer ’s dream , after Saito has been shot , and Cobb tries to tell him that he ’s not going to die : “ You ’re gonna become an old man , ” Cobb says , and Saito replies , “ Filled with regret . ”
Cobb completes the thought : “ Waiting to die alone . ”
Already , it ’s clear that this dialogue has to do with more than this particular moment in the film .
It ’s also significant that this happens just as Eames ( Tom Hardy ) , pretending to be Browning ( Tom Berenger ) is trying to plant the idea ( “ incept ” ? ) into Fischer ’s head that his father may have wanted to split up his company .
Fischer ’s and Cobb ’s fates seem strangely intertwined through the film .
( “ The deeper we go into Fischer , the deeper we go into you , ” Ariadne says to Cobb . )
The final utterance happens near the end of the film , in Limbo , as Cobb finds the aging Saito .
This time , Saito begins the exchange : “ I ’m an old man , ” he says .
“ Filled with regret , ” Cobb replies .
There ’s something specially poignant about this scene , coming as it does on the heels of Cobb having told the shadow of his wife Mal ( Marion Cotillard ) that they did grow old together in their dream together on Limbo , many years ago , and that he has to let her go .
This may well be the real “ inception . ”
Cobb ’s character has been consumed by regret — regret at what he ’s done to his wife , regret at having abandoned his children , regret at not being able to return home .
In his dreams he ’s built an elevator ( literally ! ) that stops at floors , each defined by a moment he regrets and that ( as Cobb himself explains to Ariadne ) he has to “ change . ”
This elevator , and its forbidden Basement floor , which opens to the hotel room where his wife leaped to her death , could be seen as the vault in which Cobb keeps his innermost thoughts , much like the hospital / hangar where Fischer imagines his father ’s deathbed , or the safe in Saito ’s dream - fortress from the earlier scenes of the film .
Interestingly , in Nolan ’s first film , Following , one of the characters is a thief named Cobb who breaks into people ’s homes and likes to say , “ Everybody has their box , ” referring to a box into which people always place seemingly random objects that are of sentimental value to them .
In Inception , too , everybody has their box — be it a safe , a fortified hangar surrounded by armed guards on skis , or a stop on an elevator on which no one is allowed .
In other words , the hotel room where Cobb last saw his wife , which is the forbidden floor on his Dream Elevator of Regret , is his “ box . ”
Regret is the idea that defines Cobb ( which makes his recurrent use of the Edith Piaf song “ Non , Je Ne Regrette Rien ” as a musical countdown to the end of a given dream rather ironic and touching ) , and in order for him to be free , he has to defeat it .
The second part of the message that Cobb and Saito exchange in their final scene in Limbo — “ Take a leap of faith .
Come back , so we can be young men together again ” — is in direct contrast to Mal ’s desire to pull him further into his dream so that they can grow old together .
Cobb defeats his regret by finally telling Mal that the two of them did grow old together in their shared dream .
In other words , he fulfilled his wedding promise to her .
This is , perhaps , the thing that Cobb once knew but had forgotten ; it ’s also a positive thought that trumps the negative feeling that he betrayed his wife .
It seems like a realization on his part when he actually says it to her ; but it ’s been basically suggested to him through Saito ’s repetition of the “ old man , filled with regret , waiting to die alone ” meme .
So , is Cobb being pulled back to reality by this thought , or is he being prodded further into his dream ?
That depends , perhaps , on how you view the very end of the film :
At this point , Cobb seems to be finally freed of his regret and of his memory of Mal , and has been reunited with his children .
The final shot seems to indicate that he may be still dreaming ( because his totem keeps spinning ) .
If so , then he has either lost himself in Limbo entirely , or Mal was right all along , and his world was always a dream .
But whether he ’s still dreaming may ultimately be irrelevant :
The important thing is that Cobb has been freed of his demons , and can now be reunited with what to him appear to be his real children — be they a projection or reality .
Or , as the old man in Mombassa puts it , referring to the opium den of dreamers in Yusuf ’s basement : “ They come here to be woken up .
Their dream has become their reality .
Who are you to say otherwise ? ”

Das ist jetzt nicht wahr , oder ?
Dass es eine mittelgroße Empörungswelle gibt , weil ZDF - Moderatorin Katrin Müller - Hohenstein in der Halbzeitpause eines Fußballspiels , das offenbar gerade stattgefunden hat , gesagt hat , für Miroslav Klose müsse sein Treffer doch „ ein innerer Reichsparteitag “ sein ?
Für mich ist das eine alltägliche Redewendung , um einen besonderen Triumph zu beschreiben , ein Gefühl von Schadenfreude oder die Genugtuung , es allen gezeigt zu haben .
Von mir aus können wir gerne darüber diskutieren , ob das eine besonders passende oder geschmackvolle Redewendung ist — aber doch nicht ernsthaft darüber , dass der öffentliche Gebrauch der Formulierung einen Nazi -Skandal darstellt ?
Oh doch .
Die immer um billige Aufmerksamkeit heischenden Klickstreckenproduzenten von „ Welt Online “ begannen sofort zu hyperventilieren :
Der Artikel wurde offenbar hektisch auf - und umgeschrieben .
Anfangs hieß es in sicher irgendwie bedeutungsvoller Ausführlichkeit :
Diese Redewendung bezieht sich auf die Reichsparteitage der NSDAP in den 1930er Jahren , die mit ihren Aufmärschen , Paraden , Appellen , Totengedenken und Wehrmachtsvorführungen in ihrem Repräsentationsgebaren den Charakter einer offiziellen Staatsfeier trugen .
Sie dienten der Demonstration des absoluten Machtanspruches der NSDAP und der Ideologie des NS - Staates : Disziplin und Ordnung , die Unterwerfung des Individuums unter einen gemeinsamen Willen .
( Den wesentlichen Teil davon hat der diensthabende Content - Produzent sicherheitshalber von den Seiten des Deutschen Historischen Museums kopiert . )
Später verunglückte ein neuer Formulierungs - und Skandalisierungsversuch so :
Reichsparteitage beziehen sich auf die Veranstaltungen , bei denen Adolf Hitlers NSDAP besonders ab 1933 ihre verhängnisvolle , menschenverachtende Propaganda im großen Stil ausbreitete .
Offenbar ist der Gebrauch der Redewendung für die „ Welt “ ein schlimmer Tabubruch , wobei … nö :
„ Welch innerer Reichsparteitag muss es jenem englischen Journalisten gewesen sein , dem damals die Bezeichnung „ Bum - Bum - Boris “ einfiel ( … ) . “
( „ Welt “ , 15 . Dezember 2000 ) „ Dort überall kreuzt nämlich die ganze Julian - Clique auf ( … ) – bis sie dann alle Mann hoch ihren inneren Reichsparteitag in Gorleben , als Gegner der Castor - Transporte natürlich , erleben . “
( „ Welt “ , 19 . Februar 2005 ) „ Tja , der vergangene Sonntag war den ehemaligen SED - Politikern , die sich heute in der Linken versammeln , ein innerer Reichsparteitag . “
( „ Welt “ , 30 . Januar 2008 )
Schlimm scheint es vor allem zu sein , wenn Frauen eine solche Formulierung gebrauchen .
Denn Frauen machen beim Fußball , wie „ Welt Online “ - Autor Jörg Winterfeldt weiß , immer Fehler :
Traditionell haben Frauen es im medialen Fußball - Umfeld schwer .
Das haben gerade im ZDF immer wieder leidvoll Frontfrauen erfahren müssen von Carmen Thomas , die bis heute noch gelegentlich auf ihren Fauxpas „ Schalke 05 “ aus dem Juli 1973 reduziert wird , bis zu Christine Reinhart , die ab 1993 zwei Jahre lang im Sportstudio moderieren durfte .
Doch Müller - Hohenstein hatte sich vor der WM sehr aggressiv zu vermarkten versucht und nun gleich bei ihrem ersten großen Auftritt schwer gepatzt (…)
Die „ sehr aggressive “ Vermarktung muss mir irgendwie entgangen sein , was bei meinem Desinteresse an Fußball natürlich nicht ausgeschlossen ist — aber ist es nicht interessant , dass vermeintliche „ Patzer “ , die Frauen machen , von Quatschmedien wie „ Welt Online “ immer mit ihrem Geschlecht in Verbindung gebracht werden ?
Wo bleibt , wenn Johannes B. Kerner wieder einmal Unsinn verzapft hat , die Bildergalerie zum Thema „ peinliche Fehltritte von Männern “ ?
Besonders niedlich ist der Nazifizierungsversuch von „ Welt Online “ aber auch in seiner Ahnungslosigkeit über das Kommunikationsverhalten der Menschen bei „ Twitter “ :
Der Fehltritt geriet so folgenschwer , dass viele Fans sich in der zweiten Halbzeit schon vor den Computer setzten , statt sich ganz der zweiten Halbzeit von Deutschlands erstem WM - Auftritt in Südafrika zu widmen .
Man sieht sie förmlich , die Massen , die sich vor dem geistigen Auge des Autors mit den Armen in den Hüften vom Platz vor dem Fernseher erhoben oder empört von der Public - Viewing - Party nach Hause stapften , um dort erst einmal vor lauter Ärger den Computer hochzufahren — als hätten die Leute , von denen da „ gewettert , getwittert und in sozialen Netzwerken online diskutiert “ wurde , nicht ohnehin vor dem Computer gesessen .
Und dann holt „ Welt Online “ auch noch Eva Herman aus der Kiste :
Besonders erstaunlich scheint Müller - Hohensteins Entgleisung vor dem Hintergrund , dass erst unlängst eine Moderatorinnenkollegin mit Vergleichen zu Hitlers Herrschaft für einen Skandal und in der Folge ihre Entlassung gesorgt hatte :
Die frühere Nachrichtensprecherin Eva Herman hatte den Umgang der Nationalsozialisten mit Werten wie Kinder , Mütter , Familien und Zusammenhalt , „ als das , was gut war “ charakterisiert .
Sehen wir einmal von den falschen Anführungszeichen und dem angestrengten Versuch ab , eine nicht vorhandene Parallele zu konstruieren und dem Wörtchen „ unlängst “ auch noch eine mehrjährige Zeitspanne aufzubürden — dass Eva Herman mit ihrem inzwischen berüchtigten Worthaufen den „ Umgang der Nationalsozialisten “ mit diesen Werten als positiv einstufte , ist mindestens umstritten , und das Oberlandesgericht Köln hat dem Axel - Springer - Verlag untersagt , Herman so zu zitieren , als habe sie den Nationalsozialismus in Teilen gutgeheißen .
Und die ganze Aufregung , das ganze schlimme „ Welt Online “ - Gemurkse , weil Katrin Müller - Hohenstein von einem „ inneren Reichsparteitag “ gesprochen hat ?
Weiß jemand , ob die in Südafrika Autobahnen haben ?
PS : Leider haben sich auch die Freunde von „ 11 Freunde “ in für mich unfassbare Rage geschrieben ( „ Katrin Müller - Hohenstein bettelt um ihre Entlassung “ ) , aber mein Empörungsempörungspotential ist nun erschöpft .
I know you ’ve all penned this day in your calendars , I know I ’ve been waiting for this day a long time : Today , LR Health & Beauty Systems is debuting squinty tough guy Bruce Willis ‘ “ signature collection , ” which he created in partnership with the German beauty company .
“ I personally feel that the new Bruce Willis fragrance is the manliest scent in the world , ” said Tilo Plöger , chief operating officer of LR Health & Beauty Systems .
The Willis scent reportedly contains notes of grapefruit , pepper , and vetiver .
First announced in April , the collection includes hair and body wash , deodorant , aftershave balm , and eau de parfum–which clocks in at ~ 15 % aromatic compounds compared to eau de cologne ’s ~ 5 % –since naturally , badasses need to smell strongly of badasses .
According to United Networker , Bruce Willis told reporters at the press conference in Frankfurt “ with great enthusiasm ” that “ the development of my new fragrance together with the very committed and passionate LR team was really a lot of fun .
The products stand for individuality , uniqueness and sustainability .
That ’s what convinced me , and what unites me with LR . ”
The design of the perfume bottle , in the classy yet intrepid , indomitable , macho , rugged style expected of Willis , incorporates a huge metal badge which adorns “ the exceptionally high - quality glass flacon , ” which apparently is “ heavy in the hand , ” because John McClane would never use lightweight perfume bottles , damn it !
And of course , the packaging mimics “ brushed aluminium and embossed riveting . ”
Finally , the product tagline is the stuff of Don Draper : “ Smart Guys Live Forever . ”
Damned straight .

HMS Investigator was abandoned in 1853 trying to find earlier mission searching for north - west passage across North America
Canadian archaeologists have found a British ship abandoned more than 150 years ago in the quest for the north - west passage , the fabled sea route across North America , the head of the team said .
Marc -Andre Bernier , Parks Canada 's head of underwater archaeology , said the HMS Investigator was found in shallow water in Mercy Bay along the northern coast of Banks Island in Canada 's western Arctic .
The ship had been abandoned in the ice in 1853 while trying to find the doomed earlier expedition of Sir John Franklin .
" The ship is standing upright in very good condition .
It 's standing in about 11 metre ( 36 feet ) of water , " he said .
" This is the ship that sailed the last leg of the north - west passage . "
The Investigator was one of many American and British ships sent in search of the HMS Erebus and the Terror , vessels commanded by Franklin in his ill - fated hunt for the north - west passage in 1845 .
The Canadian environment minister , Jim Prentice , said the British government has been informed of the find , as well as the discovery of the bodies of three sailors .
Captained by Robert McClure , the Investigator set sail in 1850 .
When McClure brought the ship into the strait that now bears his name , he realised that he was on the final leg of the north - west passage .
But before he could sail into the Beaufort Sea , the ship was blocked by pack ice and forced to winter in Prince of Wales Strait , along the east coast of Banks Island .
The following summer , McClure tried again to sail to the end of the passage , but was again blocked by ice .
He steered the ship and crew into a large bay on the island 's north coast which he named the Bay of Mercy .
There they were to remain until 1853 , when they were rescued by the crew of the HMS Resolute .
The Investigator was abandoned .
" This is actually a human history , " said Bernier .
" Not only a history of the passage , but the history of a crew of 60 men who had to overwinter three times in the Arctic not knowing if they were going to survive . "
The Parks Canada team arrived at Mercy Bay on 22 July .
Three days later , the ice on the bay cleared enough that researchers were able to deploy side - scanning sonar from a small inflatable boat over the site where they believed the wooden ship had eventually sunk .
Within 15 minutes , the Investigator was found .
The masts and rigging have long been sheared off by ice and weather .
But the icy waters of the McClure Strait has preserved the vessel in remarkably good condition .
" It 's incredible , " said Prentice from Mercy Bay .
" You 're actually able to peer down into the water and see not only the outline of the ship but actually the individual timbers .
The graves of three sailors thought to have died of scurvy have been marked off and will be left undisturbed , said Bernier .
103 = 1 x 10 x 10 x 10
102 = 1 x 10 x 10
101 = 1 x 10
100 = 1
102 ÷ 102 = 102 - 2 = 100 = 1 code for calculating 10^n :
input n
x = 1
for i=1 to n
x = 10 * x
next i
print x
Look at this :
103 = 10 x 10 x 10
102 = 10 x 10
101 = 10
So far so good .
Now let 's look at the negative exponents :
10 - 3 = 1 / ( 10x10x10 )
10 - 2 = 1 / ( 10 x 10 )
10 - 1 = 1 / 10
What should go in between - 1 and 1 ?
0 , but what value should we be giving to 0 anyway ?
Sounds tricky ... or is it ?
Recall that exponents are based on multiplication .
So maybe we can multiply 1/10 by 10 to find out what the value should be .
Going back , we can see the following :
101 = 10
100 = ?
10 - 1 = 1 / 10
So :
( 1 / 10 ) * 10 = 1
given : 10x/10x=1
10x/10y=10x-y
now , 10 to the power 0 = 10x -x
= 10x/10x
=1
since the powers can " cancel " each other
given two nonnegative integers a and b , if A is a set with a elements and B is a set with b elements , then there are b^a mappings whose domain is A and codomain is B .
If A is an empty set ( a=0 ) , the only one mapping is the empty one .
if s is a positive real number , by definition , s^p = exp ( p* ln (s ) ) , exp is the exponential function and ln the natural logarithm .
If p=0 , s^p = exp ( p* ln (s ) ) = exp ( 0 ) = 1 .

In 1982 , researchers affiliated with the Cooper Institute in Dallas surveyed a large group of well - educated , affluent men .
The researchers were interested in the men ’s exercise habits , but they also asked , almost incidentally , about their indolence .
Specifically , they inquired about how many hours each day the men spent watching television or sitting in a car .
( This was before you could do both at once . )
Over the years , the survey ’s main results were used to reinforce a growing body of science about the health benefits of regular exercise .
But the information about the amount of time the men spent being inactive remained largely unexplored .
Recently , however , scientists from the University of South Carolina and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge , La. , parsed the full data .
In a study published in May in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise , they reported that , to no one ’s surprise , the men who sat the most had the greatest risk of heart problems .
Men who spent more than 23 hours a week watching TV and sitting in their cars ( as passengers or as drivers ) had a 64 percent greater chance of dying from heart disease than those who sat for 11 hours a week or less .
What was unexpected was that many of the men who sat long hours and developed heart problems also exercised .
Quite a few of them said they did so regularly and led active lifestyles .
The men worked out , then sat in cars and in front of televisions for hours , and their risk of heart disease soared , despite the exercise .
Their workouts did not counteract the ill effects of sitting .
Most of us have heard that sitting is unhealthy .
But many of us also have discounted the warnings , since we spend our lunch hours conscientiously visiting the gym .
We consider ourselves sufficiently active .
But then we drive back to the office , settle at our desks and sit for the rest of the day .
We are , in a phrase adopted by physiologists , ‘‘ active couch potatoes . ’’
The amount of time that most Americans spend being inactive has risen steadily in recent decades .
A 2009 editorial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine reported that , on average , adults spend more than nine hours a day in oxymoronic ‘‘ sedentary activities . ’’
For studies like these , scientists categorize activities by the number of METs they demand .
A MET , or metabolic equivalent of task , is a measure of energy , with one MET being the amount of energy you burn lying down for one minute .
Sedentary behaviors demand one to one and a half METs , or very little exertion .
Decades ago , before the advent of computers , plasma TVs and Roombas , people spent more time completing ‘‘ light - intensity activities , ’’ which require between one and a half and three METs .
Most ‘‘ home activities , ’’ like mopping , cooking and changing light bulbs , demand between two and three METs .
( One exception is ‘‘ butchering animals , ’’ a six - MET activity , according to a bogglingly comprehensive compilation from 2000 of the METs associated with different activities . )
Nowadays , few of us accumulate much light - intensity activity .
We ’ve replaced those hours with sitting .
The physiological consequences are only slowly being untangled .
In a number of recent animal studies , when rats or mice were not allowed to amble normally around in their cages , they rapidly developed unhealthy cellular changes in their muscles .
The animals showed signs of insulin resistance and had higher levels of fatty acids in their blood .
Scientists believe the changes are caused by a lack of muscular contractions .
If you sit for long hours , you experience no ‘‘isometric contraction of the antigravity ( postural ) muscles , ’’ according to an overview of the consequences of inactivity published this month in Exercise and Sports Sciences Reviews .
Your muscles , unused for hours at a time , change in subtle fashion , and as a result , your risk for heart disease , diabetes and other diseases can rise .
Regular workout sessions do not appear to fully undo the effects of prolonged sitting .
‘‘ There seem to be different pathways ’’ involved in the beneficial physiological effects of exercising and the deleterious impacts of sitting , says Tatiana Warren , a graduate student in exercise science at the University of South Carolina and the lead author of the study of men who sat too much .
‘‘ One does not undo the other , ’’ she says .
You can , however , ameliorate the dangers of inactivity with several easy steps — actual steps .
‘‘ Look for ways to decrease physical inactivity , ’’ Ms. Warren says , beyond 30 - minute bouts of jogging or structured exercise .
Stand up .
Pace around your office .
Get off the couch and grab a mop or change a light bulb the next time you watch ‘‘ Dancing With the Stars . ’’

It 's apples and oranges .
If anyone can actually remember , think about what SWG was like at launch and compare that SWG to SWTOR .
Then and ONLY then will you convince me that SWG was better .
Fact of the matter is that this is the first MMO I have ever bought at launch , so I can not do this .
I was in SWG Beta , and SWTOR Beta .
I was in both on launch day , and on from there .
This game is 3 months old and at that age in each game :
SWG , I had one character and played it 6 to 8 hours a day , 7 days a week .
( and that was after a full 8 to 10 hour work day )
SWTOR , I have multiple characters and play 3 to 4 hours a day , but not every day .
SWG , I had dozens of friends I logged in and played with every day , no matter what time of day I played .
SWTOR , I am lucky to have 3 to 4 guild mates on at any given time , and each planet I am on is lucky to have 20 players on it .
And this is at " peak " play times , get on after peak ours and the game worlds are ghost towns .
I have to go to the fleet to see more than 4 other players in the same place I 'm at .
SWG , I have stories I repeat to this day of the early gorup adventures ( multiple groups of 7 each hunting Ewoks on Endor to make them an endagerd species ) and I still have contact to this day with friends I made in those early days .
SWTOR , I may as well be playing this on a console with my 13 year old son occasionally grabbing controller 2 and tag teaming some content with me .
SWG , I was telling myself " I will play this game till the day they shut the servers down . "
SWTOR , I am telling myself " I 'll play this game till I get one complete charater of each class , then I will un-sub and re-visit if / when new content is worth checking out ..... or till a better SW game comes along " .
Is SWTOR bad ?
No , it is what it was designed to be .
And I hope that going forawrd they expand it enough to keep me interested in playing .
I just happen to like what SWG was ( at 3 months old ) more than what SWTOR is today .
I play it because I like Star Wars games , and even if SWG was still up and running I may play SWTOR just because it is set in the Old Republic era and offers some things that are different , but I would still be playing SWG ( especially if it was pre-NGE SWG ) .
I 'll give you a more fair compairison .

My man of the week is Syrian President Bashar Assad .
His call to calm the crisis in Israeli - Turkish relations seems like a serious attempt to cool the mutual invective between Ankara and Jerusalem .
“ If the relationship between Turkey and Israel is not renewed , it will be very difficult for Turkey to play a role in negotiations to revive the Middle East peace process , ” Assad said on Monday in Spain .
And he added that failure to mend these ties would “ without doubt affect the stability in the region . ”
Assad ’s balanced position was a surprise .
Instead of getting up and cursing Israel for its “ aggression ” against a Gaza - bound flotilla in May , he acted like a responsible neighbor by trying to calm the dispute .
His remarks are being interpreted as a diplomatic warning to Turkey ’s leaders :
If you continue quarreling with Israel , you will lose your influence and encourage the extremists who undermine stability .
Cool it .
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his foreign minister , Ahmet Davutoglu , have turned out to be talented diplomats .
The flotilla that set out for the Gaza Strip under their aegis resulted in the easing of Israel ’s blockade on Gaza .
And Davutoglu ’s recent meeting with Industry , Trade and Labor Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer did more to undermine the unity of Israel ’s governing coalition than any other incident to date .
Even U.S. President Barack Obama , for all his efforts , was unable to so threaten the stability of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s rule .
But the Turks are not resting on their laurels .
They are presenting the discord with Israel as an issue of national honor .
They demand that Israel apologize for the killing of Turkish civilians during its boarding of the Mavi Marmara , or alternatively , that Israel allow itself to be investigated by an international commission and pledge to accept its conclusions .
Otherwise , Ankara will cut its ties with Israel .
Netanyahu , however , has made it clear that Israel will not apologize “ for our soldiers being forced to defend themselves . ”
The moment the run-in becomes an issue of honor , it is difficult to find a solution .
How can one compromise on national honor and look like a dishrag to the rest of the world ?
And Turkey ’s alternative demand , that Israel agree to an international probe , is less humiliating than the demand for an apology , but still very problematic .
First of all , by easing the blockade of Gaza after the flotilla incident , Israel admitted in retrospect that its previous policy was wrong .
No international commission will justify the blockade after Netanyahu has renounced it .
Second , there is no “ objective ” commission .
An international commission headed by Alan Dershowitz will rule completely differently than a commission headed by Richard Goldstone , even if they are shown the same evidence .
Clearly , the third option , cutting off ties , would be very bad for Israel , and Netanyahu must make every effort to prevent it .
He seems to understand this , and therefore dispatched Ben-Eliezer to meet with the Turkish foreign minister .
But the meeting was fruitless .
There is another way out of the entanglement :
Move the disagreement from the field of honor to the field of interests , and thereby give both sides an opportunity to emerge from the corner into which they have painted themselves .
This is where Assad comes in .
The Israeli establishment , which admired Assad senior , tends to disparage his son and depict him as a confused , bumbling child .
But that is foolishness and conceit .
In his 10 years in power , Bashar Assad has maintained Syria ’s internal stability and secular character , retaken control of Lebanon and nurtured Hezbollah as a strategic deterrent against Israel .
That is quite a bit .
Assad ’s decision not to respond to the 2007 bombing of the nuclear reactor he built in the desert shows that he is a rational and restrained leader .
It is not hard to imagine how Israel would respond to an attack on a military base in its territory : with strategic bombing , all - out war and anxieties about holocaust and destruction .
Assad showed that sometimes , it is better to sit quietly .
The bombing may have destroyed the reactor , but Syria ’s strategic standing in the region has only grown stronger since then .
After the attack on the reactor , in which Israel once again violated Turkish sovereignty , former prime minister Ehud Olmert was quick to renew talks with Syria , mediated by Erdogan and Davutoglu .
The Turks restrained themselves over the flight across their airspace and set to work to lead a diplomatic effort that calmed tension in the north .
Now , Assad is proposing the same deal , in the opposite direction :
Let ’s renew talks on the Syrian channel and give the Turks and Israelis something important to deal with instead of mutual recriminations over the flotilla .
Instead of competing over who has more honor , it would be better to work to improve the region ’s situation .
Erdogan and Netanyahu should listen to their responsible neighbor .
They might discover that the road from Ankara to Jerusalem can also run through Damascus .
The corrugated steel wall of the gymnasium at Yardley Court School in Tonbridge , Kent , there was a jagged hole punched into the metal about five feet from the ground .
By 1956 , the outer edges had rusted red and white but we 10 - year - olds could stick our fingers into it and feel the sharp edges inside .
Maurice Bickmore , the obsessive and sadistic headmaster , would almost mellow when he told us how it had come to be there – whenever his anger frothed out at us we had learnt to ask him about the hole in the gymnasium wall to cool him down .
" I was standing just over there in the schoolyard , " he would say every time , " and a German plane came right over the building chased by a Spitfire , and the Spitfire was shooting and one of the bullets hit the gym with a tremendous bang . "
I had books about the fighter aircraft of the Second World War and I quickly identified that corroded hole in the wall as the effect of 22 mm Hispano cannon fire , ......... f unless the Spitfire pilot had used his twin Browning .303 machine guns .
If it was a Spitfire .
I wanted it to be a Spitfire with its clean leaf - like wings and its devastating profile .
I had Airfix kits with which I constructed the fighters and bombers of the war – German , British , American , even a couple of stubby Japanese Mitsubishis , all stuck together with LePage 's Aeroplane Glue , although my Mum had to help me build the Avro Lancaster – but it was the Spitfire that mesmerised me .
I could put my upright thumb under the fuselage of the tiny glue - stuck , completed scale - model aircraft just forward of the ailerons , and it would balance perfectly , swaying gently backwards and forwards with no danger of toppling off , even if my thumb imitated the turbulence of a sudden cumulonimbus at Angels Twenty .
By 1942 , RAF 616 Squadron 's Spitfire HF VIIs could reach Angels 43 – forty - three thousand feet – with a maximum speed of more than 400 miles an hour at Angels 25 .
There was n't much you could teach Master Fisk about the Supermarine Spitfire – even if he had been born almost six years to the day after the start of the Battle of Britain , as the desperate campaign fought out mostly in the skies above southern England from 10 July to 31 October 1940 is remembered .
It was the Spitfire 's swept - back cockpit canopy that gave it the edge , lifted it out of the 1930s and put it firmly into the 1940s and the design of the future .
Even at 10 years old , I knew there was something special about it – just as I realised , in a much vaguer way – that the Spitfire was emblematic of something unprecedented and necessary about the Battle of Britain .
All the other fighter planes that entered the war in 1939 were artistically clunky , even the Hawker Hurricane with its boxy cockpit and fat fuselage which some say had more claim to victory in the skies over Kent in 1940 .
I liked my model German Messerschmitt 109f – partly because of its yellow - painted engine cowling – but it too had a square hen -coop of a cockpit for the pilot and a priggish tail .
No wonder , asked what he needed to win the battle , Oberstleutnant Adolf Galland ( Knight 's Cross and Oak Leaves and Swords ) turned to his bejeweled Field Marshal Goering with one word : " Spitfires . "
The young pilot Richard Hillary was to recall , almost mystically , the moment he approached his first Spitfire :
" The Spitfires stood in two lines outside ' A ' Flight Pilots ' room .
The dull grey - brown of the camouflage could not conceal the clear - cut beauty , the wicked simplicity of their lines .
I hooked up my parachute and climbed awkwardly into the low cockpit .
I noticed how small was my field of vision .
Kilmartin swung himself on to a wing and started to run through the instruments .
I was conscious of his voice , but heard nothing of what he said .
I was to fly a Spitfire .
It was what I had most wanted to do through all the long dreary months of training .
If I could fly a Spitfire , it would be worth it ... "
The Spitfire was to previous aircraft design as Auden was to Robert Graves – even though Auden missed the battle by skulking in New York – or as the Nightingale in Berkeley Square was to " We Don't Want to Lose You , But We Think You Ought to Go " .
In art , the Spitfire was Vorticism against the Romantics – sleek , new , frightening , unforgiving .
In the First World War , stringbag fighters – literally glued together – were constructed to fight .
The Spitfire was built to win .
And as the years now stretch out our grim and bloody historical perspective , from Great War to Second World War , to the vile , hypocritical conflicts we fight today in the Muslim world , the Battle of Britain itself has become a kind of antidote to both past and future .
The blood sacrifice of 1916 on the Somme – 20,000 British dead in just one day – was assuaged by the sacrifice of the " Few " in 1940 .
The flower of British manhood in both cases , to be sure – with a strong leavening of public schools in the Spitfires and Hurricanes – but the Battle of Britain proved that you did n't have to destroy all of a nation 's youth to fight the good fight .
In restrospect , the air battles of 1940 were also an antidote to the memory of the RAF 's later savagery over Germany , the fire - storming of tens of thousands of civilians across the Reich .
If Bomber Command was brutality – even Churchill spoke about terror crimes – then Fighter Command in 1940 represented chivalry .
Hillary wrote a short and brilliant book about the battle – and about himself – called The Last Enemy .
It remains one of the few great literary works of the Second World War , its title culled from the First Book of Corinthians xv 26 – " The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death " – and its sorrow enshrined in the crash on 7 January 1943 , in which Hillary himself met his last enemy .
Returning from his first air battle in 1940 , in which he had shot down a Messerschmitt and killed its pilot , Hillary examined his own conscience .
On an old gramophone record , I have a BBC recording of this young man 's voice , clipped , impatient , self - justificatory :
" My first emotion was one of satisfaction , satisfaction at a job adequately done , at the final logical conclusion of months of specialised training .
And then I had a feeling of the essential rightness of it all .
He was dead and I was alive ; it could so easily have been the other way round ; and that would somehow have been right too .
I realised in that moment just how lucky a fighter pilot is .
He has none of the personalised emotions of the soldier , handed a rifle and bayonet and told to charge .
He does not have to share the dangerous emotions of the bomber pilot who night after night must experience that childhood longing for smashing things .
The fighter pilot 's emotions are those of the duellist – cool , precise , impersonal .
He is privileged to kill well .
For if one must either kill or be killed , as now one must , it should , I feel , be done with dignity ... "
Hillary , though he could not have known it , captured that necessary antidote which his battle would provide for us .
The soldier with his bayonet came from the Somme , the " dangerous emotions " of the bomber pilot from the future Battle of Germany .
Yet it is easy to forget that RAF Fighter Command did not save British cities from destruction , even if their crucifixion came nowhere near the incendiary slaughter that Bomber Command was later to visit upon Germany .
Indeed , it was Hitler 's decision in September 1940 to attack London – transferring his assault from Britain 's airfields and radar stations – which spared the RAF from defeat .
And of course , in the years that followed , especially in the 1960s and 1970s , the harsh facts of post - war research – read , for example , Peter Fleming 's awesome Invasion 1940 – suggested that the Battle of Britain was not as great a victory as we imagined .
The Germans had fewer pilots than we believed they had .
We had more aircraft than we thought .
And our " kill " claims were exaggerated .
The British claimed 2,698 aircraft shot down between 10 July and 31 October 1940 .
The real figure was 1,733 .
But in the same period , the Germans claimed 3,058 British aircraft .
In fact , they only shot down 915 .
The Brits only exaggerated by 55 per cent – the Germans by 234 per cent .
There 's Nazism for you !
Yet the years have also served to soften the cruelty and pain of the battle , to smother the terrible suffering of pilots and their families with the balm and bandages of our clichés .
A stream of consciousness has wrapped itself around the reality of 1940 .
Never - before - in - the - field - of - human - conflict - Spitfires - Hurricanes - Dowding - Goering - Biggin - Hill - Tangmere - the - Few - Churchill - Hitler - Bandits - at - five-o'clock-Messerschmitts - Dorniers - Heinkels - the - Big - Wing - Bader - Deare - Tuck - Leigh - Malory - Galland - Molders - Wieck - Blood - Sweat - Tears .
Very often tears .
And most of it was fought above hop fields and Anglo - Saxon churches , the pale blue Kentish summer skies engraved with circular vapour trails , August forever turning into a golden September .
On the other side of the Channel , William Shirer – a CBS correspondent from still - neutral America whose memoir The Nightmare Years is in many ways more powerful than his timeless The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich – was taken by German military guides to a hotel in occupied Calais .
From there , on 15 August , he saw " a
wave of German bombers roaring overhead towards the cliffs of Dover " with a swarm of Me 109 fighters above them .
That day , the Luftwaffe flew 1,950 sorties , the RAF nearly a thousand on an air front of 500 miles .
Then Shirer saw the German bombers coming back , some of them streaming smoke .
But the German " minders " did not allow Shirer to talk to the returning pilots – he specifically asked for Galland – with good reason .
The ghastly , flesh - burned creatures in those wounded planes were to be kept from the world .
So come now to a small Luftwaffe airbase near the forest of Crécy in occupied France where German pilot Gunther Bloemertz is waiting for a comrade to return from a raid over England in 1940 .
His almost forgotten record of the air war , Heaven Next Stop – regarded as a conflation of not only his own memories but those of his Luftwaffe colleagues – includes the terrifying moment when a Luftwaffe friend crashes on landing , his Me 109 toppling upside - down and bursting into flames :
" Our trapped comrade 's horrible screaming came through to us , muffled by the closed cockpit - hood and drowned by the crackling of the flames .
A human being burning alive before our eyes !
At intervals we could make out the condemned man writhing and jerking convulsively – hammering on the unyielding walls of his glass cage , every moment more and more enveloped by the roaring flames ...
His despairing cry made us all realise simultaneously the only thing which could be done to ease our comrade 's torment ...
Another pilot , identified only as Ulrich , walked into the flames and shot the burning man in the head .
Earlier , Bloemertz himself had shot down an RAF fighter , at the same time willing his British victim to jump from his burning aircraft .
" I shout aloud in despair .
Instead I see him bathed in the red of his own blood ; his body strains half over the side to hang there , mutilated .
Then the waves close over him ... "
Hillary was to suffer almost the same fate when his own burning plane dived towards the Channel :
" I was falling .
Falling slowly through a dark pit .
I was dead .
I saw it with my mind , my mind that was redness in front of my eye , the dull scream in the ear , the grinning of the mouth , the skin crawling on the skull .
It was death and resurrection .
Terror , moving with me , touched my cheek with hers and I felt the flesh wince ...
I was hot now , hot , again , again one with my body , on fire and screaming soundlessly . "
My own father , First World War veteran Bill Fisk – in 1940 head of the local Home Guard in Maidstone – was to recall the shriek of uncontrolled Merlin engines as a fiery ball fell out of the sky over the centre of the town .
He lay on the cobbles behind the Star Hotel as the Spitfire blew up a few hundred metres away , his own body bouncing on the road as the blast waves came down the High Street .
On the golf course , he found the three - feet - deep perfect imprint of a German pilot who had jumped from his burning plane – without a parachute .
Bill 's future wife Peggy , on the outskirts of Maidstone , saw a pyre of black smoke and cycled off with her sister Bibby to see the burning wreckage of another Messerschmitt .
" But when we got there , " she told me years later , " we found it was one of ours on fire . "
When Harry Saltzman produced his 1969 epic Battle of Britain – using more than a hundred real British and German fighters and bombers , for these were pre-digital days – he employed a real and terribly disfigured ex-fighter pilot to explain to a burned pilot 's distraught wife ( Susannah York ) that plastic surgeons could do " wonderful things " these days .
The man 's gaunt , twisted face added a bleak sidebar to the battle which Kenneth More , Robert Shaw and Laurence Olivier ( as Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding ) could never match .
For those who were burned or smashed to death , wives and lovers re-lived the nightmare last moments or , broken in spirit , faithfully awaited the return of husbands who could never come back .
In his often distressing Battle of Britain novel Piece of Cake , Derek Robinson describes the heartbreak of a fighter pilot 's wife who turns up each day at the airfield perimeter to wait for her dead husband 's Spitfire , a fearful presence which haunts his still - living fellow pilots :
" Cattermole was squinting and blinking into the hazy distance where a tiny black figure shimmered beside a little black car .
He began walking ...
Cattermole stopped when he was 10 feet away .
The sweat trickling into his eyes made him blink but his face was untouched by expression .
' We want you to go , ' he said ... ' Stupid bitch .
I do n't give a damn about you ...
You 're a jinx , a menace .
Fitz is dead , he 's not coming back ... ' "
RAF Fighter Command could also show a ruthlessness which Bomber Command would later perfect a thousandfold .
If the nobility of warfare was upheld in the Battle of Britain , the Geneva Conventions were not .
The Luftwaffe complained bitterly that the RAF attacked German hospital sea-planes .
Their claim was correct .
Churchill 's War Cabinet formally announced that " it has come to the notice of His Majesty 's Government ... that enemy aircraft bearing civil markings and marked with the Red Cross have recently flown over British ships at sea ...
His Majesty 's Government are unable , however , to grant immunity to such aircraft flying over areas in which operations are in progress on land or at sea ... "
Dowding was blunter : " They were engaged in rescuing combatants and taking them back to fight again , and they were also in a position ... to make valuable reconnaissance reports ... "
In the television series The World at War , Squadron Leader Max Aitken , son of Lord Beaverbrook , revealed that he had no compunction at shooting down German Red Cross planes .
And Churchill wrote : " We did not recognise this means of rescuing enemy pilots in order that they might come and bomb our civilian population again . "
But the Germans pointed out that whenever German Red Cross aircraft rescued British pilots , they were , oddly , never shot down .
Of course , the Battle of Britain did produce honour , even humour , amid the carnage .
RAF pilots sometimes circled ditched German bombers in the Channel in an effort to save their crews ' lives .
One British pilot found a German 's parachute tangled on his starboard wing and throttled back to allow his German enemy to float free and alive to earth .
Hillary remembered shouting German invective into his radio while climbing to 25,000 feet .
" To my delight I heard one of them answer : ' You feelthy Englishmen , we will teach you how to speak to a German . '
I am aware that this sounds a tall story , but several others in the Squadron were listening out and heard the whole thing . "
Several true stories were astronomically funny .
Fighter pilot Peter Townsend – later to be Princess Margaret 's lover – returned from a fierce battle over the Channel to find a German Heinkel 111 bomber , wheels up , propellers bent , crash - landed on the runway of his RAF airfield .
The pilot thought he had ditched in the sea and " before the astonished eye of the airfield control officer ... a door was opened , a dinghy was thrown out and two of the crew – bootless for easy swimming – dived out on to dry land .
Rumour even had it that they dived into their dingy and began rowing . "
Inevitably , the pilots were fascinated by their enemies .
When the legless Douglas Bader was shot down over France – by one of his own Spitfires , although he would never admit it – Adolf Galland greeted him warmly at his Luftwaffe airbase at St Omer , enquiring how he had managed to bale out with no legs .
Bader did n't remember .
" One never does , " Galland replied before warmly inviting his captive to climb aboard a fully armed Me 109 .
According to Bader 's biographer , " mad thoughts " of starting the engine and throttling away to freedom passed through his mind .
But a snapshot sent to Bader after the war shows a junior Luftwaffe officer covering him with a machine pistol .
As he stepped out of the 109 , " Bader looked across country and saw the sea .
Far beyond he thought he could glimpse the White Cliffs of Dover and for a moment felt quite sick . "
A few months later , Wing Commander Robert Tuck crash - landed near Boulogne and was taken on the same pilgrimage to Galland .
" We have met before , Herr Oberstleutnant Tuck , " Galland said , shaking hands .
" Last time I very nearly killed you , but you saw me coming ... "
The two men laughed when they realised that each had shot down the other 's number two pilot .
Galland recalled Bader 's visit to his airbase at St Omer – " Wonderful fellow ! " – before telling an orderly to place a bottle of White Label in front of Tuck , the last of the stock abandoned by the British at Dunkirk .
But the Battle of Britain was not a schoolboy game , a jape , a friendly match .
It was harsh and cruel and thus – if it was an antidote to what had gone before and to what was yet to come – reflected the murderous war in which it occurred .
The battle also remains a danger to us in a historical sense ; our obsession with the RAF 's victory tends to diminish infinitely more terrible and important turning points in a conflict that consumed upwards of 60 million lives .
In terms of men and machines , it was a puny sideshow to Pearl Harbour , Alamein , Stalingrad , D - Day , the Battle for Germany , Dresden , Hamburg , Iwo Jima , Hiroshima , Nagasaki ...
The Soviets , not the RAF , broke the back of Hitler 's legions .
And the pilots who fought were not , as hindsight might suggest to us , struggling to avenge Hitler 's greatest crimes .
The industrial slaughter of the Jewish Holocaust had not yet begun .
The invasion of the Soviet Union was a year away .
The nightly Blitz on London commenced on 7 September 1940 , when the RAF were on the edge of victory .
It was , perhaps , something more visceral that drove those pilots into the sky ; the sheer bloody insult that the Luftwaffe committed by flying over the British coast from France .
" The controller reports another large formation of Huns building up over Gris Nez and starting to come across but he does n't go into how many , " Spitfire pilot Geoffrey Wellum recorded in his diary .
" Perhaps he thinks we 've enough on our plate already .
Where do all these bloody Germans come from ?
There seems to be no end to them ... "
When a false report of the German invasion of England circulated in one fighter pilot 's mess , the legless Bader was the first to cheer up his comrades .
Rubbing his hands with delight , he announced that now they would be able to kill even more Germans .
Nor would RAF Fighter Command keep its chivalry intact in the years to come .
After the Normandy landings in June 1944 , some of those same pilots helped to massacre the encircled German army trapped in the " Falaise Pocket " ; thousands of French civilians died in the Pocket and in the still occupied towns between Normandy and Paris .
While Bomber Command tore Germany 's cities to pieces , fighter pilots – American and British , flying Spitfires as well as Typhoons and Mustangs – ranged the countryside to strafe German refugees , trains and even farm carts and horses , just as the Luftwaffe had done in France in 1940 .
Inevitably , they also attacked columns of British and American PoWs .
At the time , the Battle of Britain did not seem as coherent as it does today .
" From time to time we openly recognised the meaningless of this existence , " Luftwaffe pilot Bloemertz was to write of 1940 .
" More often we simply sensed it ...
Fate plunged onwards down its ordained path , and however we might try to protect ourselves it struck us exactly as it pleased .
I could n't block its way ; and you – you who had wanted to kill me early in the morning – you could n't do so either .
Tommy , if you still live , are you perhaps drinking at this moment in some bar in the West End ? "
And yet .
There is always an " and yet " with this battle .
By June of 1940 , Britain was the sole country still in arms against the Nazis .
If the RAF had broken , giving the Luftwaffe air superiority , the German invasion of the UK would have followed .
If Britain failed , Churchill warned in June 1940 , " the whole world , including the United States and all that we have known and cared for , will sink into the abyss of a new dark age , made more sinister and perhaps more protracted , by the lights of perverted science " .
And despite the historical manipulation of both the battle and Churchill by those miserable politicians who want to maintain our dishonest , illegal wars abroad today , his words , like the Spitfire , retain their integrity .
A lot has been happening on the immigration front in Canada .
In the meantime , while Canada has reduced the number of occupations from the list for Federal Skilled Workers Program , the Citizenship and Immigration Canada has also been talking about welcoming more economic immigrants to the country in the year 2010 .
In fact , the Canadian immigration department is looking to streamline the immigration plans for this year in order to bring more economic immigrants .
The country ’s authorities are in favor of gaining more and more economic immigrants in order to make sure that the Canadian employers have the appropriate number of skills they require , while the country works towards recuperating from the recession .
People are referred to as Economic Immigrants who apply under the categories of :
Skilled Workers ;
Business Immigrants ;
Provincial Nominees ;
Canada Bonds Investors Permanent Residence visa ; and
Caregivers .
The Canadian immigration department every year designs a plan as to how many immigrants the country intends to gain under the immigration programs for economic workers , as well as humanitarian and family migrants .
The usual cap for these immigrants ranges from 240,000 to 265,000 , and the country has a track record of attaining the mid range of the expected immigrants each year .
But , for 2010 , immigration department expects to achieve the upper end of the range , with its new plan to welcome more economic immigrants .
The Citizenship and Immigration Canada hopes to increase the number of federal skilled workers and the provincial nominees in order to attain the goal , without hurting the original number of immigrants entering Canada under the family and humanitarian categories .
The countries authorities think that economic immigrants are the need of the time , which is likely to grow in years to come !

Did you know about :: keywords ?
In this week 's „ did you know “ will we have a short look at : keywords and what nice little features are hiding in there …
Keywords
We all know and love : keywords .
They are a often used as keys in maps and their ability to be called like a function on maps makes for some very concise code .
user= > ( map :a [ { :a 1 } { :a 2 } { :a 3 } ] ) ( 1 2 3 )
However what happens if two libraries modify the same map ?
On the same key ?
Then we are in trouble , because one overwrites the other .
To remedy this issue , Clojure provides ( similar to Symbols ) namespace - qualified keywords .
Simply add a double - colon in front and the keyword will be qualified with the current namespace .
user= > :: foo :user/foo
Using the fully - qualified form , we can create keywords with an arbitrary namespace .
user= > :my.company.division.project.module-a/keyword :my.company.division.project.module-a/keyword
So we can communicate with a library using its own qualified keywords .
The library can then internally use the short :: keyword form .
But now imagine you have to use the above namespace several times !
Ieck !
However , we can relax !
Clojure would n't be Clojure if this was the only way to handle this situation .
A little known fact is , that the double - colon form also allows for aliases !
So all we have to do is set up a suitable alias for the namespace and we can save some serious typing .
( ns my.company.division.project.module-b ( : require [ my.company.division.project.module-a : as module - a ] ) )
And later on in the code we can simply use :
( get some - map ::module-a/keyword )
Nice and short .
A NEW Zealand man remained in stable condition today after his dog jumped on a loaded rifle and accidentally shot him in the backside .
The Northern Advocate said the 40 - year - old man from Te Kopuru , located in far - northern New Zealand , was injured while on a pig- shooting trip with three other men on Saturday .
The man was sitting in the back seat of a 4WD vehicle when the dog jumped on the loaded .22 rifle , which was also on the back seat .
The gun fired and a bullet lodged in the man 's buttocks .
He was treated at the scene before being flown to Whangarei Hospital by helicopter where he had surgery to remove the bullet .
The men told police they thought the gun was unloaded , prompting authorities to warn of the need to be careful transporting firearms .

… the proprietors of this Toronto bar will leave you pondering some different questions instead .
Meanwhile , as Will observed , a Shell station in Austin apparently abides by a similar “ honesty is the best ” policy .
… as does a shopping center in Tyler , Texas , where Erin spotted this explanation ( on a 100 - degree July day ) .
Similar venting was on display at a store in Ironton , Ohio .
( “ For the record , I can not validate whether or not the ‘ oner ’ was an in fact an asshole , ” says submitter Meagan . )
And smetimes , of course , brutal honesty is n’t enough .
So really , why bother with an explanation at all ?

Canada
Day tends to put one in a reflective mood , especially soccer fans in this country who have been deprived the pleasure of seeing Canada compete at the World Cup in South Africa .
Some might be contemplating the future of the national team and whether or not it will qualify for the 2014 tournament in Brazil .
But more than likely the majority of fans will be looking back in time — to 1986 , to be specific .
It 's hard to believe that 24 years have passed since the Canadian national team qualified for the World Cup for the first — and to this day the only — time in its history .
Mexico was where Canada rubbed shoulders with soccer 's elite , but before heading south there was the small matter of qualifying for the tournament , which was achieved with a 2 - 1 win over Honduras on Sept. 14 , 1985 in St. John's .
" The was the greatest day of my soccer career , " Tony Waiters , who served as coach of Canada 's national team from 1981 - 86 , told CBCSports.ca .
" We knew going against the Central Americans that we would n’t out - skill them , so we had to play to our strengths and make it very difficult for the opposition . "
Bobby Lenarduzzi , a defender on the team , can recall the dying moments of the game , which " seemed to pass so slowly " that he thought the match would never end .
" The ball was in their half and I knew time was winding down , so I was starting to allow myself the excitement of waiting for the final whistle , " Lenarduzzi said .
" And when it went it was a little surreal — we finally managed to do it and qualify . "
Qualifying was the first step down the pathway to Mexico .
The second step was an intense training camp held in Colorado .
Waiters put his players through a gruelling series of practice sessions , held at altitude to acclimatize them to the conditions in Mexico .
Waiters emphasized hard work and felt that , if nothing else , his squad of former NASL stars and players who plied their trade in the Major Indoor Soccer League would not be beaten because they were unfit .
" We certainly were n’t the best team in the tournament by a long way , in terms of skill .
But I ’d say we were the fittest team , " said Waiters , a former goalkeeper who earned five caps for the English national team during his playing career .
" We had great commitment from the players .
Bruce Wilson was the captain and he was a fitness fanatic .
Bobby Lenarduzzi was a great trainer .
Paul James was the best of all in terms of endurance and Randy Ragan had great commitment . "
At the time , Waiters ' conservative tactical approach to the game did n’t exactly go over well with the players .
" There were afew of us who would have preferred to try to be a little willing to play out of the back , " Lenarduzzi admitted .
" But I think looking back at it now , Tony did exactly the right thing and what we needed to do .
He had us minimize the risk and made sure we were well - organized defensively so that we knew what we needed to do when the other team had the ball .
" When we had possession it was about getting the ball to the front man and trying to get the defence turned .
We did n’t have the kind of players who could play the ball around .
We played the percentages and it was the right way to go . "
Waiters preached a conservative playing style because he did n’t want a repeat from four years earlier , when fellow CONCACAF side El Salvador suffered one of the heaviest defeats in World Cup history .
" My biggest concern going to the World Cup was that we were going to be blown out of the water .
El Salvador went to Spain in 1982 and lost 10 - 1 to Hungary , so I wanted to avoid that . "
Star - struck
First up for Canada in Mexico was a match against France , then the reigning European champions .
It was a French side that was touted among the tournament favourites , and boasted world - class players the calibre of Michel Platini , Jean Tigana and Alain Giresse .
Waiters was n't star - struck , though , and played up his team ’s chances before the game .
" I downplayed the opposition .
I got a video of France and showed it to the players without the TV commentary , and pointed out their mistakes and errors .
I was trying to make the point that we ’re all human beings and that they could be beaten , " Waiters said .
Waiters was n't in awe of the French , but the same could n’t be said for his players .
" I 'll never forget standing in the tunnel [ of the stadium ] prior to the game against France , " Lenarduzzi recalled .
" To look across the line to see Platini , Tigana , Giresse — they were all players that I had watched play , and here we were going out to play them , and it was n't a friendly .
It was a game that had something at stake . "
Few gave the boys in red and white much of a chance against Les Bleus , including the local fans .
" Prior to the game Mexican fans held up their fingers to indicate what the score would be , " Lenarduzzi remembered .
" They needed both hands for France .
They put up eight fingers , and we did n't have any , so everyone assumed we were going to get hammered .
" The fact that we did n't … it allowed us to walk away with our heads held high . "
Indeed , in the searing mid-afternoon Mexican heat , the Canadians came out attacking against the heavily favoured French , and more than once pinned Les Bleus back deep in their own end .
Canada came within a breath of scoring on several occasions before France took control of the game and eventually scored in the 78th minute .
It was a brave effort by the Canadians as the French escaped with a narrow 1 - 0 victory thanks to a goal by Jean - Pierre Papin .
" We thought we had them on the rack just before they scored .
Branko Segota had a few shots off and I was making some overlapping runs , " said Lenarduzzi .
" Unfortunately , I factored on France ’s goal .
I was on the goal side of the guy who knocked the ball back across into the middle for Peppin to head in .
I assumed [ goalkeeper ]
Paul Dolan was going to get it .
He came for the cross and I saw him come out , and then I just stopped .
But if I have kept going and anticipated him missing it , I would have just headed the ball out for a corner .
" Paul kept us in the game early on and throughout the game .
He was fantastic so you could n’t fault him at that point .
One that got away
Confidence was high amongst the Canadian players after the France game , but the team suffered a major letdown in its next encounter , a 2 - 0 loss to Hungary .
" That was a classic case of everyone was wound up for France because everyone thought we were going get stuffed .
And we watched Hungary get stuffed by Russia 6 - 0 in their first match and they looked terrible , " Lenarduzzi said .
" And then all of a sudden , we went into the game thinking we were the favourites instead of doing what we did in the first game , which was putting our head down , doing the work and playing the percentages .
They scored an early goal and we had our chances but that ’s the one I think we let get away . "
Canada 's World Cup campaign ended with a 2 - 0 loss to the Soviet Union , as it bowed out of the tournament without scoring a single goal .
Not that the Canadians did n’t have chances — Lenarduzzi squandered a glorious opportunity that he should have buried from close range late in the match against the Soviets .
" I was up for a corner kick and the ball went over my head .
I turned around and their defender and one our guys both headed it at the same time , " remembered the former defender .
" It bounced down right to my feet and I turned and , thinking I had to get the shot off quick , I ended up doing it too quickly and catching the ground in front of the ball and I never got anything on it . "
The fact that Canada did n’t score at the tournament ranks as a big disappointment , but the 1986 team can take pride in the fact their performance in Mexico inspired an entire generation of Canadians to take up the sport .
Foremost among them was Jason de Vos , a native of London , Ont. , who played professionally in England and Scotland , and who served as captain of the Canadian national team , earning 49 caps between 1997 and 2001 .
" Watching the Canadian players , most ofwhom I had never heard of , do battle against the Soviet Union , Hungary and the legendary French team was an experience that shaped my career , " said de Vos , who retired in 2007 to become a soccer commentator for CBC Sports .
" It motivated me to put in long hours of travelling and training , to forego the usual teenage life in favour of the more single - minded lifestyle of an athlete . "
That 's the greatest legacy of Canada ’s 1986 team , one that makes Lenarduzzi extremely proud and feel as though the hard work of he and his teammates was n't in vain .
" It ’s nice tohear that , because you never knew what kind of impact you were having , " said Lenarduzzi .
" To hear all those years later that we inspired someone like Jason , who went on to have a great career , that 's gratifying . "
Philip Shenon , a former New York Times reporter now writing for Tina Brown ’s The Daily Beast , alleged late Thursday that the Pentagon is “ desperately ” searching for the founder of the whistleblower website Wikileaks , out of concern he is about to publish classified US State Department cables .
Curiously , the piece cites an American diplomat as saying their chief concern is the leak of communications “ prepared by diplomats and State Department officials throughout the Middle East , regarding the workings of Arab governments and their leaders . ”

The concern over US communications about Arab governments seems slightly surprising in lieu of the fact the cables also “ contained information related to American diplomatic and intelligence efforts in the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq , ” which would , in theory , be of greater concern to Pentagon bosses running US war efforts .
Authorities are said to be seeking Wikilieaks founder Julian Assange , who allegedly came into possession of secret US cables after they were leaked by a 22 - year - old Army intelligence officer .
The Army specialist , Bradley Manning , was recently arrested and is being held in Kuwait .
Manning reportedly told authorities that he ’d leaked reams of State Department communiques .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Hillary Clinton and several thousand diplomats around the world are going to have a heart attack when they wake up one morning and find an entire repository of classified foreign policy is available , Ã¢â‚ ¬
Â the 22 - year - old Army specialist wrote of the cables , according to a story published at Wired.com .
Wikileaks responded to Manning ’s claim on Twitter , saying that reports that Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ we have been sent 260,000 classified U.S. embassy cables are , as far as we can tell , incorrect .
Ã¢â‚¬Â

Regardless ,
Shenon says that US government officials believe Assange is in possession of at least some secret State Department cables .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ It looks like theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re playing some sort of semantic games , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â one US official purportedly told Shenon .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ They may not have 260,000 cables , but theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve probably got enough cables to make trouble .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
It ’s unclear what US authorities could do to prevent the secretive Wikileaks founder from publishing classified US documents , since the website is based on servers in Sweden , a country that has traditionally looked favorably on whistleblower claims .

NEW YORK (
The Street
) -- There is new light on
Apple's
( AAPL ) - Get Report
white iPhone 4 delay mystery .
Apparently , the back light from the iPhone display screen is leaking out around the edges of the glass and seeping through the back of the white phone , according to a person familiar with the manufacturing process .
As Apple announced Friday , the company wo n't have new supplies of the white version of the iPhone until later this year because it is " more challenging to manufacture than we originally expected . "
Skeptics scoffed , calling it a
white lie
invented to hide the fact that Apple was actually suspending production to make a significant internal fix to the ongoing antenna defect .
And while that may still be the case , the light seepage presents a very specific problem to the white phone since it is far more transparent than black .
The iPhone is made like a glass sandwich .
Apple uses
Corning's
( GLW ) - Get Report
Gorilla glass on the front and back of the phone and a metal band runs around the outside doubling as an antenna .
The bold new design has led to some unintended consequences for Apple as well as a great deal of heat .
With the rising level of competition from
Google
( GOOG ) - Get Report
Android - powered devices , every little hitch gets big attention .
While the antenna glitch does n't seem to have any impact on iPhone sales , Apple has been called on by
Consumer Reports
to make more than a Band - Aid fix to the problem .
This of course raises delicate questions about how Apple 's antenna fix wo n't turn into a
total iPhone recall
.
The antenna has been shown to lose signals when users cover the lower left corner .
Apple chief Steve Jobs argued unconvincingly that it's a problem common to many phones .
And now the new glass exterior has presented Apple with a difficult problem .
As the source described it , if it were a metal or plastic material , a simple coating would fill in the gaps and block the internal light .
Glass is an entirely different issue .
Light leakage has been a problem with at least one other big glass panel phones .

EVO has been reported to have some seepage around the seams of the phone .
Oddly , HTC has been advertising the availability of its white EVO phone as a clear response to Apple 's white iPhone snag .
The white EVO , it 's worth noting , has a plastic back -- not glass .
Apple shares are up 4 % over the past week as the antenna concerns have faded from the headlines .

We just received this from a source requesting anonymity .
It purports to be a more complete transcript of a portion of Army intelligence analyst Bradley Manning 's conversation with Adrian Lamo , the hacker who reported Manning to authorities .
Released in part by Wired News , and excerpted in part in a Washington Post story , the remainder was said to contain information of potential national security import .
However , we do n't see material of that nature in the portion of the transcript we were sent here , and neither can our lawyers .
Update :
We have removed a few words regarding specifics of personal issues not directly related to the whistleblowing / national security concerns at hand .
Some of the sections which , as far as I can tell , have n't been published in " raw " form are in bold .
There 's a reference here to " confession " on Manning 's part .
Glenn Greenwald wrote in his Salon piece published yesterday :
Lamo told me ( though it does n't appear in the chat logs published by Wired ) that he told Manning early on that he was a journalist and thus could offer him confidentiality for everything they discussed under California 's shield law .
Lamo also said he told Manning that he was an ordained minister and could treat Manning 's talk as a confession , which would then compel Lamo under the law to keep their discussions confidential ( early on in their chats , Manning said : " I ca n't believe what I 'm confessing to you " ) .
In sum , Lamo explicitly led Manning to believe he could trust him and that their discussions would be confidential — perhaps legally required to be kept confidential — only to then report everything Manning said to the Government .
Transcript of the alleged log between Lamo and Manning
as sent to Wikileaks by Lamo .
The transcript is clearly only a small
portion and has presumably been edited .

water / food / clothing … that much is true , it includes that , but the other
85 % of it is for F - 16 fighters and munitions to aid in the Afghanistan

( CNN ) --
A popular sightseeing destination in Australia is boldly going where no tourist attraction has gone before -- by offering audio tours in the Klingon language .
Starting August 22 , Star Trek fans and those who are fluent in Klingon can visit the Jenolan Caves National Park and take a self - guided audio tour in Klingon through the " Nettle Cave . "
Currently offering audio tours in eight languages , Nettle Cave is part of one of the oldest cave systems in the world and has about 150,000 to 200,000 visitors annually , making it one of the most visited caves in Australia .
" We thought it would be neat to add another language , perhaps a fictional one , " says David Hay in charge of Cultural Initiatives at Jenolan Caves .
" We considered adding dwarfish or elfish , but then decided to add the second most spoken fictional language in the world after Esperanto , which is Klingon . "
How to speak Klingon
Hay says the language addition is n't completely out of the blue .
In the early 1990s , two writers of " Star Trek : The Next Generation " visited the caves and decided to name a transport vessel , the USS Jenolan , in the 1992 episode , " Relics . "
In July , two Klingon scholars -- Michael Roney Jr. and Tracy Canfield -- visited the caves from the United States and translated the current English audio tour of the caves into Klingon and recorded it in a Sydney studio .
Speaking in the Star Trek language , Roney exclaimed " lH , qar'a ' " ?
when he first visited the caves to express their beauty , according to a statement released by Jenolan Caves Reserve Trust .
The Klingon language was first created in 1979 for " Star Trek : The Motion Picture . " by James Doohan , who played Scotty in the sci - fi series .
Star Trek producers later consulted linguist Mark Okrand to develop the language for " Star Trek III : The Search for Spock " and subsequent other films .
The " Klingon Dictionary " created by Okrand went on to sell hundreds of thousands of copies over the years .
Currently , the Klingon Language Institute has an estimated 2,500 members in 50 countries .
" What I think is happening is that people are very interested in the language and we have created a portal into it , " says Hay .
" This is an opportunity for others to listen to Klingon and make it available for those who interested in it . "
Emotions -- particularly those provoked by negative events -- can cause distorted , inaccurate memories , but less often in children than in adults , according to a new Cornell study .
The findings , published online in the Journal of Experimental Child Psychology , contradict prevailing legal and psychological thinking and have implications for the criminal justice system , report Charles Brainerd and Valerie Reyna , professors of human development and co-authors of the 2005 book " The Science of False Memory . "
The researchers previously demonstrated that adults attach far more meaning to events than children do .
But leading memory theories embraced by the legal system claim that adults remember negative events better than children and have fewer false memories about them .
Brainerd and Reyna 's data show these theories are not accurate .
Experiments conducted at Cornell 's Memory and Neuroscience Laboratory show that experiences that stimulate negative emotions are very bad for the accuracy of children 's memories but even worse for adults .
When an experience has negative emotional qualities , true memory levels are lowest and false memory levels are highest .
The researchers tested children , ages seven and 11 , and young adults , ages 18 - 23 , by showing them lists of closely related emotional words -- pain , cut , ouch , cry , injury -- but in each list some related words -- such as " hurt " -- were missing .
When asked to recognize words from the list , respondents would mistakenly remember " hurt " as one of the words .
These mistakes allowed researchers to determine the level of emotion - induced false memory at each age .
" We found something different than what leading theories of emotional memory in adults say , " Brainerd said .
Those theories say that " When you 're involved in a very negative experience of some sort , like a crime , it focuses your mind , and you really pay attention to details .
" But our research showed that exactly the opposite is true .
By manipulating the emotional content of word lists , we found that materials that had negative emotional content in fact produced the highest levels of false memory .
And when you add arousal to the equation , memory was distorted more . "
Two experimental psychologists in China have contacted Brainerd to say that they have successfully replicated all of these results .
Brainerd and Reyna 's work " shows that these leading adult theories -- namely that your memory is preferentially accurate for negative emotional experiences -- are wrong , " Brainerd said .
" We 've been able to show that memory is most distorted in those situations . "
The implications of the findings are profound for the U.S. legal system .
Brainerd , who directs Cornell 's psychology and law program , said forensic evidence is gathered in fewer than 10 percent of U.S. felonies , and in less than half of those can the evidence actually be used to prosecute the case .
" In the great preponderance of legal cases , the only evidence that 's determinative is what people say happened , " Brainerd said .
" That 's it .
So the question of the conditions under which your memory of events is distorted is the most fundamental question about the reliability of evidence -- because it is most of the evidence .
" One of the main reasons why people look at memory and memory distortion is the legal connection , " Brainerd said .
" In the law , you 're dealing with events that are emotional .
So the question of whether or not the emotional content of experiences that you 're trying to remember screws up your memory is a really big question . "
The National Science Foundation supported this research .
As the last continent on Earth to be explored – and still the least developed – Antarctica may yet fall prey to the onward march of human civilization , but its lack of resources beyond ice make it an inhospitable place to build .
Architecture student Taylor Medlin of the University of California at Berkeley has developed a thesis project packed with ideas , and while some may be fantastically tongue - in - cheek , the project itself is a work of art , revealing tiny worlds cut into the ice .
Medlin ’s architectural proposals use various forms of ice as the primary building material rather than unsustainably transported materials from other continents , often reinforced with a variety of additives that could make the ice stronger and easier to work with .
A refrigerated display cabinet holds blocks of ice and wax carved into little rooms , illuminated from within , complete with human figurines that illustrate Medlin ’s ideas with stunning detail .
Reminiscent of the miniature models of Thomas Doyle , these rooms are visible through both fisheye lenses that peer inside and magnifying glasses fixed to the outside of the case .
Entranced viewers find complex compounds with steel frames , huts on stilts and simple ice caves with secret subterranean basements , all bathed in an eerie golden light .
Medlin , a John K. Branner fellow , has many more photos of the project and scans of his sketchbook available on Flickr .

Wars is an excellent game that has kept my interest ever since I downloaded it several weeks ago .
The controls in game are well done .
It 's dual stick , so you can fire and move in two different directions , which is very original for calculator .
I personally use the d-pad for movement and find the XT0N configuration confusing , but different things work for different people .
The buttons in High Score entry are a bit confusing , however , since you press Enter to save your score and then 2nd to get back into the main menu .
The graphics just look great .
Enemies move fluidly , bullets are clean , and those explosions are just plain awesome .
A fair word of warning : Do n't run this on a TI - Nspire in 84 Plus mode !
It will crash , and the only way to get your calc back is to reset the 84 Plus archive as well .
But it runs like a charm on the normal 84 Plus and the SE .
Verdict :
If you have a true 84 Plus or SE , download this game !
You will keep it forever .

The US International Trade Commission has decided to investigate HTC 's allegations that Apple is infringing its patents .
Its answer could see the iPhone banned from American stores .
The ITC 's investigation is in response to HTC 's complaint , filed on May 12th , that Apple is in breach of various patents owned by HTC .
The complaint calls for a ban on the import of infringing products - an interesting prospect , but one that 's pretty unlikely to actually happen .
At least the ITC will have Apple 's details handy : it 's already investigating possible infringements of touch - screen patents owned by Elan Microelectronics , which could equally well lead to an import ban .
Complaints to the ITC are very much in vogue at the moment , given the speed the decision can be made with and the immediate financial pain inflicted on the losing party .
Patent battles can and do rage for decades , mostly to the benefit of the legal minds involved .
Such spats can also lead to some sort of phased royalty payment which itself is generally subject to lengthy ( and expensive ) negotiations .
ITC investigations , in contrast , follow a strict timetable , and if the Commission upholds the compaint then infringing products cannot be legally imported into the US .
That puts huge pressure on the company to resolve the dispute .
When Qualcomm faced such a ban the company used every weapon at its disposal - the company even planned a personal appeal to then - president George Bush , but in the end had to grovel to Broadcom for a licence .
A ban on Apple products would certainly hurt the company , and quite possibly the US economy , but such a thing is still a very long way off .
The ITC has announced it will be investigating , and now has 45 days to announce a schedule for that investigation .
Even if Apple is found to be infringing HTC 's patents it will still get 60 days to appeal to the US Trade Representative .
Such an appeal depends on the public good , and lack of harm to the infringed party .
Qualcomm 's public profile and political clout was n't enough to help , but Apple has more of both and that certainly would n't do any harm . ®

TeenKasia gets fucked by a dildo while on the phone with her stepmother
The secretive Asian state has registered a block of IP addresses , but no one knows for sure how it will use them
Pyongyang , the capital of North Korea , in a file photo from 2002 .
More than 3 million of the country 's 24 million people live here .
The government keeps strict control on its subjects , requiring travel permits to move around the country .
Few have access to radio or TV broadcasts from outside the country and Internet access ...
View all images
In the past few months , a block of 1,024 Internet addresses , reserved for many years for North Korea but never touched , has been registered to a company with links to the government in Pyongyang .
The numeric IP addresses lie at the heart of communication on the Internet .
Every computer connected to the network needs its own address so that data can be sent and received by the correct servers and computers .
Without them , communication would fall apart .
It is unclear how the country 's secretive leadership plans to make use of the addresses .
It seems likely they will be assigned for military or government use , but experts say it is impossible to know for sure .
North Korea 's move toward the Internet comes as it finds itself increasingly isolated on the world stage .
The recent sinking of a South Korean warship has been blamed on the insular country .
As a result , there are calls for tougher sanctions that would isolate North Korea further .
" There is no place for the Internet in contemporary DPRK , " said Leonid A. Petrov , a lecturer in Korean studies at The University of Sydney , referring to the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea .
" If the people of North Korea were to have open access to the World Wide Web , they would start learning the truth that has been concealed from them for the last six decades . "
" Unless Kim Jong - Il or his successors feel suicidal , the Internet , like any other free media , will never be allowed in North Korea , " he said .
The North Korean addresses were recently put under the control of Star Joint Venture , a Pyongyang - based company that is partly controlled by Thailand 's Loxley Pacific .
The Thai company has experience working with North Korea on high - tech projects , having built North Korea 's first cellular telephone network , Sunnet , in 2002 .
Loxley acknowledged that it is working on a project with Pyongyang , but Sahayod Chiradejsakulwong , a manager at the company , would n't elaborate on plans for the addresses .
" This is a part of our business that we do no want to provide information about at the moment , " he said .
A connection to the Internet would represent a significant upgrade of the North 's place in cyberspace , but it 's starting from a very low base .
At present the country relies on servers in other countries to disseminate information .
The Web site of the Korea Central News Agency , the North 's official mouthpiece , runs on a server in Japan , while Uriminzokkiri , the closest thing the country has to an official Web site , runs from a server in China .
North Korean citizens have access to a nationwide intranet system called Kwangmyong , which was established around 2000 by the Pyongyang - based Korea Computer Center .
It connects universities , libraries , cybercafes and other institutions with Web sites and e-mail , but offers no links to the outside world .
Connections to the actual Internet are severely limited to the most elite members of society .
Estimates suggest no more than a few thousand North Koreans have access to the Internet , via a cross - border hook - up to China Netcom .
A second connection exists , via satellite to Germany , and is used by diplomats and companies .
For normal citizens of North Korea , the idea of an Internet hook - up is unimaginable , Petrov said .
Kim Jong
- Il , the de-facto leader of the country , appears all too aware of the destructive power that freedom of information would have to his regime .
While boasting of his own prowess online at an inter-Korean summit meeting in 2007 , he reportedly rejected an Internet connection to the Kaesong Industrial Park , the jointly run complex that sits just north of the border , and said that " many problems would arise if the Internet at the Kaesong Park is connected to other parts of North Korea . "
Kim himself has made no secret of the Internet access that he enjoys , and famously asked then - U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for her e-mail address during a meeting in 2000 .
The government 's total control over information extends even as far as requiring radios be fixed on domestic stations so foreign voices cannot be heard .
The policy shows no signs of changing , so any expansion of the Internet into North Korea would likely be used by the government , military or major corporations .

This would knock out one favorite object of citizen outrage  the costly pilgrimage the European Parliament must make to work in Strasbourg , France , for one week every month .
The price tag on that is estimated at more than $ 250 million a year , but it is written into the governing treaty , as a concession to the French .
Advocates say all the requirements would prove too much for any ideas from the average citizen .
“ What we fear , ” said Carsten Berg , who coordinates a group campaigning for the citizens ’ initiative , “ is that only the big , well - funded organizations will be able to use it . ”
Maros Sefcovic , a vice president of the European Commission responsible for the initiative , said the union was looking for the right balance in its regulations .
He does not want “ to overdo it with too strict “ procedures .
But he also believes it is important to stop abusive campaigns or ideas that are “ frivolous or devoid of seriousness . ”

Under the draft rules , organizers would have to begin the process by registering their petition .
Then , they would have to collect some number of signatures before they even got a reading from the commission about whether the subject fell within the scope of what was allowed .
Initially , the idea was that 300,000 names would be needed ; the latest draft has cut this by two - thirds .
In some countries , those signing would have to give their passport or national identity card numbers to help prevent fraud  another requirement that has prompted many objections because few citizens would be willing to give that information to someone collecting signatures on a street corner , for instance .
The final step is to amass the one million signatures .
At that point , the commission would be obligated to propose legislation or give a reason why not within four months .
Alain Lamassoure , a French member of the European Parliament who fought to include the initiative in the Lisbon Treaty , said many of the proposed restrictions were reasonable , though some fine - tuning might be needed .
Sean Faircloth of the Secular Coalition for America issues a reminder that faith - based discrimination ( with federal money ) is still allowed in our country .
President Obama could stop it in an instant , but he has n’t done it yet .
There ’s no reason to wait on this .
Obama knows this is an illegal use of tax - payer dollars and he ought to put a stop to it .
Sachverständige waren sich bei der ersten öffentlichen Anhörung der Enquete - Kommission " Internet und digitale Gesellschaft " des Bundestags einig , dass die Politik der Informationsverbreitung im Netz Raum lassen sollte .
" Machen Sie nichts " , appellierte der Münsteraner Informationsrechtler Thomas Hoeren in der vierstündigen Sitzung am heutigen Montag in Berlin an die Abgeordneten .
Die Selbstregulierung der Internetwirtschaft sei besser , zumal viele der bislang erlassenen Gesetze rund um die Online - Welt nicht nur inhaltlich , sondern auch formal " unbrauchbar " seien .
Das Internet passe nicht in die traditionell auf den Nationalstaat ausgerichtete Rechtsordnung der westlichen Welt , führte der Jurist weiter aus .
Das führe zu " wilden Urteilen " etwa des Landgerichts Hamburg , nach denen man das Internet " zumachen " müsse .
Der Staat müsse ein " Datenrecht " schaffen , das über den Datenschutz hinausgehe .
Die Erweiterung des Urheber- , Marken - oder Patentrechts müsse überdacht werden ; das Recht an immateriellen Gütern sie auch unter dem Aspekt der Verbreitung von Informationen zu sehen .
Der Berliner Informationswissenschaftler Rainer Kuhlen meinte ebenfalls , dass etwa durch die jüngsten Novellierungen des Urheberrechts " Verhinderungsstrukturen " aufgebaut worden seien .
Damit habe die Politik " katastrophale Weichen hin zur Kommerzialisierung von Wissen gestellt " .
Dabei zeige das Beispiel der skandinavischen Länder , dass ein freizügiger Umgang mit Informationen sich auch in der Volkswirtschaft positiv bemerkbar mache .
Marie - Thérèse Huppertz , Politikbeauftragte bei SAP plädierte für " mehr Freiräume " statt Regulierung .
" Keine neuen Gesetze " , lautete auch die Devise des Paderborner Medienwissenschaftlers Jörg Müller - Lietzkow .
Der bestehende Rechtsrahmen müsse aber besser durchgesetzt werden vor allem gegen jene , " die Missbrauch betreiben " .
Generell attestierte der Forscher dem Netz eine " destabilisierende Gesellschaftswirkung " , der aber etwa mit einer " vernünftigen Familienpolitik " und der Einführung eines Kurses Medienfachkunde in den Unterricht entgegengesteuert werden könne .
Der Bremer Psychologe Peter Kruse forderte mehr Einfühlungsvermögen der Politik in die " Dynamik des Internets " und die sich darin abbildenden " Resonanzmuster " der Gesellschaft .
" Wir brauchen ein Recht an informationeller Grundversorgung , das das Internet voll mit einschließt " , sagte der Berliner Informatikprofessor Wolfgang Coy und plädierte dabei für eine stärkere Rolle des Staates .
So müsse ein Universaldienst geschaffen werden , der höhere Breitbandraten als 1 Mbit /s definiere , was sich " nicht nur über die privatisierten Telecoms " lösen lasse .
Für unerlässlich für die Netzgesellschaft erachtete er ferner das Recht auf sichere und – soweit angemessen – auch anonyme Kommunikation .
Über das Internetprotokoll IPv6 sei eventuell eine " Grundverschlüsselung " der Datenübertragung zu erreichen .
Forderungen nach mehr Datenschutz stießen im Unternehmerlager auf Widerstand .
Der Mittelständler
Peter Bisa betonte , dass das deutsches Datenschutzniveau bereits " weltweit Spitze " sei .
Man könne aber eventuell einen " Exportschlager " daraus machen , von dem soziale Netzwerke oder Cloud Computing besonders profitieren könnten .
XING - Gründer Lars Hinrichs fürchtete dagegen , dass auch in diesen Bereichen die deutsche , Innovationen behindernde Datenschutzausgestaltung zum " Rohrkrepierer " werden dürfte .
Gemeinsam waren die beiden Firmenvertreter auch der Meinung , dass Regelungen wie das Zugangserschwerungsgesetz das Vertrauen in die Netzpolitik erschüttert hätten .

Sweden weighs benefits of ditching cash By Tim Mansel
Stockholm Published duration 17 July 2010
image caption Could all this become a thing of the past ?
In many countries , debit and credit cards are steadily taking the place of cash in everyday transactions .
In Sweden , the process has been given new momentum by a campaign to cut crime .
Marie Jarvas , a bank worker in central Stockholm , has experienced two robberies .
" The first one was early in the morning and two men broke through the glass door with an axe .
" What they wanted was the box with the cash for the ATMs , " she recalls .
" I was really scared and I ran into a back room and hid behind a cupboard .
I was sure they were going to come and shoot me .
I was really scared for my life . "
Two years later it happened again .
This time , a man brandishing a gun jumped in the bank 's front office through a window that had been smashed by car .
Ms Jarvas 's union is now leading Sweden 's drive to do away with cash , out of concern for the safety of the 30,000 bank workers among its members .
" If we can reduce the amount of cash in the banks and in society in general , robberies will also be reduced , " says Marie Look , of the bank workers ' trade union .
" If in the long term we abandon cash completely , there will be no robberies , because there 's no point in robbing a bank if there 's no cash there to steal . "
The campaign has some high - profile supporters , including former Abba band member Bjorn Ulvaeus .
" There are no direct practical reasons , as far as I can see , to have coins and banknotes , " he wrote in a recent blog post .
image caption Buses have already gone cash - free
" There are obvious advantages in getting rid of them .
Sweden should be able to be the first country in the world to do this . "
He said that it was " patronising " to assume that the elderly , for example , would have problems paying for goods or services over the internet or with a card .
" There are , of course , those who need help , but if as a result they run less of a risk of being robbed , then perhaps it would be worth the inconvenience , " he wrote .
Buses in Stockholm have already gone cash - free .
Strips of tickets or sim - based bus cards can be bought in advance , or payments can be made via mobile phones .
After a series of attacks against bus drivers , Sweden 's health and safety authority stepped in and told the bus companies they had to find a way of protecting the cash more securely .
The result was that buses stopped accepting notes or coins .
" All indications are that there have been a lot fewer problems on the buses .
The drivers are very happy with the situation , " says Bernt Nilsson of the Swedish Work Environment Authority .
The Swedish central bank takes no position in this debate .
But in a speech earlier this year , the bank 's deputy governor Lars Nyberg highlighted the higher cost to society of cash transactions , compared with those made with credit or debit cards .
Citing a survey from 2002 he said : " It is much more likely that the costs of using cash have increased rather than decreased .
For example , the costs for increasing the security of transportation and ATMs have been substantial . "

The buskers have a stay of execution
Over the past 10 years , the value of card payments made in Sweden has increased fivefold , while the number of card payments has increased by a factor of eight .
" The technology exists for a cashless society to work , " says Andrew Scott , Professor of Economics at the London Business School .
Cash survives , he says , despite the nuisance of bulging pockets and looking for ATMs that work , partly because it preserves privacy .
" Its key advantage , in an electronic age , is that it is anonymous and tells you nothing about where it 's been , " he says .
Par Strom , of the New Welfare Foundation in Stockholm , says Sweden 's move towards a cashless society is worrying for precisely this reason .
" If it 's impossible to pay cash when you buy stuff , it 's also impossible not to leave electronic footprints behind you , and the electronic footprints from what you buy put together can tell the entire story about your life .
This can be very sensitive information , " he says .
" Most people do n't want this total surveillance society . "
Bernt Nilsson says it will be several years , at least , before Sweden can finally rid itself of cash .
So the buskers at Stockholm 's tourist spots will continue to entertain passers - by with their tunes on the accordion or pan pipes for the foreseeable future .
Britain's fight against terrorism has been a disaster , because its " flawed , neo - conservative " direction alienated Muslims and increased the chances of terrorist attacks , a former leading counter - terrorism officer has told the Guardian .
Speaking to mark today 's fifth anniversary of the 7 July attacks in London , Dr Robert Lambert said the atrocity had led the Labour government to launch not just the publicly declared battle against al - Qaida , but a much wider counter - subversive campaign that targeted non-violent Muslims and branded them as supporters of violence .
Lambert , now an academic , served for 30 years as an officer in Scotland Yard 's special branch , dealing with the threat from Irish Republican terrorism through to the menace from al - Qaida .
He was head of a counter - terrorism squad , the Muslim contact unit ( MCU ) , which gained intelligence on violent extremists , and won praise from Muslims , even those who have criticised police .
Lambert said the Labour government adopted a " flawed , neo -con analysis to react to 7 July .
The view was that this is such an evil ideology , we are entitled to derogate from human rights considerations even further . "
The effect of this , said Lambert , was to cast the net too wide : " The [ British ] analysis was a continuation of the [ US ] analysis after 9/11 , which drove the war on terror , to say al - Qaida is a tip of a dangerous Islamist iceberg ... we went to war not against terrorism , but against ideas , the belief that al - Qaida was a violent end of a subversive movement . "
Lambert said this approach alienated British Muslims , as those who expressed views such as opposition to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , also held by non-Muslims , feared that holding such beliefs made them suspects .
" The best way of tackling al - Qaida is to reassure the communities where it seeks support and recruits , is to show those communities that their grievances can be expressed legitimately , " Lambert said .
His comments come as Andy Hayman , the former assistant commissioner who led the 7/7 investigation , warns in the Times that Britain remains " under severe risk " from terror attacks .
" There are now probably more radicalised Muslims , their attack plans are more adventurous and the UK still remains under severe risk , " Hayman said .
Five years ago today , four Britons inspired , and some trained , by al - Qaida exploded homemade bombs on three London Underground trains and a bus .
They killed themselves , murdered 52 people and injured 750 more .
Lambert said the government was desperate to deny that British foreign policy drove sections of the Muslim community to support or sympathise with al - Qaida .
He continued : " What the bombers did , and what al - Qaida does successfully , is to exploit widely held grievances .
That should not be difficult to grasp .
The last government spent most of the last five years denying that , looking for other narratives to explain what had happened . "
" All this is happening under the shadow of military action … with terrorist groups planning to legitimise their attacks in the UK on the basis of what is happening in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
Lambert said the government 's decision to go down the wrong path took the police with them .
Senior officers could have done more to tell the government their policies were making the task harder by alienating Muslims .
" We could see the Bush - Rumsfeld approach would be counter - productive and impact on us as police officers in London .
" There is still a duty on the police to let government know what the impact of their policies are , a duty on the police to report the damaging impact on Muslim community support . "
Lambert was awarded an MBE for his work heading the MCU and retired in 2007 .
He said the fight needed to focus solely on the terrorists , and not on those who may share some of their political views , but who will express them peacefully .
He said that British policies handed the terrorists propaganda victories .
Such policies included the Iraq war , civilian casualties in Afghanistan , the torture of terror suspects at Guantánamo and elsewhere , rendition , the muted response to Israel 's attack on Lebanon and the attempt to hold terror suspects in the UK for 90 days without charge .
Remarkable recovery : 7/7 victim's return to health
Five years ago , Davinia Douglass suffered horrific burns to the left side of her face in the Edgware tube bomb blast that killed six passengers .
At the time she was photographed holding a gauze mask to her face and being helped by a former firefighter ( right ) , one of the most striking images from the 7/7 attacks .
Initially , she feared the scarring left by her burns would be so severe that her life would be ruined .
The pictures of her face at the time showed extensive damage and seemed to bear out her worst fears .
However , the doctors at the Chelsea and Westminster hospital , where she spent several months , did a remarkable job of repairing the damage .
Today the 29 - year - old corporate expert , who married last year , has made a remarkable recovery and her features bear almost no sign of her injuries .

The Girl Scouts logo has received a facelift — but will it make the organization cool ?
Advertisement
Opinions are divided on whether the new logo is actually an improvement .
Armin of Brand New praises design firm Original Champions of Design for hewing close to Saul Bass 's 1978 logo — he 's also a fan of the added bangs , new lips , and " perkier nose . "
But Mediabistro's Stephanie Murg calls the new hairdo " an awkward tuft of bangs , " and I have to agree .
It 's not even clear that the extra green dollop is hair — at some sizes , it looks like a hat , or sunglasses , or a bite taken out of the girl 's head .
According to the Girl Scouts , though , bangs are just the beginning of a large - scale effort to refurbish their image .
It 's a worthy goal , since the Girl Scouts could be a truly awesome organization .
They 're a a major national nonprofit that 's just for girls , and at their best , they can set girls on a path toward leadership and service while teaching them cool skills .
But they 're kind of hit - or - miss .
When I was a Girl Scout back in nineties , our activities ranged from awesome ( sea kayaking ) to pretty stupid ( playing with rubber stamps ) , and actual community service opportunities were few and far between .
The general understanding was that the coolness of scouting varied widely by troop , and if you ended up in a lackluster one , then Girl Scouts might be a waste of time .
Things do seem to have changed for the better since then — intern Noorain , a current Girl Scout , says ,
They 've done a great job of changing what they do and providing services and opportunities especially to those who are generally underserved and / or in rural areas .
They have not done a good job with rebranding and being more than cookies even though they 've enlisted endless consultants / branding specialists to do it .
Advertisement
Indeed , I remember rebranding efforts of everything from cookie boxes to uniforms from my time as a Scout , yet Chief Marketing Officer Laurel Richie still has to say things like ,
While we are proud of our $ 700 million cookie business run by girls , we offer so much more than that , and this new work is designed to let people know about all the new and exciting things girls do every day as Girl Scouts .
The Scouts ' press contact has n't returned my call yet , so I can't say for sure what the " 360 degree marketing program " that 's supposed to accompany the new logo will entail .
Whatever the case , the Girl Scouts are going to need more than a new hairdo if they want to show everyone they 're better than their baked goods .

President Obama this week praised San Diego - based antivirus vendor ESETÃ‚Â for itsÃ‚Â Securing Our eCity program , citing it as an example ofÃ‚Â how local - level partnerships between the private and public sectors can boost cybersecurity .
ESET was awarded “ Best Local / Community Plan ” as part of the Department of Homeland Security ’s National Cybersecurity Awareness Challenge .
Speaking at the award ceremony , Obama alluded to ESET as helpingÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â strengthen ” public / private partnerships both cooperatively on the domestic as well as the international side .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
DHS handed out seven awards to organizations , business and one individual .
This is allÃ‚Â part of DHS working toward crafting a comprehensive national cybersecurity plan , which it is slated to officially unveiled in October as a part of Cybersecurity Awareness Month .
Since 2008 , ESET has been rallying San Diego - areaÃ‚Â consumer advocates , business owners , law enforcement investigators , government regulators and elected officials to form partnerships to boost cybersecurity awareness and best practices .
“ The journey to get to this point was beyond exciting , ” says ESET ’s Liz Fraumann , Director of Cybersecurity Awareness & Education .
“ With 200 stakeholders representing all segments of the greater San Diego community we are well on our way to achieving our mission of ‘ making San Diego a place where we can all live , work and play in a cybersecure city . ’

BP 's logic seems to be that if the oil cleanup does n't look dangerous then it must not be .
The oil company has told workers not to wear respirators because it 's bad for public relations , according to one human rights group .
RFK Center President Kerry Kennedy traveled to the Gulf Coast to talk to cleanup workers and found that BP was trying to repress the use of safety equipment .
" In all three states that I 've visited , fishermen said when they went out to work on the cleanup , that if they tried to bring respirators they were told it was unnecessary equipment and would only spread hysteria , " Kennedy told Fox News Friday .
" When I went out with eleven people , we had respirators on and within half an hour , all of our eyes were burning and our throats were closing and we all had headaches , " she explained .
Kennedy was also concerned that BP was refusing to release information about the contents of the dispersant being used .
" They 're basic human rights issues .
The right to access of information .
BP still will not say what the chemical makeup of the dispersants are so health care officials and victims can know why they 're sick and what 's going on with them , " Kennedy said .
And the health care options for workers who have fallen ill is a problem too .
" One of the things that we were told is that BP would not allow county health officials on to their campus .
They finally allowed one nurse .
They told workers that if they became sick , the nurse could only give them a Band - Aid or an aspirin .
If they really felt sick they had to go to the BP doctors .
So BP has completely control over the health care of those workers and what 's happening , " Kennedy told Fox host Eric Bolling .
" And no government health care down there at all ? " asked Bolling .
Kennedy found that there was government health care but workers were reluctant to accept it .
" The workers are concerned that this is the only job in town and if the go outside what BP tells them to do they might lose the only job they could get , " she said .
CALCUTTA — In what is widely believed to be the result of clerical error on the part of Heaven 's massive soul - evaluation and punishment - allocation bureaucracy , The Calcutta Daily - Telegram reported Monday that beloved missionary caregiver Mother Teresa was condemned to agonizing , eternal torment in Hell following her death last Friday at the age of 87 .
After a lifetime of good works , Mother Teresa is currently enduring the searing flames of Hell .
Her eternal damnation is believed to be the result of a clerical error .
Widely expected to ascend into Paradise and take her rightful place among the saints to the glorious fanfare of horns and choruses upon her passing , she was instead hurled from the firmament into the bowels of the Lake of Fire .
" We can only assume that some sort of mix - up occurred in the processing phase , " said St. Peter , the heavenly official in charge of the Book of Life , in which the names of those chosen to ascend to the Gates of Heaven are written .
" Unfortunately , when you deal with over 70 million souls a day , these kinds of mistakes happen .
What can I say ?
I do n't know what else to tell you . "
Advertisement
Mother Teresa , who for decades inspired the world with her selfless devotion to the starving , disease - ridden masses of Calcutta , was unavailable for comment , as she was being lowered upside - down into a vat of boiling human excrement by a trio of pitchfork - wielding demons .
Similar punishment reportedly awaits her for the rest of eternity .
Ever since Monday , heavenly angels , cherubim , seraphim , and other secondary celestial entities have been working around the clock to keep up with the enormous volume of intercessionary prayers arriving daily on Mother Teresa 's behalf .
Despite the tremendous number of pleas , however , Heaven essentially has its hands tied .
Advertisement
" It 's sad that this happened , " the archangel Gabriel , a spokesperson for Heaven , told reporters .
" But we really can't do anything about it .
The whole point of eternal damnation is that it is inescapable , absolute , and irrevocable .
If the Lord were to turn around and pull her out of Hell now , he'd be turning his back on millennia of Catholic doctrine , on everything Mother Teresa stood for . "
Her arthritic limbs snapping like twigs as her frail , 4 ' 11 " frame was rent asunder by the claws of grotesque , multi-limbed demons , Mother Teresa reportedly screamed in indescribable agony as the superheated gases of Hell 's unholy furnace blackened and charred her hair and face .
According to a New York Times report , her skull has already been used as a drinking goblet by Satan , the Great Deceiver himself , and the esteemed nun 's rape at the hands of insatiable , barbed - penis - wielding hellhounds in the near - future is considered " highly likely . "
Advertisement
" I can't believe this happened , " said stunned Catholic Cristina Fontanez , 38 , of Petaluma , CA .
" She must have been so shocked when , after a lifetime of good works , she found herself face - to - face with Satan .
Instead of being thrust into the living and redemptive light of Jesus ' love for all time upon her death , she instead found herself being slit from crotch to sternum and suffering the pain of red - hot instruments of torture repeatedly being plunged deep into her writhing entrails . "
Speculation varies as to what could have caused such a miscarriage of heavenly justice .
While some contend that Mother Teresa 's policy of not administering medication to the sick and dying in her clinics may have caused some in Heaven to doubt her true compassion , others believe that her constant speeches against birth control — a contributing factor to mass overpopulation , poverty and starvation throughout the Third World — may be to blame .
Advertisement
Still others posit that Teresa may have sinned in her heart at some point during her long life , qualifying her for eternal damnation despite a history of good works .
" According to Catholic doctrine , even one moment of lust would be enough to justify Mother Teresa 's banishment to the flame , " said Archbishop Janiusz Wolsczya of Krakow .
" It is possible that after years of celibacy and self - denial , her natural desires for sexual release may have built to a breaking point .
I imagine that sleeping alone on that hard cot all those years and donating every ounce of her strength to the care of the poor , she must have been very lonely .
The compulsion to masturbate must have been enormous . "
Advertisement
Most observers , however , reject these explanations , firm in the belief that the eternal punishment is undeserved , the result of simple bureaucratic error on the part of heavenly officials .
" I promise a full investigation into this matter , " the Apostle John , seated at the right hand of Christ Almighty , told reporters .
" If any evidence of incompetence or error on the part of the officials who conducted Mother Teresa 's afterlife evaluation is found , I assure you there will be serious repercussions . "
Advertisement
Despite such strongly worded statements from Heaven , a majority of followers on Earth are calling the promise of a full investigation a case of " too little , too late . "
" I feel like this has forever weakened the foundation of my faith , " said 73 - year - old Giancarlo Rossetti of Milan , one of over 300,000 protesters who crowded Vatican Square Tuesday to call for an immediate reversal of the Mother Teresa Hell condemnation .
" She was a good woman , and she does not deserve to have her eyes torn out of their sockets by flaming packs of ravenous demon - dogs . "

Satan , speaking from deep within his fortress in the Hell city of Dis , described the late Mother Teresa 's soul as " succulent and tasty . "
Tuli Kupferberg , a founding member of the underground left - wing 1960s band the Fugs as well as a poet , political cartoonist and lifelong peace activist , died Monday in New York .
He was 86 .
Kupferberg ’s health had been declining since he suffered two strokes last year that left him blind , according to Ed Sanders , with whom he formed the Fugs in New York ’s Lower East Side in 1964 .
Earlier this year , producer Hal Willner coordinated a benefit concert in New York featuring dozens of musicians who cited the Fugs as an influence , including Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson , Sonic Youth , Philip Glass and Lenny Kaye from the Patti Smith Group .
“ It ’s hard to imagine a world without Tuli Kupferberg , and New York will never be the same , ” Willner told The Times on Monday by e-mail .
“ More than anything , Tuli was someone who you never heard a negative thing about and everyone was always happy to see him … a rare quality .
Advertisement
“ With his poems , songs and parodies , he always cut to the chase and got right to the point of what it was he was getting at — always incredibly insightful , biting yet done with hysterical yet simplistic humor that one could not argue with his point of view , ” Willner noted .
Kupferberg had been too ill to attend the benefit show but sent a short video that concluded with him telling the audience , “ Now go out there and have some fun .
It may be later than you think . ”
Kupferberg wrote the lyrics for one of the Fugs ’ signature songs , “ Kill for Peace , ” which the band played at its concerts as the Vietnam War was escalating in the mid-'60s .
He also wrote “ Nothing , Nothing , ” a nihilistic song set to the melody an old Yiddish song , which helped set the stage for the art rock outfits such as the Velvet Underground in the late ‘ 60s and much of the attitude of ‘ 70s punk music .
Advertisement
“ The Fugs were right on the barricades of what was possible , ” veteran music industry executive Danny Goldberg told National Public Radio in April .
“ There was a fearlessness , an intensity , an unwillingness to pander to any commercial norms that was very exciting . ”
In addition to making music for years with Sanders , Kupferberg continued to publish his poetry , sometimes selling his works on street corners in and around his longtime home in Greenwich Village .
He also was the author of books that became minor counterculture classics , including “ 1001 Ways to Beat the Draft ” and “ 1001 Ways to Live Without Working . ”
Naphtali Kupferberg was born Sept. 28 , 1923 , in New York City .
He attended the Brooklyn College of Arts , studying , among other topics , sexual freedom in the institution ’s New School of Social Research .
He published poetry magazines including Birth , which attracted the attention Allen Ginsberg and other Beat poets .
When he and Sanders started the Fugs in 1964 , Kupferberg was 41 , a generation older than Sanders and young rock stars like the Beatles .
After the group reunited in 1985 to embark on making another string of albums , Sanders would n’t reveal Kupferberg ’s age , telling The Times only that his band mate was “ ready for Medicare . ”
Advertisement
Although he stopped performing with the Fugs several years ago , Kupferberg continued writing , selling political cartoons on the street and posting homemade videos on YouTube , including a recent one , “ I Am an Artist For Art ’s Sake , ” that crystallized much of his approach through life :
“ I am an artist for art ’s sake , ” he sang .
“ It was God who gave me my big break .
I was born for a higher reason , and all his angels I am pleasing .
I ’m an artist for God ’s sake . ”
Kupferberg is survived by his wife , Sylvia Topp , and three children .

Fiona from Amnesty UK sez ,
After raising £ 30,000 to support an ad campaign exposing Shell 's damaging practices in the Niger Delta , Amnesty International and its supporters were sorely disappointed when the Financial Times took a last minute decision to pull their ad .
Tim Hancock , Amnesty International UK 's campaigns director , said :
" The decision by the Financial Times is extremely disappointing .
We gave them written reassurances that we would take full responsibility for the comments and opinions stated in the advertisement .
Both The Metro and The Evening Standard had no problems with running the ad .
" The money to pay for the advertisements came entirely from more than 2,000 individuals online , who we 'd asked to fund an ad campaign targeting Shell 's AGM — and it really caught their imagination .
And I am sure these supporters will share with us our sense of deep disappointment . "
Washington ( CNN ) --
With the first tar balls from the Gulf oil spill now washing ashore in Galveston , Texas , Rep. Ron Paul , whose district includes the affected area , said Monday the federal government is not doing enough in the recovery effort .
" They have done a lot to interfere , " Paul told National Political Correspondent Jessica Yellin on CNN's " John King USA . "
He said local residents and state officials in Louisiana and Mississippi have complained that some federal agencies , including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Fish and Wildlife Service , have not acted quickly enough to relax some regulations to fast - track recovery initiatives .
Federal officials have previously defended their efforts .
Another area of criticism by Paul concerned the deployment of National Guard troops to help in the cleanup .
" If all our states had their Guard units back here maybe they would have the manpower to do more to help clean up the beaches and prevent the oil from coming in , but , no , our Guard units are all over the world fighting wars we do n't need , " said Paul , a critic of the U.S. deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan .
While 17,500 National Guard troops from Gulf Coast states have been authorized to respond to the crisis , currently 1,577 are active , according to the Obama administration .
Paul has been one of the few the national Republican leaders to come out in support of embattled Republican Party Chairman Michael Steele after Steele told a fundraiser last week the Afghanistan war was " a war of Obama 's choosing " and suggested it was not winnable .
Many national Republicans immediately called for Steele 's resignation , pointing out it was in direct contradiction to what they believed , especially since the war started under President George W. Bush after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
" He did not deserve to be punished through the media in a sense that , ' Get out , we do n't want you .
We do n't need you . '
I think the party is doing reasonably well , " Paul said on the program .
The former GOP presidential candidate disagreed with his colleagues Sens. John McCain , R - Arizona , and Lindsey Graham , R - South Carolina , who over the weekend blasted Steele and his comments , calling them inaccurate , uninformed and unwise .
" Millions of Americans feel frustrated .
This war has gone on too long , cost us too much money , cost us billions of dollars , cost us thousands of casualties , " Paul said .
" People are tired of the war , and it is going badly . "
Paul finds himself in unusual company .
A USA Today - Gallup Poll last week showed 66 percent of Republicans supported the war while only 27 percent of Democrats did .
The eleven - term congressman said he has not spoken to Steele since the controversy erupted .
Asked about criticism that his son , Rand , has received since winning the GOP nomination for the open Senate seat in Kentucky , Ron Paul said , " He got some bad raps ...
I guess I did n't warn him enough and prepare him enough . "
Rand Paul found himself in the middle of firestorms after criticizing the 1964 Civil Rights Act , calling President Barack Obama 's criticism of Gulf oil well owner BP " un- American " and holding a recent fundraiser in Washington , D.C. , which was criticized by some Tea Party members .
Some of the members of Congress listed on the invitation as part of the welcome committee for the event voted for the 2008 financial bailout known as TARP ( Troubled Asset Relief Program ) .
One of Paul 's major campaign themes was his opposition to that initiative .
" You can expect it after you win a primary ... and beat the estabilshment .
You can sort of expect something , " is how the elder Paul Monday reacted to some of the criticism weathered by his son .
Rand Paul , whose primary race had drawn a large amount of support from Tea Party activists both in the state and nationwide , had run as an anti-Washington candidate in the primary , beating the incumbent Kentucky secretary of state who had won the backing of many state party leaders .
Ron Paul said he has refrained from offering his son advice .
" I let him run his own campaign , " he added .
I ’ve seen these on several blogs but I want to keep this in my own records because they are so beautiful !

BP , that poor old company that was recently shaken down by mean , mean President Obama ( who , by contrast , will be having some private time at that now luxurious and lovely smelling Gulf coast ) tries to spin this ... somehow :
In a statement , BP described Hayward 's break as " a rare moment of private time " and said that " no matter where he is , he is always in touch with what is happening within BP " and can direct recovery operations if required .
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/...
Based on a GoogleNews search , it looks like the UK's DailyMail had a story about this :
But oops , now it 's gone :
UPDATE : The DailyMail story is back online .

Update 2 : Tony's Defenders
" It 's a well - known event in the British calendar .
He 's entitled to private time with his family , " said BP spokesman Robert Wine .
... " He 's continuing to work hard .
You do n't have to be physically in a location to remain in charge of the response , " said Wine .
http://www.nydailynews.com/...
A company spokeswoman said : " We would n't dream of commenting on what the chief executive does in his rare moments of private time . "

Update 3 : This is n't going over well , Tony
The original AP story has been updated :
LONDON —
In what one environmentalist described as " yet another public relations disaster " for embattled energy giant BP , CEO Tony Hayward took time off Saturday to attend a glitzy yacht race around England 's Isle of Wight .
As social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook lit up with outrage , BP spokespeople rushed to defend Hayward , who has drawn withering criticism as the public face of BP 's halting efforts to stop the worst oil spill in U.S. history .
http://www.chron.com/...
The embattled chief executive of BP seems to have made yet another embarrassing PR gaffe by attended a yachting event on the Isle of Wight .
As company officials insisted Tony Hayward was still in charge of the operation to control the Gulf of Mexico spill amid confusion over his role , someone who resembles him was seen relaxing at the JP Morgan Asset Management Round the Island Race .
... But Hugh Walding , the co-ordinator of the Isle of Wight Friends of the Earth , criticised Mr Hayward for his outing , saying he deserved all the criticism he was getting over his failure to control the oil spill .
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/...
BP chief ' sailing into PR disaster ' Charlie Kronick , of Greenpeace , said Mr Hayward 's actions were " rubbing salt into the wounds " of people whose communities are affected by the catastrophe .
... Mr Walding [ co-ordinator of the Isle of Wight Friends of the Earth ] said : " I 'm sure that this will be seen as yet another public relations disaster for him from people who have got exceedingly upset about this whole thing .
Personally I do n't think that the bloke is particularly competent from the results that he has delivered .
He obviously does n't have the technical know - how but he should at least be managing the image of the company better . "
http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/...
Hayward Sailing Into Further Trouble ?
When I heard earlier today that Tony Hayward , the under pressure boss of BP , was spending his Saturday with ' Bob ' , I assumed it meant that he was working alongside Robert Dudley , the executive taking of day - to - day operations in the Gulf of Mexico , on the company 's ongoing operation there .
But no .
The Bob that Hayward has this afternoon been spotted with is the name of a boat he jointly owns and which has been taking part in today 's Round the Island yacht race The Round the Island Race website lists the boat as having been entered by Hayward , Sam Laidlaw , chief executive of Centrica , the owner of British Gas , and Rob Gray , an investment banker at Deutsche Bank who has been close to BP for more than 20 years .
It 's not clear if Laidlaw , a respected figure in the energy industry , and Gray , were also there today .

Every once in a while I see a blog post or hear a comment about how easy it is to transition these days , and should n’t people be waiting longer ?
Little snippets of panic about people rushing into things , usually coupled with the assumption that , as medical transition becomes more easily accessible , more and more people will do it , and will end up regretting it .
I ’m not going to link to the post that triggered this one because it is a steaming pile of bullshit that , amongst other things , uses an episode of CSI as proof of our slippery slope into a dark , apocalyptic transsexual future .
CSI , the most reliable of sources .
Moving on .
As well as being paternalistic , privileged scaremongering , this is also a pretty blatantly transphobic position , with the underlying understanding being that ending up with an ‘ unnatural ’ transsexual body is the worst possible thing that could ever happen to a cis person , and must be avoided at all costs .
The precautions being increased obstacles to medical transition , and the costs being the vastly larger amount of trans people who have to climb over them to get to it .
The other ridiculous thing about this ( the first being the ratio of people who regret it to people who do n’t ) is that the preventative measures do n’t work .
For as long as there has been access to medical transition , there has been gatekeeping , and there has been regret .
The thing with transsexuality is that it is self - diagnosed , in the end , and anyone can jump through the hoops if they want to .
And in my personal experience , those hoops require personal dishonesty , and denial of doubts and fears .
I remember in the early days of my trans experience , hearing about these people , who did it , who regretted it , and being told not to worry because ‘ that hardly ever happens ’ .
Of course I did worry , though , and I do n’t think many transsexual people do n’t worry – that they might be the one who regrets it , who ends up with an awful surgically constructed body when they did n’t even have to .
I think most of the time this fear is internalised transphobia , a desire not to be a ‘ fake ’ , second - class human being , and a clinging to the possibility of being a ‘ real ’ , ‘ natural ’ cis person .
At least , after six years of struggling with doubt , that ’s the conclusion I have come to regarding myself .
But the interesting thing is how this doubt came through and how I dealt with it .
When I set out to access medical transition two years ago , and came up against mental health professionals who questioned and interrogated my identity and choices , I found myself feeling more and more certain .
I had never been that certain before apart from when I had just come out and was having to justify my identity to my family and friends .
See the theme yet ?
Having to prove myself forced me to push the , quite substantial , doubts and fears I had about medical transition to the back of my mind .
And it worked , and I eventually , finally , got my hands on a testosterone prescription , and it was all very exciting .
Until my voice began to break .
It was like the floodgates had opened , and all of the things that I had n’t allowed myself to think about for the last two years came pouring back in and overwhelmed me .
I stopped testosterone .
I started seeing a private counsellor .
I started to deal with my doubt again .
I did all this and did n’t tell the NHS anything about it because I was terrified they would cut off my treatment if I did .
And that ’s the thing about uncertainty : you do n’t know what you want to do .
Because I was n’t sure if I wanted the treatment I had access to or not , I did n’t want to risk being honest about my fear and losing that access .
I decided to continue with treatment again , after a lot of help from a fantastic counsellor – I will probably write more about that journey another time .
The point is that the gatekeepers ’ net failed to fish out my uncertainty , and more than that , it actually prevented me from dealing with it .
What gatekeeping , and the self - policing trans community that swallows the medical industries ’ bullshit trans narrative does , is prevent people from being honest with themselves .
If transitioning is the wrong direction for someone to take , then following a script and burying their real feelings is n’t going to help them figure that out .
I think that concern about transsexual regret , most of the time , is an elaborate and patronising cover - up for transphobia .
If you really want people to stop making bad choices , then maybe you should stop trying to police them .

Cash spent on the Flying Gorillas , a West London dance troupe
Documents from Brussels revealed that 727 grants have been doled out by the European Commission to undisclosed schemes around the world in the past three years .
They included £ 80 million in aid to South Africa and £ 66 million for “ neighbourhood policy ” in the tiny eastern European republic of Moldova .
But no details of the grants were given for “ security reasons ” to show how the money was spent .
The siphoning of public money to mystery projects was revealed by the think - tank Open Europe yesterday .
Its spokesman Stephen Booth said : “ It is unacceptable for the European Commission to be throwing £ 400 million of taxpayers ’ money down a black hole marked ‘ confidential ’ .
“ To make matters worse , the EU is demanding even more money to spend on ludicrous projects that are a complete waste of money . ”
Bizarrely the secret spending has now been published on a new EU Commission database called the Financial Transparency System .
The database , which anyone can view on the internet , lists all grants made by the European Commission since 2007 .
It reveals millions of pounds lavished on questionable “ cultural ” projects including a dance troupe which performs “ spectacular belching ” , a travelling model of a fire - breathing dragon and a set of postcards for Euro MPs costing £ 47,000 .
However the database warns :
“ In certain cases parts of the information displayed on a particular grant or contract may be masked , eg for security reasons . ”
Other “ secretive ” payments have included £ 6.5 million to an unnamed recipient in Switzerland – which is not in the EU – for “ European Neighbourhood and Partnership financial cooperation with Mediterranean countries ” .
The handouts were revealed at a time when the EU Commission has proposed a 5.3 per cent rise in the EU ’s budget , which is expected to exceed £ 118 billion this year .
Critics of the EU were last night outraged over the payments .
Tory MP Douglas Carswell said : “ At a time when our coalition administration is making government more accountable to us , the EU is hiding how it spends millions of pounds of our money .
“ This shows that David Cameron ’s vision for Britain is incompatible with our EU membership .
“ We ca n’t be opening up the state in Britain while being governed by a secretive elite in Brussels . ”
In Part 1 of this multi-part article on OpenMP , I described how OpenMP source code is processed by an OpenMP compiler .
OpenMP compilers resemble the typical compiler pipeline of traditional compilers and augment it with OpenMP - specific stages and passes that transform OpenMP code to multi- threaded execution ( see Figure 1 ) .
In this installment , I explore how a parallel construct is transformed into code that can be handed over to a team of threads for execution .
My focus will be on how to utilize POSIX threads , but the concepts shown here can easily mapped to other threading APIs as well .
Before we dive into the OpenMP low - level transformation to create threaded code , we first need to investigate how most threading APIs work to understand why these code transformations are necessary .
Without too much loss of generality , I will start with a short example of how to concurrently execute a piece of code with a threading model such as POSIX threads .
( Other threading APIs rely on similar concepts to implement threading . )
I believe this is a good kick start for all that are not experts in low - level thread programming .
Let 's assume we want to write a POSIX version of the all - time favorite " Hello World " .
Here 's the sequential code :
#include < stdio.h > int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { printf ( " Hello World
" ) ; return 0 ; }
The following code fragment shows the POSIX version of the previous program .
Each thread will print the " Hello World " string and then exit :
#include < stdio.h > # include < pthread.h > # define NUM_THREADS 8 void* run( void* arg ) { printf ( " Hello World
" ) ; return NULL ; } int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { int i ; pthread_t threads [ NUM_THREADS ] ; for ( i = 0 ; i < NUM_THREADS ; i++) { pthread_create (/*1*/ & threads [i ] , /*2*/ NULL , /*3*/ run , /*4*/ NULL ) ; } for ( i = 0 ; i < NUM_THREADS ; i++) { pthread_join (/*1*/ threads [i ] , /*2*/ NULL ) ; } return 0 ; }
Multi -threading with POSIX relies on a so - called start routine that contains the code to be executed .
A typical task for enabling a sequential program for POSIX threads thus is to move the corresponding code from the sequential code area to a newly created thread function .
In the above example , we have moved the printf statement from the main method to a new function called run .
This function is required to accept one pointer that points to the arguments for the invocation and it returns a pointer to the address for the function 's return value .
To execute the run function in a new thread , we invoke the POSIX call pthread_create in a for loop to create a set of threads for execution .
We pass along four arguments to pthread_create : ( 1 ) a pointer to the thread handle that can be used by the creator to control its created child threads , ( 2 ) a pointer to thread attributes ( we can ignore this here ) , ( 3 ) a function pointer of the start routine ( the run function in our case ) , and ( 4 ) the pointer that will be passed to the start routine as the argument .
After the for loop is done , there are NUM_THREADS threads that will run concurrently in addition to the very first thread that executes the main function of our program .
At the end of the " Hello World " example , we need to take care to wait until all threads have finished executing their work .
We use the pthread_join call for this purpose .
It suspends the calling thread until a second thread has finished execution .
The second thread is determined by the thread handle , which is passed as the first argument of pthread_join .
The second argument is a pointer to variable that will receive a pointer to a return value .

Voice of One Piece 's Ivankov allegedly posted pictures of lower body on blog
Police arrested 56 - year - old voice and stage actor Norio Imamura on Monday for allegedly posting pictures of his lower body on his blog .
According to the police , Imamura posted indecent images on his blog for two months starting this past April .
Imamura runs a bar named
Toh where tattoo enthusiasts gather in Tokyo's Shinjuku ward , and he has adorned his own entire body with tattoos .
According to the police investigation , Imamura said in a deposition that he has been tattooing himself for about a decade , and was wanting to show off the fact that he finished tattooing his entire body .
As a voice actor , Imamura is best known for playing Emporio Ivankov in the One Piece television anime series .
Sources : TBS , Mainichi Shimbun
Update : Imamura 's public blog does not currently have images of his lower body posted in the time period described by the police .
Update 2 : Imamura reportedly spent 4 to 5 million yen ( about US $ 45,000 to US $ 56,000 ) on his tattoos and publicly posted four images between April 26 and June 17 .

When loaded with an anticancer drug , a delivery system based on a novel material called nanosponge is three to five times more effective at reducing tumor growth than direct injection .
That is the conclusion of a paper published in the June 1 issue of the journal Cancer Research .
" Effective targeted drug delivery systems have been a dream for a long time now but it has been largely frustrated by the complex chemistry that is involved , " says Eva Harth , assistant professor of chemistry at Vanderbilt , who developed the nanosponge delivery system .
" We have taken a significant step toward overcoming these obstacles . "
The study was a collaboration between Harth 's laboratory and that of Dennis E. Hallahan , a former professor of radiation oncology at Vanderbilt who is now at the Washington University School of Medicine .
Corresponding authors are Harth and Roberto Diaz at Emory University , who was working in the Hallahan laboratory when the studies were done .
To visualize Harth 's delivery system , imagine making tiny sponges that are about the size of a virus , filling them with a drug and attaching special chemical " linkers " that bond preferentially to a feature found only on the surface of tumor cells and then injecting them into the body .
The tiny sponges circulate around the body until they encounter the surface of a tumor cell where they stick on the surface ( or are sucked into the cell ) and begin releasing their potent cargo in a controllable and predictable fashion .
Targeted delivery systems of this type have several basic advantages :
Because the drug is released at the tumor instead of circulating widely through the body , it should be more effective for a given dosage .
It should also have fewer harmful side effects because smaller amounts of the drug come into contact with healthy tissue .
advertisement
" We call the material nanosponge , but it is really more like a three - dimensional network or scaffold , " says Harth .
The backbone is a long length of polyester .
It is mixed in solution with small molecules called cross-linkers that act like tiny grappling hooks to fasten different parts of the polymer together .
The net effect is to form spherically shaped particles filled with cavities where drug molecules can be stored .
The polyester is biodegradable , so it breaks down gradually in the body .
As it does , it releases the drug it is carrying in a predictable fashion .
" Predictable release is one of the major advantages of this system compared to other nanoparticle delivery systems under development , " says Harth .
When they reach their target , many other systems unload most of their drug in a rapid and uncontrollable fashion .
This is called the burst effect and makes it difficult to determine effective dosage levels .
Another major advantage is that the nanosponge particles are soluble in water .
Encapsulating the anti-cancer drug in the nanosponge allows the use of hydrophobic drugs that do not dissolve readily in water .
Currently , these drugs must be mixed with another chemical , called an adjuvant reagent , that reduces the efficacy of the drug and can have adverse side - effects .
It is also possible to control the size of nanosponge particles .
By varying the proportion of cross - linker to polymer , the nanosponge particles can be made larger or smaller .
This is important because research has shown that drug delivery systems work best when they are smaller than 100 nanometers , about the depth of the pits on the surface of a compact disc .
The nanosponge particles used in the current study were 50 nanometers in size .
" The relationship between particle size and the effectiveness of these drug delivery systems is the subject of active investigation , " says Harth .
The other major advantage of Harth 's system is the simple chemistry required .
The researchers have developed simple , high - yield " click chemistry " methods for making the nanosponge particles and for attaching the linkers , which are made from peptides , relatively small biological molecules built by linking amino acids .
" Many other drug delivery systems require complicated chemistry that will be difficult to scale up for commercial production , but we have continually kept this in mind , " Harth says .

The targeting peptide used in the animal studies was developed by the Hallahan laboratory , which also tested the system 's effectiveness in tumor - bearing mice .
The peptide used in the study is one that selectively binds to tumors that have been treated with radiation .
The drug used for the animal studies was paclitaxel ( the generic name of the drug Taxol ) that is used in cancer chemotherapy .
The researchers recorded the response of two different tumor types -- slow - growing human breast cancer and fast - acting mouse glioma -- to single injections .
In both cases they found that it increased the death of cancer cells and delayed tumor growth " in a manner superior to know chemotherapy approaches . "
The next step is to perform an experiment with repeated injections to see if the nanosponge system can stop and reverse tumor growth .
Harth is also planning to perform the more comprehensive toxicity studies on her nanoparticle delivery system that are required before it can be used in clinical trials .
Additional participants in the study were Ralph J. Passarella , Daniel E. Spratt , John G. Phillips , Hongmei Wu and Li Zhou from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Alice E. van der Ende and Vasanth Sathiyakumar from Vanderbilt 's Department of Chemistry .
The research was supported by grants from the Department of Defense , National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health .
As part of a new initiative cracking down on Internet piracy and counterfeiting , yesterday the U.S. government took action against nine web portals suspected of streaming of first - run movies .
Not only were domain names targeted , but assets seized from bank , PayPal and other accounts .
One site , NinjaVideo , was warned by TorrentFreak months ago they were being watched .
Following last week ’s threats from U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator Victoria Espinel directed at those offering unauthorized movies and music , yesterday saw indications of the first clear action .
Under the banner “ Operation In Our Sites ” , authorities targeted nine domains that are claimed to have offered first - run movies without consent from the copyright holders , a serious criminal offense under U.S. law .
“ Criminal copyright infringement occurs on a massive scale over the Internet , reportedly resulting in billions of dollars in losses to the U.S. economy , ” said Preet Bharara , the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York , whose office handled the warrants authorizing the seizures of seven of the domains .
The seven seized domains are TVShack.net , Movies - Links .
TV , FilesPump.com , Now -Movies.com , PlanetMoviez.com , ThePirateCity.org and ZML.com .
Feds left a message
In addition to the domain seizures , agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ’s Homeland Security Investigations ( HSI ) seized assets from 15 bank , PayPal , investment and other advertising accounts .
Four residential search warrants were also executed .
The other two domains targeted – NinjaVideo.net and NinjaThis .net – belong to the hugely popular streaming service NinjaVideo .
According to authorities the site had been subjected to a months - long operation which resulted in the seizure of both their domains and website content .
“ This investigation resulted in the execution of federal search warrants for their content and domain name at servers in the United States and the Netherlands .
HSI agents also executed four residential search warrants in North Carolina , New Jersey , New York and Washington , ” reads the ICE announcement .
Here at TorrentFreak this announcement did n’t really come as a surprise .
Several months ago we were informed that NinjaVideo was being closely watched but we had no idea the U.S. authorities were behind it .
In March we received word that Dutch police had arrived at Ecatel , NinjaVideo ’s host in The Netherlands .
Our sources said that servers had been removed for examination but had been later returned .
TorrentFreak contacted Ecatel who told us that “ your sources have given you a lead far removed from the truth . ”
We also contacted NinjaVideo and gave them what few details we had but after emails back and forth , it became clear that NinjaVideo either could n’t or would n’t be drawn on the information we had provided .
Without any absolute clear information or quotable sources we were sadly forced to abandon our planned article .
Now , three months later NinjaVideo is one of the nine websites that were targeted by the U.S. Government .
As is often the case , however , not all of the websites are surrendering without putting up a fight .
At least two sites have already adapted .
Movies - Links .TV , is operational under the new domain name of Watch - Movies - tv.info and TVShack.
net is now located at TVShack.cc .
Both are hosted with former Pirate Bay bandwidth supplier CB3ROB and both are mentioned in a previous MPAA copyright warning .

Previous Lieberman - Netanyahu problems
Israel Beiteinu ministers slam new budget
Rebecca Anna Stoil and Herb Keinon contributed to this report .
Relations between Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman have reportedly hit a low after the government 's budget meeting and the prime minister 's reaction to the conversion bill .
The two plan to meet on Monday to mend ties .
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu announced on Sunday that he opposes the conversion bill , proposed by Israel Beiteinu MK David Rotem .
Netanyahu said the bill could tear apart the Jewish people .
The prime minister plans to try to reach an agreement with Israel Beiteinu over the bill , however , if the bill is not removed , Netanyahu said he plans to tell the Likud and other coalition parties to vote against it .
Rotem said he doubts that Netanyahu will stand by his opposition to the conversion bill in an interview with Israel Radio on Sunday .
" Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is impressionable , and in the end he 'll fold in this case , too , " Rotem said .
" This law has nothing to do with American Jewry .
The law will pass , in the end the prime minister will support it and even vote for it .
" Netanyahu reportedly called Lieberman over the weekend , while the foreign minister was in Kazakhstan , in order to update him on the prime minister 's upcoming trip to Cairo , and to discuss the budget .
Netanyahu and Lieberman agreed to meet on Monday .
However , Lieberman also plans to call a press conference on Monday in which he will air his grievances against Netanyahu , Israel Radio reported .
Lieberman 's Israel Beiteinu , the government ’s second - largest faction ( 15 MKs ) , has geared up for a long fight over the budget , with the party ’s ministers boycotting Friday ’s vote to protest cuts to their ministries , while battling in the short term to bring the controversial conversion bill to a plenum reading before week ’s end .
Israel Beiteinu ministers claim that Netanyahu and Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz ignored agreements with the party .
In reaction to Israel Beiteinu 's criticism , Steinitz said : " In my opinion , the crisis is not economic , but political .
If there are realistic requests , then we can try to respond to them and solve the crisis .
" Over the weekend , Lieberman also appointed veteran diplomat Meron Reunen as the next ambassador to the UN without informing Netanyahu .
This is reportedly retalliation for six months ago , when Netanyahu prevented Lieberman from bringing his preferred candidate , former consul - general in NY Alon Pinkas , to the cabinet for approval .
Reuven ’s appointment is a temporary one , meaning that it does not have to go to the cabinet for approval .
One foreign ministry official , however , said that after a few months the appointment would most likely become permanent .
Industry , Trade and Labor Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer slammed Lieberman 's behavior in an interview with Army Radio on Sunday , saying " the foreign ministry can't be a war ministry .
It has to be a ministry that gives a message of peace .
" About his meeting with the Turkish foreign minister , Ben-Eliezer said " I would do it again .
" This comes after a number of crises in Israel Beiteinu - Netanyahu relations .
Recently , Lieberman only learned about a meeting in Brussels between Industry , Trade and Labor Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu from Channel 2 news .
After the incident , sources close to Lieberman vowed revenge .
Previously , Lieberman complained that Netanyahu did not make efforts to bring Israel Beiteinu - drafted legislation to plenum readings , such as allowing Israeli citizens outside of Israel to vote , and a law allowing civil marriages .
“ Israel Beiteinu is the senior partner [ in the coalition ] , ” Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch said following the cabinet meeting , “ but we ’re treated otherwise .
I say to the government and to the prime minister :
We ’ll meet in the Knesset .
"
We ’re voting against the budget – it will not pass ! ”
During a Friday interview with Israel Radio , Aharonovitch complained that his ministry ’s budget had been trimmed by approximately NIS 700 million .
Immigrant Absorption Minister Sofa Landver , also from Israel Beiteinu , blasted the cuts to her ministry ’s budget request .
“ This is the first time since the establishment of the State of Israel that aliya is not on the government ’s agenda , ” Landver said .
“ The proposed budget is directly harming the absorption and encouragement of aliya .
I call upon Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to get involved , because he said that the absorption of olim is a priority for our government . ” Israel Beiteinu ministers , including Tourism Minister Stas Meseznikov , who was supposed to have been the party ’s point man on the budget , complained that Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz ( Likud ) had not consulted with them before making the cuts .
They said that other coalition parties had received better treatment .
Vic Rawl , who was the presumptive Democratic nominee in South Carolina 's U.S. Senate race until his upset loss this week to unemployed military veteran Alvin Greene , is now calling for an investigation into the results .
Rawl , a four - term former lawmaker who was heavily favored to win Tuesday , has accepted the help of a couple of mathematics professors who found some possible anomalies in voting patterns , including Rawl 's superior performance among absentee voters compared with Election Day voters .
Another expert examined voting machines used in the primary to check for malfunctions or tampering .
" These findings concern the campaign , and should concern all of South Carolina , " Rawl said in a press release issued late Friday .
" We do not know that anything was done by anyone to tamper with Tuesday 's election , or whether there may have been innocuous machine malfunctions , and we are promoting no theories about either possibility . "
" However , we do feel that further investigation is warranted , " he said .
Greene did not return messages left for him at his home .
A state Democratic Party official told FoxNews.com that the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division , or SLED , had launched an investigation Friday at the request of an unknown person .
But neither the official nor a law enforcement spokeswoman could provide details about what is being reviewed .
Greene 's stunning victory has raised suspicions among some who wonder how a jobless candidate without party support could pay the $ 10,440 filing fee .
House Majority Whip James Clyburn , D - S.C. , has suggested Greene is a Republican plant and has called on federal authorities to investigate where the money came from .
Greene , who says he left the military last August after 13 years in the Army and Air Force , has said he paid the fee by saving up two years of his service pay .
He says he is a " legitimate candidate . "
Greene also has rebuffed pleas from party officials to withdraw from his race against Republican Sen .
Jim DeMint after reports surfaced that he faces a felony charge for allegedly showing pornography to a college student .
Greene won Tuesday with nearly 59 percent of the vote to Rawl 's 41 percent , receiving more than 100,000 votes in the state 's 46 counties .
But after spotting some " oddities , " Rawl sent the election results to Walter Mebane , a professor of political science and statistics at the University of Michigan and Michael Miller , a professor of political science at Cornell University , who Rawl says are not affiliated with his campaign .
Mebane 's test on precinct returns showed that the voting pattern for Rawl on Election Day could be expected to occur only about 10 percent of the time by chance .
" The results may reflect corrupted vote counts , but they may also reflect the way turnout in the election co-varied with the geographical distribution of the candidates ' support , " Mebane said in the press release .
Miller 's test showed that Rawl performed 11 percentage points better among absentee voters than he did among Election Day voters .
" This difference is a clear contrast to the other races , " Miller said .
" Statistically speaking , the only other Democratic candidate who performed differently among the two voter groups was Robert Ford , who did better on Election Day than among absentees in the gubernatorial primary . "
Rawl added that his campaign is receiving e-mails from voters and poll workers who experienced significant problems with voting for whom they intended .
Rawl said a further investigation is needed to find out exactly what happened on Election Day .
" South Carolinians would rather be 100 percent right than 90 percent uncertain , " he said .
After months of debate , the European Parliament finally gave its consent to the controversial Swift agreement on Thursday .
The so - called Swift accord will allow the bulk transfer of European citizens ' financial data to U.S. authorities as part of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program ( TFTP ) .
The Parliament originally rejected the agreement in February over concerns about civil liberties .
But after both the European Commission and the European Council – made up of all EU heads of state – approved the plan , Parliament came under increased pressure to allow the agreement to go ahead .
The Commission revised the original proposal with concessions to Parliament and its members voted to approve the revised proposal by 484 to 109 .
There were only 12 abstentions .
In exchange for Parliament 's support the new agreement acknowleges the ambition for the European Union to establish a system equivalent to the TFTP , which could allow for data extraction to take place on EU soil .
The U.S. has committed to providing assistance in setting up such a system .
One of the chief concerns about the five - year Swift agreement was who would be responsible on the E.U. side .
This issue has been addressed with the setting up of a dedicated unit within Europol , the European Police Office , under the supervision of the Data Protection Officer .
Data can only be transferred with the approval of Europol , on a case - by - case basis and in the smallest possible quantities .
Europol refused to give specific details on the level of security training of those involved .
However according to EDRI ( European Digital Rights ) , the European Data Protection Supervisor ( EDPS ) and several other data protection authorities the agreement interferes with the private life of potentially all Europeans .
Commissioner Malmstr ö m refuted this , saying that European citizens have been given a twofold guarantee to " complete transparency as far as access and use of data are concerned ; and , second , access to appropriate tools and redress procedures to ensure that privacy is protected . "
However , many consumer and civil liberties organizations remain concerned with the security aspect .
EDPS ( European Data Protection Supervisor ) pointed out that Europol is not a judicial authority .
Furthermore , nine MEPs ( members of the European Parliament ) in the civil liberties committee who opposed the agreement warned that the accord might break European data protection rules and could face a legal challenge at the European Court of Justice .
Opponents say that the agreement is illegal because it violates the right to privacy , which is enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights .
EDPS also called for the storage period for non-extracted data ( i.e. data that US law enforcement authorities have not accessed for terrorism - related investigations ) to be considerably reduced -- currently the US can hold this information for five years .
The data held by Swift includes the names of bank account holders and their account numbers .
European citizens also have well - founded concerns about ' mission - creep ' – the expansion of the program to examine the data for reasons other than terrorist tracking - US authorities were secretly accessing the information for five years .
The US Treasury Department first demanded access to Swift 's confidential data following the Sept. 11 attacks and issued compulsory subpoenas .
However , Swift failed to inform the responsible EU authorities and the situation only came to light following a report in the Wall Street Journal in 2006 .
The reworked agreement includes demands from MEPs to allow an EU official to be present in the U.S. when American counter - terrorism officials extract and review data transmitted to them from the EU via Swift and Europeans can seek redress from the U.S. authorities if data is misused .
The accord has already been signed by the EU and the U.S. and will come into force Aug .

Nintendo gamers have waited years for a Wii version of Kirby , a character who has made appearances in other games , such as Super Smash Brothers , but had not received his own spotlight since Nintendo 64 .
Today , Nintendo announced Kirby ’s Epic Yarn , a unique approach to gaming that allows characters to sew items into existence , rip through enemy fabric , and employ some of Kibry ’s favorite actions , like sucking in opponents .
Another favorite who finally returns on the Wii is Donkey Kong in the new platform game : Donkey Kong Country Returns .
At the conclusion of Nintendo ’s one - hour press conference , they announced the new device that everyone has been talking about :
The Nintendo 3DS , which promises to deliver 3D graphics without the need for 3D glasses .
The only way to truly experience it , Nintendo says , is to actually play it , and they paraded tens of young women with 3DS units tethered to their waists for E3 attendees to play .
[ youtube f081 - Iy_fxc 500 375 ]
The 3DS includes a 3D depth slider to adjust the amount of 3D from zero to full , a touch screen on the bottom , d- pad , analog stick , motion sensor , gyro sensor , and two camera lenses on the outside that allow the user to take 3D photos .
In addition the 3DS will play 3D movies and allow users numerous online features for no monthly fee .
Nintendo already has numerous game partnerships with developers to bring 3D games , such as Metal Gear Solid to the 3DS .

Environmental health officers are calling for cheap DIY tattoo kits that can be bought online to be banned .
They say the kits , many of which come from China , are dangerous because the equipment is often poor quality and does n't come with the right safety advice .
Adina Campbell reports .
Last night , I got an email out of the blue .
It was from Chris Munns , sysadmin at Etsy , the home to a huge online community of people who make and sell things .
The email basically asked if there was any way that Etsy could help sponsor the SysAdmin Appreciation Day event !
Excellent .
The only question in my mind was , what kind of sponsorship would our event need ?
In the end , it winds up being a bunch of system administrators sitting around drinking , swapping war stories .
I told them as much , and Chris responded :
Hey Matt ,
Chad Dickerson who is the CTO here at Etsy was actually the one who wanted to us to help sponsor / participate .
We were wondering if maybe we could just throw some money in for drinks on behalf of Etsy ?
- Chris
Pick up some of the bar tab ?
Well , ok !
After some more discussion , we ’ve got it settled down , and I am happy to say that Etsy is contributing a very significant amount towards our bar tab tomorrow .
I ’m not going to say how much just yet , because I have n’t worked out how it ’s going to be handled , but I ’ll be surprised if anyone ends up paying for a drink themselves .
A huge ( ! ) thank you to Etsy !
And if you ’re wondering why a site largely dedicated to crafting cares this much about the community of System Administrators , you should read their blog , Code As Craft .
They believe strongly in Dev / Ops cooperation , and they spend a lot of time on that blog discussing their infrastructure .
If you ’re interested in Hadoop installations and continuous deployments , I recommend you check it out .
If you were holding back because you did n’t want to spend the dough on drinks , then do n’t be afraid any longer .
Check out the event page , then register !

The description of my wedding in this comic is alarmingly accurate .
In fact , the only untrue thing in it is the idea that I call my mouth the " wisdom hole . "
I did n't have room in the word balloon for " wisdom aperture . "
Having a source control tip that always compiles is one of those software truths that I thought was self - evident , but today was reminded that it ’s not self - evident for everyone .
I was ready to check an important change , and as per our process , updated to the latest to make sure everything still worked before checking in .
As it turns out , the guys one floor up were not so courteous .
The build was broken in several places .
It took a few minutes to determine the offender , and I shot him a quick email in case he was n’t aware of the issue .
“ Sorry for the inconvenience , ” came the reply .
“ We ’re not done checking it in yet . ”
Multiple people coordinating check ins can be complicated , so I gave them another hour .
Still did n’t compile , but for slightly different reasons .
I then had a four hour training class .
I came back from that expecting to be able to check in before I went home , and they had made progress but the build still did n’t compile .
At this point it was clear this was n’t just a matter of coordinating check ins .
They were using the main branch the entire building shares to integrate and debug their changes with each other .
In case it ’s not clear by now why that is bad , we will probably not have a working daily build tomorrow .
If we do have a daily build tomorrow , a lot of important changes will not have made it in .
Everyone ’s testing will be set back by a day because a small group thought they would save a little effort by circumventing the process .
Early in the development cycle , this might not be a big deal , but we are very close to release .
If there ’s one thing I ’ve learned about software , it ’s that integration and debug time is hard to predict .
Do n’t ever think “ just this once ” you ’ll check in something broken because you “ know ” it will only take a few minutes to fix .
Dealing with accidental breakage is difficult enough .
Having an unusable repository for 6 hours cannot be classified as an “ inconvenience . ”
On the other hand , it ’s difficult to blame them for being tempted , given the source control tool we ’re using .
We ’re evaluating alternatives , but in the mean time are stuck with what we ’ve got .
Take a look at the following characteristics of our version control process .
If they look familiar , you might want to consider a version control change of your own .
Merging is difficult , so we have one big branch that everyone checks in to .
We have rules like do n’t check in things that do n’t compile , but no technological way to ensure they are followed .
We can either push our code to everyone in the building or no one .
There is no in between without a lot of manual work .
We can check in even if our local copy is n’t updated to the latest .
We have no easy way of cherry - picking only code that is known to work .
There is no easy way of collecting related changes , then committing them all to the main branch in one operation once they are integrated .
If that list sounds familiar , and you have n’t looked at distributed version control yet , now is a good time to do so .
At this point , we are simply struggling to maintain what I consider a bare minimum standard of having a tip that always compiles error free .
I have n’t even touched on the ideal of having a tip that always passes a test suite .
If your tests are automatable , your tools should be able to be set up to automatically reject changes that cause it to fail , same as a bad compile .
If , like us , circumstances necessitate tests being run manually by a human , distributed version control can help with that too , with the right branching model .
More on that later .

A whip cracks because when it is " whipped " properly , the end of the whip actually breaks the sound barrier .
By swinging the whip back and then jerking it forward in a properly timed motion , the end , which is moving rapidly backward , is forced to very quickly change direction and go forward .
It is at this transition that , if the motion of the individual wielding the whip is adequate , the end reverses direction so quickly that it breaks the sound barrier and the crack ! of the whip is heard .
Universities Required to Fight Student Piracy
By : Chris Tribbey | Posted : 07 Jul 2010
Universities nationwide that receive Title IV funding from the federal government are now required to actively help prevent illegal downloads and file sharing among students , thanks to a provision in the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act ( HEOA ) .
By July of this year , the Act required that universities “ to the extent practicable , offer alternatives to illegal downloading or peer - to - peer distribution of intellectual property . ”
Universities had to develop plans to “ effectively combat the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material ” and “ offer alternatives to illegal downloading or peer - to - peer distribution of intellectual property . ”
The Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) have long been fighting to keep piracy at bay on university campuses .
In 2006 the two groups fired off letters to 40 universities , demanding they take actions to prevent rampant piracy using the universities ’ local networks .
In late June the RIAA said that in less than two years , it has sent infringement warnings to more than 269,000 students in the United States .
In coordination with American Council on Education , the RIAA has launched a website , CampusDownloading.com , giving universities orientation materials to help educate students about copyright laws .
“ It ’s the first time ever in the history of dealing with the issue [ of piracy ] that Congress is holding schools accountable and requiring them to address the problem , ” said Cary Sherman , general counsel for the RIAA .
“ Many schools have already taken necessary steps to deal with the issue , with great success and who deserve real credit .
But there are some universities who are reluctant and perhaps prefer to remain on the sidelines without actually doing anything to proactively confront the piracy situation on their campus . ”
The MPAA notes in a statement that universities and colleges are required to offer alternatives to illegal downloading , such as access to iTunes .
“ Upon request , an institution must include information regarding institutional policies and sanctions related to copyright infringement to prospective and enrolled students , ” the organization said .
“ This information must explicitly inform students of the civil and criminal liabilities and disciplinary action risked in engaging in the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials , including peer - to - peer file sharing , with a summary of penalties for the violation of federal copyright laws . ”
In the wake of the passing of HEOA , The Campus Computing Project did a study on the potential costs to colleges and universities to be in compliance with the provisions .
Using data from more than 320 colleges and universities nationwide , the 2008 study found each institution of higher learning spent between $ 350,000 and $ 500,000 a year to try to prevent piracy .
Each university has taken a different tactic to comply with the requirements , but most have a common theme : software on local networks identifies when peer - to - peer software is used , or illegal downloading takes place , and offending students are often warned before serious action is taken .
At The Ohio State University , the school denies Internet access to students who violate copyrights , and threatens disciplinary action both inside the university ’s Office of Student Judicial Affairs and outside the university .
“ Copying material in digitized form is easy to do , but that does n't make it legal , ” the university warns students on its website .
“ Avoid the temptation to reproduce copyrighted material in any form and on any media , unless you have explicit permission to do so . ”
Some states handled the new requirements via their education commissions , rather than let universities work it out themselves .
For example Tennessee in 2009 required all its universities to report on how they were fighting piracy , The Tennessean reported .
The paper reported that at Middle Tennessee State University , the school ’s network was reworked to detect whether students were running peer - to - peer programs and kicked students off the network when those programs were found .
Al Qaeda may be producing a new English - language magazine intended to lure recruits – a glossy online product that might be described as a mix of “ Jihadists Illustrated ” and “ Popular Jihad Science . ”
It is called Inspire , and it features articles such as “ What to Expect in Jihad ” and “ How to Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom , ” according to pages posted on the website of the Atlantic Monthly .
Is it for real ?
Some experts are wary , considering that the online magazine does not yet appear on actual jihadist websites .
But Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has been talking about the publication in its own communications , noting that it was coming , according to the Atlantic post .
The article titles might seem perilously close to ones that could be thought up by the satirical publication The Onion .
But an attempt at English - language outreach such as this would fit in with the evolving nature of Al Qaeda ’s use of the Internet .
For many years , Al Qaeda central leaders have been a bit behind the curve in their use of advanced technology , according to a recent report by Daniel Kimmage , an independent consultant and a senior fellow at the Homeland Security Policy Institute at George Washington University .
While Osama bin Laden and others early on recognized the power of Web - based distribution of audio and videotapes , their communication strategy has remained static .
“ The group has largely stuck with its traditional forum - based media distribution strategy and has done little to alter its core message to respond to shifts in public opinion , ” writes Kimmage .
But while Al Qaeda central may be stuck on Web 1.0 , associated groups appear to have forged ahead into more modern and interactive communication techniques , according to an article in the most recent issue of a counterterrorism journal produced by the Combating Terrorism Center ( CTC ) at the US Military Academy at West Point .
The growth in Web 2.0 tools such as file - sharing portals and social networking sites has resulted in an explosion of user - generated jihadist content outside the usual sites .
Rising stars in the jihadist movement , such as the American - born cleric Anwar al - Awlaki , have celebrated this development and urged followers to engage in more active and creative ways of spreading the word .
“ As a result of these varying legitimizing mechanisms , the ‘ media jihad ’ has gradually gained respectability and has become a legitimate endeavor in itself , ” notes the article in the CTC journal Sentinel , which was written by British jihadist expert Dr. Akil Awan .
The new English - language Al Qaeda magazine has on its cover a quote from Anwar al - Awlaki : “ May Our Souls Be Sacrificed for You ! ”
Web 2.0 media outreach has helped rejuvenate jihadist ideology and spread the word to possible new recruits all around the world , notes Dr. Awan .
But the downside for Al Qaeda is that radicalized Muslims may be able to satisfy their desire to engage in jihad by reading about it , instead of actually travelling to Pakistan for training – in much the same way that people read travel magazines for a few minutes of escape , though they have no intention of traveling to Bali or Bahrain .

If the Environmental Protection Agency had hoped that the hundreds of landowners , students , community activists , environmentalists , and oil and gas representatives invited to a hotel ballroom in southwestern Pennsylvania on Thursday night would really stay on point , they were surely disappointed .
The aim of the meeting , which drew well over 1,000 attendees , was to solicit advice from stakeholders on how E.P.A. should focus and design a study of the impact of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater .
The agency ’s regional administrator instructed the crowd at the outset that the meeting was not to become a debate on the merits of the practice , which involves injecting a high - pressure cocktail of water , sand and chemicals deep underground to crack the rock and release natural gas deposits .
Much advice was offered , and E.P.A. scientists and regulators took copious notes .
Industry supporters , too , were on hand to urge that science trump emotion in any analysis and to point out that hydraulic fracturing has never been definitively linked to groundwater contamination .
But a vast majority of the more than 100 speakers used their two - minute turns at the microphone to unleash furious recriminations at the gas industry , hydraulic fracturing , and state and federal regulators for negligence in allowing it to continue .
One resident called the E.P.A. ’s pending analysis the equivalent of studying the flammability of Rome while the city was burning , while others offered a litany of personal experiences with ponds , streams and wells — all contaminated , they believe , by nearby natural gas fracking fluids .
“ Corporations have no conscience , ” said Dencil Backus , a resident of Mount Pleasant Township in Pennsylvania .
“ E.P.A. must give them that conscience . ”
Hydraulic fracturing has been practiced in Pennsylvania and around the country for decades .
The gas industry insists that no clear evidence has ever surfaced linking the fluids they use to crack open gas deposits to contamination of drinking water or any other systemic environmental problems .
The E.P.A. ’s study — which is just getting started and is expected to be completed in early 2012 — aims to explore the connection further .
Pennsylvania is among several Northeastern states where the natural gas industry is priming for a boom .
An industry - sponsored and financed study released this week suggested that the gas play known as the Marcellus Shale could generate some $ 6 billion in government revenue and create up to 280,000 jobs .
But with oil still washing up on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico , many residents were witheringly skeptical of drillers in general .
“ If you believe the industry line , it ’s all coincidental and it ’s not their fault , ” Mel Packer , a member of Pennsylvania ’s Green Party and a congressional hopeful , said of the dozens of personal stories from landowners complaining of water contamination from nearby gas wells .
“ I recognize a scam when I hear one . ”
Whether the opprobrium is justified or misplaced remains a matter of debate , particularly among those seeking to nudge the nation toward cleaner sources of energy .
Many experts consider natural gas , which burns more cleanly than coal or oil , to be a crucial bridging fuel in that process .
“ Natural gas has played and will continue to play an important role in our energy portfolio as we transition to a new energy future , and we are fortunate to have domestic resources to help meet our growing needs , ” Senator Bob Casey , a Pennsylvania Democrat , said in a prepared statement delivered to the assembly .
“ But I believe it is important to protect the health and safety of Pennsylvanians as we further develop the Marcellus Shale . ”
For a few millionths of a second after the Big Bang , the universe consisted of a hot soup of elementary particles called quarks and gluons .
A few microseconds later , those particles began cooling to form protons and neutrons , the building blocks of matter .
Over the past decade , physicists around the world have been trying to re-create that soup , known as quark - gluon plasma ( QGP ) , by slamming together nuclei of atoms with enough energy to produce trillion - degree temperatures .
“ If you ’re interested in the properties of the microseconds - old universe , the best way to study it is not by building a telescope , it ’s by building an accelerator , ” says Krishna Rajagopal , an MIT theoretical physicist who studies QGP .
Quarks and gluons , though they make up protons and neutrons , behave very differently from those heavier particles .
Their interactions are governed by a theory known as quantum chromodynamics , developed in part by MIT professors Jerome Friedman and Frank Wilczek , who both won Nobel prizes for their work .
However , the actual behavior of quarks and gluons is difficult to study because they are confined within heavier particles .
The only place in the universe where QGP exists is inside high - speed accelerators , for the briefest flashes of time .
In 2005 , scientists at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory reported creating QGP by smashing gold atoms together at nearly the speed of light .
These collisions can produce temperatures up to 4 trillion degrees — 250,000 times warmer than the sun ’s interior and hot enough to melt protons and neutrons into quarks and gluons .
The resulting super - hot , super - dense blob of matter , about a trillionth of a centimeter across , could give scientists new insights into the properties of the very early universe .
So far , they have already made the surprising discovery that QGP is a nearly frictionless liquid , not the gas that physicists had expected .
By doing higher - energy collisions , scientists now hope to find out more about the properties of quark gluon plasma and whether it becomes gas - like at higher temperatures .
They also want to delve further into the very surprising similarities that have been seen between QGP and ultracold gases ( near absolute zero ) that MIT ’s Martin Zwierlein and others have created in the laboratory .
Both substances are nearly frictionless , and theoretical physicists suspect that string theory may explain both phenomena , says Rajagopal .
At the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva , MIT faculty Gunther Roland , Wit Busza and Boleslaw Wyslouch are among the physicists planning to double the temperature achieved at Brookhaven , offering a glimpse of an even - earlier stage of the universe ’s formation .
C’était il y a sept ans , dans l’une des suites du Domina Plaza , une résidence hôtelière du centre de Vilnius , en Lituanie .
Dans la nuit du 26 au 27 juillet 2003 , après une soirée passablement arrosée , Bertrand Cantat , le chanteur de Noir Désir , avait assené quatre gifles d’une rare violence à Marie Trintignant , la comédienne dont il était devenu éperdument amoureux quelques mois plus tôt .
Pour elle , le rocker avait quitté sa femme , Kristina Rady , et ses deux enfants en bas âge .
Ce soir - là , le chanteur n’avait pas supporté qu’elle reçoive un SMS affectueux de son ancien compagnon , le réalisateur et auteur de pièces de théâtre Samuel Benchetrit .
N’obtenant pas d’explication de sa part , il n’avait pu contenir sa rage et l’avait frappée .
Il la croyait endormie .
Mais la comédienne était tombée dans un coma irréversible .
Rapatriée en France , elle mourra quatre jours plus tard dans le service du célèbre docteur Delajoux à Paris .
Un homme libre
Condamné à huit ans de prison par la justice lituanienne pour « meurtre commis en cas d’intention indirecte indéterminée » , Bertrand Cantat finira de purger sa peine cette semaine , le jeudi 29 juillet .
Sept ans jour pour jour après avoir été écroué dans la vieille prison de Vilnius qu’il quittera peu après son procès pour rejoindre le centre de détention de Muret .
Désormais , il n’aura plus à respecter les obligations imposées dans le cadre de la libération conditionnelle dont il avait bénéficié en octobre 2007 .
Le chanteur était tenu de répondre aux convocations du juge de l’application des peines et du travailleur social qui le suivaient .
Mais aussi les prévenir de ses déplacements , ne pas quitter le territoire français et poursuivre une psychothérapie .
Irréprochable pendant ses quatre ans de détention , Bertrand Cantat l’a été tout autant dans le respect de son contrôle judiciaire qui lui interdisait d’évoquer publiquement le drame .
Ayant recouvré la plénitude de ses droits , le chanteur de Noir Désir est redevenu un homme libre d’aller et venir et de s’exprimer .
Sans Kristina
« Sans elle , il ne serait pas vivant .
»
Dans une interview poignante publiée par le dernier « Journal du dimanche » , Ferenc et Csilla Rady rappellent avec des mots douloureux ce que Bertrand Cantat doit à leur fille , Kristina , qui a mis fin à ses jours au mois de janvier dernier .
Elle l’avait accompagné en France après l’avoir rencontré en Hongrie , en 1993 , lors d’un festival .
Pendant le procès de Vilnius , harcelée par Me Kiejman , l’avocat de la famille Trintignant , Kristina Rady avait été exceptionnelle dans l’adversité .
Balayant sarcasmes et sous - entendus , elle avait pris sans faiblir la défense du père de ses enfants .
Sa parole n’appelait aucune réplique .
Dans les pires moments , elle ne l’avait jamais lâché .
Peu après sa sortie de prison , elle avait accepté qu’il réintègre le domicile conjugal dans le quartier Nansouty , à Bordeaux .
Les difficultés ne semblaient jamais doucher l’incroyable optimisme de cette femme polyglotte et cultivée .
Mais ce n’était qu’une façade .
Le drame de Vilnius était trop lourd à porter , les jours heureux impossibles à rattraper .
« L’histoire d’amour s’est transformée en cauchemar » , affirment ses parents au « Journal du dimanche » , en évoquant les menaces de mort que continuait à recevoir le couple .
La musique
Dévasté par ce cortège de deuils et de drames , seul à assumer désormais l’éducation de ses deux enfants , Bertrand Cantat essaie de faire face tant bien que mal .
Avec l’aide d’amis fidèles et le secours d’une passion restée intacte pour la musique .
« C’est toute sa vie » , résume l’un de ses proches .
Le guitariste Serge Teyssot - Gay poursuit sa carrière en solo , le batteur Denis Barthe et le bassiste Jean - Paul Roy tournent avec Les Hyènes .
Noir Désir est en sommeil mais n’a jamais été dissous .
Allergique aux médias , le groupe protège jalousement son intimité .
Nul ne sait si Bertrand Cantat a écrit des textes ou si des morceaux ont été enregistrés .
Le chanteur ne se désintéresse pas de la scène rock .
Lors des derniers mois , il a été aperçu lors des concerts de Gaëtan Roussel et du groupe Eiffel .
Il est question de sa participation à un disque hommage à Alain Bashung .
Le groupe mythique du rock français n’a pas perdu son public dans la nuit de Vilnius .
L’attente reste forte .
Les organisateurs du festival des Vieilles Charrues , qui vient de battre des records de fréquentation ( 240 000 entrées ) , rêveraient , paraît - il , de Noir Désir comme tête d’affiche l’an prochain pour son vingtième anniversaire !

AS DUSK descends on the Sinchon neighbourhood of Seoul , a wave of Saturday shoppers melts away into restaurants and bars .
But in a windowless room several floors above the throng , Ji Yu-tae is steeling himself for a very different night 's entertainment .
His only companions are a bottle of vitamin drink , cigarettes and a monitor displaying a scene from Aion , one of South Korea 's most popular online games .
When the hunger pangs become irresistible , he will click a box in the corner of his PC screen and order instant noodles .
By Monday morning , after two days of almost non -stop gaming , Ji will make his way to work , pale and sleep - deprived , but content that he has progressed in the virtual world that has been his second home for the past two years .
Hundreds of gamers compete in Seoul , South Korea , where 90 per cent of people have high - speed home internet .

Seated next to him among rows of screens at this ' ' PC bang ' ' , an internet cafe in the South Korean capital , are scores of fellow obsessives whose attachment to online gaming is fast becoming a problem in the world 's most advanced internet society .
According to the government , about 2 million South Koreans - nearly one in 10 online users - are addicted to the internet .
Many spend every waking moment immersed in role - playing games , in which players form alliances to guide their characters through mythical worlds , collecting extra powers and other items as they go .
'' I 've been playing this for about two years and wo n't stop until I get to the end , '' Ji , a 27 - year - old mobile content developer , says as beads of sweat form on his brow .
But he denies that he is addicted .
'' It 's my way of relieving stress .
I could drink or go to the cinema , but this is how I want to spend my spare time .
I do n't have a girlfriend , and I 'm not likely to meet one here . ''

Saving Lives with Skepticism
We skeptics talk about many different things .
Ghosts , psychics , intelligent design , cryptozoology , and dowsing are all frequent topics for our lectures and articles , but in most cases these are academic exercises .
It 's true that in some cases we might save someone pain and suffering , such as when people realize that the " psychic " who 's been taking their $ 100 a week really can't talk to the dead , or when someone takes our advice and does n't buy the $ 30,000 audio cables .
For matters of so - called " complementary and alternative medicine , " the stakes are higher and a skeptical viewpoint can actually save a life , as whatstheharm .
net shows in some detail .
But in the past year , we skeptics did something quite a bit more impressive .
We literally saved hundreds if not thousands of lives , and it all started at a meeting at JREF headquarters .
But actually that 's not true ... as with many things skeptical , it begins with Randi , tirelessly dogging promoters of " woo - woo . "
A search of Google shows us nearly 1500 references to the word dowsing on randi.org , and that does n't include the forum .
Randi and the challenge have been responsible for demonstrating over and over again that dowsing does not work .
It does n't work with forked willow branches , pendulums , and it still does n't work when batteries and ersatz electronic ciruits are added .
We 've seen this last form under the names " Quadrotracker , " " Sniffex , " and the later form of the Quadrotracker , " ADE 561 . "
It 's these " hi- tech " dowsers that turn a harmless delusion into a profitable and deadly deception .
At that staff meeting at the JREF , we learned that Randi had been invited to speak to a group of government and industry representatives at a major conference on IEDs , suicide bombers , and vehicle bomb detection .
He was asked to address divining devices and give some evidence for his claim that they are useless and dangerous .
Sadly , Randi was in the middle of an extensive course of chemotherapy and unable total travel .
After a brief discussion , it was decided that long - time friend and adviser to the JREF , Hal Bidlack would be asked to speak in Randi 's stead .
Hal is a retired Lt. Colonel from the USAF who taught for years at the Air Force Academy .
That , plus the addition of his strong science and military background ( Hal was on the National Security Council as an environmental science adviser to President Clinton , as well as a military advisor in the State Department ) made Hal the perfect choice for this event .
And indeed he was — the hosts of the conference ( The Departments of Homeland Security , Defense , and State ) " promoted " him from speaker to keynote .
After a talk at the conference , which featured a live demonstration of the Lectrasearch device that the JREF has in its cabinet of curiosities , Hal received a great response .
Followup came fast and furious .
The British Ministry of Defense contacted him for advice , and Hal put them in touch with Richard Wiseman .
A New York Times reporter based in Iraq heard about the event , and called Hal for an in - depth interview , quoting Hal extensively in his article .
Rachael Maddow read the article , and then reads Hal 's quotes on her show .
Katie Couric had Hal as an expert guest on the CBS Evening News , and even went so far as to label him as an unofficial spokesperson for the entire U.S. Military .
The Economist magazine will soon interview Hal for a future article .
You can see the progression here ... once someone got the word out , the media ate it up .
And the end result : the man responsible for the ADE 561 is arrested , export of the devices is prohibited , and militaries around the world stop using the device .
Sadly , the cost of this scam is already hundreds of millions of taxpayers dollars , and countless civilian and military lives .
Now , the makers of these devices are on the run , as this BBC article shows .
It 's too bad this headline did n't appear five years ago .
The point of me telling this story is that we , the skeptics , have the winning cards in our hand .
But life is like poker in this regard ... it 's not having the winning cards that matter — it 's how and when you play them .
In the case of deadly dowsing rods , the JREF had the right background and people to get the issue in front of the media .
This is important stuff , and there are times when we need to take it seriously .
P.S. I wish to also acknowledge Robert Park for his work on exposing these devices .
As his June 11 , 2010 missive shows , we have n't won the pot yet .
Last week the Federal Court found that the flute solo in Men At Work 's ' Down Under ' infringed the copyright of Larrikin Music Publishing , the current owners of the song ' Kookaburra Sits in the Old Gum Tree ' .
Blogs , letters to editors and Facebook sites are full of angry musicians and fans who feel that the ruling is wrong , and that the breach of copyright was insignificant if not non-existent .
One person who wants to make sure his position on the matter is clear is Warren Fahey , cultural historian , author , record producer , broadcaster and singer .
He founded Larrikin Music in 1975 , but sold it to the huge international publishing company Music Sales in 1988 , before they bought the rights to the children 's ditty .
He says the song has been parodied probably more times than any other song in Australia 's history , placing it in the public domain .
Despite international bans , more than 250,000 children fight as soldiers in 86 countries across the globe , almost half of them in Africa .
Two new studies explored how these children adjust after they return to their homes .
Key to successful adaptation , the studies found , was the characteristics of the communities to which the children returned .
In the first study , researchers found that former child soldiers from Sierra Leone who lived in communities in which they felt accepted were less depressed and more confident , and children who were able to stay in school showed more positive attitudes and behaviors .
However , these protective factors did n't fully counterbalance the war - related trauma the children experienced , a finding that has implications for public health .
In the second study , researchers found that the former child soldiers from Uganda who adapted the best were those who returned to less violent homes and communities .
These children also had fewer feelings of survivor guilt , less motivation to seek revenge , better socioeconomic situations , and more perceived spiritual support .
The studies appear in a special section on children and disaster in the July / August 2010 issue of the journal Child Development .
The first study took a longitudinal look at adjustment in former child solders involved in Sierra Leone 's bloody civil war .
Researchers focused on more than 150 children ages 10 to 18 , mostly male , following them over two years .
The research was carried out by a team based at Harvard University in collaboration with partners at the International Rescue Committee and the U.S. Agency for International Development .
During Sierra Leone 's 1991 - 2002 civil war , thousands of children , some as young as 7 , were conscripted into fighting forces and paramilitary groups , and as a result , witnessed executions , death squad killings , torture , detention , rape , and massacres of family members .
As the conflict ended , the young people were returned to civilian life .
This study , carried out in 2002 and 2004 , is the first of its kind to examine how these youths fared .

The researchers found that all of the former child soldiers were exposed to high levels of violence , such as massacres or village raids .
More than a third of the girls reported having been raped , and almost a quarter of both girls and boys reported having injured or killed someone .
Children who reported surviving rape or reported hurting or killing others showed higher levels of hostility , while those who survived rape demonstrated higher levels of hostility and anxiety over time compared to those who did n't experience these types of trauma .
This suggests that these categories of war trauma are highly toxic to children 's psychological and social adjustment .
The study also found that children who were abducted at younger ages were more likely to report symptoms of depression over time than those who were older .
" Witnessing general war violence , although very common , did n't have a strong effect on the children 's psychological and social adjustment over time , " according to Theresa Betancourt , assistant professor of child health and human rights at Harvard School of Public Health , who led the study .
" In contrast , the effects of experiencing rape and wounding or killing others were longer lasting . "
The authors recommend that particular attention be paid to war - affected children with an accumulation of toxic risk factors and few protective resources .
Social and mental health services for war - affected youths are severely limited in Sierra Leone today .
Without targeted attention to those showing continued need , the researchers point out , there may well be broader consequences for society as this generation enters adulthood -- including the inability to make the most of current investments in education and development activities .
" We have a long way to go before being able to fully mitigate the effects of particularly toxic stressors in the lives of children affected by war , " notes Betancourt .

In the second study on child soldiers in Child Development , researchers from the University of Hamburg in Germany looked at 330 former Ugandan child soldiers ages 11 to 17 .
Since the late 1980s in Northern Uganda , an estimated 25,000 children and adolescents have been forcefully recruited into the Lord 's Resistance Army .
This study was carried out in 2006 at a government boarding school designed to support war - traumatized children and at the same time attempt to identify risk and protective factors to better target supports .
On average , the children returned from the armed group after about 30 months ; the study was carried out 4 months after they arrived at the school .
According to the study , almost all of the children had been exposed to shooting and beatings by armed forces , more than half had killed someone , and more than a quarter had been raped .
The researchers found that a third of the children suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder , more than a third were depressed , and more than half had behavioral and emotional problems .
Older children had more mental health problems than younger children , the study found .
The study also found that almost 90 percent of the child soldiers continued to be exposed to violence once they returned home -- including caning , burning , being locked up , and being raped -- and two thirds of them suffered from significant mental health problems .
What helped foster the resilience of the one third of children who did n't have significant mental health problems ?
The researchers discovered it was the qualities of the child and the home environments to which they returned -- such as less exposure to domestic and community violence , better family socioeconomic situations , less motivation to seek revenge , and more perceived spiritual support .
In Uganda , where there is only one psychiatrist for every 1.3 million people , training mental health professionals and creating sustainable intervention programs are urgently needed , according to the researchers .
By identifying the factors that contribute to resilience in former child soldiers , this study can help those working with this population .
In this information vacuum it is easy to make wrong assumptions that lead to mistaken conclusions .
It can be made worse if you have some degree of technical knowledge and verbiage and use that to make a case for a scenario that does n’t pass muster with actual engineering analysis but sounds highly authoritative to many people , some TV commentators and various politicians .
First , I will say that in one area we are in complete agreement .
BP and the USCG have been less than forthcoming , and in doing so have hurt both themselves and the general public as all kinds of wild rumors and technical misinformation abound .
Some of this misinformation results in harm to individuals and businesses as people suffer increased stress and tourists cancel vacations .
In this post , I would like to respond to a long comment made by DougR a few days ago , that has received a lot of publicity .
This is a guest post from Oil Drum commenter shelburn , who is a retired manager for an offshore underwater service company .
Shelburn also wrote a previous guest post related to the oil spill .

What eventually will happen is that the blow out preventer will literally tip over
DougR has made a case that he expects the BOP to tip over .
He seems to base this on the following information .
1 – The well is leaking into the sediment below the mudline and that is undermining the foundation holding the BOP upright .
2 – In support of that theory he cites that BP cut off the broken riser to relieve pressure on the well .
3 – Currents are pushing on the BOP stack .
4 – He seems to believe the inclination or tilt of the BOP is increasing .
5 – The BOP , riser and well casing are eroding from the inside due to sand erosion further weakening the structure .
He weaves a visual picture of a 450 ton BOP waving around a hundred feet high supported by a thin piece of liner or well casing .
Given that description it is understandable that people will believe the BOP is in immediate danger of collapse .
Looking at this from an engineering view point and using real data instead of conjecture and hyperbole I come to a much different conclusion .
The BOP is not in danger of tipping over .
Let look at each of his points .
1 – His theory seems to be that the well is blowing out the side about 1,000 feet below the mudline .
I can understand , given the sparse and misleading information from BP and the USCG , how you could come to that conclusion .
But let ’s look at the actual make - up of the casing that supports the wellhead and the BOP .
Here is the data :
http://www.energy.gov/open/documents/3.1_Item_2_Macondo_Well_07_Jun_1900...
First a 36 ” casing , up to 2 ” thick was put down .
It extends from the mud line to 255 feet down , as tall as a 25 story building .
Next a 28 ” casing was run from the mudline to 1,150 feet down , almost the height of the Empire State building .
This was followed by a 22 ” casing from the mudline 2,870 feet down , twice as deep as the World Trade Center was high .
All three of these casings were completely cemented together and they form a very solid base which is what supports the BOP .
I wo n’t detail the casing string below the 22 ” but is in the above pdf .
It is hard to envision any way the well would be able to leak out in the sediment between the mudline and the end of the 22 ” casing which is over a half mile down and well into formations below the mudline .
At 1,000 feet there is a 1 ” thick pipe ( the 22 ” casing ) which is 100 % cemented to another thick pipe ( the 28 ” casing ) which in turn is 100 % cemented to the formation .
Not much of a leak path there .
The immediate ( first 1,000 feet ) of well structure that remains is now also undoubtedly compromised .
There is no evidence that the foundation holding the BOP is being undermined or the upper portion of the casing ( first 2,870 feet ) is damaged .
If you watch the leakage from under the LMRP cap you can see the oil and gas immediately start rising up at a pretty good velocity .
If there were any oil or gas leaks anywhere near the BOP it would be very obvious as the leaks would look very much like the leakage from the cap and they would be quite visible as they flowed up around the BOP .
There are also occasional video shots of the lower part of the BOP and there is no sign of any seabed disturbance or subsidence .
It looks pretty much like the earliest photos BP released .
The well pipes below the sea floor are broken and leaking
What may be helping to confuse the situation is that there are two more concentric “ pipes ” that run from the wellhead area down into the well .
A 16 ” casing string is suspended about 160 feet below the mudline and runs down to over a mile below the mudline .
This piece of casing is also sealed to the 22 ” casing and hangs down from there .
The “ annular ” space is inside the 16 ” casing between it and the liner .
A 9 - 7/8 ” liner was installed from the mudline to the bottom of the well .
This liner reduces down to 7 ” before it reaches the bottom .
It was through this liner that the well was expected to produce oil and gas .
The 16 ” casing has three rupture / burst disks subs installed and one of those is at about 980 feet down .
It was this “ disk ” that Admiral Allen was referring to when he said it “ failed ” .
This would indicate the “ well pipes below the sea floor are broken and leaking ” .
But a rupture of that disk does NOT leak directly into the mud .
It leaks inside the well casing .
The leak would have to migrate down to the bottom of the 18 ” casing - 3,902 feet below the mudline before it left the well .
I expect that BP thinks they may have underground blowout at that level , which would leak into another formation , not up to the surface unless the cement jobs at the 18 ” casing or the 22 ” casing were also bad and those were fully tested and used .
DougR also supports his theory of downhole leaks by stating :
80 Barrels per minute is over 200,000 gallons per hour , over 115,000 barrels per day ... did we seen an increase over and above what was already leaking out of 115 k bpd ?.... we did not ... it would have been a massive increase in order of multiples and this did not happen .
But three paragraphs above he contradicts himself stating :
Early that afternoon we saw a massive flow burst out of the riser " plume " area
and
Later on same day we saw a greatly increased flow out of the kink leaks
2 – DougR says BP cut off the riser to relieve the pressure but the timeline of the events indicates otherwise .
BP had released the design of the LMRP cap well before they started the Top Kill .
If BP had thought they had a leakage problem requiring a pressure reduction , they would never have attempted a top kill .
So the claim that they cut the riser to relieve the pressure does n’t fit the facts -- it fits the already announced plan to cut the riser and install the LMRP cap .
3 – There is very little current at 5,000 feet .
There may be other forces acting on the BOP , like gravity , but the currents are minimal .
It is easy to verify this just by watching the video of the oil leakage .
4 – DougR ’s claim is that the inclination of the BOP is increasing .
There is no evidence of this .
Early discussions on TOD when BP released the first pictures talked about the fact that the BOP to well head connection appeared bent and the BOP looked tilted .
The pictures at that time ( very bad quality ) seem to show a bend between the base of the wellhead and the bottom of the BOP .
I have n’t seen any evidence that this tilt has increased over time or that there is any less mud at the wellhead .
There is a good reason why the BOP wellhead connection could be bent and weakened .
For over a day the DWH was without power and the 50,000 ton rig was anchored to the wellhead .
The movements of the rig in the surface currents would have put a huge strain on the BOP stack .
Also , when the rig sank and the riser bent over it would also have put stress on the BOP .
But the riser does n’t weigh as much as most people would think as it has floatation on it .
It would be a reasonably easy exercise , if you have all the data , to calculate the force that bending the riser would impart to the BOP and the well head .
I ’m sure that BP did that calculation and it did n’t deter them from proceeding with the Top Kill .
The LMRP has a flexjoint where it connects to the BOP .
I believe that flexjoint is designed to tip up to 7.5 or 10 degrees .
Normally the LMRP is under some tension from the riser which tends to hold it straight .
Without this support from the riser it will always tip to one side .
So the LMRP will always have a substantial inclination , by design .
you may have noticed that some of the ROVs are using an inclinometer ... and inclinometer is an instrument that measures " Incline " or tilt .
The BOP is not supposed to be tilting ... and after the riser clip off operation it has begun to ...
The ROVs have been checking the bullseyes regularly , before and after the riser was cut .
The box that DougR thinks is an inclinometer is likely some other instrument , probably ultrasonic .
That would be backed up by another poster ’s observation that they had been cleaning the area where the box was being used .
They could be checking the wall thickness at that point or trying to determine fluid flow .
Both are more likely that an inclinometer reading .
5 - Erosion
I am convinced the erosion and compromising of the entire system is accelerating and attacking more key structural areas of the well , the blow out preventer and surrounding strata holding it all up and together .
I ‘m not sure if DougR is referring to internal pipeline erosion or external foundation erosion and I may be doing him a disservice but there has been enough other discussion about internal erosion to try to correct some misconceptions .
When we have been talking about erosion we are talking about small restrictions that have been eroded where the oil flow has to pass small spaces .
The most dramatic example was the increase in the leaks at the riser kink .
They started at almost nothing and grew dramatically over time .
A similar process was occurring inside the BOP .
There are a lot of variables that effect erosion but the biggest is velocity .
The only place that there is erosion in this well is where there are tight restrictions which have high velocity and large pressure reductions .
These seem to be inside the BOP and the riser kink when it was still there .
The original cross section of the leak path was probably less than 0.20 sq in .
With the very high velocity this restriction would have eroded very quickly .
The five fold increase in the flow estimate in the first few days of the spill would be consistent with this theory as is the continuing increase in flow estimates .
As the restriction enlarges the pressure drops and the erosion slows down .
This is also consistent with various pressure readings at the bottom of the BOP , dropping from the “ 8,000 to 9,000 psi ” to 4,400 psi on May 25 .
The velocity inside the casing , liner , body of the BOP and the riser is relatively low .
I doubt that it would be possible to detect the erosion on the casing or riser with the naked eye .
It would take years of flow before there would be enough structural damage from internal erosion to cause any problems .
This is especially true for vertical or near vertical piping .
In a horizontal pipe sediment can drop to the bottom and over time wear a groove on the bottom of the pipe , which is not the case here .
All of these things lead to only one place , a fully wide open well bore directly to the oil deposit ... after that , it goes into the realm of " the worst things you can think of "
The well may come completely apart as the inner liners fail .
There is still a very long drill string in the well , that could literally come flying out ... as I said ... all the worst things you can think of are a possibility , but the very least damaging outcome as bad as it is , is that we are stuck with a wide open gusher blowing out 150,000 barrels a day of raw oil or more .
This statement brings together all DougR ’s suppositions .
I ’m not sure if he is actually that frightened himself or if he just enjoys scaring others , but his conclusions come pretty close to fear mongering .
Besides painting a picture of a completely out of control blowout ( which is a true worst case ) , in his “ very least damaging outcome ” he pretty much doubles the amount of maximum flow that this well could produce according to analysis that has been presented on TOD by well experts .
Transparency Issues
If BP and the USG were more inclined to transparency , a lot of this aggravation could be avoided .
You will never convince the conspiracy theorists ; it is a life style they enjoy .
But the MSM would not be quite as far out there if they were presented factual information , even if they could n’t understand it .
Just doing a quick review of this long post I came up with this list of questions BP or the USG could answer that would indicate some transparency .
Have you found any seabed leaks of oil and gas ?
Edit – Evidently this was answered by USCG at a press conference with an emphatic “ No ” .
No seabed leak , no washing away of the well head foundation , no traction for the DougR theory .
Do you believe there are any leaks from the well into other formations ?
If so , which ones ?
Has the inclination of the BOP changed ?
By how much ?
Describe the “ disk failure ” at 1,000 feet .
Are you concerned about the structural integrity of the BOP ? , wellhead ? , the LMRP ? , the casing ?
Describe the formation levels .
What are the current pressure readings inside the BOP ? , the historical readings ?
Is there any indication of seabed movement at the base of the BOP ?
What are the ROVs doing when they are looking at the seabed ?
What is the little black box the ROVs place on the riser ?
I could go on for pages .
I understand that BP has legal reasons why they wo n’t comment on the flow rates or what happened to cause the blowout .
But there are reams of information that they could be providing the public .

As a landmark gay marriage bill hurtled toward an uncertain vote last year , New York ’s Democratic leaders scrambled to corral support .
Gov. David A. Paterson delivered impassioned speeches , Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand headlined a giant rally and City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn shuttled back and forth to Albany to lobby lawmakers .
But the state ’s most popular Democrat , Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo , was all but invisible .
He was asked by those pushing for the measure to call three wavering senators .
He never spoke with two of them , their aides said , and did not reach another until after the senator had voted  against the bill .
“ He left a message , ” said a spokesman for Senator Joseph P. Addabbo Jr. , a Democrat from Queens , who finally spoke with Mr. Cuomo after the vote .
In the end , none of the three senators supported the bill .
Mr. Cuomo , 52 , appears poised to succeed the most pro-gay rights governor the state has ever had , at a pivotal moment in the debate over same - sex marriage , and with gay men and lesbians exercising increasing influence within the state Democratic Party .
Blizzard is so close to launch date for ‘ StarCraft II ’ and yet somebody got their copy of Collector ’s Edition already .
The video captures a gamer opening a copy of the Collector ’s Edition of StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty and trying to install the game .
Sadly , Blizzard stop the person from installing and even has a message for the gamer :
Pretty clever .
Either way you get to see all the goodies that come with the Collector ’s Edition , plus remember you get a Thor mini pet and StarCraft and StarCraft : Brood War on a 2GB USB flash drive .
The game is schedule for July 27th , so while this gamer is enjoying all that extra stuff from the CE - he still has to wait like all of us to actually play the game .
No word if they will be bringing back the Beta and I wonder if there is any point if they bring it out for a week before launch .

At the close of 2007 , Jake Sigal had a choice to make .
He was a product manager at automotive supplier Delphi ’s consumer electronics group , which manufactured XM Satellite Radio portable players .
Then XM and Sirius Satellite Radio announced a merger and Sigal “ saw the writing on the wall . ”
“ I always wanted to start a business , ” says Sigal .
“ My background is in consumer electronics and there ’s not a lot of consumer products that are made here in Detroit , and I figured , hey , it ’s time to start my own company . ”
So , he took a buyout at Delphi and in January 2008 , in the guest bedroom of his home in suburban Ferndale , MI , Sigal launched what would become Livio Radio , a developer of standalone Internet radios .
His flagship products are two specially branded radios — one plays National Public Radio programs and the other plays Pandora , the personalized online radio service that announced yesterday it has hit the 60 - million - user mark .
Just a little more than two years later , Sigal has 10 employees , has moved the business out of his home and into an office down the street , and is the recipient of an investment from Beringea , one of Michigan ’s largest venture capital firms .
The secret , Sigal says , is really no secret at all .
It ’s just to focus on what customers tell you they want , rather than trying to create a need where none existed .
People want to listen to Internet radio without being tethered to their computers .
Livio provides that service .
“ We do n’t invent technologies here , ” Sigal says .
“ We only make the current technologies that people love more accessible . ”
Sigal is 28 years old , but looks even younger , with an athletic frame — he bikes to work every day — and a faux hawk hairstyle .
We sat down a few weeks ago in his office , along with a newly hired marketing person who comes to Livio straight from the Detroit Red Wings .
Up until now , though , Livio has not really needed any marketing help .
Even before the Beringea investment , word of the products has spread through customers and early media coverage that occurred kind of organically .
NPR approached Sigal at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2009 and asked if it was … Next Page »

Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood emerged victorious after an odd scuffle between his agency and an anti-government regulation lobbying group .
The Washington - based Seward Square Group circulated a memo this week , claiming that anti-distracted driving efforts are equivalent to “ a full - throttle assault on mobile technology , ” and that “ auto , tech , and insurance industries … have become collateral damage . ”
Not wasting any time , LaHood called a press conference to condemn Seward and defend his agency ’s crusade to cut down on distracted driving , which is the number one killer of teenagers and responsible for 1.6 million crashes each year .
“ Regardless of what a powerful lobbying group has to say , the simple fact is that texting and talking on cell phones behind the wheel is a deadly epidemic , ” LaHood wrote on his blog .
“ To suggest otherwise is to put your head in the sand .
To spend considerable resources to suggest otherwise is a glaring waste . ”
In its original memo , Seward also warned that distracted driving regulation could face the same fate of seat belt laws and enforcement of drunk driving laws .
LaHood responded that this is the goal , and it would save lives .
Soon after LaHood ’s strong denunciation of Seward , the group withdrew its criticisms , saying that the media dust up was the result of a miscommunication .
“ We are pleased that the concept has met its goal of expanding dialogue on distracted driving , therefore the proposed coalition is no longer being pursued , ” said a spokesman for the short - lived coalition .
“ We commend Secretary LaHood for his leadership in bringing a comprehensive view to this complex issue . ”
With new states continually implementing laws against distracted driving , it ’s clear that public awareness is moving toward acceptance of more regulation on the local and national level .
But , as proven by this most recent scuffle , opponents to the safety movement are out there , attempting to derail the process .
That ’s part of the reason why a nationwide distracted driving ban has stalled in Congress .
But regardless of the deep pockets of any lobbying group , the statistics remain on LaHood ’s side , and we ’re likely to see more and more regulations on driving while typing , talking , or texting .
If you are worried about your child texting behind the wheel , consider downloading the GJEL Accident Attorneys ’ Parent - Teen Safe Driving Contract to set ground rules for driving and determine rewards for responsible behavior .

( CNN ) -- Government scientists
Tuesday increased the estimate of oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico to between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day , up to 50 percent more than previously estimated .
That translates into 1.5 million gallons to 2.5 million gallons per day .
The government 's previous estimate , issued last week , was 20,000 to 40,000 barrels per day .
The change was " based on updated information and scientific assessments , " and was reached by Secretary of Energy Steven Chu , Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar , and Chair of the National Incident Command 's Flow Rate Technical Group Marcia McNutt , the Deepwater Horizon Incident Joint Information Center said .
" The improved estimate is based on more and better data that is now available and that helps increase the scientific confidence in the accuracy of the estimate , " it said .
Full coverage of Gulf oil disaster
Alberto Alisedo , a member of the flow rate technical group , said scientists reached the consensus after a three - hour conference call on Monday and a 10 - hour meeting on Sunday of the group in Seattle , Washington .
" Our response to the spill is not determined by flow rate estimates , " said BP spokesman Toby Odone .
" Our primary concern is to capture as much oil as possible .
We are building options to contain higher volumes of oil . "
He called measurement of the flow rate " extremely challenging , " given the fact that the leak is a mile below the surface of the water .
Tuesday night , President Obama used his first Oval Office address to the nation to say 90 percent of the oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico will be captured within weeks .
Read full transcript of Obama 's speech
" Already , this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced .
And unlike an earthquake or a hurricane , it 's not a single event that does its damage in a matter of minutes or days , " the president told the nation .
" The millions of gallons of oil that have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico are more like an epidemic , one that we will be fighting for months and even years . "
In an attempt to counter complaints of a sluggish government response to the oil disaster , Obama noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil .
" From the very beginning of this crisis , the federal government has been in charge of the largest environmental cleanup effort in our nation 's history , an effort led by Adm .
Thad Allen , who has almost 40 years of experience responding to disasters , " Obama said .
BP spokesman John Curry said the analysis of the increased oil - flow estimate included data provided by BP .
First oil - flow estimate was 1,000 barrels a day
" We want what everyone wants , " he said .
" We want to do whatever we can to capture all the oil we can to minimize the impact . "
BP is working to contain more of the leak at the sea floor : the Lower Marine Riser Package cap now in place can capture as many as 18,000 barrels of oil per day .
A second containment option could expand that capacity to 20,000 - 28,000 barrels per day , the information center said , and BP said Tuesday its response " is not determined by flow rate estimates . "
" Our primary concern is to capture as much oil as possible , " BP spokesman Toby Odone told CNN after the new estimates were published .
" We are building options to contain higher volumes of oil . "
Tuesday 's increased oil - flow estimate brought together the work of several scientific teams and was based on a combination of analyses of high - resolution videos , acoustic technologies , and measurements of oil and pressure measurements inside the top hat .
Track the oil spill day by day
" We need to have accurate and scientifically grounded oil flow rate information both for the purposes of the response and recovery and for the final investigation of the failure of the blowout preventer and the resulting spill , " Salazar said
Meanwhile , government negotiations with BP are continuing on a BP - funded escrow account to pay for oil - spill damage claims , with a main sticking point being whether workers who lose their jobs due to the government 's six - month moratorium on offshore drilling could file for damages , two senior administration officials said Tuesday .
Lawmakers hammered oil companies Tuesday as Obama toured the Florida coast to reassure Americans that the government had firm command over the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico .
" This is an unprecedented environmental disaster , " he told a crowd of soldiers , Marines and sailors at Pensacola Naval Air Station .
" This is an assault in our nation 's shore , and we 're going to fight back with everything we 've got . "
Obama meets Wednesday with the chairman of oil giant BP , which owns the broken well at the bottom of the Gulf , and the president made clear he expects BP to pay all clean - up costs and damages from the massive leak .
BP announced Tuesday that it accelerated commercial large - loss claims and has approved 337 checks for $ 16 million to businesses that have filed claims in excess of $ 5,000 .
Initial payments began over the weekend and will be completed this week , the British energy giant said .
In Washington , senior Democrats launched a blistering attack on oil companies at a key House subcommittee hearing .
Congress holds BP 's feet to the fire
Rep. Henry Waxman , D - California , said that four of the five largest oil firms have produced disaster response plans that discuss how to protect walruses , even though there are no walruses in the Gulf .
These are " cookie - cutter plans " that , in reality , are little more than " just paper exercises , " he said .
Rep . Ed Markey , D - Massachusetts , blasted the heads of ExxonMobil , Chevron , ConocoPhillips , BP , and Shell Oil for producing disaster response plans that are " virtually identical . "
Health threats from the Gulf oil disaster could last for years , and officials lack knowledge on how long chemicals in the spilled oil and dispersants will remain toxic , a health expert told a Senate committee Tuesday .
What 's the condition of Gulf seafood ?
A Food and Drug Administration official told a Senate committee Tuesday that seafood from the Gulf of Mexico available to consumers in stores and restaurants is safe .
" We are confident that Gulf of Mexico seafood that is in the market today is safe to eat , " said Mike Taylor , deputy commissioner of the FDA .
Also Tuesday , twice suspended the operation to siphon oil from the ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico , once after a fire aboard a drill ship , the Deepwater Horizon Unified Command said on its website .
The fire Tuesday morning was likely caused by a lightning strike , and siphoning was suspended as a precaution , BP said .
There were no reported injuries .
Later Tuesday a faulty sensor led officials aboard the drill ship Discoverer Enterprise to halt collection of oil from the ruptured well into a containment vessel located a mile below , on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico .
Collection resumed after 30 minutes , the command said on its website .
The spill now dwarfs the 11 million gallons that were dumped into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground , and oil in varying amounts and consistencies has hit the shores of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida .
BP has been siphoning oil from a containment cap placed on the ruptured well but had to suspend oil collection Tuesday after a fire aboard the drilling ship Discover Enterprise .
i Report : Track the oil disaster .
Is the oil spill affecting you ?
A statement from the company attributed the fire to lightning .
It said operations would restart Tuesday afternoon .
Meanwhile Tuesday , federal authorities announced guidelines to speed up maritime waivers that would allow more foreign ships -- in addition to the 15 already in the Gulf of Mexico -- to assist in oil cleanup efforts .
" Should any waivers be needed , we are prepared to process them as quickly as possible to allow vital spill response activities being undertaken by foreign - flagged vessels to continue without delay , " said Allen .
CNN 's Dana Bash , Anderson Cooper and Ed Henry contributed to this report .
Sen .
Russ Feingold , in a close race , portrays himself as outsider
By Shailagh Murray
Add a new Democrat to the list of vulnerable incumbents : Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - Wis . ) .
As Republicans grow increasingly hopeful about knocking off the liberal lawmaker , Feingold released the first radio ad of his reelection campaign Tuesday , portraying himself as the same scrappy insurgent Wisconsin voters elected 18 years ago .
For months , political operatives have wondered whether Feingold would escape the wrath of an angry 2010 electorate that seems bent on running establishment figures out of office .
He still breaks from his party with irritating regularity , most recently by opposing a financial regulatory overhaul bill he deemed insufficiently tough .
Yet after three Senate terms , Feingold hardly fits the outsider bill , and that may be sinking in back home .
Feingold 's ad , entitled " Penny Pincher , " reminds voters of his roots as a common - sense reformer .
It portrays the senator as an " independent voice " who opposed the 2008 Wall Street bailout and has fought to eliminate automatic congressional pay raises .
" In Wisconsin , we do n't spend money we do n't have , " Feingold says in the ad .
A news release announcing the ad cites kudos from conservative groups that Feingold has earned over the years for seeking to ban earmarks and voting against pork - laden bills .
But the National Republican Senatorial Committee called the Feingold ad " desperate and misleading , " noting that the senator also supported the health - care bill and the economic stimulus package , both among the most costly legislative initiatives Congress has approved in recent years .
" This November , Wisconsinites will hold Feingold accountable for his disastrous economic record when they elect a fiscally responsible Republican to the U.S. Senate , " said Chris Bond , NRSC spokesman , in a statement .

Dani Pedrosa was fastest in opening practice at the Sachsenring , while Valentino Rossi commenced his comeback with seventh place .
Rossi's return was inevitably the main point of interest in the session , and he was on the pace from the outset , holding fourth initially , just a tenth off the early benchmarks set by Casey Stoner and Jorge Lorenzo .
Although Rossi did not join in the late quick runs and therefore fell to seventh , he still completed a highly encouraging 29 laps and was within 0.723 seconds of the pace .
At the front , the three leading teams all had spells on top , suggesting a very open weekend is in prospect .
In the end it came down to a head to head between Pedrosa ( Honda ) and Stoner ( Ducati ) , with the Spaniard moving 0.4s clear of the pack with 13 minutes to go .
Stoner closed in , but Pedrosa was able to go quicker again , ultimately setting three laps that would have stood as the best of the hour and ending on a 1m22.521s , 0.2s ahead of Stoner .
Both works Ducati were in the top three , with Nicky Hayden making a late jump to third .
Others to improve in the closing minutes were Tech 3 Yamaha 's Ben Spies and Gresini Honda 's Marco Simoncelli , who surged to fourth and fifth ahead of the two factory Yamahas .
Andrea Dovizioso missed the opening part of the session with mechanical problems on his Honda and was only 10th , behind Randy de Puniet ( LCR Honda ) and Marco Melandri ( Gresini Honda ) .
Both Pramac Ducatis and Hector Barbera 's Aspar example held top 10 positions for a while , but amid a flurry of quick times late on , all were pushed back to the midfield .
Although Alex de Angelis was slowest as he returned to MotoGP to deputise for the injured Hiroshi Aoyama at Interwetten Honda , he was only 1.580s off the pace in the tightly - packed field .
Pos Rider Team Time Gap 1 . Dani Pedrosa Honda 1m22.521s 2 . Casey Stoner Ducati 1m22.795s + 0.274s 3 . Nicky Hayden Ducati 1m22.983s + 0.462s 4 . Ben Spies Tech 3 Yamaha 1m23.189s + 0.668s 5 .

I read an interview with Gordon Lish on BOMBLOG and some of his answers made me mull .
But the only one that I remembered enough to try and reference in conversation a few days after reading his interview is Lish ’s take on what a writer tries to do with the opening sentence .
He says , “ Well the opening is to get the thing opened , to overcome the inertia of silence , indifference .
Whatever means convince you you have achieved this effect ordain what follows . ”
He then clarifies that by silence he means “ The silence that precedes the writer beginning to write , ” as opposed to the silence that precedes the reader beginning to read .
A little later , Lish gets giddy when asked about the FORWARD to his new book , COLLECTED FICTIONS .
He says , “ Wow , that bit , it ’s nuts !
What the deuce was I up to ?
Yet , let it not become hypertrophic in me , but I have been taken with the feeling that the preface discloses , however opaque , what ’s truest of me .
I produced it as fast as I could write it and concluded , queerly , I ’d stand by it no matter what .
Apart from its drift as reference , there ’s words in there I ’m not certain are to be found anywhere else . ”
And I grew curious about the FORWARD .
I wanted to read at least the FORWARD , if nothing else .
I found it online at OR BOOKS .
And then I did a little ctrl c + ctrl v for ease of passage :
FORWARD
By Gordon Lish
Fine , fine — now here ’s a trope for you .
To fetch groceries , to collect rations , to supply the place with vittles , unless it be deemed better spelt victuals , I do not have to but indeed do choose to make my arthritic , rachitic grudge down a steep hill and thereafter to groan my way back up the steepness steeper still , what remains of my proprium all the while suffering ever more keenly the impudent yearage step by hideous step , whereas , please be so good as to be listening to me , I could just as well carry out my commerce among the aisles of a spankingly swell food - o- rama no more distant from my door and , more ’s the madness , reachable via a byway latitudinous to a fault .
But I go down , down , down , up , up , up .
You hear ?
Now down , now up — to and from where the grisly shelves are stocked with little in the line of the recognizable , to and from where the ether within is never not vicious with infection and disinfectant , to and from where the personnel ( am I kidding ? — personnel , personnel ? ) would even on Easter sooner spit in your face than to face it in a faint - hearted experiment in decency .
Go know .
But look at me , look at me !
—I went and I went , dark purchases mounting against the load - bearing walls of my household trip upon ghastly trip .
So there for the nonce is the figure of the day , your author having hence satisfied himself of his having hinted at the amentia of what founded the variously deformed fundaments of the stories ( am I kidding ? — stories , stories ? ) all arranged for you in the very sequence of their sequentiality ahead .
I , I , I was the maker of them .
Once .
Long ago .
When the literateur ’s swindle was no less the rage .
So now to quit now .
Ah , but curse , curse the volition !— too much paid for the profit , too much told for the gain .

JOURNOLIST LUST
There ’s renewed hubbub over the mysterious “ JournoList , ” displayed in full plumage at the Daily Caller , providing more evidence that the hundreds of journalists and wonks who signed up with the online information and chitchat service were a vast left - wing conspiracy of sorts - a liberal cabal of those seeking to steer the proper White House message .
“ As a journalist , even an opinion journalist , the public places trust in you to say what you believe , not what you believe needs to be said to help your side .
The JournoList posts raise serious questions about whether a group of liberal journalists ditched their independence at key political moments , especially during the 2008 presidential campaign , ” Caller scribe Jonathan Strong tells Inside the Beltway .
Mr. Strong has written all week about JournoList records that confirm , among other things , that journalists from Time , Politico , the Huffington Post , the Baltimore Sun , the Guardian , Salon and the New Republic groused over press treatment of President Obama and in some cases “ plotted to fix the damage . ”
Getting hold of these records was a big “ get . ”
The membership list and its archives of e-mails were considered a Rosetta Stone by conservatives seeking to crack the liberal code .
Mr. Strong is mum about his source , though a computer whiz recently suggested to the Beltway that the much - coveted content was likely just “ a hack away . ”
It was worth serious money at one point .
BigHollywood.com founder Andrew Breitbart offered $ 100,000 to anyone who could produce the JournoList ; he formally rescinded his offer Monday after Mr. Strong ’s initial expose was published .
Collateral damage occurred , however .
The list ’s founder , Ezra Klein , has disbanded his creation .
And former Washington Post “ conservative ” blogger David Weigel resigned his post last month after he was outed as a JournoList member by Mr. Strong .
He has since joined MSNBC and has little to say about the newest Daily Caller revelations .
“ I joined in January 2009 and had n’t seen these e-mails , ” Mr. Weigel tells Beltway .
Mr. Strong ’s efforts won the approval of Sarah Palin , who noted Tuesday at her Facebook page , “ It ’s encouraging for commonsense conservatives who are frustrated with media cover-ups and biases to see truth revealed . ”
REGS RAGE
Along with bamboo from Burma , coal from Pakistan and granite from Nigeria , the Department of Labor ’s Executive Order 13126 on the Prohibition of Acquisition of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor , issued Tuesday , also prohibits federal agencies and their contractors from purchasing pornography from Russia .
That particular entry on the 29 - item list was characterized by the Moscow Times as a “ bizarre message ” to Russia from the Obama administration .
Both Russia and the U.S. are “ world leaders ” in producing child porn , children ’s “ ombudsman ” Pavel Astakhov told the paper .
VIDEOGATE
Sharp eyes are tracking the trajectory of video footage exposed by the aforementioned Andrew Breitbart that showcased racially tinged remarks made by Department of Agriculture official Shirley Sherrod during an NAACP banquet .
The story , says Media Research Center president L. Brent Bozell is in a holding pattern .
“ The liberal media are deliberately spiking the shocking video , ” he says .
“ We ’ve waited a full 24 hours to see if any coverage of this expose would surface .
So far , nothing but crickets .
The ABC , CBS and NBC evening and morning ‘ news ’ shows all failed to even mention the damning video admission . ”
The same networks , Mr. Bozell continues , gave much coverage to NAACP charges that “ tea parties ” were guilty of racism .
“ The thoroughly untrue accusation against the tea parties has been propped up and propelled by the incessant reporting of these same networks , ” he says .
“ The only thing more newsworthy than the charges of racism are the hypocritical charges of racism . ”
The video did get play on Fox News and later on CNN .
In the aftermath , Ms. Sherrod told CNN that the White House had forced her to resign from her post , noting , “ For some reason , the stuff Fox and the ‘ tea party ’ does is scaring the administration . ”
Mr. Breitbart also had much to say .
“ This was not about Shirley Sherrod .
This was about the NAACP attacking the tea party , and this is showing racism at an NAACP event .
I did not ask for Shirley Sherrod to be fired .
I did not ask for any repercussions for Shirley Sherrod , ” he told CNN .
“ They were the ones that took the initiative to get rid of her .
I think she should have the right to defend herself . ”
TRUTHINESS
Approaching practical application , perhaps : functional magnetic resonance imaging , or fMRI , used as a lie detector to measure the brain ’s devious “ deception centers . ”
Two companies , Cephos and No Lie MRI , are marketing such services to lawyers , government agencies , law enforcement and corporations seeking to get at the , uh , truth - or at least conduct tidy security clearances .
“ Truth is a valuable commodity , ” Cephos notes .
MORE TRUTHINESS

After being asked by Jake Tapper why President Obama is bringing up the issue of immigration reform now even though it does n't appear there 's any chance that something is going to get passed in the Senate , Al Hunt takes John McCain to task for his fear mongering interview earlier in the show where he lied about the crime rate in Arizona .
HUNT : I must say , John McCain , in his interview with you , Jake , that was extraordinary to say that crime is up there .
He 's talking about Mexico .
Crime is down in Arizona .
Every single academic study that 's been done shows that immigrants commit fewer crimes .
RAMOS : That 's right .
HUNT : We have a system where there are now three - and - a - half - fold more illegal immigrants than there were 20 years ago .
It 's a system that 's broke .
And for John McCain to say that there 's been a dramatic change just simply is not the case .
It 's too bad Al Hunt is the one bringing this up instead of Jake Tapper calling out McCain while he had him on the air .
“ I Wo n’t Rest Until Leak Is Stopped ”
The Vacationer in Chief … Barack Hussein Obama .
Like we were supposed to believe any words coming out of President Obama ’s mouth .
What an image of leadership this displays to the American people and especially those in the Gulf Coast region .
Obama claimed he would not rest or be satisfied , yet he will now have gone on three vacations since the outset of the BP oil disaster started .
One really has to ask them self whether this President really cares or gives a damn at all .
President Barack Hussein Obama and the first family will vacation in Maine at MDI and Acadia national Park .
This is the third vacation that Obama has been on since the BP oil spill began on April 20 , 2010 .
As the Gateway Pundit reminds us this is Day 81 and remember when on May 14 , 2010 Barack Obama said he would not rest or be satisfied until the leak is stopped at the source .
President Barack Obama and his family are scheduled to arrive Friday , July 16 , and stay through Sunday , July 18 .
“ I ’m not going to rest or be satisfied until the leak is stopped at the source , the oil in the Gulf is contained and cleaned up , and the people in the Gulf are able to go back to their lives and their livelihoods . ”
The Obama ’s visit is a personal family vacation and there are no public appearances scheduled .
His promise of not resting can be added to the pack of lies of transparency , Obamacare lowering health care costs and the deficit , unemployment staying below 8 % with the passage of the $ 787 billion stimulus package and he would create millions of jobs .
Most people in today ’s Obama economy cannot afford to take one vacation away with their families and this President now takes his third since the BP oil spill as Gulf Coast residents watch tar and oil float up on their beaches and vacation resort towns are paralyzed by the spill .
What a model of leadership you are and an image of empathy to the Gulf Coast Mr. President , NOT !
Hopefully your fun and frolic will not be lost on the voters of the Gulf Coast and America in 2010 and 2012 .
We 've seen a lot of interesting lego creations over the last couple years , but nothing like this .
Andrew Lipson and Daniel Shiu were inspired by Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher who is most famous for his so - called impossible structures .
“ I 'm very fond of Escher 's work , and I wondered for some time whether it would be possible to produce a plausible rendering of any of his pictures in LEGO bricks , ” says Lipson .
The piece above is a LEGO recreation of M.C. Escher 's Balcony .
The duo took 16 separate shots , zoomed in on distinct parts of the model , and glued them together as a mosaic panorama .
Relativity – “ Unlike many of Escher 's other ‘ impossible ' pictures ( like ‘ Ascending and Descending ' ) , there is actually no optical illusion involved here .
Gravity seems to be working in three different directions simultaneously , but the picture shows a perfectly self - consistent physical scene . ”
Waterfall – “ We actually resorted to photographic manipulation for this one .
We took two photographs of the model ; one with and one without these channels , but from the identical viewpoint .
The final image was constructed by very carefully overlaying portions of the left image with the corresponding portions from the right . ”
Belvedere – “ The domes on top , and the slightly protruding cell wall at the near end of the bottom level , were both interesting exercises in half - brick spacing – using full brick increments we just could n't get the resolution at this scale to get the domes to look at all rounded , but with half - brick increments it looks vaguely reasonable . ”
Ascending and Descending – “ The picture has to be taken from exactly the right place , and the final photograph was slightly distorted to emphasize the perspective effect . ”

Thousands of laptops have been stolen from the Florida office of a private contractor for the U.S. military ’s Special Operations Command .
Surveillance cameras caught up to seven people loading the computers into two trucks for nine hours .
U.S. Special Operations Command coordinates the activities of elite units from the Army , Navy , Air Force and Marines .
A spokeswoman said Tuesday that none of the stolen laptops contained military information or software .
The Virginia - based company iGov was awarded a $ 450 million contract earlier this year to supply mobile technology services linking special operations troops worldwide .
A company executive says iGov is cooperating with authorities and the March 6 break - in at its Tampa facility remains under investigation .

IF you were one of the few brave readers of printed books in 2007 who crossed the divide into digital reading , your options were sparse and expensive .
The original Amazon Kindle , for example , cost $ 400 , and its screen displayed a mere four shades of gray .
Today , digital readers are much cheaper and come with significantly better displays and storage space .
But things are just getting started  like the price war that erupted last week between Amazon and Barnes & Noble that pushed the prices of their e-books below $ 200 .
Those e-readers are also facing challenges from other gadgets that can display books , newspapers and magazines , including mobile phones and the new tablet computers like the iPad .
Apple said last week that it had sold 3 million iPads in 80 days .
“ The paper book is dead , ” says the digital visionary Nicholas Negroponte .
So what ’s next for these digital book replacements ?
Will the e-reader be reduced to a tiny chip that can be implanted in our retina by 2015 ?
Not quite , but those who think a lot about the future say e-readers are set to take on new shapes and sizes , and their prices will continue to fall .
Mr. Negroponte runs a nonprofit group that hopes to put inexpensive computers in the hands of millions of impoverished children around the globe .
Its efforts helped push the commercial development of the popular netbook , the cheap small laptop computers that have grown in popularity in the last few years .
He agreed that the price of e-readers eventually will fall to $ 50 and perhaps even $ 20 .
Confessed racist busted on Facebook : ‘ See you in church with my AK ’
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer 's office said late Wednesday that the state will file an expedited appeal with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday , asking the panel to lift the preliminary injunction preventing several sections of Arizona 's new immigration law from going into effect .
U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton 's ruling
Montini : War will go on | Roberts : History to judge
Arpaio ' wo n't put up with ' civil disobedience | More
A breakdown of the ruling | Gov. Brewer : ' Bump in the road '
Role of ICE | Law preview | Immigrants ' babies
The appeal will ask the court to lift the injunctions put in place by U.S. District Court Judge Susan Bolton earlier Wednesday and allow those provisions to go into effect until a decision is made on the merits of the law , Brewer spokesman Paul Senseman said .
As part of its motion , the Governor 's Office also will ask the 9th Circuit to expedite its briefing schedule and its ruling on the matter , Senseman said .
Senate Bill 1070 was passed by the Legislature and signed into law by Brewer in April .
It made it a state crime to be in the country illegally and stated that an officer engaged in a lawful stop , detention or arrest shall , when practicable , ask about a person 's legal status when reasonable suspicion exists that the person is in the U.S. illegally .
It also made it a state crime to stop a vehicle in the road to hire a day laborer if it impedes traffic as well as to transport , harbor , conceal or shield an illegal immigrant while committing a separate criminal offense .
Bolton 's ruling stops four of the law 's more than a dozen provisions from going into effect .
" The court also finds that the United States is likely to suffer irreparable harm if the court does not preliminarily enjoin enforcement of these sections , " she states in the ruling .
" The balance of equities tips in the United States ' favor considering the public interest . "
Key parts of SB 1070 that will not go into effect Thursday :
�� The portion of the law that requires an officer make a reasonable attempt to determine the immigration status of a person stopped , detained or arrested if there 's reasonable suspicion they 're in the country illegally .
�� The portion that creates a crime of failure to apply for or carry " alien - registration papers . "
�� The portion that allows for a warrantless arrest of a person where there is probable cause to believe they have committed a public offense that makes them removable from the United States .
� The portion that makes it a crime for illegal immigrants to solicit , apply for or perform work .
There are three parts to that part of the law .
Two of them will go into effect , one of them will not .
Bolton prevented from going into effect the part that creates a crime for an illegal immigrant to solicit , apply or perform work .
She allowed the part that makes it a crime to pick up a day laborer in a roadway if it impedes the flow of traffic as well as the part that makes it a crime to be picked up as a day laborer in a roadway if it impedes the flow of traffic .
The ruling also says that law enforcement still must enforce federal immigration laws to the fullest extent of the law when SB 1070 goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. Thursday .
Individuals will still be able to sue an agency if they adopt a policy that restricts such enforcement .
Bolton did not halt the part of the law that creates misdemeanors crimes for harboring and transporting illegal immigrants .
After the ruling came down , attorneys rushed to read the 36 pages and begin explaining to law enforcement what could still be enforced .
Brewer , in a phone interview from Tucson , said she was still being briefed on the order , but said , " I look at it as a little bump in the road . "
Brewer has not yet spoken with her attorneys in detail , but said she " would assume " that their next step would be appealing the injunction to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals .
" The fact of the matter is this is just an injunction , " Brewer said .
" We need to go through the court process so the merits of the bill can be debated .
I am sure as we go through the process , we 'll get a fair hearing . "
Bolton 's ruling followed hearings on three of seven federal lawsuits challenging SB 1070 .
Plaintiffs include the U.S. Department of Justice , the American Civil Liberties Union , Phoenix and Tucson police officers , municipalities , illegal immigrants and non-profit groups .
Today 's ruling is in the Department of Justice case .
Bolton has not yet issued rulings on motions in the case filed by Phoenix Police Officer David Salgado and the case filed by the ACLU and other civil - rights groups .
What the ruling means
Brewer had tasked the Arizona Police Officer Standards and Training board with creating a training video for law enforcement around the state to help them comply with the law .
Lyle Mann , the agency 's director , said Bolton 's decision raises more questions about what portions of the law , if any , police departments will be enforcing on Thursday .
" We will review in detail the injunction as issued to see what , if any , response we need to provide to agencies , " Mann said .
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said he was not surprised by Bolton 's ruling , but it will have little impact on his planned " crime - suppression " operation scheduled for Thursday .
" That 's not going to affect our human - smuggling or employer - sanction investigations , that was n't addressed in that law , " he said .
Arpaio said the only thing Bolton 's ruling changed is the ability for Arizona law enforcement to use a state charge - willful failure to carry documents - to book someone into jail .
Now , Arpaio said , the agencies can continue to contact Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to determine if federal agents will take custody of the suspect .
Everyone booked into Maricopa County Jail will continue to have their immigration status screened by federally trained sheriff 's deputies through an agreement with ICE .
Phoenix police legal advisors were busy combing through Bolton 's ruling to determine the impact .
The challenge , said Sgt. Tommy Thompson , will be determining what , exactly , that ruling means before 12:01 a.m .
Brewer gave AzPOST a month to develop the statewide training for law enforcement , and police across the state had a month to implement the training , which included a two - hour video and additional materials police departments used to supplement .
Legal advisors now have 14 hours to determine what Bolton 's ruling does to the last two months of preparation .
" We have to give our legal people time to review it , " Thompson said , adding that it is not unrealistic to expect officers to have some directive by Thursday morning .
" We are bound to enforce the law and that means that we enforce it correctly , " Thompson said .
" It 's certainly a challenge for us to meet that deadline , but it 's something that we will do our best to be ready to follow the guidelines laid out by the judge at this point . "
The Pinal County Sheriff 's Office also is waiting for a review .
" We have no reaction because we 're going to do business today , tomorrow the same as we did yesterday ...
If we come into contact with a load of what is obviously someone being smuggled , we 'll do what we do today :
We 'll call ICE or Border Patrol or a deputy who is ICE certified , " said Chief Deputy Steve Henry said .
Henry said he is waiting on an overview from the Pinal County Attorney 's Office as to what happened in court today and what it means with regard to SB 1070 implementation .
" In the meantime , we 're not even holding our breath , " Henry said .
" We 're just doing business .
We 're not in the business of racially profiling or arresting people on their skin color .
This is essentially a non event . "
However , Sheriff Paul Babeu was more vocal in his opposition to the ruling : " Incredibly , even though there is not one person who can legitimately claim to be harmed by a law that has not even taken effect , the result of an injunction is de facto amnesty through non-enforcement of laws against illegal immigration . "
The governor deferred answering specific questions about the impact of the ruling to her attorneys .
For example , Bolton let the part of SB 1070 that requires agencies to enforce federal immigration law to the fullest extent of the law to stand , but enjoined the part about allowing officers to question an individual 's legal status .
When asked how it would be possible to do one without the other , Brewer said her office would need to " confer with our lawyers to see how that would be enforced . "
" Those are legal questions that do have to be addressed , " said Brewer , who plans to be back in Phoenix by 3 p.m. , and hopes to meet with her attorneys at some point this afternoon .
The Arizona Supreme Court had prepared an administrative order as to how the courts would handle SB1070 cases that was supposed to be issued Wednesday morning .
Bolton 's ruling sent the high court scrambling to revise the order in light of the enjoined portions of the law .
Originally it called for a review hearing after 24 hours for those people who were being held in custody only because their immigration status had not yet been verified .
That issue became moot when the federal court order tabled that section of the law .
Instead , the Supreme Court ruled that the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency be notified when defendants are found to be unlawfully present in the United States .
And it codified a part of the law in which law enforcement officers apply to a judge to remove a suspect from the state , and rewrote the documents that law enforcement fills out for a defendant 's initial court appearance .
Stakeholders react
Brewer said Bolton 's order was not entirely a surprise , given some of the questions that the judge asked during last week 's court proceedings .
Sen .
Russell Pearce , a Mesa Republican and author of Senate Bill 1070 , downplayed the significance of the judge 's order Wednesday , noting that it was just a temporary injunction and that she allowed the portion of the bill that requires agencies to enforce federal immigration law to the fullest extent to remain in place .
" As of Thursday , the handcuffs come off of law enforcement , " Pearce said .
" This says clearly that we can enforce federal law and we can not be impeded .
" Pearce believes the case will ultimately make its way to the Supreme Court , and he predicted a win for Arizona .
" We will appeal this immediately and we will win on appeal , " he said .
" This will be to the Supreme Court eventually , and I expect a 5 - 4 decision in our favor , perhaps even 6 - 3 . "
Rep . John Kavanagh , one of the co-sponsors of the bill , had a less optimistic view of the ruling , calling Bolton 's ruling " very disappointing , " saying that she " went to the meat of the law . "
" The decision is very disappointing , " Kavanagh said .
" Those were major parts of the law that helped us battle illegal immigration .
I assume that we will immediately appeal to the 9th Circuit ( Court of Appeals ) . "
Kavanagh said that the state remained committed to defending the law and seeing it enacted .
" This is only the start of the legal battle . "
Brian Bergin , the attorney representing Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever as a defendant in one of the lawsuits , said he appreciated the fact that Bolton did n't prevent SB 1070 in its entirety from becoming law .
" But the court did enter an injunction prohibiting the enforcement of what we consider to be some of the act 's more important provisions , " he said .
Bolton has not yet issued an order in Dever 's case , but Bergin said he expects it to be similar to the one she has issued .
He said he still has to talk to Dever but he expects they would appeal .
Meanwhile , Hannah August , a Justice Department spokeswoman , said the administration believes Bolton 's decision to block key parts of SB 1070 was correct .
" While we understand the frustration of Arizonans with the broken immigration system , a patchwork of state and local policies would seriously disrupt federal immigration enforcement and would ultimately be counterproductive , " August said .
Matt Chandler , deputy press secretary with the Department of Homeland Security said Bolton 's decision " affirms the federal government 's responsibilities in enforcing our nation 's immigration laws . "
" Over the past 18 months , this administration has dedicated unprecedented resources to secure the border , and we will continue to work to take decisive action to disrupt criminal organizations and the networks they exploit . "
ACLU of Arizona Executive Director Alessandra Soler Meetze said she 's pleased with the judge 's decision .
" We think this is a major step that will protect the residents of Arizona against racial profiling and discrimination , " she said .
" But we still have some concerns about the remaining provisions , especially how the harboring provisions and the day laborer provisions may be misapplied by overzealous law enforcement . "
Shortly after the ruling , Attorney General Terry Goddard , who is the presumptive Democratic nominee for governor and Brewer 's anticipated general election opponent , accused her of using SB 1070 for political gain , tweeting " Brewer played politics with immigration - and she lost . "
Stephen Montoya , the attorney representing Phoenix police Officer David Salgado in the lawsuit he filed challenging SB 1070 , said he was gratified by Bolton 's ruling .
" We think she struck the heart out of 1070 , " Montoya said .
" We 're gratified but we 're not surprised . "
He said he expects the state to immediately file an appeal , and they will fight that .
Montoya said he hopes that Bolton 's ruling will bring a halt to the inflammatory rhetoric on all sides .
" I think the people who lost should n't feel like they completely lost because they do have an avenue of redress and that is the United States Congress , " he said .
" This debate is for the federal Congress , not for the state Legislature . "
Rafael Lim�n , head of the Sonora state government 's migrant affairs office in Nogales , said " It will give us a little rest , but it 's not time to celebrate yet . "
Lim�n 's office has been bracing for a wave of new deportees because of the law , he said .
The Sonoran government runs a clinic for deportees , gives them free telephone calls and pays half the cost of a bus ticket for out - of - state migrants who want to return home .
Sonoran officials are worried that a wave of deportees caused by SB1070 could lead to more crime in the state , L�mon said .
" That 's one of the fears , that we could see more social problems , " Lim�n said .
" With no money , some of those deportees may turn to crime . "
Planned protests
David Gonzales , U.S. Marshal in Arizona , whose agency is charged with security at the federal courthouse in downtown Phoenix , said the building was closed to the public except for those who have business there .
Gonzales said there was some concern about protesters in the wake of Bolton 's ruling .
" When you have situations like this , emotions are running high on both ends , " Gonzales said .
" So the potential for violence is high . "
A spokeswoman for Puente , one of the groups that have been organizing against the law , said the group does n't view the partial injunction as a victory and believes the entire law should have been stopped .
" There is still a lot to be dealt with , " said Opal Tometi , a spokeswoman for the group .
" This decision does n't get at the root of the issue or get at the concerns of the people affected . "
Tometi said the group is planning on going ahead with Thursday 's scheduled protest .
Community activist Salvador Reza said at an afternoon news conference that the community would not rest because of the injunction .
" We will continue our struggle , we will continue our vigilance and we will continue our civil disobedience . "
Those words were echoed by Pablo Alvarado , of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network , said " SB 1070 is on life support , but it 's still alive . "
Republic reporters Dan Nowicki , Erin Kelly , Kevin Kiley , Michael Kiefer , Lindsey Collom , Chris Hawley and Casey Newton contributed to this report .
We 've heard from many people who have been distressed to learn that their identity is being sought by the US Copyright Group , which purportedly represents various independent filmmakers , for allegedly having downloaded a movie such as " Far Cry " over BitTorrent .

People no longer live one life , but many .
Physical .
On -line .
With whom are we really communicating ?
You may think that this is a silly topic , if you ’re someone who has n’t grown up on - line or thrown yourself into the world of the Internet and social media .
But you would be mistaken – a significant proportion of the population , young and old now have two very distinct lives : physical and online .
As a parent or a friend , this means that you have to become savvy to how other people may have several different presenting selves or personas – each which is as real to them as the one they live in physical space .
In a world of symbols and representations , that is , the world of communication and the internet – there is no real distinction between the physical and cyber-reality .
It is all symbols flowing through wires into your brain .
Let ’s think about this for a second .
You touch the stove and it feels hot , right ?
So you take your hand away quickly .
Your pet saunters over and you grab it .
It feels soft and warm in your arms .
This all feels real , right ?
Well , the answer is … sort of .
The fact is that you are feeling emotions and sensations because your brain is processing the outside world as information .
As Bishop Berkeley , a British philosopher implied , reality exists in the mind of the beholder .
So , what does this mean in terms of cyberspace vs physical - space ?
Well , the fact is , since our eyes and ear pull create nervous impulses that are translated in our brains as information , and if reality lives in the mind , it would seem that , for the mind , cyber- reality and physical reality are similar – two streams of information which blend and blur in the electric storm of the brain .
This PBS Frontline documentary lends significant insight into how teens are living in two parallel realities :
The young people seem to live in two separate realities with two very different moral codes .
Parents are present in physical reality but neutered in virtual reality .
Also , the interview demonstrate that the young people do n’t really understand that what happens in cyber- reality can have consequences in physical reality .
This must be terrifying for parents of children .
For PR pros , this is both an opportunity and moral hasard .
As the relationship - builders for organizations and individuals , we have to be at the frontlines of understanding how people are building their identities on - line and what this means for the practice .
How does one create and organizational “ avatar ” ( an online identity ) that interacts in cyber - reality in an ethical yet persuasive fashion ?
To achieve this , PR pros have to become familiar not only with what is being said online , but also how it is being understood .
Understanding leads to empathy , and empathy is at the core of PR practice .

QuickCode is the new name for the original ScraperWiki product .
We renamed it , as it is n’t a wiki or just for scraping any more .
It ’s a Python and R data analysis environment , ideal for economists , statisticians and data managers who are new to coding .
Meh .
It 's been done .
( seriously , nice save )
RB air race will be next door in NJ in two weeks and I 'll probably drive down to check it out .
I can still remember the first nightmare I ever had .
I was three years old and imagined walking into a large entryway in a two - story house and announcing to my parents and older brother , " Grandma is a witch . "
At that point I woke up to discover it was still dark and I was completely alone in a room whose color and dimensions looked nothing like the space in my dream .
It 's not much to think about now , but I was so touched by the idea that my laughing , candy - dispensing grandmother was a servant of the supernatural that I could n't fall asleep again .
Blood+is+the+new+GPS .
I 'm thirty years older now and the things I find disturbing are much more varied and grisly than what my three year - old brain could imagine .
One of the worst dreams I have now is of winding up in jail after having killed someone .
The murder itself is never part of the dream , only the guilt and the hopeless realization that I 'm to be confined for the most productive parts of my life .
Or else I 'm yelling at people with unhinged emotion , behavior I make a point of tightly buckling down in waking life .
Occasionally there are still dreams of the supernatural , weird shadow monsters or oozing manimals crawling towards me with unnatural speed .
What makes these experiences unhinge my inner doors is not the literal details , but the implications I draw from them .
Games excel at describing rules ; what happens to Object A when Action B is performed on it .
They 've become quite skilled at drawing in detail as well , charging a staff of artists with the creation of environmental viscera .
Yet , games are still fumbling in the darkness when it comes time for a creator to connect rules and environmental details to some kind of creative implication .
One of the root causes of this persistent gap is that games just are n't violent enough .
Consider games like GTA IV , Uncharted 2 , BioShock , Red Dead Redemption , and Fallout 3 , and you might be led to the opposite conclusion .
To appreciate the characters and stories in these games you 've got to look through a thicket of violence , which often chokes the believability from the polygonal dramas waiting to play out on the other side .
But the blood spurts and rag dolls are illusions designed for repeatability and player convenience .
They sometimes look and sound like violence , but rarely do they feel violent for more than a few minutes .
Games have gotten as far as making killing an interactive option , but few have pushed into what it might actually mean to take a life by force .
This has retarded the evolutionary path and left us in a world of creative doublespeak where we subconsciously know games wo n't be taken too seriously , and that it 's wrong to ever expect them to .
This warped creative arc has left us in a place where heroes kill 300 other human beings in between emotional close - ups .
What 's necessary to correct it is a willingness to describe the meaning of killing to help give each rag dolling enemy a little more impact than that of an overcome obstacle .
We do n't need more moralizing in games ; we ought to be braver about admitting how and why we 're capable of transgressing our collective standards of wrong and right .
Foremost among the ways this could be accomplished is through a more honest attention to point of view .
Game designers are adept at telling players they 're winning or losing .
Blood spurts in a shooter are a kind of reward for good aim , a musical cue lets you know you 've killed all the bad guys in an area , and a reddening screen means you 're standing in the wrong spot .
These are mainly competitive cues and the emotions players connect with them are generally low - level emotions about performance , pressure , and relief .
Is this what the emotional experience of killing is really like ?
If it 's these emotions that developers want to invoke , should n't there be a more apt gameplay metaphor than killing ?
Some reports describe killers as emotionless and dissociated from the act - - do n't think about that too long next time you 're trotting through a single - player kill tunnel ( what are the odds that you would ? ) .
Others describe intense spasms of rage or ecstatic release .
Still others discover killing as a horrific trauma that forever weighs on the psyche .
All of these experiences could be rendered in games .
Killing someone from a dissociative point of view could be done by draining the world of color in the moments you stab , choke , or shoot a victim , turning everything into a blurry black and white in which only basic shapes are visible .
Or else a trigger could transform the world into a briefly surreal place where you 're hacking your way through a tropical jungle with a machete or shooting at distant birds in a clearing .
After the act the normal world would return to show you mangled bodies or a panicked crime scene .
Haze used this idea in a wonderful but limited way , showing players a tropical world where enemies wore army uniforms and died without blood when they were high on nectar .
Without drugs the world became a stormy place and enemies were simply - dressed peasants whose corpses were smeared with blood .

Take cover when you hear a political leader talking about economic affairs .
You can bet a bad decision is incoming .
Luckily for the leaders , their meddling usually has a slow , erosive effect on the economy .
Every so often , however , the great ones manage to land a real whopper that takes them down along with their whole country .
Here are ten examples from history .
1. Charge Too Much and You Die
In the year 301 , the Roman emperor Diocletian issued the Edictum De Pretiis Rerum Venalium , i.e. , the Edict on Prices of Foodstuffs , which rebalanced the coinage system and set maximums on wages and the prices of many types of goods , especially food .
The penalty for selling above the stipulated prices was death .
Copies of the edict were inscribed on stone monuments all over the empire .
Here 's a tip for future dictators : never inscribe your blunders on stone unless you want people to laugh at you for the rest of eternity .
The edict was a disaster .
Sellers withdrew their goods , unwilling to sell at the fixed prices or even risk being falsely accused of selling beyond the maximum and thus be subject to execution .
Workers responded to the wage edicts by vanishing or sitting around doing nothing .
Eventually the edict was ignored and became a subject of derision and mockery which permanently lowered the prestige and authority of the empire .
2. Shearing the English Wolf
You know you are doing something wrong when your enemies become folk heroes like Robin Hood .
Common sense is to tax the weak and give money to the strong , but after his failure in forestry policy King John of England decided to try the reverse .
He relieved the knights of the realm from their military service requirements , but then ordered them to pay instead a hefty " scutage " ( shield ) tax .
Soon , there were 10,000 Robin Hoods trying to kill him and going about it in an organized fashion .
Signing the humiliating Magna Carta in 1215 bought him some time , but by the next year he was living on the lam .
After his folly - won treasure was washed away in a mistimed river crossing , he went crazy and died soon after .
3. Paper Money Is Amazing
The fifth Khan of Persia was named " Gaykhatu , " which means " amazing " in Mongolian .
After recklessly squandering the money left by his predecessors he was in no position to cope with a massive rinderpest epidemic that began devastating his subjects ' livestock in 1294 .
Amazing came up with an amazing solution to his financial problems : paper money .
Invented by his boss , Kublai Khan , back in China the idea of paper money was a godsend .
He would print up certificates just like the Chinese ones , decree death for anyone who refused them , and all his problems would be solved .
Amazing !
Unfortunately for Amazing he did not fuss too much with technical details like convertibility and capital controls , which Kublai Khan had agonized over , and the result was the total failure of the project .
Economic chaos ensued .
Amazing was deposed and put to death the next year .
4. I 'll Buy Every Sword You 've Got
In the Muromachi period ( 1336 to 1573 ) , Ming dynasty Mandarins in China adopted a policy of buying and importing swords from the Japanese with the goal of depriving the troublesome " barbarians " occupying those islands of their weapons .
The gleeful reaction of the Japanese was along the lines of Jay Leno 's Doritos commercial : buy all you like ; we 'll make more .
5. No Smuggling Allowed
Price controls are stupid anytime , but it takes true idiocy to apply them in the middle of a siege .
In 1584 forces controlled by Alexander Farnese , the duke of Parma , were besieging Holland 's grandest city , Antwerp , in the Dutch War of Independence .
At first the siege was ineffectual because the duke 's lines were porous and Antwerp could be supplied by sea , but the duke was in luck because the city decided to blockade itself voluntarily .
The magistrates of the city declared a maximum on the price of grain .
The smugglers who had been running the blockade up to that point became considerably less enthusiastic about making food deliveries after that .
Facing starvation , the city surrendered the next year .
6 . The Gold Factory of Venice
In 1590 the Republic of Venice was in decline .
Nineteen years earlier it had gloriously fended off the Ottoman Turks by a tremendous victory at the Battle of Lepanto , but had nevertheless lost Cyprus , the republic 's greatest possession .
In 1585 the newly elected doge had thrown silver coins instead of the traditional gold at his ascension .
Weighed down by taxes , imposts , tariffs , duties , tithes , assessments and fees , the economy had seen better days .
From out of this gloom a new hope unexpectedly appeared .
A long - lost Venetian named Marco Bragadini , currently resident in nearby Lombardy , had discovered how to make gold .
The republic had to act fast , though , because the duke of Mantua was trying to lay his hands on this valuable goose .
A cohort of soldiers was sent forthwith and Bragadini was securely delivered into the city in triumph by three galleys .
Rigorous scientific tests were ordered by the senate to verify the power of the " anima d'oro , " which Bragadini alone possessed .
The alchemist filled a crucible with quicksilver , added a pinch of his secret powder and set it to fire .
Soon the quicksilver turned to gold ; it was all true .
The price of alchemist capes and retorts skyrocketed .
Signor Bragadini coolly informed the senate he could produce six million ducats or whatever they would require .
For himself he wanted nothing but to be the humble servant of his country .
Naturally , the senate put all the resources of Venice at his disposal .
Nobles flocked to Bragadini by the dozen , imploring him to cut them in on his business .
The months wore on , but the production of the new gold factory was disappointingly meager .
Apparently there were limits to the speed with which the gold could be manufactured .
Sensing a mounting impatience with his operations Bragadini absconded to Munich where Duke William the Pious was wooing him .
Unfortunately for the maestro , in the meantime Pope Sixtus had died and been replaced with the sanctimonious Pope Gregory XIV who considered the alchemist and his two dogs to be the devil 's spawn and sent orders for their execution — with which William complied .
The senate of Venice decided to pretend the whole thing never happened .
7. How to Deal with Hoarders
As the famine - fueled French Revolution careened out of control in 1793 , a radical clique called the " Committee of Public Safety " headed by Maximilien Robespierre took power .
The committee resolved to solve the food problem by enacting the " General Maximum , " a set of policies fixing the maximum price of bread and other common goods .
When those measures failed to increase the supply of food , they sent soldiers into the countryside to forcibly seize grain from the evil farmers who were " hoarding " it .
Robespierre and the committee went to the guillotine the next year .
8. A Hobo's Dream , An Empire 's End
In 1880 , railroad technology was advancing rapidly , and the Russians received several private petitions for a concession in the Far East .
To the paranoid patricians of Moscow , it was not enough to merely deny these foreign schemers ; they needed to build their own railroad to the east to keep them out .
Under the leadership of His Royal Paranoidness , Czar Alexander III , the Russian state began taking out massive foreign loans and constructing the 5,000 - mile Trans - Siberian Railway , the largest civil - works project since the Great Pyramid of Giza .
Alexander ( and his empire ) would later die from injuries sustained in a railroad accident .
By the time the corruption - ridden boondoggle was completed in 1904 , Alexander 's son , Nicholas II , was technically bankrupt .
Wars and revolts started to plague the empire .
Instead of carrying trade goods , the new railway was carrying political prisoners and supplies for soldiers .
When Russia rolled over its debts in 1907 , it was obvious to the large banking houses that the empire was financially doomed and only small investors could be found to subscribe the new loans .
Even with these loans suspended , Russia 's economy was so weak that it would not survive the coming war .
Nicholas was executed July 16 , 1918 .
9 . It Takes a Village to Build a Famine
The 1984 crop failure in Ethiopia presented a fresh set of problems for the Marxist junta called the " Derg " that controlled the government .
The nationalization programs and price controls they had been experimenting with for years seemed less effective than ever .
Obviously the remnants of capitalism were still infecting the economy , so they took vigorous measures such as outlawing grain trading .
Oddly enough , that did not stop the famine .
The chairman , Mengistu Haile Mariam , inspired by the brilliant agricultural successes of Secretary Stalin in the 1930s thereupon sponsored a whole new idea dubbed " villagization . "
Under this plan the scattered rural inhabitants of Ethiopia would be gathered together in modernized villages with all the latest civic infrastructure .
As might be expected , not all the beneficiaries of this plan realized what utopias these villages would be so they had to be driven there at gunpoint for their own good .
Unfortunately , the expected increases in agricultural production never materialized and millions starved .
The country descended into a permanent state of civil war , which only ended in 1990 after the Soviet Union stopped supplying the Derg .
Mengistu fled to Zimbabwe where he has become an important advisor to that nation 's rulers .
10 . Rubles : Now You See Them , Now You Don't
On January 22 , 1991 , Mikhail Gorbachev , the president of the Soviet Union , decreed that all existing 50 - and 100 - ruble banknotes were no longer legal tender and that they could be exchanged for new notes for three days only and only in small quantities .
This had the effect of instantly deleting large portions of the savings and accumulated capital of private citizens .
He followed up this genius move on January 26 , by ordering that the police had the authority to search any place of business and to demand the records of any business at any time .
The union 's economic problems accelerated into a death spiral .
Gorbachev resigned on December 25 , and on the next day the Supreme Soviet dissolved itself and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics .
John S. Chamberlain lives in Natick , Massachusetts , and works as a software engineer specializing in earth science and artificial intelligence .

A new leaked picture of the rumored HTC Vision has made it's way into the wild via engadget .
This is new clean crisp photo of the device from a tipster .
The device is clearly branded with the T - Mobile logo on it that supports earlier claims that this phone will arrive on TMO Network but questions still arise if it is going to Europe or North American bound or possibly both .
Rumored specs have it with a 1GHz snapdragon processor and spacious Qwerty slider keyboard and a 3.7 WVGA screen .
The HTC Vision pictures have been leaking over the past month which would leave us to believe that this phone is not far off and we should see it this fall .
One other leak that accompanied this picture was the tipster saying was that this phone may also get a new name from T - Mobile the " G1 Blaze " which has been thrown around a few times in the rumor mill aswell .
This new HTC offering would certainly do the G1 name justice and bring HTC a new Android Qwerty phone to market to rival Motorola 's upcoming release next month of the Droid 2 .
Tell us what you think about this new HTC Vision / G1 Blaze , does it have TMO customers excited ?

I really enjoyed Scott Pilgrim vs The World when I played it at E3 , despite having zero knowledge of the source material .
Now that I ’ve read the first 5 Scott Pilgrim books in record time ( and will be picking up the 6th and final one today ) , I ’m in full on “ DO WANT ” mode .
So too , apparently , are the folks over at IGN .
Fortunately , we ’ll be featuring the latest build of the game at our Comic - Con event on Thursday ( invites just went out for that , btw – check your email ) .
And Scott Pilgrim vs The World ’s ( PSN - exclusive ) debut is n’t that far off , either – August 10th .
In the meantime , and just in time for Comic - Con , take a look at the latest trailer .
We ’ll have more on Scott Pilgrim vs The World shortly after Comic - Con .
Well , well , well — where have we seen this before ?
The indiscreet U.S. commander whose tongue digs his own grave .
The stunning resignation submitted within hours of the magazine 's online posting of the story .
And General David Petraeus — yet again — as the go - to choice as America 's turnaround specialist .
Amidst all the nonstop chatter from pundits , politicians , and former ambassadors , allow me to distance myself from the familiar situation I was in with Admiral William Fallon and sift through the tea leaves to look ahead at Petraeus 's new gig .
Because there are magazine stories , and then there is war .
And because — who knows ? —
Afghanistan may be a lot better off , and Obama may have picked his replacement in more ways than one .
1 . There wo n't be a policy shift .
Unlike the Fallon saga , this time it was the president who spoke on camera and the general who was restricted to a press statement .
That 's because this time the Pentagon - White House flap was an issue of perception ( Obama : " undermining civilian authority " ) — not any fundamental differences on how to fight the war at hand .
2 . But the Pentagon now holds the keys to the castle .
Obama may have put his foot down , but he 's making a serious gamble in anointing Petraeus , much like Bush did after Fallon 's resignation .
The president needed to make McChrystal 's sacking seem like an upgrade in gravitas , which it is when the upgrade is to the boss of Central Command .
Just do n't forget that Petraeus is the only general capable of making Afghanistan his war , and not Obama's .
3. Petraeus is truly untouchable .
Understand this , too :
Whatever the general wants , the general will get .
After firing his Afghanistan commander twice in just thirteen months , Obama has no choice .
Petraeus now outranks every administration player on Afghanistan .
Save Obama — officially , at least .
4. Friends of Dave just became a lot more important .
Frankly , the new sheriff 's strong personal relationships with the Pakistani military and security forces will matter a helluva lot more than which of McChrystal 's lieutenants he keeps on or gets rid of .
Hamid Karzai made his bid to keep McChrystal onboard , and was clearly ignored — as he should be — so now Obama 's Af - Pak strategy will place the most eggs in Islamabad 's basket .
5 . The administration 's review of Af - Pak begins now .
Originally scheduled for public release in December , any White House - led effort at a war report will inevitably take its cues from General Petraeus 's own review of the situation as he assumes command in the coming weeks and months .
Expect to hear the general outline at Petraeus 's confirmation hearing next week , along with previews of the GOP 's national - security campaign slogans for November .
6. Obama 's 2012 campaign could be all about war .
If Petraeus says the strategy needs more time , then Obama 's running for re-election as a wartime president .
Period .
There 's just no way that Obama can overrule Petraeus on this one without wounding himself politically .
McChrystal had been signaling that Obama 's summer 2011 deadline to begin withdrawing combat troops was too optimistic .
Expect Petraeus to press that case — however subtly — from day one .
7 . Two jobs ?
One job ?
Same thing .
No matter what anyone says in the confirmation hearings , it wo n't matter if Petraeus steps down from CENTCOM or becomes The General with Two Hats .
Nobody who would step in at CENTCOM could overshadow Petraeus , so that kind of a choice is unimportant in many respects .
But given the general 's recent health issues , it 's hard to believe a replacement wo n't be picked .
I 'm betting on General James Mattis , whom I profiled in detail a couple years ago .
8 . The counterinsurgency lives on .
" King David " has no peers when it comes to counterinsurgency credentials , having overseen the creation of the Army - Marine Corps 's seminal field manual and commanded its first successful application in Iraq .
If anything , Obama has now doubled - down on the COIN path in Af - Pak , so the COINdistas have n't taken any sort of hit .
9 . The " Draft Dave " presidential run could live on , too .
Can Petraeus pull off his second COIN miracle ?
If he does , and if it 's perceived as such prior to the GOP convention in the summer of 2012 , then I guarantee you there will be a groundswell of delegate support to make him the Republican candidate — assuming he gets out of uniform in time .
10 .
There is one big winner from this hoopla .
And her name is Elena Kagan , whose confirmation hearings also happen to begin next week .

Now that we 've got a pretty good idea of what we can expect from the new iPhone as well as what 's coming to Android , we 're wondering :
Which mobile operating system do you think is worth your money ?

There 's a lot that goes into the Android vs.
iPhone decision , and we 'll go into how we see the two breaking down later this week , but in the meantime , we 're curious what your current feelings are :

Let 's hear which pros and cons you consider most important to making your decision in the comments .
It might surprise the futurists and environmental activists who support renewable energy to find out that the renewable manufacturing industries , according to a number of studies , create as many -- if not more -- blue - collar , boots - on - the - ground jobs as the fossil fuels industry .
In 2009 , the number of wind industry workers -- many in manufacturing , heavy transport and factory assembly -- surpassed the total number of workers in coal mining for the first time .
At a recent press conference , the American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) joined with leaders from the United Steelworkers and members of the BlueGreen Alliance to announce the release of Winds Of Change , a new report that describes the 18,500 manufacturing jobs now provided by the wind energy industry and the seven times as many manufacturing jobs that could materialize in the next five years from a wind industry supported by policies such as a Renewable Electricity Standard ( RES ) requiring regulated U.S. utilities to obtain 25 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2025 .
" The expansion of the wind industry , if we do it right , has the ability to revitalize American manufacturing , " said Jason Walsh , the Director of Policy for the BlueGreen Alliance , a coalition of labor unions , including the United Steelworkers , and environmental groups , like the Sierra Club .
" A typical wind turbine has 8,000 component parts and 250 tons of steel , " Walsh said .
" It wo n't be a handful of scientists and engineers who build this green economy , " Walsh said .
" It 's going to be pipefitters and machinists and technicians and welders .
These are good , middle - class jobs -- you can call them blue - collar jobs -- that have been transformed into green - collar jobs .
And , very importantly , they are accessible to a very broad range of workers as long as they get the right training and the right support . "
A turbine tower is made from 100 tons of steel .
Factory - made fiberglass blades and the steel rotor that turns them can weigh 40 tons .
The fiberglass nacelle , a turbine 's brain and heart containing the gearing , generator , and thousands of those component parts , can weigh 70 tons .
Three years ago , John Grabner , the President of Cardinal Fastener , grabbed a chance to supply wind turbine fasteners to a project developer when European fasteners proved unsatisfactory .
Because the work was profitable for Cardinal , Grabner went after more .
With wind 's record 2009 installations , Cardinal grew its manufacturing jobs 67 percent last year .
The photo accompanying this post was taken at Cardinal .
Can you spot the leader of the free world in there ?
" The wind industry is real , " Grabner said , " and the turbine manufacturers are doing what they said they would do .
They are homologating their supply chain . "
( Homologation is the entirely legal marriage of foreign turbine technology and domestically manufactured components .
Walsh called it " insourcing . " )
" When we talk about green jobs , " Walsh said , " there 's often a misconception about what these jobs are .
These are not jobs that are somewhere out there in the sci - fi future .
They are jobs that already exist but are geared toward green ends . "
There are three basic reasons that Vestas , the world 's largest manufacturer of turbines , wants to buy U.S. - made parts , Grabner said .
They want to deal in dollars , they save 18 percent to 20 percent on transportation costs , and they want to build a domestic manufacturing base so the federal government will continue to support the renewables industries .
" It 's like a ripple effect , " Grabner said , explaining why he accepts the independent studies that show a national Renewable Electricity Standard ( RES ) will create 274,000 jobs .
" When we get an order for fasteners for a wind turbine , we call the steel mill , who gets hold of the iron ore mine .
They do their job with the steel and send it to us via truck .
We build it and send it to our outside service folks , who in turn heat , treat and plate it , " Grabner explained .
" Then it goes to the turbine manufacturer and then into the field . "
That is the ripple effect for just one critical component used to attach tower segments , attach the nacelle to the tower , and attach the blades to the hub .
As Walsh pointed out , a wind turbine has over 8,000 such components .
Once manufactured , parts are sent to assembly centers .
Once assembled , the tower and nacelle must be transported to the installation site .
Grabner said Cardinal regularly ships tons of fasteners via trucking companies .
Walsh pointed out that towers and nacelles are often transported by rail .
Blades are usually trucked .
Such transport puts the domestic rail and trucking labor force to work .
At the installation site , it 's a matter of boots on the ground .
" Installing these turbines is a large construction project , " Walsh said .
" It 's good for the economy . "
Once the wind installation is producing electricity , operations personnel and maintenance workers must be onsite regularly , booting it up the towers to monitor and service gearboxes and generators .
" Building a green economy will involve some brand - new industries and jobs but , for the most part , it will involve transforming the industries and jobs we already have , " Walsh said .
A welder who once worked on submarines can become a welder of wind turbine towers .
" Same skill set , " Walsh said .
" Very different economic ends . "
" The culture in the manufacturing base has got to change , " John Grabner said .
" There is an opportunity there , but you 've got to be in the right place at the right time with the right attitude to get it . "
" So the tourists get out of the vehicle , they stand amazed at the vista and the view , and the baboons go for the door , and say : ' well , that door 's not locked ' .
Japan edged out Cameroon in a dour encounter at Bloemfontein 's Free State Stadium which produced little in the way of goalmouth action .
A far from capacity crowd witnessed two out - of - form teams struggle to find any inspiration in another tepid World Cup encounter .
After a dire opening half - hour Japan took the lead against the run of play when Dalsuke Matsui 's cross looped over Stephane Mbia and was met by Keisuke Honda , who fired in coolly at the back post .
Japan almost doubled the lead when Makoto Hasebe crashed an effort towards goal but it was well saved by Souleymanou Hamidou before the offside Shinji Okazaki clattered the post as he followed up .
Cameroon finally found some urgency in the closing stages as Mbia rattled the crossbar from 25 yards but the well - drilled Japan side were able to hold on and go level with the Netherlands at the top of Group E .
The Blue Samurai , who had lost four straight games in their World Cup build - up before drawing 0 - 0 with Zimbabwe , set out so defensively it seemed they would be happy with a point from the opening whistle .
And although Cameroon showed more endeavour , the fact that star striker Samuel Eto'o was played wide on the right and was often found lurking very deep meant they lacked any sort of cutting edge .
A 37th - minute shot from Eyong Enoh was the first goalmouth action of the game and , although it was comfortably collected by Japan goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima , it did finally suggest Cameroon may start to find gaps in the Japanese defence .
But the opposite was true as , despite their lack of attacking intent , Japan took a surprise lead one minute later .
Matsui 's deep left - footed cross was completely missed by the Cameroon defenders and Honda had time to control the ball before passing into the net .
The Indomitable Lions are the most successful African side in World Cup history having qualified for the World Cup six times , but the pride and passion shown by previous incarnations was sadly lacking in this first tournament on their own continent .
Only one brief moment of class immediately after half time suggested Cameroon might rouse themselves from their slumber .
Three - time African Footballer of the Year Eto'o finally showed a glimpse of his ability when he picked the ball up on the right and beat two men on his way into the area before squaring to Maxim Choupo - Moting but the striker could not control his finish and blasted over the bar .
But that impetus was not to last and it was not until the 85th minute that Cameroon found two efforts which could have stolen them a point .
In a moment of inspiration totally out keeping with the rest of the game , Mbia hammered a stunning effort towards goal from 25 yards which crashed off the crossbar and following that Kawashima saved from Pierre Webo in injury time .
In fairness to Japan the Asian side 's tactics worked almost perfectly as they defended solidly but on this evidence the Netherlands and Denmark will have little to worry about going into the tournament 's second week .

Image caption Google is competing for a slice of the lucrative travel market
Search engine giant Google has entered the travel market after acquiring flight information firm ITA Software .
ITA provides software that organises fares , flight and journey times that are used by airlines , travel agents and flight comparison sites such as Orbitz .
Google said it may well expand the scope , enabling users to search directly for flight destinations .
Google paid $ 700 m in cash for the US - based company , founded in 1996 by a team of MIT computer scientists .
" What we 're going to do is build new flight search tools that focus on end users , " said Google chief executive Eric Schmidt .
However , he said that the firm would not be selling airline tickets to consumers and that it would honour " all existing agreements that ITA has with its partners " .
Those partners include some of Google 's direct competitors - such as Microsoft 's own flight comparison website , Bing Travel .
Other firms which had been bidding for ITA included Travelport , Expedia and Kayak , many of which are also dependent on ITA for their flight data .
A spokesman for Kayak told BBC News that , for now , they were not concerned .
" In the short term , it 's not an issue , because Google said it 's honouring existing agreements , " he said .
Image caption
The deal could see Google controlling a significant amount of flight data
However , there are fears within the travel industry that Google could have an excessive influence .
Google says the acquisition is " pro-competitive " and " pro-consumer " but said regulators were likely to examine the deal .
" I would expect that it would be a significant review , " said Mr Schmidt .
The Independent 's travel editor , Simon Calder , told BBC News that the biggest loser may be the old legacy booking systems , should Google expand ITA 's remit .
" If anything , the airline industry used a system that you could describe as the forerunner to the internet , " said Mr Calder .
" The aviation industry used GDS - the Global Distribution System - for decades , because there were computers in travel agents , airports and airlines across the globe .
" Now it consolidates around Amadeus , Sabre , Galileo and World Span and these still have legacy aspects .
For example , if you book a flight from London to Mexico City via Dallas , you will still have to pay $ 3 for each segment .
" If Google can do something to rival that , it would be very interesting and exciting .
" But , as with all things to do with Google , the issue of market domination comes up , " he added .
Collision course
Google confirmed it was also working on a project that would enable users to search for hotels , with the results displayed on Google Maps .
That could put put it on a collision course with firms like Expedia , Travelocity and Opodo .
Mr Calder said that while he could see merit in Google running a flight information firm , he was not convinced that it should launch a travel comparison website of its own .
" While there is great competition when it comes to transatlantic flights , from smaller airports , the choice for a passenger is more limited , " he said .
" There are plenty of price comparison sites already and for someone booking flights , the system is almost perfect , so I do n't see how Google is going to get a slice of that . "
I just got back from the unbelievably awesome Emerging Languages Camp at OSCON .
I wish I could come up with a good way to get across how cool of an experience it was .
All I can really say was that for the first time in a long time , I felt like I was really around my people .
A programming language nerd is a really specific kind of nerd and I do n’t really know many who share my obsession .
For the last two days , I was in a room packed with people who did .
It ’s hard to summarize two intense days of full - on nerdery , but I thought I would talk a bit about something good I got from some of the talks .
This does n’t mean I agreed with them all ( honestly , I found the Go talk myopic ) , or that anyone I omitted here was n’t interesting .
I ’m honestly exhausted this morning , so I only have so much steam .
Rob Pike ( Go )
The theme that comes up frequently when I read about Go or hear Rob talk about it is this sense of pragmatic feature economy .
Any time someone asks , “ why does n’t Go have Foo ” , his answer tends to be “ We found in practice that we do n’t miss it . ”
Language designers can tend to be magpies , wanting to cram in all of our favorite features just because they ’re shiny or to have a longer bullet list than the other guy .
If those features do n’t help real people solve real problems , you ’re just wasting your time and making things more complex for them .
While I do n’t always agree with the specific choices that the Go designers make , I do agree with the “ let ’s see if we can get by without them ” approach that leads to them .
Phil Mercurio ( Thyrd )
Phil ’s talk was one of a few on visual programming .
Most of my experience with visual languages is that they ’re either toys or incomprehensible timecube - esque crankware .
Phil got up and humbly walked through his visual language .
When he asked for questions at the end , there was a long pause before any hands went up .
From talking to people afterward , I think the consensus was that we were all thinking , “ Holy crap , he actually did it . ”
He managed to find a small kernel for a visual language ( nested grids and triads ) and build something out of it that really works .
It ’s really hard to pull something like this off , and I think it ’s cool that ’s he had the insight and tenacity to keep cranking away at it .
Alan Eliasen ( Frink )
Alan stressed that Frink is a general - purpose language with user - defined functions and stuff but its raison d'etre is doing arithmetic with units , which it does so unbelievably comprehensively that it boggles the mind .
From his talk , I can only assume that Alan ’s house is packed floor - to - ceiling with yellowing almanacs and dusty IEEE standards reports .
Calling his knowledge of measure “ encyclopedic ” is giving encyclopedias too much credit .
What I found interesting about Frink is that by limiting its focus to a single domain , Alan has ended up with a language that ’s more powerful and useful .
When asked what their language is good for , many designers would say “ everything ” which really means “ nothing ” .
Frink embodies the principle of doing one thing and doing it well .
Gilad Bracha ( Newspeak )
The camp was an even mix of academics and hackers .
A lot of academic talk is over my head so the mortarboard team is underrepresented in this post .
Gilad ’s talk was in that category : a lot of it was too high - level for my primitive monkey brain to grasp .
One thing really stuck with me though .
Newspeak does n’t have namespaces , modules , or a lot of other OOP features .
What it does have is classes , and classes nest .
That simple core is flexible enough to do duty as a module system , an abstraction system , a namespace system etc .
I love the idea of getting one simple concept and letting it fully unfold to cover a bunch of different problem solutions .
Jeremy Ashkenas ( Coffeescript )
I totally did n’t pay attention to Jeremy ’s talk because I was busy slapping together slides for mine .
This sucks because I think Coffeescript is fantastic .
I love its obsession with aesthetics and clarity .
Both the language and its documentation are a testament to the philosophy that beautiful is usable .
I wish more language designers would pay heed to that .
Steve Folta ( Trylon )
Steve ’s talk embodied two ideals that I think are often overlooked .
The first thing he said when he got up was , “ Trylon does n’t do anything new . ”
That puts Trylon in the same space as Python , Ruby , and almost every popular language today .
If you want to publish papers and advance the art , breaking new ground is key .
If you want a language for people to use , there ’s real value in staying away from the borderlands .
The other thing he said that struck me was , “ When I get home I program in Trylon because it ’s the language that feels the most fun to me . ”
A well - worn truism in writing is “ write for yourself . ”
Trying to make a language that ’s all things to all people is futile and exhausting .
I love that Steve just made the language that he wanted .
Amos Wenger ( ooc )
Any domain has two levels of knowledge : the core ideas for the domain , and the cultural wisdom around those ideas .
The first tells you how to do stuff .
The latter often tells you which stuff not to do .
Any well - versed programming language person can tell you about both recursive - descent parsers and generated parsers .
They ’ll also tell that generated parsers are the “ right ” way to do that .
Most of the time that advice will save you from wasted effort , but sometimes I think it keeps people from going down paths that may actually be fruitful .
Sometimes the thing that everyone knows is true is n’t .
( For example , every language I know of with a lot of real - world users actually does use a hand - written parser . )
Amos is a young French iconoclast .
If he ’d been born in a different time , I expect he’d be a brick - tossing anarchist .
One advantage that attitude gives him is that he and the others working on ooc pour features into the language while the rest of us are still sitting around fretting about minutia .
I think a lot of us could use some of that “ let ’s just fucking do it ” spirit .
By Ben Pleasants .
Ben Pleasants :
When was the last time you spoke with Bukowski ?
John Fante :
It ’s been months .
BP : You want to talk to him today ?
JF : No , not necessarily .
Joyce Fante :
You ’re testing , are n’t you , Ben ? [ laughs ]
BP : Yeah [ laughs ]
Well , that ’s okay .
I do n’t know how much stamina you have today , John , so we can just go for a little while ; then we can stop , if that ’s all right .
John Fante : Yeah .
I ca n’t go all the way through it .
BP : Okay .
What I want to start with is Brotherhood of the Grape , and I want to get now what happened with that book .
I just touched on it with the last piece , but I did n’t really get into the whole thing .
So let ’s start .
You wrote the thing when , originally ?
What year did you write it in ?
JF : [ To Joyce ]
Do you know , honey ?
Joyce Fante : I think it was ’ 75 .
John Fante : Published in ’ 77 .
BP : By Scribners ?
John Fante : No , Houghton - Mifflin .
BP : That ’s one thing I got wrong ; glad I got that straight .
So Houghton - Mifflin published it in hardback , but it was published originally before that by Coppola and City Magazine ?
JF : No , no .
Originally it was purchased by Bob Towne , and I got $ 75,000 for it .
Joyce Fante :
It was published in an abridged version in City Magazine .
John Fante :
Oh yes .
Then Coppola got a hold of it and he published the whole thing in his magazine , City , published in San Francisco .
Joyce Fante :
After that , you expanded it and added a whole section at the request of your publisher .
Do you remember that ?
John Fante :
Yes , that ’s right .
BP : What was the section ?
Joyce Fante :
It was a flashback .
John Fante : Flashback to my arrival in Los Angeles .
BP : Also the part about the cannery and all that ?
Joyce Fante :
That ’s all added .
BP : So that was all added , too .
How about the part where he walks through the town and sees all the masonry that his father did ?
Joyce Fante :
That was there originally .
BP : Okay .
When you wrote that as a book , and it was published , Towne originally planned to do a screenplay ?
John Fante : Yeah .
BP : Did he know who was going to produce it ?
JF : I suspect that he wanted to produce it himself , but he hesitated about letting me write the screenplay .
BP : Why was that ?
JF : I do n’t know .
He had his own reasons for doing that , and then Coppola got hold of it .
BP : How did that happen ?
JF : I guess Bob gave it to him .
BP : So in other words , there was sort of an agreement or a discussion about Coppola producing , directing it and Towne writing the screenplay ; is that what happened ?
JF : No .
Towne wanted to hire a screenwriter for it , and while he was debating the choice , Coppola gave the book to a writer by the name of Shaughnessy .
Is n’t that right , honey ?
Joyce Fante :
It was an Irish name .
John Fante :
And he wrote a screenplay , which Towne eventually saw and hated , and rejected .
And the result was that he and Coppola could not agree on the screenplay , and the thing was left in abeyance ; nobody had it .
And to my knowledge , that ’s where it is now – Coppola not particularly interested in it , not manifesting any interest , and Towne refusing to use Shaughnessy ’s screenplay .
So there ’s the book , out in limbo .
BP : Was there ever an attempt by Coppola to ask you to do the screenplay ?
JF : Yes , Coppola asked me to do the screenplay , and I agreed to do it , and I wrote him a letter and asked him to put it down on paper , what he intended to pay me and the terms of the contract .
And I never heard from him .
BP : Tell me about the – I would like you to jump in on this , too , Joyce – about the thing in San Francisco with the opera and so on .
I just vaguely remember that , but it was very funny .
Does this have to do with when he published the thing in City ?
JF : Yeah .
He invited me up to his home in San Francisco .
BP : Which was what , a 35 - room mansion or something ?
JF : On Pacific .
Joyce Fante : A beautiful , restored Victorian mansion on Broadway and Pacific .
But we were picked up at the airport by limousine and taken to the hotel , which we paid for .
BP : Sounds like Coppola – classic with a capital Q .
Joyce Fante :
Then we went to a theater in downtown San Francisco to hear his father rehearsing La Boheme .
And we sat in this cold , drafty theater – John had been very ill just previous to this – all day , listening to the stops and starts of the practice of La Boheme .
And at some point during all this , Coppola arrived in the theater and he was hovering around in the back , we saw him now here and now there .
And finally he came down and spoke to us , but this was after many hours of being acutely uncomfortable and bored .
BP : Why did you go up there originally ?
Did he ask you to come up and talk about the book ?
John Fante : I guess he just wanted to meet me and gauge my character in terms of what he wanted .
BP : Did he know your work as a film writer ?
JF : I do n’t know .
BP : Did he ever mention it ?
Joyce Fante :
Oh yes .
John was invited to dinner – the dinner was in honor of John – and after the dinner at his home that night , he showed Full of Life , which he admired .
John Fante :
The mayor of San Francisco was there .
Joyce Fante : Yes , Alioto was there and a number of other prominent people .
John Fante :
And his lawyer .
Joyce Fante : Alioto ’s daughter , his father – I do n’t remember all the people – his wife .
And he had a beautiful dinner for us .
John Fante :
After his dinner , he took us down to the projection room , and we did n’t know what we were there for , and the screen darkened , and there it was , Full of Life .
BP : By you about your wife , really .
JF : Yeah .
It was very nice .
Joyce Fante :
He had a beautiful home .
BP : He sold it .
Joyce Fante : Oh , did he sell that ?
BP : Yeah .
John Fante :
Where ’s he living now ?
BP : He ’s living down here because he owns a studio called Zoetrope , somewhere in Hollywood .
I think it ’s Burbank .
JF : He ’s fragmented , has n’t he ?
BP : I think he ’s having the problem that all people when they go into production have .
They just have tremendous money problems , and they never really seem to know how to deal with it .
JF : Especially if you think big all the time like Francis .
BP : I ’ve been reading that huge book on Selznick .
My God , there was a guy who was tremendously successful , he was having terrible financial problems .
Joyce Fante :
Was he really ?
BP : Yeah , he was just good at hiding it .
Coppola is n’t good at hiding it .
Joyce Fante : Coppola also had a vineyard and still does , I imagine , because we got a bottle of wine .
BP : Those are hard to sell .
[ laughs ]
So he never made a hard and fast commitment in terms of doing it .
Is that right , John ?
John Fante : No , he never did .
But the reason for that is that he could not get squared away with Robert Towne .
He and Robert Towne differed so radically about the screenplay that there was no point in even discussing anything more about it .
BP : I see .
I did n’t realize that .
JF : And then it appeared that Robert Towne was no longer interested in it .
And then he had his lawyer write me and ask me if I would do the screenplay , and of course I agreed to it , and I told him to send me the terms and all .
BP : Who had his lawyer – was it Towne or Coppola ?
JF : Coppola .
Joyce Fante : Tom Sternberg .
John Fante : Tom Sternberg , yeah .
BP : And what happened at that point ?
JF : The whole thing kind of floated away .
Nothing more was said about it .
BP : When you tried to reach Towne , what happened ?
JF : He was never home to me .
BP : Have you heard anything about it since ?
JF : No , no .
Towne is mad at me because the section of Dreams from Bunker Hill seems to cover the same period as Ask the Dust .
Whereas in Ask the Dust there was no mention at all ever of working in the studios , whereas in Dreams from Bunker Hill , that was its main concern , but they ’re actually quite separate books .
But Towne once during our discussions about it said that he would be interested in buying , or interested in my writing Ask the Dust if I would include Dreams from Bunker Hill .
BP : In other words , buying the whole thing together ?
JF : And I would n’t do that .
BP : Yeah , they ’re two very separate books .
Of course , they do have the same character in them .
I guess that may be one of the reasons why it feels you could put them together .
JF : I think he was trying to get something cheap .
BP : Going back to Towne , he was originally interested in Ask the Dust ?
JF : Oh yes , he was .
BP : And was n’t that the book that got him started on the whole business about doing a thing –
JF : Yes , yes .
He read that book when he was up north , he had his agent contact me , he took a couple of options on it , and when I wrote the novel , he gave me $ 75,000 .
BP : That was for Brotherhood of the Grape ?
JF : Yeah .
BP : Now , what happened with the publication of that book ?
Bukowski mentioned , and several other people mentioned that it was very difficult for them to get it .
JF : What book was that ?
BP : Brotherhood .
JF : I ’m not aware of that .
It was not a very good sales job on the part of Houghton - Mifflin .
BP : Were you aware of that , Joyce , that it was hard to get ?
Joyce Fante :
Yes , I ’ve heard a lot of people say that .
Friends say they could n’t get it .
John Fante :
And I ’ve heard people say they ’ve seen it in Fedco and in Thrifty Drug Store .
BP : Is that the hardback ?
JF : No , the paperback .
BP : I think the paperback is getting around , but the hardback , nobody could find it .
Joyce Fante : Yes .
I went to Pickwick two or three weeks after it was published , and they had already moved it from the counter to the shelf .
BP : Anyway , so as far as Brotherhood is concerned at this point , concerning Towne and Coppola , there is n’t anything happening ?
John Fante : No .
BP : I mention that because if I write this , I do n’t want to spoil anything for you .
If you ’ve got something out there , this is not going to help it , let ’s put it this way .
Joyce Fante : I thought it was totally dead until we got the bottle of wine in January .
So maybe he ’s still interested , I do n’t know , or maybe it was just a friendly gesture .
BP : It would appear that the heavy in the thing anyway was not Coppola , anyway – that it was Towne .
John Fante : Yeah .
Joyce Fante : Yes .
John Fante :
It ’s just a disagreement about the screenplay .
Coppola thinks it ’s a bad screenplay , I do n’t think it ’s very good , and Towne thinks it ’s all right .
BP : I see .
So the screenplay as it exists , the one that Towne had written , he would go ahead with it , Towne would ?
JF : I presume so , if he ’d had some kind of approval from Coppola .
Joyce Fante : Towne bought it , you see , but obviously , he had some kind of a deal with Coppola .
BP : So that ’s where the problem is .
He owns the thing outright ?
John Fante : I guess he does .
Joyce Fante :
He owns the screen rights .
BP : Okay , let ’s move on , get out of that morass .
About that time , what were you doing in terms of your own work after you finished Brotherhood of the Grape , besides looking around for getting the production of it done ?
JF : It was at that time that I decided to write Dreams from Bunker Hill .
BP : That was ’ 79 ?
Joyce Fante : Yes .
BP : And there , again , you reintroduced the character of Bandini , which you had not used for quite some time .
John Fante :
That ’s right .
BP : Because as I recall , you did n’t use him in My Dog Stupid , which still remains unpublished , you did n’t use him in Brotherhood , and you did n’t use him in Full of Life .
He was used only in Wait Until Spring , Bandini , and Ask the Dust , and I think a few stories , if I ’m not mistaken .
Or am I wrong ?
That book I loaned to Bukowski , I know I can get it back .
Joyce Fante : I think that ’s about right .
In My Dog Stupid , it ’s Henry Molise .
BP : Which is the same name in Brotherhood .
What was the reason for going back to Bandini , first of all ?
John Fante :
You mean the name ?
BP : Yeah , or back to the character of Arturo Bandini .
JF : I do n’t know .
There was no particular reason .
BP : Why did you go back into the world of the ’30s ?
JF : Because that was the era of the books , incidents , right there .
I wanted to write about that period , and that period actually was prior to Ask the Dust .
BP : Ask the Dust was as a young man , was n’t it ?
He ’s like 22 , 23 ?
JF : Yeah .
BP : So that would be in the late ’ 20s , would n’t it , or early ’30s ?
I guess you have to go back to that question of when you first came to Los Angeles .
Was it ’ 31 or later ?
JF : ’31 .
BP : So Ask the Dust really took place about that time .
Another linkup is the work that Towne did on Chinatown .
I wo n’t put that in , but he lifted some of the atmosphere .
Joyce Fante :
That was how he came to read Ask the Dust .
He was researching the period and found Ask the Dust in the library .
BP : So Ask the Dust really takes place over a period of about a year , 1931 , and when that book came out , it was your second published novel .
Shortly after that , you began to do work in the studios , so it was maybe ’ 32 , ’33 ?
John Fante : Uh-hm .
BP : And that gave you the background of writing Dreams from Bunker Hill , which really covers a period of how many years , would you say ?
JF : A couple years .
[ Phone call for John – tape stops ]
BP : Let ’s see now , I ’m a little lost , not doing my job here [ laughs ] .
I know where I was .
So we go back into , let ’s say ’ 32 , ’33 .
Are you all right , John ?
I do n’t want to push this too hard .
JF : I ’m all right .
BP : And you started working at what particular studio ?
JF : Warner Bros .
BP : And you worked there off and on for the next ten years ?
JF : No , I worked there , RKO , Republic and Fox .
Joyce Fante : Universal ?
John Fante : No .
BP : How about MGM , did you work there ?
JF : Yes , I worked at MGM .
BP : So the film writing starts in the ’30s and goes all the way through the ’70s ?
JF : Yes , that ’s right .
BP : Writing the book – this is the hard part in terms of being an interviewer and asking you these questions delicately – you wrote the book because it was an experience you knew and enjoy –
JF : Yeah , it was basically autobiographical .
BP : You took the character of Bandini , returning again to your youth , really , pre-Full of Life .
What was it like to write a book having lost your vision , writing a book without being able to see and without being able to type ?
JF : It did n’t bother me any .
Naturally , I miss my sight and regretted not having it .
But I did n’t – I was n’t depressed about it .
I was philosophical .
BP : The book is not depressing .
It has a lot of humorous passages .
JF : Yes .
BP : How exactly did you do your work ?
JF : I dictated it to Joyce , she put it down in long - hand and then typed it out .
And there it was .
BP : How did you feel about doing it , Joyce ?
Joyce Fante : I was delighted he was doing it , and I loved the material , and I was very enthusiastic .
I was n’t quite sure how to set out fiction because I ’d never written fiction , but I looked at John ’s previous work , saw how he did it , and tried to set it up as close as possible to his style , as to paragraph breaks and so on .
BP : The whole bit of what chapters ?
Joyce Fante : Yes , short chapters .
John would tell me when he wanted to make a paragraph and when he wanted a chapter break .
BP : So you had to read the whole thing back to him constantly ?
John Fante : Yeah .
BP : Was there a great deal of rewriting ?
JF : Very little .
Joyce Fante : Almost none .
BP : That ’s amazing .
Fante ’s son : Can I say something here , Ben ?
BP : Sure .
Fante ’s son : Mom could work as an editor .
She has … a great feel for literature .
So that ’s how they work , they ’re very simpatico with each other .
BP : I do think that ’s an amazing part of the story , it really definitely is .
Joyce Fante : I do n’t want you to overemphasize what I did .
It ’s completely John ’s work .
All I did was write it down .
BP : I know that .
I saw some of it at times after you had finished writing and what you had done .
I saw the notebooks , the tablets ; you worked on yellow tablets .
Joyce Fante : John ’s way of working is highly individual , I think , because he does most of his work before he begins to write , so to speak , and he knows exactly that it ’s going to be like before he starts to dictate .
BP : The fact is that the novel was really in your head ?
John Fante : Yeah .
BP : You said one thing – this I did have in the other piece I wrote – that you were tougher on yourself than you had been when you were simply typing it out .
Why was that ?
JF : I do n’t know , except that I recognized the fact that I was blind and I wanted to overcome that , so I devoted more attention to the work .
BP : What part did Bukowski play in this , in terms of bringing the work along ?
JF : Nothing .
BP : I do n’t mean in terms of the writing .
I mean in terms of the publishing .
JF : Nothing .
[ Pause ]
I ’m trying to relate Bukowski to John Martin .
BP : What I would say – I ’m not trying to put words in your mouth , but Bukowski had been a tremendous fan of your work for many years , and he began to mention your work in print just about this time .
JF : That ’s a great idea .
BP : Especially in Women , but there are other places , also .
I also think by writing the introduction to Ask the Dust , which was the book that was a tremendous influence on his own work and his own life , that was to me a very significant breakthrough , and it was perhaps one of the reasons why Martin read the book .
It was n’t the reason he took it , but it was one of the reasons he read it .
JF : That ’s true , that ’s true .
Joyce Fante : Bukowski called frequently , and we had very friendly conversations , but nothing about the book .
BP : The other way around , you can make a very good case that your work has had a tremendous influence on him , and he ’s not ashamed to say that , especially in terms of the style , in terms of the short chapters and in terms of putting a tremendous amount of energy into short chapters to make them lively and readable .
How do you see the Bandini saga now as you look back on it ?
Is it something – did you think it would go in this direction when you started it years ago and you wrote the first book , Wait Until Spring ?
John Fante : No .
BP : Did you perceive it as something that would have a continuum ?
JF : No , I did n’t .
BP : When you wrote
Ask the Dust , did you see it as something that would have a continuum ?
JF : No .
BP : So you simply used the character of Bandini in Ask the Dust because it was autobiographical ?
JF : I just used chunks of my life , and they fell into place time - wise .
BP : I see .
Now as you look back on it , do you see it as a continuum ?
JF : What ?
BP : The Bandini saga , starting with Wait Until Spring ?
JF : No , I do n’t see it as a saga .
But somebody who was publishing it might see it as that ; it ’s a good gimmick .
BP : Is there a missing chunk in there somewhere ?
JF : No .
BP : So you think it pretty much goes along the way you wanted it ?
JF : Yeah .
I could get another book out of it , though .
BP : If you were thinking in that direction , where would you go ?
Or do you think about it ?
JF : I would go into the period before I got married , before I came to Los Angeles .
BP : So that would be somewhere in between Ask the Dust and Wait Until Spring , Bandini ?
JF : Yeah .
BP : In your teenage years ?
JF : Right .
BP : How old were you when you came out here ?
JF : 21 .
No , 20 .
BP : Okay , I think that ’s probably a good place for me to stop , unless you have anything for me to add .
JF : No .
But now that you ’ve sort of planted the course , I ’ll think along that way , and I may be able to come up with some more material .

There was a sixth tape in the last year of John Fante ’s life .
He was at the Hollywood Home in the San Fernando Valley .
I went to see him twice with Marlene Sinderman , my girlfriend at the time .
Marlene was also diabetic and losing her sight .
John had met her for lunch at the house on Point Dume when I completed the fifth tape .
At the end of his life , John was sad and a little delusional .
He told me there was an orderly at the home who wanted to kill him with a poison dart .
He said he was not often visited by anyone .
He was glad to hear ( he couldn ” see ) Marlene and me again .
He asked a few questions about Black Sparrow .
Would they give him an advance ?
I had to laugh .
I felt I had done my little part and the rest was in the hands of the gods .
I told him about my idea for a Bukowski book when Bukowski was a nazi in college .
He laughed at that and encouraged me to write it .
I did .
Every agent who ever read it told me they would actively make sure my novel never got published .
That was what John Fante told me would happen .
It ’s called it The Victory of Defeat and it will be out on the internet next year .
Life goes on , mostly without agents .
Hope you enjoyed these tapes as much as I did .
Bukowski liked to call me his Boswell , but I think I did a better job with John Fante that I did with Bukowski .
Buk was a great self promoter .
Look for the Bukowski tapes to appear soon .
Amazing stuff you ’ve never heard of .
The last John Fante tape I destroyed .
It was the right thing to do .
Yes , life is a dream here on the Hamakua Coast , where the land is slowly returning to what it once was when the Hawaiian monarchy ruled here .
There ’s peace everywhere .
The sugar cane grows wild up the hillsides and all the refineries are long gone .
I have never met a Hollywood agent anywhere between Hilo and Honoka ’a .
Yes , life goes on here .
There ’s so much to discover .
So aloha and mahalo .
May these tapes allow you to hear the true voice of John Fante , and see before your eyes , at least in dreams , Camilla Lopez and Arturo Bandini .
They will live forever .

There ’s a reason why we included the “ always present threat for a new Radiohead album ” in our recent “ 35 More Albums to Buy in 2010 ” list ” : because there really is an always present threat for a new Radiohead album , a reality that guitarist Ed O’Brien again affirmed when he recently appeared on the BBC radio program Adam Buxton ’s Big Mixtape .
“ Ideally , it ’d be great if it came out sometime this year .
It ’s got to .
I hope so , ” O’Brien answered when asked by Buxton when the band ’s followup to 2007 ’s In Rainbows will be released .
He explained that “ We ’re at the studio at the moment … we ’re in the heart of the record , ” but added “ the finishing line … it ’s in touching distance ” and , barring any last minute problems , the record will likely be completed in “ a matter of weeks . ”
O’Brien would give no real specifics , but did feel confident enough to say “ I ’m really excited …
I feel like this is the best record we ever made .
It really is genuinely exciting .
It ’s very different from what we did last time . ”
[ And breathe ]
Radiohead has reportedly been working on its untitled eight LP since July 2009 .
In December , O’Brien told Rolling Stone that the band is in a “ very different place , a very new place . ”
There have also been rumors that the album may feature some orchestral elements .
All that said , no definitive description of the album ’s sound has been offered .
Before any new Radiohead record is released , however , both frontman Thom Yorke and drummer Phil Selway have solo tour dates to attend to this summer .
Below , you can find a full listing of these dates , as well as O’Brien ’s interview in full ( via at ease ) .
The Radiohead guitarist also used the appearance to show off his personal mixtape , which includes David Bowie , Diplo , XTC , and of course Radiohead .

Very sad news today for Manga lovers .
It seems that one of the largest sites for manga scanlations is shutting its door soon .
Onemanga.com will be taking down the site at the end of this week due to pressures by Manga puplishers .
This is quite sad as One Manga usually put up the latest Japanese versions of Manga titles with full English translations well in advance before they are published here in the states .
That means that those who came to read such popular titles as Naruto , One Piece , Bleach , and others must now find an alternative site to read them or just wait until they are released here .
Here is the notice from the site owner :
Sad news indeed .
If you are a fan of the Shonen Jump series , you can still read them here at Mangastream.com … for now .

DENVER --
A laid off paramedic who turned to delivering pizzas to make ends meet is credited with saving the life of a man who went into cardiac arrest just as a pizza was delivered to his door .
Christopher Wuebben , 22 , was delivering a pizza late last week to the suburban Denver home of George Linn , when he heard the man ’s wife screaming for help , according to Wuebben ’s boss , John Keiley .
“ Chris told the woman that he was trained in CPR and knew what to do , ” Keiley , owner of Johnny ’s New York Pizza , said on Tuesday .
“ He got him on the floor and brought him back to life before the fire department showed up . ”
Linn was transported to Swedish Medical Center where he is listed in serious condition in the hospital ’s critical care unit , hospital spokeswoman Julie Lonborg told Reuters .
Keiley said Wuebben is a military veteran who recently moved to Colorado after he was laid off from his paramedic job in Illinois .
He said Wuebben is not scheduled to work at the pizza restaurant until later in the week , but Keiley may not have his new employee for long .
At least one local hospital and a fire department have called to offer Wuebben a job in his chosen field after hearing of his heroics .
“ He ’s a good kid who was very nonchalant about what he did and hopefully this will work out for him , ” Keiley said .
Review of Django 1.2 E-commerce
I 've worked with Django for more than two years now .
The majority of the sites I have worked on have been social - networking or content based , but I have yet to do any serious work on a site where the main purpose is to advertise and sell products .
So I when a copy of ‘ Django 1.2 e- commerce ’ landed on my desk I was intrigued by what it might cover that I had n't been exposed to with other fields of Django development .
The book starts out with a brief run-down of Django .
The first chapter is more of a explanation of the philosophy behind Django , and definitely not a tutorial .
Which I think is fair enough ; if you are building an e-commerce site , you are probably a professional Python developer and there are plenty of books to get you up to speed with Django .
In the second chapter , the author runs through a simple web - shop application with an inventory and a ‘ buy now ’ button – which seemed more like a confidence building exercise than anything else , but it does do a good job of demonstrating how simple it can be to build this kind of application with Django .
The subsequent chapters go in to detail regarding managing users , shopping - carts and taking payments with Google Checkout and Amazon services .
I 've never used these payment services , so I found the information particularly interesting .
I like the author 's approach of making generic views in order to share functionality across payment services , but I would have liked some more detail in to the APIs involved .
Chapter 6 was a surprise , it covers a variety of modules that you can use to add powerful search capabilities to your application .
Django 's database querying will only get you so far with searching , if you need more sophisticated searching of the kind you would expect from Google then you will need to integrate one of a number of external modules and services , which chapter 6 covers pretty well .
The following chapter covers exposing data via several APIs , and creating PDF reports with ReportLab , but not in any great detail .
I was impressed with chapter 8 , which covers writing JavaScript to create rich AJAX interfaces – something which is pretty much expected in a modern web - site .
I would have preferred a more detail here , but only because I have a particular interest in front - end technologies .
The next chapter explains how to integrate a Django application with Amazon payment services and S3 storage to sell digital goods , and goes it to more detail than other chapters .
The final chapter covers a number of options you will have for deploying your application .
If your application is moderately sophisticated and has many components , deployment can be a tricky affair .
This chapter explains how Python technologies such as Fabric , Buildout and Virtualenv can ease deployment headaches .
It also covers serving the site with Apache and ‘ mod_wsgi ’ .
The code snippets in this book are pretty good at demonstrating the subjects covered , but I did notice some quite glaring syntax errors in several of the code examples .
The errors were n't subtle either ; they would result in the code not even running .
I suspect that many of them were likely to be the result of a non-technical editor re-formating the code and not a mistake on the part of the author , but there were also a number of programming errors and bad practices which were a little disapointing to see in a book aimed at professionals .
For instance , the author consistently used the ‘ is ’ operator in place of the equality operator ( they are not interchangable even though they may appear to be ) .
Overall , my impression of this book was favourable .
It 's definitely not a tutorial book in that its not going to teach you any new skills – since it covers so many technologies and does n't go in to great detail about any of them .
What it will do is give you a grounding of the components in an e-commerce system .
If you are looking to build some kind of web - shop in Django then I would recommend this book .
It 's less of an essential purchase if you are n't working with e-commerce , but since many of the topics discussed in Django 1.2 e-commerce are applicable to other web - sites you may still want to check this book out .
Enlarge Carl's Jr. Talk about beefy : :
Three meat patties , three slices of cheese .
The fast - food world has proof positive that size matters : a foot - long cheeseburger .
A cheeseburger sold as a foot - long sandwich , with three burgers and three cheese slices , is being tested at 50 Carl 's Jr. restaurants in Southern California and 50 Hardee 's units in Indiana .
That 's the same chain that introduced the world to the 1,400 - calorie Monster Burger and the Monster Breakfast Sandwich , with 47 grams of fat .
PHOTO GALLERY : More outrageous foods DEMAND : KFC keeps selling bunless , meaty Double Down
The move comes at a time fast - food chains are focused on concocting more items intriguingly low in price but large in size .
This summer , there 's serious foot - long - on - the - cheap mania .
The Carl 's foot - long fetches $ 4 without lettuce and tomatoes , $ 4.50 with .
Sonic just added a $ 2.99 foot - long hot dog this month .
Subway , the king of the $ 5 sub , will roll out a line of spicy foot - longs in mid-August .
Quiznos is eyeing a line of premium foot - longs early this fall — one made with prime rib — for $ 5 .
" We live in a society that 's fascinated with all things big , " says Scott Hume , editor of BurgerBusiness.com , an industry trade site .
" It 's inherently American to push for something bigger and better than anyone else has . "
The foot - long burger idea was hatched two months ago from a product development chef at Carl 's , says Brad Haley , marketing chief .
The chain is especially eager to create products that appeal to its core customers : young men ages 18 to 24 .
" Obviously , the foot - long sandwich has been very successful at Subway .
But we decided to do it the Carl 's way . "
That means big — and controversial .
The sandwich has 850 calories with 20 grams of saturated fat .
It 's served on a white sub roll , sliced in half and wrapped in butcher paper .
If it 's a hit in testing , it could be sold at all Carl 's and Hardee 's — sister chains in different regions of the country — within three to six months , Haley says .
The move , Hume says , is clearly a response to the wild success that Subway has had with its $ 5 subs .
" Subway is taking ' share of stomach ' from the burger places , too , " Hume says .
Responds
Haley , " I 'd rather have a charbroiled , foot - long cheeseburger than a cold , foot - long deli sandwich any day . "
There are plenty of others in the foot - long hunt : • Subs .
Subway 's new line of subs will be its spiciest , says Tony Pace , who oversees marketing for the brand 's franchisees .
" We consider the $ 5 foot - long a powerful brand for us , " he says .
It 's also recently begun to offer Steak & Cheese Omelet foot - longs at breakfast .
Quiznos is expanding its $ 5 foot - long menu next week with two new subs , including a Turkey and Ham sub , says Greg MacDonald , president .
He vows that by fall , with the prime rib sub , " We 're going to take $ 5 subs to a whole new level . "
• Hot dogs .
Sonic 's Foot - Long Quarter Pounder Coney is 11/2 inches longer than its previous longest hot dog , says Dominic Losacco , marketing vice president .
And it 's topped with hot chili and melted cheese .
Sonic also rolled out a s'more - like Campfire Blast dessert this summer that 's made with ice cream blended with toasted graham crackers and covered with chocolate and marshmallows .
But , Losacco insists , " There are no plans for foot - long sundae . "

Following on from Sean ’s thesis on women I thought that I would say a quick word about tea .
Sean rightly said that tea is like a cuddle in a cup , however what Sean did n’t mention is that some teas are a lot cuddlier than others .
Up until last summer the cuddliest tea that I knew was milky sugary black tea .
It is what you give people who are sick or in shock .
It ’s what you want when it ’s cold and rainy outside and it is of course a whole hell of a lot cuddlier than black tea all on its own .
Then however I went to India .
We may think that we like tea over here but in India people are seriously mental for tea .
They drink tea all the time and in various different forms and it turns out that some of these forms are even cuddlier than the traditional Irish cup of tea .
Chai means tea in Hindi and the most popular and basic form of chai is made using black tea leaves which are boiled with fresh chopped ginger and green cardamom and then milk and sugar is added and it all boils up together and then the tea is ready .
The addition of these two ingredients to our milky sugary favourite makes it somehow amazingly more delicious and also more cuddly , it ’s a lot more fragrant too which helps .
There are a lot of things that can be added to this version of chai tea , most commonly cinnamon , nutmeg , cloves and black pepper but these things do tend to give the tea a slightly spicy aftertaste and this is n’t all that cuddly .
These variations on chai tea were available all over Northern India where we were travelling .
We were offered chai in shops , from street vendors in the school that we worked and in every home that we went visited .
Then as we travelled further north into the Himalayan mountains and as the climate got colder we found what could possibly be the cuddliest form of tea .
This tea is made using very similar ingredients to the chai that I described earlier but instead of boiling water , boiling milk is used .
This makes it a lot like a tea version of hot chocolate .
A really easy way to make this tea is to use a masala chai tea bag which usually has black tea and a combination of other spices .
Really nice fairtrade masala chai tea bags are available in Oxfam .
Just boil the milk in a saucepan and then pour the hot milk into a mug and throw in the tea bag .
Leave it to brew for a few minutes and then add sugar to taste .
And there you go , possibly the most cuddly tea in the world .
There is however a limit to the amount of caffeine that one person can handle in one day .
So if you have reached your jitteriest but still want a cup full of cuddle herbal and fruit teas are probably the way to go .
Matchabar in the Powerscourt centre do delicious fruit and herbal teas , the shop has a brilliant old pharmacy feel to it with all the different tea containers and the owners are very friendly and helpful .
( As an aside they also do lovely tea cups and saucers , as well as tea containers which are great presents for tea and coffee lovers . )
Another great herbal source is the brand clement and pekoe .
Their fruit tissane tea is great and is a brilliant pink colour to boot .
Add a slice of lemon and some honey to a nice cup of fruit tea and it will rival its other leafy counterparts in cuddliness no bother .
So there you have it , a brief guide to getting the most cuddles out of your tea .
Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh famously said he hoped President Obama would “ fail ” in January , 2009 .
Almost a year later , when Limbaugh was rushed to the hospital with chest pains , Washington Post reporter David Weigel had a wish of his own .
“ I hope he fails , ” Weigel cracked to fellow liberal reporters on the “ Journolist ” email list - serv .
“ Too soon ? ” he wondered .
Weigel was hired this spring by the Post to cover the conservative movement .
Almost from the beginning there have been complaints that his coverage betrays a personal animus toward conservatives .
E-mails obtained by the Daily Caller suggest those complaints have merit .
“ Honestly , it ’s been tough to find fresh angles sometimes –how many times can I report that these [ tea party ] activists are joyfully signing up with the agenda of discredited right - winger X and discredited right - wing group Y ? ”
Weigel lamented in one February email .
In other posts , Weigel describes conservatives as using the media to “ violently , angrily divide America . ”
According to Weigel , their motives include “ racism ” and protecting “ white privilege , ” and for some of the top conservatives in D.C. , a nihilistic thirst for power .
“ There ’s also the fact that neither the pundits , nor possibly the Republicans , will be punished for their crazy outbursts of racism .
Newt Gingrich is an amoral blowhard who resigned in disgrace , and Pat Buchanan is an anti-Semite who was drummed out of the movement by William F. Buckley .
Both are now polluting my inbox and TV with their bellowing and minority - bashing .
They ’re never going to go away or be deprived of their soapboxes , ” Weigel wrote .
Of Matt Drudge , Weigel remarked , “ It ’s really a disgrace that an amoral shut - in like Drudge maintains the influence he does on the news cycle while gay - baiting , lying , and flubbing facts to this degree . ”
In March , Weigel wrote that the problem with the mainstream media is “ this need to give equal / extra time to ‘ real American ’ views , no matter how fucking moronic , which just so happen to be the views of the conglomerates that run the media and / or buy up ads . ”
When Obama ’s “ green jobs czar ” Van Jones resigned after it was revealed he signed a 9/11 “ truther ” petition , alleging the government may have conspired to allow terrorists to kill 3,000 civilians , Weigel highlighted the alleged racism of Glenn Beck – Jones ’s top critic .
“ One extra , obvious point–Beck ’s campaign against Jones was transparently racial . . . he treated his very white , very angry audience to video after video of Jones giving scorching speeches .
At one point Beck just eschewed subtlety and played videos of Jones alongside videos of Jeremiah Wright while he remained on the screen mugging like Harpo Marx , ” Weigel said .
Right wing “ memes ” begin in “ WND / FreeRepublic / talk radio swamps , ” Weigel wrote , referring to conservative websites World Net Daily and Free Republic .
Sometimes , they spread like a virus into liberal sites , a fact that clearly upsets Weigel .
After Sarah Palin claimed Obama ’s health care legislation included “ death panels ” that would ration health care , for instance , the Huffington Post reported that many Americans believed the claim was true .
Weigel suggested that reporting on the subject might be counter - productive to liberal policy aims .
The Huffington Post , Weigel pointed out , ran “ a picture of Sarah Palin , linking to a poll that suggests 45 percent of Americans believe her death panel lie .
But as long as the top liberal - leaning news site talks about it every single hour of every day , I ’m sure that number will go down . ”
“ Let ’s move the fuck on already , ” Weigel wrote .
Weigel seems to harbor special contempt for a type of conservative he calls a ratfucker , a favorite phrase of his .
In a thread with the subject line , “ ACORN Ratf * cker arrested , ” Journolisters discussed how James O’Keefe , whose undercover reporting showed officials from activist group ACORN willing to help a fake prostitution ring skirt the law , had been arrested in another , failed operation at Sen.
Mary Landrieu ’s ( D - LA ) office .
Weigel ’s response : “ HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
. ”
“ Deep breath . ”
“ HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHAHAHA . ”
“ He ’s either going to get a radio talk show or start a prison ministry .
That ’s was successful conservative ratfuckers do for their second acts , ” Weigel wrote , likely alluding to Nixon aide Charles Colson who converted to Christianity after a stint in prison for obstruction of justice and founded Prison Fellowship .
Republicans ?
“ Ratfucking [ Obama ] on every bill . ” Palin ?
Tried to “ ratfuck ” a moderate Republican in a contentious primary in New York .
Limbaugh ?
Used “ ratfucking tactics ” in urging Republican activists to vote for Hillary Clinton in open primaries after Obama had all but beat her for the Democratic nomination .
Reached by phone late Thursday and asked about the e-mails , Weigel responded , “ my reporting , I think , stands for itself . ”
“ I ’ve always been of the belief that you could have opinions and could report anyway …. people are n’t usually asked to stand or fall on everything they ’ve said in private . ”
In the e-mails , Weigel appeared particularly invested in the President ’s health care law , expressing undisguised scorn for moderate Democrats who seemed fearful about voting for it .
Rep. Daniel Lipinski , a pro-life Democrat from Illinois who expressed reservations about the abortion provisions in the legislation was , according to Weigel , a “ monster ” because he represents “ a deeply safe seat ” and could afford to vote for it .
Before he left Congress in a cloud , then - Rep. Eric Massa rocked Washington by claiming that backroom deals were polluting the health care bill .
Weigel seemed to have little patience for Massa ’s inconvenient allegations .
“ Well , so much for the health care push leading the news cycle , ” Weigel wrote .
“ Does anyone else think this guy ’s turning out to be a political suicide bomber ? ”
After Scott Brown won the Massachusetts Senate seat , threatening to kill the health care legislation by his presence , Weigel stressed how important it was for reporters to highlight what a terrible candidate his opponent Martha Coakley had been .
“ I think pointing out Coakley ’s awfulness is vital , because it ’s 1 ) true and 2 ) unreasonable panic about it is doing more damage to the Democrats , ” Weigel wrote .
But despite the perils of the modern media cycle , the health care bill survived , and for once , all was right in Weigel ’s world .
“ Tangentially related : Betsy McCaughey showed up at Grover Norquist ’s conservative meeting today , massive spiral - bound health care bill in hand , and shook with rage as she promised that the ‘ war ’ was not over . ”
“ I ’m still smiling . ”
Ed. note :
A previous version of this story incorrectly reported a Weigel e-mail about “ moronic ” views of the American public as having been written in April .
It was written March 12 .

Whenever the government causes a mess , chances are high that it will accuse speculators of being responsible .
In the recent financial crisis , speculators and their financial instruments have been under attack again .
Some famous investors have even supported governments ' attacks on speculators .
Warren Buffet has called derivatives " financial weapons of mass destruction .
George Soros has argued in favor of a ban on naked credit - default swaps .
In the current sovereign - debt crisis that is rolling over Europe , speculators , and especially credit - default swaps , are suffering another assault .
The assault has an obvious aim : governments want to shift attention and blame to speculators .
But who is responsible for government debts if not governments themselves ?
In an attempt to find a scapegoat , the German government has banned all naked sovereign - credit - default swaps in Germany .
There are plans to extend this ban to the rest of the European Union .
But what is a ( naked ) credit - default swap ?
A credit - default swap may be described as an insurance that investors buy to compensate for a loss if a particular debtor defaults on its obligation .
Imagine that an investor holds a million - dollar bond issued by Citigroup .
If the insurance premium ( CDS spread ) is 25 basis points , or 0.25 percent , the investor can insure himself against a default by paying an annual fee of 0.25 percent of one million , i.e. $ 2,500 .
CDS spreads indicate the insurance premium and the confidence in the underlying bond .
If Citigroup defaults on its bond , the investor receives one million dollars in exchange for the bond .
An intriguing aspect of CDSs is that you can buy them even if you do not own any debt from the company that they refer to .
These are the infamous naked credit - default swaps .
By buying a CDSs on Citigroup without owning the corresponding bond , you can bet that Citigroup will default on its obligations .
By just paying $ 2,500 , a hedge fund could make a gross profit of $ 1,000,000 when Citigroup defaults on its obligations .
From a free - market point of view , betting on defaults of financial institutions is as legitimate as betting against a certain soccer team in the World Cup .
Yet , there is one important difference : in the case of financial institutions the betting can become self - validating .
For instance , investment funds bet on the downfall of Icelandic banks during the financial crisis by buying CDS on obligations of Icelandic banks .
It was in the fund 's interest to undermine people 's confidence and , thereby , promote their own investments .
But why did investors start to bet against Icelandic banks in the first place ?
Icelandic banks were highly dependent on wholesale short - term funding .
Once international liquidity evaporated , they could not roll over their short - term liabilities .
Moreover , their size made them too big to be bailed out by the Icelandic government .
The Icelandic financial system was the perfect target .
How could this bet then become self - validating ?
As the demand to buy protection on Icelandic banks increased , the price of the insurance increased in CDS markets and spreads on the banks rose .
The rising spreads indicated distrust in the banks .
Consequently , Icelandic banks had to pay higher interest rates on the market to attract new funds .
The rising spreads spurred further demand for insurance , leading to even higher spreads , and so on until the distrust in the banks reached a point where banks could not receive further funding and failed .
" By anticipating the future , speculators may bring about events earlier and reduce their potential harm . "
Due to this self - reinforcing spiral of distrust in banks and rising funding costs , people have regarded CDSs as one example of Warren Buffet 's infamous financial weapons of mass destruction .
Indeed , CDSs can be used to take down banks by lowering the confidence in them .
Yet , such an attack can only be successful if banks are vulnerable .
Only if banks violate the golden rule of banking , i.e. , if they mismatch currencies or maturities or engage in a combination of both , they become vulnerable to attacks through CDSs .
Only then will the distrust spurred by higher spreads translate into funding problems that threaten a bank 's liquidity .
When a bank matches maturities and currencies , holding 100 - percent reserves , the attack will be unsuccessful and will not bring down the bank .
In this case , speculators may ultimately suffer losses .
Increased spreads may spur distrust and bring about a loss of costumers that do not roll over funds or withdraw deposits .
However , a sound bank would not become illiquid or insolvent by such an attack .
Only fractional reserves , mismatching of maturities , and mismatching of currencies make banks vulnerable .
CDSs are powerful corrective instruments that discipline banks .
CDSs are not weapons of mass destruction but instruments of providing discipline and order .
It is possible that without rising CDSs spreads , Icelandic banks would have survived longer .
They would have had time to cause additional distortions and make the collapse even more disastrous .
But what about the sovereign - debt crisis and CDSs ?
It is true that CDSs and speculators can accelerate the sovereign debt crisis .
By buying CDS protection for Greek government bonds , investors bid up CDS spreads .
The higher spreads signal market participants that there is an increasing distrust in the Greek government 's capacity or willingness to honor its obligations .
The distrust causes higher yields of Greek bonds .
Interest - rate payments for the Greek government increase .
The higher burden of debt may lead to a further distrust in the Greek government , causing higher CDS spreads and so on .
Are the investors that trigger this downward spiral by betting on the Greek default via CDSs as harmful to society as governments suggest ?
Is it an illegitimate activity that should be banned ?
First , we have to take into account that these investors are risking their own money .
There is no guarantee that they make money .
They may be wrong with their expectation , and Greece 's government finances will be not as bad as they expected .
If they buy CDS and the spreads fall , they suffer losses .
Second , the investors perform an important social function .
They warn citizens that government finances may be unsustainable .
Their attack may actually increase the distrust in the capacities of government .
People will be less willing to buy government bonds .
They may , thereby , put a limit on further government debts .
The attack may cause a government default and thereby end the excessive government spending that distorts the economy .
What would be the alternative ?
The alternative would be a ban on naked CDSs .
Speculators would be prevented from triggering a fast default and the government could go on increasing public debts .
Most probably , the increase in public debts will also cause a default ; only later with more harm .
This is what speculation is all about .
By anticipating the future , speculators may bring about events earlier and reduce their potential harm .
Speculators anticipate a sovereign default and speculate in this direction via CDSs .
Thereby , they put a limit on the reckless fiscal behavior of the government .
In sum , CDS may be used as bets that can make unsound financial institutions and reckless governments fall sooner than they otherwise would .
Therefore , they are feared by governments .
Yet , the ultimate cause of the collapse is the reckless behavior and not the bet against its sustainability .
The bets may discipline and put , effectively , a stricter limit on reckless behavior .

I 'm very pleased to be able to officially announce that Goodreads now has an iPhone app , which is available in the Apple app store .
And , very excitingly , Apple was kind enough to notice and feature it , causing it to shoot to the top of the free books category ( for the moment anyways ) !
We built the app because many of our members have asked for an iPhone app , and because we think it will be very useful for Goodreads members on the go .
Also , mobile statistics on the growth of the iPhone in the US alone show it to be one of the fastest growing adoptions of a new device ever , so we think even more people will be able to take advantage of our app in the years to come .
Here is a full list of features the app offers :* Browse your shelves !
Next time you are in the library or bookstore , your to - read list will be handy . *
Add status updates and reviews of books you are reading .*
See book reviews and updates from your friends , and comment on them . *
Explore your friends shelves *
Explore some of popular book lists *
View literary events near youI 've been using the app for the last month and have to say I think it 's pretty slick .
There are still a few features I 've had to go to our mobile site for ( like groups ) , and we hope to add those in the coming months .
You may notice that on the app some books appear without cover images or descriptions or other pieces of data that appear on the site .
This is because , as some of you may remember , Goodreads uses Amazon book meta-data , and Amazon 's terms of service does n't allow iPhone apps .
Thus we have built this app with a completely separate source of book meta -data .
We are working on filling in these holes , and have already made great progress there .
If you have an iPhone or an iPod touch , please give the app a go - and do n't forget to give it an ( appropriately ) high rating !
If you have any feedback or thoughts on the app , please post them in the comments or in the Feedback Group thread Just for clarity as people have asked in the comments , we do have a decent mobile site that should work on any phone with a browser .
And we plan to build an Android app next .
If anyone knows a good Android developer let us know !
If you read the news last week thinking a trout - rich northern British Columbia lake was " saved " from being filled with toxic tailings from the proposed Prosperity mine , you would be wrong .

Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
Despite a negative environmental assessment report , the federal government could still find the project " justifiable under the circumstances " and give the go - ahead if it decides that other factors outweigh the environmental costs -- for example , the economic benefits of killing Teztan Biny Lake , also known as Fish Lake .
Unfortunately , if the government relies on the numbers handed to it by the panel , the measure of economic benefits the government will be vastly overestimated .
A strong independent case has been made that the mine will cost British Columbians more than it will benefit them -- but that analysis is not in front of federal decision makers .
A slew of adverse effects
The conclusion of last week 's assessment report from the federal government 's Prosperity review panel was that an array of significantly adverse effects would inevitably result if Taseko 's copper - gold mining project in the Chilcotin area was to proceed .
The panel concluded that the Taseko's mine would result in significant adverse effects to fish and fish habitat , navigation , current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes by Aboriginal communities , cultural heritage , and on certain Aboriginal title and rights in the area .
Unlike most federal assessment panels , which do not find significant adverse effects of proposed projects , this one found a slew of them .
Strangely , however , the panel did n't , or could n't , actually recommend to the federal authorities that in the light of all these negative impacts the project ought not to be approved .
Instead , the panel was directed to provide information to the ministers to help them decide whether or not the project could be justified , even if there were adverse effects .
One of the usual suspects in these matters of justifiability is , of course , the alleged substantial economic benefits of the proposed project .
In this case , the numbers trotted out by Taseko are not inconsequential -- 375 direct jobs , an annual payroll of approximately $ 30 million , $ 200 million in annual expenditures in the provincial economy , some $ 30 million in government revenues , and an overall injection of $ 50 billion into the economy over 20 years .
These are , unfortunately , the numbers the panel passed along to the ministers as reliable information on the economic benefits of the project the ministers could consider in their decision - making .
The difficulty with all this is that in terms of identifying the net economic benefits of the project , the numbers provided by the company are seriously misleading .
Relying on the company ’s numbers
The panel had expert evidence before it that Taseko had substantially overestimated the economic benefits of its project and yet , in providing information to the ministers concerning justifiability , it did not pass on the only independent analysis available .
This is bad news , because it is virtually certain that the ministers will examine the issue of economic benefits if they contemplate approving the project despite the serious environmental and cultural consequences identified by the panel .
Not incidentally , these are the same numbers with which Robin Jungers , then executive director of the BC Environmental Assessment Office , " justified " the project in his December 2009 recommendation to provincial ministers to approve the project , even though the loss of Fish Lake was determined to be a significant adverse environmental effect .
B.C.'s review of the Prosperity mine was a sham in many ways , but this particular move by the executive director to rely on extraneous information from the company about the presumed economic benefits to justify approval to the provincial ministers was outright shameful .
The economics of Prosperity were never independently examined by the B.C. review process , and the executive director had no business writing off the environmental impacts of Prosperity against presumed economic benefits .
The unreliability of Taseko's stated numbers came to light when independent expert evidence on the economics of the project was presented to the Prosperity panel .
Huge costs not taken into account
Marvin Shaffer , an SFU professor and prominent resource economist in B.C. , examined the company 's statements of net costs and benefits of the project , and concluded that the net costs would significantly exceed the estimated benefits .
For example , Shaffer noted in his technical submission that Taseko estimated it would be buying power at $ 37 per MWh , based on what it is currently paying for power at its operating Gibraltar mine near Williams Lake .
However , the cost to BC Hydro of acquiring this power would be much higher .
Shaffer used Hydro's 2006 call for energy , which averaged $ 88 per MWh , to conclude that Hydro would lose $ 50 on each incremental MWh , or approximately $ 35 million each year over the mine life .
This cost would ultimately be borne by all the customers of Hydro .
Shaffer told the panel that the BC EAO 's conclusion that " there is no expected cost to future generations except for the loss of Fish Lake and Little Fish lake ” was factually incorrect .
There would be a very large , on - going cost to present and future generations from this arrangement .
Shaffer also noted there would be some employment net benefits , but these would be limited by the fact that labour shortages are expected in the medium to long term , and the job opportunities generated by the project are not likely to employ persons who would otherwise be unemployed .
Similarly , there are some government net benefits from mineral taxes and income taxes , but these are far less than the gross tax impacts presented by Taseko , and not at all certain .
Tax revenues overestimated
As for tax revenues to government , Shaffer questioned the company 's estimate of $ 25 million per year , stating that the effective tax rate , taking into account financing and corporate tax strategies , would be less that $ 7.5 million .
Further , there is no certainty such payments would be made , since it would depend upon the economic performance of the mine and the corporate strategies used to minimize payments .
Joan Kuyek , testifying for MiningWatch Canada corroborated Shaffer 's point that actual taxes paid by the company could be significantly less than what Taseko was alleging .
On its Gibraltar mine , according to Kuyek , Taseko paid mineral taxes of $ 606,000 on an operating profit of $ 28.1 million in 2008 , and $ 981,000 on an operating profit of $ 48.3 million in 2009 , the tax averaging some two per cent over these two years .
As for income taxes , Taseko estimated its 2009 tax at statutory rates of $ 3.38 million , but paid only $ 669,000 , slightly over one per cent of its operating profit .
In total , Shaffer concluded that the direct corporate income mineral and property taxes paid by the mine might yield up to $ 11 million per year , far less than the $ 35 million cost imposed on Hydro on each year .
Shaffer also did some calculations for air contaminant and GHG emissions costs to B.C. , showing that unless the mine pays carbon taxes or permit fees in amounts sufficient to offset these emissions , they could cost British Columbians some $ 2.6 million per year during construction and operation .
Other economic costs , unquantified but considered by Shaffer to be " strongly negative overall " include pressures on housing , services and infrastructure , impacts to traditional resources and cultural values of the affected Aboriginal communities .
Shaffer pointed out that decision - makers need to look at net economic benefits , and determine whether they would be of a magnitude that would offset the adverse effects .
So , for example , potential estimates of employment induced by the project would need to consider the incremental employment or other benefits of those jobs relative to what those hired would otherwise be doing .
Similarly with estimates of government revenue impacts -- these need to indicate the incremental revenues governments would receive and would need to net out the incremental expenditures government would incur .
British Columbians could lose big
Shaffer 's overall conclusion is that contrary to Taseko's pronouncements that the project would generate billions of dollars of net benefits , the project would appear , based on available information , to generate significant net costs for British Columbians and Canadians as a whole .
Not including the unquantified environmental , cultural and social costs , Shaffer concludes that the net costs of the project would average $ 20 million per year over the life of the mine .
This number is based on Shaffer 's use of the 2006 reference rate for power at $ 88 per MWh -- recent numbers in the media suggest electricity from Site C at $ 160 per MWh .
The picture from all this is that the net economic benefits of the proposed Prosperity mine will be substantially less than what the company tells us and may , in fact , be negative overall .
So , if the federal cabinet is even thinking of justifying the project on economic grounds , it would be well served by careful scrutiny of the evidentiary record from the panel hearings , or else an independent critical assessment of the project economics by someone who knows what they 're doing .
First off I know the reviews are usually Kelson ’s thing ( and you can expect to see his later in the week ) but I decided to share my two cents and take a shot at it .

Ok , this is the way a Flash relaunch needs to be done ; Fast and Furiously .
Through the last two issues we ’ve been on a nonstop action - packed , roller coaster ride that shows no signs of letting up with Part 3 of The Dastardly Death of The Rogues .
As many of you may be aware I was not the biggest fan of Barry ’s return .
I love Wally and he has been a character that I loved reading about and identified with for years .
He was the Flash that I got into and despite the once off story featuring Barry ( JLA Year One , The Secret of Barry Allen , and Rogue War ) , he seemed like a distant memory of a character that died an awesome memorable death .
I ’m also a huge fan of legacy characters in general .
It ’s what made DC kind of stand out on it ’s own .
They had characters that got older , retired , or died and then a new hero would take their place .
When Barry died and Wally took his place as The Flash this was huge .
It was the first time we had seen a character developed as a sidekick take on the role of their mentor , the first time the inherent promise had been fulfilled .
In other words this was ground breaking and it stands out as one of DC ’s defining traits .
Allowing their heroes to age and move on ( quasi ) organically while still allowing the character ’s previous developments to shine is what DC has been doing pretty well for years .
Just one reason why I do n’t like all the back tracking .
Do n’t get me wrong , they ’ve done some great stuff with Barry Allen and Hal Jordan since their returns but I feel like nothing is making them that unique other than that they are older heroes returning to take back their mantles from their previous sidekicks ( or letting them co-exist like the superhero equivalent of Gallagher Too ) .
I loved the steady progression we were seeing in the DC Universe and it really made me feel like I was growing up alongside these characters .
I would n’t be disappointed if a newer younger version would take his place , I would expect it .
It needs to happen in order for others to have that feeling as well .
Of course as I said , it needs to happen organically ; when a character has without a doubt outlived their usefulness and needs a shake - up .
The problem is that this is mostly subjective , but certain things like sales , the ability to hold a solo title , etc , etc can ( and should ) be factors in whether a character is worth keeping around .
With that said , Barry Allen has just about won me over .
Just about .
First Johns is doing a great job turning these stories into Barry Allen stories .
Meaning that you ca n’t easily insert
Wally into these pages and call it the same story .
Barry ’s occupation is a huge part of this .
We get to see a Flash that actually works with the police and at the crime lab .
He is at the forefront of all information about Rogues and criminals running loose and then in an interesting twist has to do the forensics to convict them after taking them down .
I love how they are playing up the C.S.I. part of it and even flat out referencing it on the cover .
CSI : Central City .
I could definitely see The Flash being an awesome TV show if they emphasized the C.S.I. elements like Johns does in this issue .
There is also a noticeable lack of internal narration that we had with Wally that emphasizes that this is a different Flash through and through .
In contrast when Bart Allen took over as Flash they kept the internal narrative from Wally ’s run and I do n’t think this helped in establishing a whole new ball game .
We open with what we ’ve already seen in the Newsrama preview , Digger Harkness ( also known as Captain Boomerang ) is in the prison infirmary after a welcome home beating from the Iron Heights prison guards .
Boomerang attacks a guard in a last ditch attempt to escape his fate and is beaten and subdued fairly easily .
Facing another ruthless beating from the guards , Boomerang under duress utilizes his former Black Lantern abilities and creates explosive boomerangs out of thin air and takes care of the guards .
I guess that works .
I would have liked Boomerang to pull off something a little craftier than randomly developing powers to generate boomerangs out of thin air .
It would have been cool to actually see him pull off a real prison escape ala Piper .
Also part of the fun of Captain Boomerang was his ingenuity and over the top quality when crafting them .
These new developments reek of a nineties revamp .
In fact this reminds me of when The Punisher died and came back and was able to pull ghost weapons out of his trench coat .
He also fought angels .
Do n’t believe me ?
It was lame then and it ’s kind of lame now .
I can only hope once this Brightest Day thing is over that he somehow loses them .
Would the JLU Episode where he tied The Flash to a huge Boomerang be half as fun ?
With that said I can’t wait until we see Boomerang face off against The Flash .
Hopefully the ghosterangs will have some cooler properties than simply exploding , although it does n’t seem like it according to the Flash Fact at the end of this issue .
Now we get to the :
**** SPOILERS ****
When we left Barry last issue the evidence recovered in the investigation of the death of Mirror Monarch identified Barry Allen as the murderer .
Luckily Director
Singh blames it on scene contamination caused by Barry and the issue is quickly resolved .
I was wondering how Barry would get out of that one and I love that .
I ’ve begun to wonder again .
And surprisingly I ’m wondering more about whats going to happen next instead of when we will see Wally again .
Do n’t get me wrong , Barry will never supplant Wally West as my Flash , but I think that with the latest developments with Wally and the West family he should be at most in semi-retirement .
He has a family to raise and a daughter to train .
Oddly enough Barry while older has neither so I guess it makes sense in the scheme of things , I just wish they could have done this with Bart instead .
They were pretty much heading in that direction back in The Flash : The Fastest Man Alive when they killed Bart off anyway .
He had just joined the Police Academy and was studying Forensics .
Now that I think about it Marc Guggenheim actually used similar story elements to this one when Bart was almost arrested after Steppenwolf broke into Bart ’s locker .
He was looking for a device Bart recovered earlier from underneath Los Angeles after a fight with the ironically named one - shot villain , Impulse .
He escaped from the authorities by revealing that he was the Flash and then running to his final fate at the hands of the Rogues .
I guess Barry ’s stories are interchangeable with someone but I guess it works a bit better when you are in the actual crime lab and not a rookie recruit .
Or maybe Johns should never ever leave the Flash ever again …
But I digress , Barry and Iris meet for Coffee to discuss Barry ’s dilemma and a closed case that he is investigating when the Renegades strike again , in a scene that reminds me of Spider - Man 2 , when Peter and Mary Jane are talking in a coffee shop and Doctor Octopus throws a car through the window :
And while we are on the subject of art , Mr. Manapul ’s sketchy style has a way of drawing ( hehe ) me in nicely .
It seems as if he has come a long way in a very short time .
The Flash # 3 has impressive work throughout with scenes like this one :
Francis ’ style has a way of just making The Flash pop .
The way he conveys speed is only enhanced by his sketchy style giving a visually vibrant and unique feel of speed .
He really is making the Flash stand out as an iconic hero in a way that has n’t really been done since Howard Porter left the Flash along with Geoff Johns after Rogue War in 2006 .
Sure there have been a few flashes of excellence here and there ( Karl Kerschl , Tony Daniel ) but for the most part it ’s been pretty uneven in the art department .
Something you can’t have when the main draw of The Flash is his look and his speed .
Francis Manapul , Scott Kolins ( my personal favorite Flash artist ) , and Ivan Reis ( in Blackest Night and the Green Lantern tie-ins ) have done a great job maintaining the momentum and draw the Flash the way he should always be drawn .
Slender and sleek , not rippling with ridiculous muscles and kinetic , always on the move and bursting with vibrant energy .
After the initial attack , Barry checks on Iris while simultaneously asking her to check out Iron Heights through a contact and then changes into his working clothes .
The Renegades muse about the whereabouts of The Flash just as he appears and surrenders himself to the them in an effort to calm them down and avoid casualties .
The Renegades trap him in a supposedly speedster - proof force - field and begin reading Barry his rights .
After some back and forth , Barry uses the time talking to figure out the frequency of the field and jumps through .
Trixster comments that The Flash should not have been able to break through and Warlock replies that it ’s better they know now for their eventual encounter with Professor Zoom .
Love all the foreshadowing .
After a brief chase with some added foreshadowing of Iris Allen ’s future , Barry is apprehended again .
He is only saved by the sudden appearance of Captain Boomerang and his exploding ghosterangs setting up a three way battle between Barry , Boomerang and The Renegades next issue .
More props btw for the Renegade character designs .
The more and more I read this issue , the more and more it feels like an episode of a TV show or a treatment for a movie .
With the right material , the Renegades ’ costumes could translate very easily into contemporary Rogue movie costumes .
Francis did a fantastic job updating the Rogue ’s looks , especially with Commander Cold :
At the end in keeping with the spirit of Barry Allen and also hitting home a little more that this is Barry Allen ’s book and Barry Allen ’s stories , we have a Flash Fact .
Drawn by Scott Kolins and done in two parts , the first is a scientific explanation of how boomerangs work .
To illustrate it we have a young Digger Harkness , who is practicing throwing his boomerang before dinner .
The second part gives us a mini-profile of Captain Boomerang and his recent exploits .
Kind of an update for those who did n’t follow Blackest Night and are n’t following Brightest Day .
Geoff Johns has gone out of his way to make this book accessible to new readers , even in the third issue we are brought up to speed fairly quickly on what we ’ve missed earlier in the story .
All in all I give it a solid B+.
We all know Johns can write a good Flash story and he is n’t disappointing many here .
He is little by little fleshing Barry out a bit while also hitting home key things about him that will never change ;
His unswerving sense of right and wrong , his methodical approach to just about everything , his analytical scientific mind , and his love for Iris .
These things are what ultimately define Barry Allen and make him attractive as a character .
Johns knows this and plays it up well .
Francis Manapul ’s art helps move the story along at breakneck speed and stops for nothing .
His style fits the Flash better than anyone has consistently in a while and I hope that he is in for the long haul .
A few things , like the unnecessary change to Boomerang ’s powers kinda bug me , but I ’m a wait and see kind of guy .
I ’m sure Johns will find a way to make it work or hopefully it will be reversed by the time Brightest Day is over .
Thanks for reading .

This year , Bonkers Bolton and his Gang of Three ( Brits , French , Germans ) have managed to get the other members of the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors and the United Nations Security Council to commit assisted suicide , seriously undermining  as intended  the authority and effectiveness of the United Nations itself .
First , the IAEA  whose primary mission is to " seek to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace , health , and prosperity throughout the world . "
On Feb . 4 , 2006 , Bolton got the IAEA Board to pass a resolution [ . pdf ] that ( a ) begins by stipulating " that nothing in the Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable rights of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research , production , and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination , " but then perversely ( b ) goes on to not only deny Iran its inalienable NPT rights , but also presumes to make additional demands on Iran as an NPT - signatory .
Bolton had already attempted ( but failed ) to drastically modify the NPT at the 2005 NPT Review Conference , removing the demands made on us and the rights bestowed on everyone else .
Now , the IAEA Board " deemed it necessary " that Iran  inter alia  " ratify promptly and implement in full the Additional Protocol " to its NPT Safeguards Agreement .
Of course , the IAEA Board has no authority to make any such demands .
So recess - appointee Ambassador Bolton brought the IAEA resolution before the UN Security Council , which does .
But upon first referral , all Bolton got was a UNSC non-binding presidential statement , which begins ,
" The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and recalls the right of States Party , in conformity with articles I and II of that Treaty , to develop research , production , and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination . ”
Bummer .
Meanwhile , with Bush - Blair acquiescence  if not downright encouragement  the Israelis had launched a bona fide " act of aggression " against Lebanon .
Bolton soon had his hands full , preventing the Security Council from condemning Israel for it flagrant violations of the UN Charter , while strong - arming it into passing Resolution 1696 , which
“ Acting under Article 40 of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations
" Demands , in this context , that Iran shall suspend all enrichment - related and reprocessing activities , including research and development , to be verified by the IAEA . ”
What does that mean  " acting under Article 40 " ?
Well , Bolton had earlier strong - armed the IAEA Board of Governors into asking the Security Council to determine that Iran ’s refusal to re-suspend  as " required " by the UNSC presidential statement  certain IAEA safeguarded activities constituted under Article 39 a “ threat to the peace , breach of the peace , or act of aggression . ”
Article 40 says
" In order to prevent an aggravation of the situation , the Security Council may , before making the recommendations or deciding upon the measures provided for in Article 39 , call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable .
Such provisional measures shall be without prejudice to the rights , claims , or position of the parties concerned .
The Security Council shall duly take account of failure to comply with such provisional measures . "
Now , the Security Council has yet to determine under Article 39 that Iran ’s safeguarded activities constitute a threat to the peace , much less an act of aggression .
So , technically , the Council should n’t yet be " acting under Article 40 . "
Nor should the Council call upon Iran to take without further delay the steps required by the IAEA Board in its resolution of Feb. 4 , which included requiring Iran to " ratify promptly and implement in full the Additional Protocol " to its NPT Safeguards Agreement .
An Additional Protocol  once ratified  can hardly be considered a " provisional measure . "
The Council should n’t be " demanding " that Iran suspend safeguarded uranium enrichment activities .
After all , Bolton and his Gang of Three have made it clear such suspensions will hardly be temporary " provisional measures , " taken " without prejudice " to the exercise of Iran ’s " inalienable rights " under the NPT .
As Iran ’s UN representative , Javad Zarif , put it upon passage of UNSCR 1696 :
“ Today we are witness to an extremely dangerous trend ; while members of the NPT are denied their rights and are punished , those who defy the NPT , particularly the perpetrators of [ the ] current carnage in Lebanon and Palestine , are rewarded by generous nuclear cooperation agreements . "
Having successfully established such a trend , it may not matter to recess - appointee Bolton whether he becomes permanent ambassador to the United Nations or not .
