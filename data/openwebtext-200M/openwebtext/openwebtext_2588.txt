Toddlers in the UK could be screened for speech problems because many are so addicted to TV and video games that they fail to learn basic communication skills .
According to an article in the Telegraph , “ barely a 10th of children in some areas can repeat even one nursery rhyme and , in extreme cases , some do not even know their own name . ”
“ If children are in a home in which they are getting insufficient stimulation , where there is not enough interaction , or where communication through the spoken word is not as common or extensive or imaginative as it might be , that is bound to have an impact .
The reality is that for far too long , speech and language problems have been under - recognised . ”- Tory MP John Bercow
The nationwide screening for two - year - olds is being considered to take on the problem that some experts say is now more prevalent than dyslexia or autism .
Testing would be done in a similar manner as screening for hearing , eyesight , and other childhood development checks .
The blame is being placed on the demise of the traditional family meal time , parents who work long hours , and poor childcare with little to no stimulation , and proponents point to the future societal issues that this problem will bring .
“ Children with untreated speech difficulties are at risk of ending up unemployed , experiencing mental health problems and involved in crime . ” – Bercow
With the average modern child spending nearly 45 hours a week watching television , it ’s no wonder these kids do n’t even know their own name .

The first trickle of what will be a flood of federal stimulus dollars earmarked for Ohio is on its way .
The White House has announced it has awarded Ohio nearly $ 267 million to help local agencies beef up the insulation and heating equipment in the homes of the elderly , lower income and middle income families .
Another $ 96 million will allow the state to boost the development and manufacture of renewable energy projects such as solar and wind turbines .
The state expects the feds to announce up to $ 80 million in additional stimulus money for Ohio next week , also for weatherization and renewable energy .
The grants , administered by the U.S. Department of Energy , are part of $ 8 billion the Obama administration is awarding states through long - standing community development and energy development programs .
Ohio is concerned that local , non-profit community action agencies - where the $ 267 million will end up - will not have the capacity to spend such an enormous amount of money over the next two years .
Before the federal stimulus package , Ohio would have received about $ 21 million for this program , said Mark Shanahan , energy adviser to Gov. Ted Strickland .
" We are looking at what the new federal rules are and whether we can use up to 20 percent of the money for job training , " he said .
The jobs in this case might be training people to become home insulators or to perform home energy audits .
Two rule changes will make a big difference , he said : More money can be spent on each home , and families can make more money than previously and still qualify for help .
New income eligibility rules for the money mean a family of four can earn up to $ 44,000 per year and still qualify for up to $ 6,500 in state assistance for insulation , windows and new furnaces .
The first installments of the $ 267 million grant should come within a couple of weeks , Shanahan said .
The state will award some of the money directly to community action agencies and some to local governments .
Cuyahoga County officials were scrambling Friday to prepare for the surge of new dollars they intend to use to beef up existing programs .
" But the rules are still being written , " said Paul Oyaski , director of Cuyahoga County 's office of development .
" A lot of dust is still being settled . "
Oyaski estimates that the county 's development office will receive $ 6.2 million over two years for weatherization work .
For the past three years , the county has received an average of $ 1.4 million per year , enough to weatherize 296 homes per year , said Paul Herdeg , housing manager .
The extra money will be enough to fix up an additional 500 homes per year .
Early estimates for some neighboring counties show that Lorain and Portage counties should receive more than $ 1 million each .
Final numbers are expected next week .
The $ 96 million energy efficiency and renewable energy grant from the Energy Department will go to the Ohio Department of Development 's Energy Program , Shanahan said .
The department must develop and submit a plan this month describing the projects it will fund .
" We have to file a final plan by May 12 and it will have to identify specific projects , " Shanahan said .
Money for both grants comes from the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act that will pour nearly $ 800 billion in the U.S. economy .

Put the flour in a large bowl and make a well in the centre .
Crack the eggs into the well , pour in a splash of the milk and , using a balloon whisk or wooden spoon , start to stir from the centre of the bowl , drawing the flour into the eggs and milk .
Beat the mix until smooth ( get any lumps out now while it ’s thick ) , then stir in the rest of the milk until it ’s the consistency of single cream .
Stir in the oil .
The batter will keep covered in the fridge for up to a day at this point .

As refined " commie , homo - loving sons - of - guns " approached last night 's Oscars , here 's what they were greeted with before arriving to the Kodak Theater in Los Angeles .
The folks from God Hates Fags ilk .
Yep , they showed up in full regalia last night , coagulating at the corner of Sunset Blvd . and Highland Ave .
They even managed to garner a cocked eyebrow from Sean Penn during his acceptance speech .
According to reports , these mentally - and spiritually - challenged folks showed up to picket homosexuals , but also managed to get in digs at President Barack Obama and the economy .
And seeing as how SFist has been so anti-prop 8 as of late , it 's only fair to give the anti-gay marriage folk a turn .
But , like any good Hollywood - spun tale , a hero emerged in the form of two noble Marines who counterprotested the crazy - hate .

Dear Mr. Morgan ,
We have finished processing your application to " grow hemp so I can make cool snacks and rope and stuff . "
We regret to inform you that you are a hippie and you can go screw yourself .
Yours cruelly ,

Acting Administrator

P.S. Your blog sucks and if you put this letter in your blog , we 'll burn down the Chipotle next to your office .
On the heels of Obama 's hugely popular decision to end the DEA 's raids on medical marijuana providers , it 's worth looking into some of the other absurd federal drug policies that interfere with states rights and common sense .
Hemp cultivation is n’t technically illegal in the U.S. , but you need a special permit from the DEA , and if you ask for one they 'll call you a hippie and tell you to go [ email protected ] #k yourself .
Seriously , try it .
I applied last year and this is the response I got : That about sums it up .
Honestly , I do n’t even get why this is an issue .
Hemp is n’t drugs .
Why DEA gives a damn if people want to cultivate hemp is completely beyond me .
Near as I can tell , they 're relying exclusively on the argument that people will surreptitiously grow marijuana in their hemp fields , which is preposterous because you can't do that .
Hemp will cross-pollinate and destroy any commercial marijuana in its vicinity .
It 's the anti-pot .
Thus , I tend to assume that DEA 's animosity towards hemp is merely a symptom of the broader culture war surrounding marijuana in general .
They 'll concede nothing to the reform community , even when their intransigence requires them to obstruct legitimate economic activity based on flimsy reasoning .
Of course , now that we have a president with the guts to tell DEA when they 're out of line , there 's simply no reason this issue can’t move forward .
Hawaii , Kentucky , Maine , Maryland , Montana , North Dakota , and West Virginia have all passed laws authorizing hemp cultivation and eagerly await the federal go - ahead .
Efforts to legalize hemp are also underway in Minnesota and in California , where a hemp bill died on the governor 's desk ( Schwarzenegger cited conflict with federal law as his reason for rejecting the legislation ) .
Hemp wo n't save our economy , but it can provide income for many good , hardworking people .
We lead the industrialized world in the importation of hemp and it would make a great deal of sense to start producing it ourselves .
" " We are cooling .
We are not warming .
The warming you see out there , the supposed warming , and I am using my finger quotation marks here , is part of the cooling process .
Greenland , which is now covered in ice , it was once called Greenland for a reason , right ? " - Michael Steele , discussing global warming .

Now that it is clear just how many high - level government connections Allen Stanford had , it 's time for the SEC to explain why it did not investigate Stanford more aggressively .
The SEC also needs to explain what it meant when it said another regulatory agency had told it to shut down the investigation .
By our count , at least five former Stanford employees told the SEC they thought Stanford was running a Ponzi scheme , from 2003 on .
( The FT revealed a new one this evening - - see below ) .
The SEC began an investigation in 2005 , but did n't do anything until 2009 - - several months after Bernie Madoff and a week after someone else alleged publicly that Stanford was a Ponzi scheme .
So what happened to the complaints of all these whistleblowers ?
Did the SEC do anything about them ?
Did they just get lost in different parts of the bureaucracy ?
Or , more disturbing , did one of Allen Stanford 's connections tell the SEC to back off ?
Mary Schapiro was n't running the SEC when it muffed this latest scam , so she can blame it on her predecessor .
But it 's time we learned what , if anything , the SEC did during its investigation of Stanford , why it took four years to get anywhere , and why the complaints of so many whistleblowers were ignored .
Here 's the latest employee tale , from the FT :
A whistleblower contacted US regulators more than five years ago with allegations that Sir Allen Stanford ’s businesses were involved in an “ illegal Ponzi scheme ” , the Financial Times has learnt , raising new questions about why authorities waited until last week to shut down the alleged $ 8bn fraud .
Leyla Basagoitia , a former Stanford employee , raised a series of red flags about the tycoon ’s empire in a 2003 employment dispute with her company at a tribunal run by the finance industry ’s self - regulatory body .
Ms Basagoitia also alerted the US Securities and Exchange Commission at about the same time , her lawyer said , echoing criticisms the agency ignored early warnings about the alleged $ 50 bn Ponzi scheme run by Bernard Madoff .
Ms Basagoitia told an arbitration panel at the National Association of Securities Dealers in October 2003 that she suspected that Stanford Group Company , one of Sir Allen ’s key businesses , was “ engaged in a Ponzi scheme to defraud its clients ” , according to case documents seen by the FT .
In 2007 , the NASD became the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority , which has come under scrutiny since the Stanford allegations emerged .
In a nine - point critique , Ms Basagoitia pointed to many concerns cited last week by the SEC in its charges against Sir Allen ’s businesses , including allegations about the lack of a credible auditor , misselling of investment products and the promise of consistently high returns that did not “ correspond to the reality of the markets ” .
And here are descriptions of three other ex-Stanford employees who alleged the same thing .
Pentagon boffinry chiefs have announced that they would like some self - aware computer systems capable of " meta - reasoning " and " introspection " .
The plan is to place these machine intelligences in command of heavily armed , well - nigh invulnerable robotic tanks .
This latest plan for humanity 's subjugation comes , of course , from DARPA - the agency believed to harbour the largest known group of lifelike people - simulant robots piloted from within by tiny , malevolent space lizard infiltrators in the entire US federal government .
The plan is called Self - Explanation Learning Framework ( SELF ) .
It is being handled by Dr Mike Cox of DARPA 's renowned Information Processing Technology Office .
According to this presentation ( pdf ) by Dr Cox :
Without a model of self , cognitive systems remain brittle ...
Goal : Provide machines with an ability to reason about their own reasoning ...
SELF will enable any learning system to explain and repair itself Task Benefits : Improved goal satisfaction through self - explanation and meta - control module .
Self - explaining systems lead to better calibrated trust for human users .
It seems that DARPA already has a fearful array of " Intelligent Agent " software at its disposal , so Dr Cox would like his future collaborators to " focus fully on the meta - level " as basic Agent - Smith - a - like killer AIs will be provided as " GFE " : government furnished equipment .
Assuming the self - aware , self - repairing , self - programming software can be built , one might ask what Dr Cox plans to do with it .
Rather than attempting like any sane person to unplug the whole system at the wall before it eradicates humanity , Cox believes it would be suitable in the " near term " for " armored combat " and " tactical air " missions .
Just to make it quite clear what this means , the good doctor - or anyway the lifelike lizard - piloted simulant which long ago replaced the real Cox - helpfully includes pictures of a main battle tank and a jet fighter , two of the most potent engines of destruction available to the modern military .
It is clear that he intends to place his self - aware ' ware in charge of such kit as the frightful 70 - ton turbine - powered Abrams , armoured like a mobile Fort Knox and capable of shooting a hole through small mountains .
Bolo , anyone ? ®
When power hungry equipment like air - conditioning units and heating systems are all switched on at once , as often happens in commercial buildings .
Power consumption spikes , and a building ’s owners are left with hefty peak - demand charges on their electricity bills .
A Toronto based startup , REGEN Energy , says that it has come up with a way to reduce energy use by mimicking the self - organizing behavior of bees .
The company has developed a wireless controller that connects to the control box on a piece of building equipment and functions as a smart power switch .
After several controllers have been activated , they detect each other using a networking standard called ZigBee and begin negotiating the best times to turn equipment on and off .
The devices learn the power cycles of each appliance and reconfigure them to maximize collective efficiency .
The aim is to have everything come on at different time , but without sacrificing individual performance .
The devices work through this problem using a “ swarm algorithm ” that coordinates activity without any single device issuing orders .
This marks a big change from the centralized top - down systems currently in use in most automated building systems .
There are some researchers who say that the decentralized approach to energy management offers a simpler and therefore cheaper , and more effective way to manage supply and demand in a finely balanced electricity system .
Some even believe that it could be an early prototype for emerging smart grid technology .
Mark Kerbel , co-founder and chief executive officer of REGEN Energy , said .
“ Every node thinks for itself , ” .
Before making a decision , he explains , a node will consider the circumstances of other nodes in its network .
For example , if an air - conditioner needs to cycle on to maintain a minimum temperature , a node connected to a fan or pump will stay off for an extra 15 minutes to keep power use below a certain threshold .
“ The devices must satisfy the local restraint but simultaneously satisfy the system objective , ” says Kerbel , adding that a typical building might have between 10 and 40 controllers working together in a single “ hive . ”
The devices are simple and quick to install and , because there ’s no human intervention , and they require no special training to use .
David Chassin , a scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ’s energy - technology group , said “ You ’re seeing a lot more interest in this on a modest scale , ” .
The lab is heading up the GridWise smart - grid initiative .
The savings and other benefits could extend beyond electricity savings for individual building owners .
Today ’s electricity system is designed for peak consumption , which means that power plants are built to satisfy those few minutes of each day when power demand surges well above daily averages .
By reducing peak demand on a large scale , utilities can maximize the operation of existing power plants while reducing the need to build new plants for occasional use .
Another potential benefit is reduced carbon emissions , since power plants that supply peak electricity tend to be less efficient and fueled by coal and natural gas .
Kerbel first came up with the idea of using a swarm algorithm to manage power consumption in 2005 .
“ We were politely told that this style of control just is n’t ready and requires far more academic research , ” he says .
“ It ’s difficult to think outside the command - and - control box and allow this leap of faith –that is , relinquishing decision - making capabilities to individual nodes of the collective . ”
It is true that engineers typically want constant feedback so that they can measure system operation and make refinements .
REGEN ’s technology dispenses with that , but its application will likely make some mistakes , but in less than mission critical environments , simplicity and cost savings far outweigh any shortcomings .
Tests have so far demonstrated that buildings such as hospitals , hotels , shopping malls , factories , and other large facilities , could save as much as 30 percent on their peak - demand charges .
Those savings , REGEN claims , more than cover the cost of renting the devices , which is an option for major electricity consumers reluctant to buy the technology up front .
If the devices are purchased , the payback is less than three years , says Kerbel .
There is sure to be much more interest in this type of application over the coming years , as the U.S. economic stimulus package calls for more investment in energy efficiency and smart - grid technologies .
This is the classic ‘ low - hanging fruit ’ that advocates as high up as Steven Chu are currently promoting so strongly .

Giant flames engulf every floor of 44 - story building and it remains standing , yet limited fires across just 8 floors of WTC 7 brought down building within 7 seconds on 9/11 .
How can NIST ’s “ new phenomenon ” explain this one ?
A fierce fire consumed all 44 floors of a skyscraper in Beijing today , shooting 30 foot flames into the air , but unlike the similarly - sized 47 - story WTC 7 , which suffered limited fires across just eight floors , the building in China did not collapse .
“ The fire was burning from the ground floor to the top floor of the large building , the flames reflecting in the glass facade of the main CCTV tower next to the hotel and cultural center , ” reports the New York Times .
“ The 241 - room Mandarin Oriental hotel in the building was due to open this year .
Flames were spotted around 7:45 p.m. and within 20 minutes the fire had spread throughout the building , dominating that part of the city . ”
“ Hundreds of firefighting vehicles and police blocked off all approaches to the building – which was also set to house a luxury hotel due to be opened in 2009 – with flames appearing to leap 20 to 30 feet into the air , ” adds The London Times .
Compare images of WTC 7 with those of the skyscraper fire in Beijing .
Note that the Beijing skyscraper appears to be leaning due to the unorthodox design of the building – it did not suffer any kind of collapse .
Beijing skyscraper .

WTC 7
To any sane and rational observer , which of these buildings would have been the most likely to collapse ?
And yet it was WTC 7 which collapsed within 7 seconds into its own footprint on 9/11 .
The Beijing skyscraper , though gutted by fire damage , remains standing .
How do the debunkers explain away this one ?
How come NIST ’s newly invented “ phenomenon ” of “ thermal expansion ” did n’t put paid to the skyscraper in Beijing ?
Does fire have different properties in China compared to the U.S. ?
Does it behave in different ways depending on what country it ’s in ?
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Remember that WTC 7 was structurally reinforced and suffered limited fires across just 8 floors .
The core of NIST ’s explanation , that an “ extraordinary event ” called “ thermal expansion ” was to blame for the sudden total collapse of WTC 7 is of course on the face of it a fraud when one considers the innumerable number of buildings that have suffered roaring fires across the majority of their floors and remained standing , whereas WTC 7 suffered limited fire damage across a handful of floors .
The Beijing skyscraper fire provides yet more comparable evidence to illustrate the monolithic hoax that fire damage alone can cause buildings to collapse implosion style , adding more weight to the argument that both WTC 7 and the twin towers were destroyed by explosives that were seen and heard by dozens of eyewitnesses who were at ground zero .
Take another example – the Windsor building in Madrid , a 32 story skyscraper which was a raging inferno for no less than 24 hours before fire crews were able to put out the flames .
Despite the building being constructed of columns a fraction as thick as those used in the WTC twin towers , as well as a total lack of fireproofing , the building ’s top section only partially collapsed while the integrity of the whole structure remained firmly intact .
Compare these images of the Windsor building fire to those of WTC 7 and the twin towers .
The skyscraper fire in Beijing offers another stark and bold reminder that when one eliminates the dodgy , agenda - driven , and incomprehensible delusions of NIST , one fact remains abundantly clear ;
Office fires – even the flame shooting towering inferno variety – cannot cause modern buildings to implode in on themselves and collapse .
Only deliberately placed explosives can achieve this end .
The Windsor fire , the Beijing skyscraper fire and many more yet to come painfully underscore the awful truth that the only way WTC 7 and the twin towers could have collapsed in the manner that they did was by means of controlled demolition .

Michael D. Brown , former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency , was among those forced to flee his home by the Olde Stage Road Fire .
Brown ’s home north of Boulder was spared , but he and his wife , Tamarra , spent Wednesday night at a friend ’s rental apartment in nearby Longmont .
Brown said he took a “ go kit ” stuffed with medication and cash – something he kept handy during his FEMA tenure when he was called out on disasters .
Brown said he was working in his home office Wednesday when his Saint Bernard , Bogart , started barking at a sheriff ’s deputy in his driveway .
The deputy told him he had to leave .
“ To me it was , ‘ It ’s all automatic , ' ” Brown told The Associated Press .
“ No question in my mind .
I did n’t ask how far the fire was .
They said it was mandatory . ”
“ I ’ve seen these wildfires sprint in Montana and other places and it ’s just not worth it .
I just grabbed my dogs and said let ’s go . ”
Brown watched firefighters battle the blaze about a half - mile from his home .
“ We never think of the fact that something like this can happen , ” Brown said .
“ One minute I ’m sitting in my office and the next there is a deputy in my driveway telling me I have to leave .
“ This kind of stuff can happen any time , anywhere . ”
President George W. Bush appointed Brown to head FEMA in 2003 .
Brown was heavily criticized for FEMA ’s response to Hurricane Katrina and resigned afterward .
He was ridiculed after Bush publicly praised him , saying he did a “ a heck of a job , ” while thousands desperately waited for help .
Brown has worked as a consultant since leaving FEMA .
An octopus today managed to pry loose a water - control valve at the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium , flooding the facility with more than 200 gallons of saltwater .
The valve is inside the sea creature 's tank , and officials think the octopus grabbed hold of it while exploring .
" It found something loose and just pulled on it , " said Tara Treiber , the aquarium 's education manager .
" They are very smart creatures . "
A worker arriving this morning found water overflowing out of the tank and " a lovely little lake " on the floor — about 3 inches of water that damaged newly installed carpets , as well as walls and facades , Treiber said .
The damage could have been much worse had workers discovered the open valve later — potentially harming the sea life inside , Treiber said .

From mind - warping revisions of comic book heroes in All - Star Superman , Batman R.I.P. and Final Crisis , to pop-cultural and philosophical exegeses like The Invisibles , The Filth and We3 , brainiac graphic novelist Grant Morrison is a master of the Gordian - knot narrative .

Armed with an intellect and curiosity rivaled in comics only by Watchmen author Alan Moore , Morrison tackles M - Theory and brane cosmology , psychedelia and fascism , continuity and catastrophe while churning out comics that push the envelope well past the point of breaking .
In his books , reality and narrative collide and sometimes disappear into each other without a trace .
" I ’ve been trying to make superhero comics which draw attention to that aspect of participation and collusion between character , creator and reader , " the 49 - year - old virtuoso explained in an e-mail interview from his home in Scotland .
" I ’d love to see more comic book work which was aware of its real - world context . "
Mission accomplished .
All - Star Superman Vol. 2 , released last month in hardcover , concludes a spectacular series that takes the Man of Steel through the looking glass , humanizing and deifying him in equal measure .
Final Crisis , due in hardcover in June , does the same for most of DC Comics ' timeless heroes , culminating in one of the most brutally catastrophic narratives ever written .
By the time it was over , Morrison says he needed to lighten up .
" I spent months immersing myself in the thought processes of an evil , dying God who longed for nothing less than the degradation , destruction and enslavement of all of DC 's superheroes , " he confesses , " along with every other living thing in the universe and beyond ! "
But he 's not taking a break ; far from it .
From cinematic adaptations of his cyborg animal series We3 to games , TV shows and a Batman and Robin
series filtered through the iconography of David Lynch , Morrison 's plate is packed .
Wired.com caught up with the prolific genius to chat about the aforementioned and much more , including continuity , deconstruction , M - Theory and humans ' obsession with the sexy apocalypse .

Wired.com : All - Star Superman exploded the narrative possibilities of the Man of Steel .
Grant Morrison : I tried to be true to the concept of Superman as I understood it .
It seemed fairly significant that the more threatening the world has been made to feel , the more this concept of the superhero has bled from the margins into mainstream consciousness , onto screens and T - shirts and into political speeches .
That seemed worth exploring via the original superhero , Superman .
He seemed the perfect subject for what became an attempt to make a mainstream , adult superhero comic that did n't rely on ultraviolence , or superheroes swearing and getting their dicks out .
Wired.com :
He seems to be one of the pure heroes left standing in the 21st century .
Morrison :
We 've deconstructed all our icons .
We know politicians are lying assholes , we know soap stars are coke freaks , handsome actors are tranny weirdos and gorgeous supermodels are bulimic , neurotic wretches .
We know our favorite comedians will turn out to be alcoholic perverts or suicidal depressives .
Our reality shows have held up a scalding mirror to our yapping baboon faces and cheesy , obvious obsessions , our trashy , gossipy love of trivia and dirt .
We know we 've fucked up the atmosphere and doomed the lovely polar bears and we can't even summon up the energy to feel guilty anymore .
Let the pedophiles have the kids .
There 's nowhere left to turn and no one left to blame except , paradoxically , those slightly medieval guys without the industrial base .
What 's left to believe in ?
The only truly moral , truly goodhearted man left is a made - up comic book character !
The only secular role models for a progressive , responsible , scientific - rational Enlightenment culture are … Kal - El of Krypton , aka Superman and his multicolored descendants !
So we chose not to deconstruct the superhero but to take him at face value , as a fiction that was trying to tell us something wonderful about ourselves .
Somewhere , in our darkest night , we made up the story of a man who will never let us down and that seemed worth investigating .
Artist Frank Quitely draws Superman in a way that humanizes the alien from Krypton definitively , Morrison says .**
Image courtesy DC ComicsWired.com :
So the goal was to humanize the most popular alien of all time ?
Morrison :
Our goal was to put Superman and his familiar cast at the heart of science fiction fables that anyone , of any age , could read and understand , even though they 'd all , hopefully , take different meanings from the stories .
If you just lost your dad , maybe you 'll read what Clark Kent says at his dad 's funeral and feel some sense of human community .
If you want to feel what it 's like to be a teenager , look at Frank Quitely 's incredible drawing of the young Superman on the moon , with his faithful little superdog , Krypto , beside him .
Superman is us , in our dreams .
He lives our lives but on an epic canvas .
That 's how we chose to approach him .
Wired.com :
The series seems to carry as much sadness as it does comedy and action .
Morrison : I think the best Superman stories have an edge of sadness and loss .
This is a man who has lost an entire planet , after all !
But , like all our lives , a good Superman story also needs comedy and drama , fear and wonder .
There 's something particularly poignant about the fact that no matter how strong or fast or good - looking he is , Superman can still have his heart broken and his head twisted .
He can still suffer guilt , loss , confusion and grief , which is where I find him instantly relatable .
Wired.com :
How would you explain his death spiral in conjunction with Lex Luthor's ?
Their shared mortality produced some the most hilarious and exciting moments in your series .
Morrison : I saw Superman / Luthor as a classic pair of opposites , complementing one another like the two sides of a coin or an argument .
Lex is , of course , convinced that if there had been no Superman to stand in his way , he'd be the beloved leader of a scientific utopian culture .
I do n't agree and think the flaws in Luthor 's character would have always held him back .
If he did n't have Superman to blame all his failures on , it would be someone else 's fault .
His decision to become Superman 's archenemy is a way of inflating his own sense of importance to cosmic proportions .
Wired.com :
How would you describe the evolution of their rivalry ?
Morrison : If Superman is us at our best , Lex Luthor has to embody the worst traits of humanity .
And so , while Superman sees the potential for good in Luthor and is constantly , vainly , trying to appeal to his better nature , Luthor , who sees only the worst in everything , believes Superman is as devious , untrustworthy and arrogant as himself .
Then we decided that Luthor really likes Clark Kent !
Clark 's self - effacing humility and shabby physicality make him everything Superman is not .
Playing out that dynamic added a new spice to the relationship between the two .
Wired.com : Bizarro has often been used as a punchline , especially in the Superman and Justice League animated series .
But your series used him as a way to take Superman through the looking glass into Bizarro World .
Which is the real Bizarro World ?
Ours ?
I 'm beginning to wonder .
Morrison :
When we laugh at Bizarro World , we 're laughing at ourselves and that 's the genius of the concept .
So yeah , I 'd say the Bizarro reality is always our world as seen through a shattered window pane .
When you 've got creatures who represent the " opposite " of human culture , they can only show us how arbitrary , pointless or ridiculous many of our own customs or thoughts are .
We chose to make Bizzaro world into a kind of cosmic sewer of meaningless , nightmarish , imbecile activity in the face of looming apocalypse .
Superman , with no powers , must harrow Hell and find a way home .
My favorite bit is the reverse " Stars - And - Stripes , " when the Bizarro people sing : " Under land of no free , am us home cowardly . "
Wired.com : Zibarro , Bizarro World 's own Superman , was a misfit riot .
Morrison : Zibarro was the Morrissey Bizarro .
The sensitive outsider on a world of lunatics .
He was great to write .
Wired.com :
This series takes place outside of continuity , but so have some of comics ' coolest series .
More and more pop culture exercises are experimenting with slipstreams , time travel , discontinuity and metafiction , so worrying about continuity sometimes feels like a nostalgia trip , especially with scientific discoveries claiming our reality might just be a giant hologram .
__ Morrison : __
I used a lot of this M - Theory , brane multiverse stuff in Final Crisis .
Doug Mahnke did a great 3 - D drawing of an inter - brane corridor in the Superman Beyond segments – and it ties in fine with how I see things operating on recursive , isomorphic scales , or dimensions .
I 'm ready to accept that our entire lives are playing out across a 2 - D film as thin as soap bubble skin , since – as above , so below – we already have our own examples of such branes in the form of movie and TV screens , the pages of books and of comics .
Wired.com : Should we abandon continuity ?
Or does it still serve a vital purpose ?
Is continuity obsolete , or is it inextricable ?
Morrison : Continuity in comics takes the place of what we call " space time " in the real universe ( or multiverse ! ) and is something that 's under constant revision by diverse hands across decades of duration .
Comics ' time is clearly not much like real time as we know it , since none of the major characters age , although their sidekicks often do .
And yet it 's a kind of time that exists inside our own .
These characters I write were having adventures long before I was born and will continue to have them when I 'm dead .
The Fantastic Four met the young Beatles .
The Fantastic Four are still having vigorous adventures while only two old Beatles remain alive .
I 've done my bit but tomorrow , other writers will be forced to think like Superman , to do and say things only Superman would do and say , even though technically , he is not " real " and his writers allegedly are .
Imagine being possessed by a meme that uses writers and artists to sustain its existence before moving into the next host , the next generation !
Wired.com :
What are your thoughts on working with your Glasgow crew Frank and Jamie on We3 and All - Star Superman ?
Their work provides the perfect amount of restraint and explosiveness needed to make Superman fly off the page , or through a robot 's head .
Morrison : I think it 's somehow appropriate that the most successful take on Superman in many years has been created by three Scots .
Frank Quitely 's Superman is definitive , I 'd say , and he nails the differences between Clark Kent and Superman 's posture in a way no other artist has ever grasped .
Then Jamie colors the whole book to look like some lost , gorgeous , 1930s , sci-fi Disney version of Superman .
It was a perfect collaboration , oddly rooted in the convolutions of post - WWII history .
Where I currently live is a few miles from the former U.S. naval base at the Holy Loch .
And it was here my dad was arrested for protesting against the presence of Polaris nuclear missiles in the ' 60s , and here where comic books arrived on our shores , in bulk , along with the U.S. service personnel .
The first British comic book store as we 'd recognize it today –- The Yankee Book Store – opened in Paisley , just outside Glasgow .
Just as early R&B and rock ‘ n ' roll records sailed into Liverpool to inspire the Mersey generation of musicians , American comics arrived in the West of Scotland .
It 's no real surprise we have an affinity for this material .
Wired.com :
While we 're on Glasgow , are you a fan of your countrymen Mogwai ?
I think they make the perfect soundtrack for a reading of All - Star Superman .
Morrison : Mogwai are very cool .
But I have n't tried them with Superman yet !
Wired.com : Speaking of We3 , any update on the film ?
That would be simply incredible , if it jumps off .
Morrison : The We3 movie is still churning its way through the Hollywood machine .
John Stevenson is still attached as director , the animal effects have been costed and apparently some concept and poster drawings are being done this week .
I try not to think about it , in the hope it 'll all just finally happen one day .
The upcoming Final Crisis filters catastrophe through fringe science , with fearsome results .

Wired.com : Like All - Star Superman with the Man of Steel , Final Crisis pushed apocalypse and deicide to the outer limits of narrative possibility .
What are your thoughts on that series ?
Taken together with The Filth , is it the heaviest series you 've ever written ?
Morrison : Final Crisis was much heavier , much harder to write than The Filth , which at least came with massive doses of surreal black humor to sweeten the bitter pill of the subject matter .
On Final Crisis , I spent months immersing myself in the thought processes of an evil , dying God who longed for nothing less than the degradation , destruction and enslavement of all of DC 's superheroes , along with every other living thing in the universe and beyond !
To get into his head , I had to consider people like him in the real world and there were no shortage of candidates .
The emissaries of Darkseid seemed to be everywhere , intent on crushing hope , or shattering human self - esteem .
I began to hear his voice in every magazine headline accusing some poor young girl of being too fat or too thin .
Darkseid was there in the newscasters screaming financial disaster and planet - doom .
It was that sick old bastard 's voice terrifying children with his hopeless message of a canceled future , demanding old ladies turn off their electric blankets to help " save the planet , " while turning a blind eye to corporate ecocide .
Up against that , all we had to offer were the wise words of Pico Della Mirandola and Superman singing a song to break your heart .
I had to grind America 's superheroes down so hard there was nothing left but diamond in the dark .
Everything was falling into a black hole , even the story structure ... and fans on message boards were going to war over the thing , screaming " genius " and " gibberish " at one another .
It was quite unpleasant to be at the heart of all that but also strangely exhilarating .
I like Final Crisis a lot now that it 's all over .
I think it 's the closest I 've come to creating the type of DC superhero comic I most want to read .
Wired.com : Like continuity , is crisis itself becoming obsolete ?
Disaster scenarios seem to just get heavier and more mind - blowing , but they also are becoming more ubiquitous .
Are we too inured to apocalypse and crisis these days to be scared of it anymore ?
Morrison : I do n't know if we 're so much inured to apocalypse as almost sexually obsessed by it .
We could only love apocalypse more if it had 4 liters of silicone in each tit .
Think of all those videogames where the Earth 's overrun by insect - aliens or there 's been an atomic war and we 're stumbling in the ruins with a gun we stole from a zombie .
We should be grateful that we live in a culture so insulated from true horror it can afford to play with fear as entertainment .
Batman and Robin , Morrison 's follow - up to the popular Batman R.I.P. , is a bizarro treat .

Wired.com :
What 's next on your radar ?
Morrison : Right now I 'm working on the new Batman and Robin book which is out this summer .
Bruce Wayne is gone so we 'll be seeing a new Batman and Robin team in action together for the first time .
This is continuing the story from Batman R.I.P. and the pitch is " David Lynch directs the Batman TV show . "
Wired.com : Classic !
Morrison :
That 's the only DC Universe book I 'm doing this year .
After Final Crisis , I needed a break from the spandex set .
So I 'm back with Karen Berger at Vertigo doing what I prefer : Creating new books and characters .
I 've just finished Seaguy : Slaves of Mickey Eye , the second volume in the Seaguy trilogy with artist Cameron Stewart .
The first one comes out in April and if you do n't buy it , you 'll die never knowing !
Wired.com :
Well , that wo n't do .
Morrison :
That 'll be followed by an eight - issue series that 's a new take on the " world in a wardrobe " fantasy story , drawn by Sean Murphy , who 's the Next Big Thing in comics , they say .
Then there 's
The New Bible , the final title for the project I 'm doing with Camilla D'Errico .
And I 've been talking on the phone to Rian Hughes about doing a " graphic novel " – a proper coffee table one – together .
So that 's what 's next with the comics for the next year or so .
Wired.com :
Any non-comics activity you 'd like to share ?
Morrison : Outside comics , I 'm working on a game , a TV show and some more movie biz stuff .
The work that actually comes out is the tip of a gruesome iceberg of toil .
There are about 30 projects on the go at any one time and most of those never get further than pitch meetings or the ideas stage .
We just bought a house in Hollywood to help keep up with this side of the business , so it 's not all bad .
The late Patrick McGoohan 's 1960s British TV show The Prisoner influenced Morrison 's world view and writing .

Wired.com : Finally , any thoughts on the passing of Patrick McGoohan .
You 've sampled The Prisoner before ; any thoughts on its influence on culture and politics ?
Morrison :
My sympathies went out to McGoohan 's family when I heard about his death , but I only knew him from the TV screen , where Number 6 can never die .
His influence lives on as long as light spreads .
That 's as good as it gets .
McGoohan was one of the great heroes of my childhood and adolescence , as well as a continuing influence , via The Prisoner , on all of my thinking . *
The Prisoner * was probably the first example I ever encountered of the ergodic storytelling method I 've aspired to perfect ever since .
I hear there 's a film version on the way and I hope they have the balls to make it properly psychedelic and open to interpretation .
And it would have to be Christopher Eccleston , as Number 6 , the only British actor truly intense enough to follow the mighty , all - conquering , beetle - brow of McGoohan .

Enlarge By Robert Nickelsberg , Getty Images Los Angeles Police Department officers question MS - 13 members in 2007 .
The ubiquitous gang , which originated among Salvadoran refugees settling in L.A. in the 1980s , has spread to 42 states , with cells in suburban and rural areas .
MS - 13 SPREADING MS -13 SPREADING
The violent Salvadoran gang MS - 13 has cells , or " cliques , " in 42 states .
States reporting no MS - 13 presence : • Alaska
• Delaware
• Maine
• Minnesota
• North Dakota
• New Hampshire
• New Mexico
• Vermont Source : FBI Criminal gangs in the USA have swelled to an estimated 1 million members responsible for up to 80 % of crimes in communities across the nation , according to a gang threat assessment compiled by federal officials .
The major findings in a report by the Justice Department 's National Gang Intelligence Center , which has not been publicly released , conclude gangs are the " primary retail - level distributors of most illicit drugs " and several are " capable " of competing with major U.S. - based Mexican drug - trafficking organizations .
" A rising number of U.S. - based gangs are seemingly intent on developing working relationships " with U.S. and foreign drug - trafficking organizations and other criminal groups to " gain direct access to foreign sources of illicit drugs , " the report concludes .
The gang population estimate is up 200,000 since 2005 .
Bruce Ferrell , chairman of the Midwest Gang Investigators Association , whose group monitors gang activity in 10 states , says the number of gang members may be even higher than the report 's estimate .
" We 've seen an expansion for the last 10 years , " says Ferrell , who has reviewed the report .
" Each year , the numbers are moving forward . "
' Growing threat ' on the move
The report says about 900,000 gang members live " within local communities across the country , " and about 147,000 are in U.S. prisons or jails .
" Most regions in the United States will experience increased gang membership … and increased gang - related criminal activity , " the report concludes , citing a recent rise in gangs on the campuses of suburban and rural schools .
Among the report's other findings : • Last year , 58 % of state and local law enforcement agencies reported that criminal gangs were active in their jurisdictions , up from 45 % in 2004 .
• More gangs use the Internet , including encrypted e-mail , to recruit and to communicate with associates throughout the U.S. and other countries .
• Gangs , including outlaw motorcycle groups , " pose a growing threat " to law enforcement authorities along the U.S. - Canadian border .
The U.S. groups are cooperating with Canadian gangs in various criminal enterprises , including drug smuggling .
Assistant FBI Director Kenneth Kaiser , the bureau 's criminal division chief , says gangs have largely followed the migration paths of immigrant laborers .
He says the groups are moving to avoid the scrutiny of larger metropolitan police agencies in places such as Los Angeles .
" These groups were hit hard in L.A. " by law enforcement crackdowns , " but they are learning from it , " Kaiser says .
MS - 13 far - flung from L.A. incubator
One group that continues to spread despite law enforcement efforts is the violent Salvadoran gang known as MS - 13 .
Michael Sullivan , the departing director of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , says the gang 's dependence on shocking violence to advance extortion , prostitution and other criminal enterprises has frustrated attempts to infiltrate and disrupt the insular group 's activities .
" MS - 13 's foothold in the U.S. is expanding , " Sullivan says .
Kaiser says the street gang is in 42 states , up from 33 in 2005 .
" Enforcement efforts have been effective to a certain extent , but they ( gang members ) keep moving , " he says .
MS - 13 is the abbreviation for the gang also known as Mara Salvatrucha .
The group gained national prominence in the 1980s in Los Angeles , where members were linked to incidents involving unusual brutality .
Since then , it has formed cells or " cliques " across the U.S. , says Aaron Escorza , chief of the FBI 's MS - 13 National Gang Task Force .
The task force was launched in 2004 amid concerns about the gang 's rapid spread .
Gang members were targeted in broad investigations similar to those used to bust organized crime groups from Russia and Italy .
Among law enforcement efforts : • Omaha :
The last of 24 MS - 13 members swept up on federal firearms charges and conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine were sentenced last year in the largest bust since the group emerged there in 2004 .
The gang 's strength dimmed as a result , but the nine - month probe did not eradicate the group , says Ferrell , who assisted in the investigation .
• Nashville : During the last two years , 14 MS - 13 members pleaded guilty on charges ranging from murder to obstruction of justice .
Davidson County , Tenn. , Sheriff Daron
Hall , whose jurisdiction includes
Nashville , says MS - 13 started growing there about five years ago , corresponding with an influx of immigrant labor .
Last April , county officials began checking the immigration status of all arrestees .
" We know we have removed about 100 gang members , including MS - 13 , " to U.S. authorities for deportation , Hall says .
• Maryland : Earlier this month , federal authorities said they had convicted 42 MS - 13 members since 2005 .
More than half were charged in a " racketeering conspiracy " in which members participated in robberies and beatings and arranged the murders of other gang members , according to Justice Department documents .
In one case , Maryland gang members allegedly discussed killing rivals with an MS - 13 leader calling on a cellphone from a Salvadoran jail , the documents say .
Escorza says a " revolving door " on the border has kept the gang 's numbers steady — about 10,000 in the U.S. — even as many illegal immigrant members are deported .
The FBI , which has two agents in El Salvador to help identify and track members in Central America and the United States , plans to dispatch four more agents to Guatemala and Honduras , Escorza says .
" They evolve and adapt , " he says .
" They know what law enforcement is doing .
Word of mouth spreads quickly . "

The world 's pre-eminent climate scientists produced a blunt assessment of the impact of global warming on the US yesterday , warning of droughts that could reduce the American south - west to a wasteland and heatwaves that could make life impossible even in northern cities .
In an update on the latest science on climate change , the US Congress was told that melting snow pack could lead to severe drought from California to Oklahoma .
In the midwest , diminishing rains and shrinking rivers were lowering water levels in the Great Lakes , even to the extent where it could affect shipping .
" With severe drought from California to Oklahoma , a broad swath of the south - west is basically robbed of having a sustainable lifestyle , " said Christopher Field , of the Carnegie Institution for Science .
He went on to warn of scorching temperatures in an array of cities .
Sacramento in California , for example , could face heatwaves for up to 100 days a year .
" We are close to a threshold in a very large number of American cities where uncomfortable heatwaves make cities uninhabitable , " Field told the Senate 's environment and public works committee .
The warnings were the first time Congress had been directly confronted with the growing evidence that the impact of climate change will be far more severe than revealed even in the UN 's most recent report , in 2007 .
The hearing was also the first time senators had been permitted to hear testimony about the dangers to human health from climate change .
In 2007 , the Bush administration censored testimony from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) on the rise in asthma and other respiratory illnesses , as well as the increasing occurrence of " tropical " parasites .
" The CDC considers climate change a serious public health concern , " said Howard Frumkin , the director of the centre for environmental health at the CDC .
Yesterday 's gathering of climate scientists , led by the head of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , RK Pachauri , was designed to give momentum to efforts by the Democratic leadership to press ahead on energy reform .
" If we do n't do it people are going to die .
They are going to get sick and they are going to die , " said Barbara Boxer , who as chair of the Senate environment and public works committee is key to securing the passage of climate change legislation .
But even with the new administration and the Democratic leadership in Congress now united on the urgency of acting on climate change , there were still signs of battles ahead .
The hearing saw a steady stream of bickering between Boxer and her Republican counterpart , James Inhofe , renowned as a climate change sceptic .
Republicans argued that Barack Obama 's proposed carbon cap legislation would be costly .
" I will certainly oppose raising energy costs on suffering families and workers during an economic crisis when the science says our actions [ to combat climate change ] will be futile , " said Kit Bond , a Republican senator from Missouri .
The Republican minority on the committee also invited testimony from Professor William Happer , a physicist at Princeton University , who is a well - known climate change sceptic .
" It 's still not as warm as it was when the Vikings settled England , " said Happer .
Ousted American Idol ' Bikini Girl ' Considering Playboy ( Photos )
was booted from American Idol during Hollywood Week .
The bikini sporting singer was a controversial contestant from the start , accused by many of flaunting her body in a skimpy bikini in order to win over the male half of the judges panel .
She also carried the baggage of a previously failed career launch that included a short lived record label contract and the release of an album , though the rules do n't discriminate against those who have suffered career flops .
Darrell reached the end of the line this week but she 's pleased to report to Access Hollywood that offers are coming in from several fronts .
She told Tony Potts , " I 've had a lot of different offers like Vegas promotion offers .
Of course Playboy has called . "
The singer admits that she is very interested in Playboy but does n't want to stunt her career by jumping too soon into that arena .
She believes it is a matter of timing .
Bikini Girl is n't sure she could pose sans clothing , indicating that she will have to give that some serious thought because " my dad would probably kill me . "

Thoroughbred Race Horses From Northern Ireland Are Being Eaten
Retired athletes have it tough .
Once they are out of the spotlight , most are forgotten .
Those from previous eras did n’t make much money , or were n’t able to save enough to cover their medical bills .
However , all of those athletes should be very thankful that they are n’t race horses from Northern Ireland .
An investigation by BBC Northern Ireland ’s Season Ticket found that former thoroughbred race horses from NI are ending up on dinner plates in other parts of Europe .
In the souring economy , the value of some horses has plummeted .
As a result , it ’s no longer deemed worth it to take care of some horses once their racing careers are over .
According to animal welfare official Barbara Bent from the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals said the decline in value of horses was leading to “ welfare problems ” .
“ If an animal is very valuable , then he ’ll be looked after .
That ’s where the industry has found itself now , ” said Bent .
While Americans might scoff at the notion of eating horses , horse meat is consumed in several places around the world .
But there ’s another issue .
Most race horses are treated with drugs at some point .
Those drugs are not ones that humans should be consuming .
While there is a passport system for horses , these passports do n’t guarantee that the horse is fit for human consumption .
Equine veterinary surgeon Bruce Steele said , “ If a veterinary surgeon treats a horse with any substance , that has to be entered in the passport , with the reason for the administration , the ( name of the ) drug and how much was administered .
That horse would n’t be allowed into the food chain but there ’s no guarantee those details will be in the passport . ”
Mmm … horse .
Maybe drugs help make horse meat tastier , just like Valium is the secret ingredient for any good burger recipe .
The next time there is a Barbaro , everyone can just have a good BBQ instead of a funeral .

Charles Nesson , the Harvard Law professor who is heading up the defense of accused P2P user Joel Tenenbaum , has issued a full - scale apology to the judge overseeing the case and the recording industry lawyers who oppose him .
Or has he ?
Deposition madness
At issue is Nesson 's decision to seek a sworn deposition from Matthew Oppenheim , outside counsel retained by the RIAA to manage its file - sharing litigation .
Deposing one of the other side 's lawyers is an ... unorthodox legal strategy , since much of what would presumably be asked would be covered by attorney / client privilege .
Nesson pressed ahead , filing a Motion to Compel the deposition with the court , and he hoped to hold the deposition in a Harvard auditorium ( Oppenheim lives in Washington , DC ) .
The music industry objected , saying that Nesson had not even followed certain basic procedures , such as paying for travel and filing relevant documents with the court , and asked the Court to sanction Nesson over the entire affair .
As we noted last week , the judge has had enough and said that " the Court will not hesitate to impose appropriate sanctions , including potentially substantial costs , should the Defendant waste either the Plaintiffs ' time and money or scarce judicial resources by filing frivolous motions in the future . "
" I made a mistake by not withdrawing my motion to compel Matthew Oppenheim 's deposition immediately after the January 22 date had passed , " Nesson wrote the Court yesterday .
" I acknowledge and apologize for this , both to you and to my opponents .
I wasted the Court 's time .
I take seriously the Court 's warning about imposing sanctions .
I thank you for not imposing them .
I will make amends . "
Sounds like a serious apology .
But as IP attorney Ben Sheffner notes , it 's actually way , way less than it appears .
As Nesson noted in a comment on anti-RIAA lawyer Ray Beckerman 's blog , the apology was n't for trying to depose Oppenheim or for not obeying a host of rules regarding proper notice , but " for not withdrawing [ the motion to compel ] when the January 22 date had passed without resolution of it . "
Err , ok .
The whole case has grown so strange that even Beckerman , no friend of the labels , wrote an editorial aside in which he said , " To you law students and young lawyers out there ; please do n't think you can learn anything from this case .
Just ignore everything you are seeing from both sides .
I have seen more bizarre filings from both sides ' lawyers than I would imagine possible .
Please do n't ask me where in the federal rules there is a provision for a notice of apology .
Last time I looked , there is n't any such provision . "
" I can only hope that more good than bad comes out of this nonsense , " he added , " but I am not in the least sanguine about it . "
" Sanguine " is n't a bad word here , because if this case continues the way it 's been going , Tenenbaum could well be bleeding profusely from the pound of flesh the labels are bent on extracting from him by the end of the summer .
O Captain , my Captain !
So the bizarre case continues to lurch along .
Today , the Harvard Law students doing much of the work on the case posted an update to their JoelFightsBack.com website saying , " Make no mistake about it : we are a student run team . "
The first comment on the post , filed by Professor Nesson , says , " make no mistake , we are a faculty run team , with me as Joel 's lawyer , captain and supervisor of the team . "
But whoever 's in charge ( the students tell me that Nesson really is the leader ) will soon be getting the advice of another lawyer , Boston 's Matt Feinberg , who will be advising the team .
" We are n't trying to lead a movement against music or copyright or adequate compensation for artists , " say the students .
" We 're just trying to defend Joel .
But we know the stakes are high .
And that 's why we 're gathering the best talent there is . "
Tenenbaum 's trial , scheduled for early this summer , looks certain to provide excellent entertainment value for spectators .
On the other hand , as the team correctly points out , losing could cost one Boston University graduate student a life 's worth of debt .
As the NY Times point out in their review of two upcoming histories of The Bomb , Robbert Oppenheimer originally assumed that little could stop anyone from developing nuclear weapons .
Thankfully , he was wrong .

With a geek 's typical hubris , Oppenheimer assumed that since the laws of physics were universal , very little could stop anyone in getting a nuclear weapon , given the time and resources .
Alas , the time and resources needed are indeed scarce , so to this day , only nine countries are nuclear - equipped - the United States , Russia , United Kingdom , France , China , India , Pakistan , North Korea and Israel .
Here we see these links visualized , starting with the Manhattan project and fanning out over the last six decades ( click here for the full - size popup ) .
Instead , three proliferation experts demonstrate how nuclear capabilities were passed as political bargaining chips , stolen via espionage , and limited with diplomacy .
Both books seem like fascinating reads .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A human rights protester was in police custody Monday after throwing a shoe at Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao during a speech at Cambridge University .
The shoe landed several meters from Wen Jiabao .
The shoe landed several meters from the premier and the man was quickly apprehended by security and handed over to police for questioning on suspicion of committing a public order offence , according to witnesses .
A student who witnessed the incident told CNN that the man had stood up and shouted , " Why are you prostituting yourself ?
How can you listen to the lies he is telling ? "
Cameras filming the speech remained fixed on Wen during the incident , but video images later showed an unidentified student being escorted out of the building by a university proctor .
The student was then handed over to police , a university spokesman , who would not disclose his name due to ' university regulations , ' told CNN .
" Fortunately the incident did not spoil the event .
The auditorium was full , with nearly 500 people present , of whom just one misbehaved , " a the spokesman said .
" At no stage was there any serious threat to the Premier , or anyone else . "
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said of the incident : " The Chinese side has expressed its strong feelings against the occurrence of the incident .
The British side said that they are very sorry that the incident should have happened and the person will be dealt with according to law .
Facts have shown that the despicable behavior of the perpetrator is extremely unpopular and can in no way stem the tide of the growing friendly relations and cooperation between China and Britain . "
The incident occurred while Wen , on a three day visit to the UK to strengthen economic ties , was speaking about China 's role amid the global economic recession .
On Sunday , several hundred Tibetan activists had demonstrated outside the Chinese Embassy Sunday to protest his visit to London .
China has long been criticized by the international community for its human rights record in Tibet , where many Tibetans are pushing for greater autonomy and religious freedom .
Monday 's shoe - throwing incident is the second of its kind in less than two months .
In December , an Iraqi journalist narrowly missed striking then - U.S. President George W. Bush with both his shoes during a news conference in Baghdad , where Bush was making a farewell visit .
-- CNN's Per Nyberg and Bridget Fallon in London , Jomana Karadsheh in Baghdad , and Erin Mclaughlin in Atlanta contributed to this report .
In a joint filing made by both Apple and Psystar , the two companies agreed to a litany of stipulations for the handling of evidence that is deemed sensitive , a protected trade secret , or otherwise " confidential . "
The agreement also covers how code can and can't be reviewed .
The 18 - page protective order defines two classes of " protected material " covered by the order .
" Confidential " material covers anything that falls under Rule 26 ( c ) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , which allows for protection of sensitive information .
Further , anything information that " would affect its competitive position , security interests , intellectual properties , or technological developments in an adverse manner " can be designated " Confidential — Attorney 's Eyes Only . "
Information marked " Confidential " may be disclosed to outside attorneys and no more than two additional full - time employees selected by each party .
Information marked " Attorney 's Eyes Only " may only be disclosed to the Counsel of Record for each party .
The materials may also be accessed by court personnel , jurors , and certain experts and witnesses that have agreed to be bound by the terms of the protective order .
Additionally , the order stipulates that any software code that must be reviewed can only be done on a designated computer that is not connected to the Internet .
Further , printouts of any code will only be done when absolutely necessary , and all printouts are to be marked " Confidential " and covered by the stipulations of the protective order .
The order also stipulates that any court documents that will be publicly filed either have confidential material redacted or removed , or have permission of the necessary parties to include the information .
Additionally , any materials handed over during discovery marked " Confidential " will be returned at the end of the trial , any copies destroyed , and anything entered into evidence in court sealed .
Of course , the protective order is designed to protect trade secrets and other sensitive information from public purview .
So if you thought you were going to be able to find out Apple 's s00 pr sekrit Mac OS X code or something by digging through court documents , you 'll be sorely disappointed .
But , you can expect the discovery process to begin in earnest once Judge Alsup rules on the motion for protective order .
All the legal wrangling began last July when Apple sued Psystar for selling unlicensed Mac clones .
Psystar and Apple argued several motions regarding Psystar 's countersuit , which were finally cleared up last week .
Trial still wo n't begin until November , so the outcome of the lawsuit between Apple and Psystar is still a long way off .

Come già accennato nello scorso articolo il mercato delle lampade tradizionali ( incandescenza e scarica in gas in generale ) sono gestiti in Europa in regime duopolistico da Osram e Philips .
Le cose potevano essere diverse per il mercato del LED , forse non lo sapete , ma nel mondo sono molteplici le aziende in grado di produrre LED , ma purtroppo a quanto pare non è così per le tecnologie di gestione , di interfaccia sul chip , ecc , cioè tutto quello che riguarda il sistema strettamente preposto al corretto funzionamento dei diodi .
La Philips infatti , forte dell ’acquisto di ColorKinetics nel 2007 per la modica cifra di 791 milioni di dollari , è diventata proprietaria di circa 1000 brevetti relativi allo sviluppo della tecnologia LED , nell ’accezione più ampia del termine .
Quindi l’azienda olandese dall ’alto del suo trono , a partire dal giugno 2008 , ha introdotto una programma di licens patent rivolta alle sorgenti tradizionali e , novità delle novità , estesa alla tecnologia LED .
In sostanza viene imposto l’obbligo a tutti coloro che utlizzano led sia per corpi illuminanti , sia per insegne luminose a pagare le royalties sui brevetti di proprietà Philips .
I livelli di costo previsti in caso di utlizzo di tecnologia led non Philips ( es Cree ) sono 3 :
3 % sul prezzo netto di vendita per apparecchi con sorgenti led di colore bianco
4 % sul prezzo netto di vendita per apparecchi con sorgenti led di colore bianco regolabile
5 % sul prezzo netto di vendita per i sistemi a LED cambiacolore .
Ovviamente il pagamento della quota parte non dovuto se la tecnologia LED è Philips , cioè se io costruttore decido di utilizzare Lumileds per i miei bei prodotti non devo pagare nulla ( e ci mancava altro ) .
Nell ’ottobre del 2008 è stato sottoscritto un accordo tra Osram e Philips ( nemiche giurate da sempre ) che estende l’esenzione di pagamento delle royalties anche alla tecnologia dell ’azienda tedesca .
In particolare l’ccordo è rivolto all ’utilizzo di “ componenti significativi ” Osram , cioè Modulo Osram , Alimentatore Osram , Sistema di controllo Osram , non è incluso nell ’accordo l’utilizzo di led singoli .
Quindi i corpi illuminanti con led di tecnologia tedesca sono soggetti al pagamento di Royalties .
A mio parere una politica al limite della decenza che in sostanza dovrebbe garantire a Philips prima di tutto e Osram poi di mantenere inalterata l’egemonia sulla produzione delle sorgenti luminose , estendendola anche al mondo del LED .
E quindi mettere al sicuro il controllo di tutta la fetta di mercato riguardante il LED che , previsioni alla mano , sarà una fetta via via sempre più grande , visto che il futuro dell ’illuminazione sarà allo stato solido ( SSL ) .
Voi cosa ne dite , riusciranno veramente i due giganti europei ad imporre questa politica a tutte le aziende mondiali produttrici di LED ?
Io spero di no !

Hey Guys ,
What are you waiting for , let ' sgo grab some 4ss ; p. Go ....go....go...
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - A cholera epidemic which has already afflicted more than 60,000 people in Zimbabawe is spreading in the rural heartland , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) said on Friday .
The deadliest cholera outbreak in Africa in 15 years is gaining momentum , with 1,493 new cases including 69 deaths reported in the past 24 hours alone , it said .
The intestinal infection has killed 3,161 Zimbabweans since August in an outbreak that has now surpassed the WHO ’s previous “ worst case scenario . ”
Heavy rains and the year - end holidays , when many urban Zimbabweans traveled to visit relatives in villages , have fueled the spread of the water - borne disease , the United Nations agency said .
“ The epidemic is really present in the provinces , it ’s jumping from one area to another .
It ’s mushrooming , ” Claire - Lise Chaignat , WHO global cholera coordinator , told a news briefing in Geneva .
“ That is why it is so out of control , because it is difficult to anticipate where the next hot spot is going to occur , ” she said .
More cases were reported this week than the previous one but the number of deaths appeared to decline , Chaignat said .
Cholera spreads through contaminated food and water and can cause severe dehydration and death without proper treatment .
While cholera is normally both preventable and treatable , an economic and political crisis
In Zimbabwe has caused the near - collapse of health services .
Women and their children line up to receive cholera kits at Budiriro Polyclinic in Harare , January 29 , 2009 .
Cholera has killed more than 3,000 Zimbabweans and infected at least 57,000 , the World Health Organisation said , making it the deadliest outbreak in Africa in 15 years .

‘ DRASTIC ACTION ’ REQUIRED
Some 5.2 percent of patients catching cholera in the country are now dying , a very high fatality rate , according to the WHO .
Two of every three deaths are recorded outside of the country ’s 270 cholera treatment centers , meaning most victims die at home , mainly from sheer dehydration .
Eric Laroche , assistant WHO director - general for health action in crises , said the death toll was already far too high .
“ The bad news is that it is going to continue , ” he said .
“ Unless we have drastic action we are not going to get out of the epidemic soon .
We have to make an extraordinary effort to respond to an extraordinary situation , otherwise people are going to succumb and die even more , ” he told reporters .
The WHO asked donor countries to help pay the salaries of thousands of Zimbabwean medical workers , to provide oral rehydration salts and chlorine tablets to needy communities , and to raise awareness about cholera prevention and treatment .
The appeal was made as U.N. aid officials tried to rally international support for Zimbabwe , where they said some 5.5 million people need U.N. assistance to cope with dwindling food supplies and hyperinflation .
Elisabeth Byrs of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that no contributions have yet been received for a $ 567 million appeal for Zimbabwe this year .
“ The humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe is acute and worsening , ” she told Reuters .
“ Aid is more necessary than ever .
This is a critical moment . ”
Admiral Mike Mullen , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , raised the alarm yesterday over Iran 's nuclear activities .
In an interview with CNN , he said Iran " might now have enough fissile material to make a bomb . "
And a nuclear - armed Iran , he added , " is a very , very bad outcome for the region and for the world . "
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was also on the talk - show circuit .
While he made a more cautious assessment ( " They 're not close to a weapon at this point , " he told Meet the Press ) , the consensus is clear : Iran has not suspended work on uranium enrichment ; it has been less than forthcoming about what it is up to ; and we are worried about a " breakout " capability .
When my wife ( and Danger Room contributor ) Sharon Weinberger and I visited Iran in February 2007 , the Iranians had produced 250 tons of uranium hexafluoride ( UF6 ) , a gaseous compound that could be fed into centrifuges for further enrichment through isotope separation .
That same month , Iran began commercial - scale operations at an enrichment plant in Natanz ; it continues to feed UF6 into a 3,000 - centrifuge unit there .
So when do we start worrying ?
As this sober analysis in Time points out , almost 800 kilograms of low - enriched uranium has passed through the centrifuges at Natanz , and those stocks are monitored and under seal .
For Iran to make a single , crude bomb , it would need highly enriched uranium .
That would mean kicking out international inspectors , reconfiguring the cascades and re-enriching the low - enriched material .
Experts reckon it would take months for that to happen , enough time for a dramatic international response .
Even if successful in developing a Hiroshima - style device , Iran would not have anything that could be packaged on , say , a ballistic missile .
The Board of the International Atomic Energy Agency convenes this week in Vienna ; in his introductory statement to the board of governors , IAEA director general Mohamed ElBaradei said the agency " was unable to make any progress on the remaining issues which give rise to concerns about possible military dimensions of Iran 's nuclear program because of lack of cooperation by Iran . "
In other words , a lack of transparency is keeping the world guessing about Iran 's true nuclear intentions .
( The latest IAEA " safeguards report " is still being circulated internally , but if you feel like losing some sleep , you can check out the November 2008 IAEA board report . )
But the most crucial point , it seems , is the consensus within the U.S. military and intelligence community that Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons capability – even if it is still , as Gates suggested , a ways away from producing an actual bomb .
A 2007 national intelligence estimate concluded that Iran halted work on its covert nuclear weapons program in 2003 , but that conclusion has now been consigned to the dustbin .
The threat assessment delivered earlier this month by Dennis Blair , the Director of National Intelligence , puts it bluntly : " Although we do not know whether Iran currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , we assess Tehran at a minimum is keeping open the option to develop them . "
The question , then , is this :
What options are the United States and Israel keeping open ?

Iftkhar Muhammad Chaudhry , Pakistan ’s 20th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , was unconditionally restored to power during an address by Prime Minister Yousef Raza Gilani early Wednesday morning .
Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif has called off the long march after talking with other opposition party heads .
He congratulated the protesters on seeing to the restoration of the judiciary .
Chaudhry ’s return to power has been one of the most divisive issues since the end of General Pervez Musharraf ’s reign , and the protest movement built around his supporters has been the driving force in the Long March protests of the past several days .
Chaudhry had a hostile relationship with then - President Musharraf , who in November of 2007 sent the military into the Supreme Court and captured all its members .
Chaudhry was placed under house arrest until he was ordered freed by Gilani four months later .
After the 2008 elections , a coalition government formed between the two largest parties , the Pakistani Peoples Party ( PPP ) and the Pakistan Muslim League - N ( PML - N ) , with a promise to restore Chaudhry to power one of the central points of agreement .
The coalition splintered in August of 2008 when President Zardari declared any promises made with the PML - N were not binding , and Nawaz Sharif put the PML - N into the opposition .
The situation remained somewhat stable , in spite of a growing lawyers ’ protest movement calling for Chaudhry ’s restoration , until last month , when the current Supreme Court declared Sharif ineligible for political office , citing his opposition to the 1999 coup that brought Musharraf to power .
After the ruling Zardari seized control of the Punjab Province , igniting a nation - wide protest movement which led to the imposition of emergency rule , the mass arrest of opposition members , and the banning of the nation ’s most popular TV news station .
But despite ever growing crackdowns , the marchers continued on , it seems they have won .
Chaudhry has been restored , and the situation may finally return to normal .
For over 100 million Pakistanis facing formal bans on public gatherings and a brand of governance many hoped they would never see against when Musharraf left office , not a moment too soon .

I am a seed developer from western Canada , where since 1947 my wife and I have been developing a strain of canola that is resistant to certain diseases that we have on the prairies .
I am also a seed saver , like hundred of thousands of farmers around the world who save their seed from year to year , to plant and harvest .
I was also the mayor of my community for over twenty five years .
In 1998 without any prior knowledge , Monsanto laid a lawsuit against me alleging that I had infringed their patent by growing their genetically modified conola without a license .
It was a real shock to me , as we had never had anything to do with Monsanto .
But the real issue that concerned us was the possibility that our pure seed , which we had developed after half a century of research would now be contaminated .
We stood up to Monsanto , arguing that if any genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) were present in our pure seed , then Monsanto were liable for destroying the property of others .
It took two years for this case to go to trial at the Federal court of Canada , with one judge , but no jury , and I had no choice in the matter .
In the two years of allegations Monsanto withdrew all allegations that I had obtained their seed illegally , but because they had found some GMO canola plants in the ditch along my field , I had infringed their patent .
That is the basis on which the case went to the Federal Court of Canada .
This is what the judge ruled : it does not matter how Monsanto ’s GMOs get into or onto any farmer ’s field or into a seed supply ( He went on to specify how this could happen : direct seed movement by birds , by wind , especially on the prairies , by floods , and through cross-pollination by bees ) .
It does n’t actually matter how the genetically modified organisms get into an organic farmer ’s field or into the fields of a conventional farmer like myself : once there , those seeds and plants become Monsanto ’s property . ”
It was a very startling decision .
The judge also ruled that we were not allowed to use our seeds or plants again and that all the seeds and plants that we had developed over 50 years became the property of Monsanto .
The judge also ruled that all the profit from my 1998 canola crop was payable to Monsanto .
The judge further ruled that even from the land that had no contamination , all profit would be payable to Monsanto because there was a probability that our seed contained some of Monsanto ’s GMOs .
We immediately applied to the Federal court of Appeal which has three judges but no jury .
After a year the Appeal Court upheld the first judge ’s decision , but did not agree with all his decisions .
After this second ruling in 2002 , we appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada .
The case began in January 2004 .

Recession Bargain or Fool 's Challenge ?
Oversized eating challenges might be your ticket to a free meal or stomachache .
Dec. 1 , 2008  -- CLINTON , N.J. --
There 's no such thing as a free lunch … or is there ?
In these tough financial times , Americans are trying to save a buck any way they can .
And there 's nothing like a free steak dinner , a free stack of pancakes or a free pizza .
Several restaurants around the country offer such freebies .
The catch : you need to wolf down gargantuan meals in a short amount of time .
If you do n't , you 're stuck with a hefty check .
Consider the granddaddy of all challenges : the free 72 - oz. steak challenge at the Big Texas Steak Ranch in Amarillo .
Diners at the Texas restaurant can get a 72 - oz .
top sirloin steak , a baked potato , salad , dinner roll and shrimp cocktail for free -- if they can finish it all in just 60 minutes .
Failure brings a hefty $ 72 check .
Winners get a T - shirt , a souvenir boot mug , a certificate and a spot on the " Wall of Fame . "
Not bad , but since the challenge was started in 1960 , nearly 50,000 people have attempted to consume the massive meal .
Only 8,500 have managed to pass the test -- a 17 percent success rate .
( And in case you were wondering , the record time was 8 minutes and 52 seconds . )
" That 's almost five pounds of meat , " said David L. Katz , director of the Prevention Research Center at Yale University School of Medicine .
" For a lion , that 's a reasonable meal . "
Katz warns that such a big meal could stretch out your stomach too much , tear your esophagus or lead to any of a host of other health problems .
The diner must decide whether a free meal is worth risking $ 40,000 worth of emergency surgery .
" Whether it 's a super - sized bargain in time of a recession or just a general notion that no blue - blooded American can resist that all - you - can - buffet , what we need to recognize is that -- at a time of epidemic obesity -- extra calories at no extra charge are not necessarily a bargain , " Katz said .
" This is an opportunity to get fat at no extra charge .
Most people are willing to spend money to lose weight . "
Okay , that might be true , but there are plenty of these challenges across the country .
Somebody must be trying them .
This reporter decided to become one of those people .
The 50 - Pound Burger
The Clinton Station Diner can be found at an Interstate off - ramp in rural New Jersey , near the Pennsylvania border .
On a recent rainy day I ventured there because the 24 - hour diner , which brews fresh coffee every 20 minutes , is also home of the Mt. Olympus : a 50 - pound hamburger .
Yes , that 's right : 50 pounds of beef on a homemade bun with lettuce , tomatoes , cheese and more calories than you could ever imagine .
If five people can eat the burger in three hours or less it is free , plus the stuffed customers split a $ 1,000 prize .
Otherwise , they have to pay the $ 159.95 bill .
Has anybody ever accomplished the feat ?
" Not yet , " said diner owner Mike Zambas .
" They are trying though . "
Having never participated in an eating contest or anything of the sort , I was not about to try this alone .
So I sought the advice of King George .
No , he is n't some British monarch ; just a guy from Jersey who really likes food .
George Van Laar has always been a big eater .
He blames it on his grandmother who used to always say : " ' Come on Georgie , eat what 's put in front of you . '
And I always did . "
But he did n't get into it " professionally " until a 1999 hot dog eating competition .
After an epic battle of chewing , swallowing and trying to prevent regurgitation -- or " reversal of fortune " as it's called by those in the business -- Van Laar emerged a champion , winning a pair of World Series tickets .
The king was born .
He now shows up at events wearing a royal crown and occasionally a red cape .
A True Value Meal ?
The first bit of advice Van Laar had for me : stretch my stomach out the night before .
Contrary to my first instinct , I was to eat a big dinner and then a light breakfast .
Okay , but 25 pounds of beef ?
I was about to find out .
Van Laar and I took a corner table at the diner and waited for the Mt. Olympus to be carried out to us .
The best way to describe this burger is : gargantuan .
Zambas has to bake a special bun big enough to hold the thing .
An entire package of American cheese is used to cover it , as well as a whole head of lettuce and several tomatoes .
When the burger arrived at the table , every customer in the diner turned and looked at us .
Several came over to check it out .
And that 's exactly what Zambas wants .
We turned a normal Saturday afternoon lunch into a spectacle .
Suddenly that couple two tables over got a side of entertainment with their BLT .
Van Laar and I are served a giant slab of the burger .
Immediately , I doubt I can finish it .
In fact , I doubt with 10 people we could finish this burger .
Maybe 20 .
I ask about ketchup and Van Laar advises : " you are an idiot if you add anything to it . "
Okay .
Never mind .
We eat .
We chew .
We drink lots of water .
Other patrons come over to pose for photographs .
Van Laar brought a stack of photos from other eating competitions .
He autographs them and hands them out .
An hour passes and I am ready to accept defeat .
We still have two hours left to accomplish this task but I have consumed more food than at any other time in my life and yet most of the burger remains .
Our waiter , Gezim Mavraj , comes over .
" Take your time , we never close , " he reminds us .
Even George and his " iron - clad stomach " seem to be slowing .
He explains : it 's not the meat but the thick bun that makes this challenge virtually impossible .
The irony of the whole thing is that as I wolf this pile of beef I keep looking at this healthy eating ad on the table .
" You do n't need to clean your plate , " it says .
" Consider sharing an appetizer , entree or dessert . "
I take that as a sign .
We get the rest of the burger to go and accept defeat .
Oversized Pancakes
If you do n't like steak or burgers or meat , do n't fret .
There are still plenty of other eating challenges .
Each year , hikers along the Pacific Crest Trail stop in Seiad Valley , Calif. , and try the pancake challenge at Rick Jones ' café .
If they can finish five gigantic inch - thick pancakes in two hours or less they get the meal for free plus a T - shirt and a hat .
Failure brings a $ 12 check .
The challenge has been around since 1985 , and each year about 60 people try it .
Only 16 have succeeded .
" They think they are hungry , " Jones said .
" Well , they are hungry but it 's like putting 5 pounds in a 3 - pound sack . "
" It 's something that 's talked about up and down the trail , " Jones said , adding that for most , it 's just a " photo op . "
A Big Dessert
That might be a great way to start your day , but to end it consider the Dare to be Great Sundae served at The Parlour in Jackson , Mich .
It 's 21 scoops of ice cream plus chocolate syrup , pineapples , strawberries , marshmallows , chopped nuts and whipped cream and , of course , cherries .
Wow , that 's a lot of dessert .
" And our scoops are really big , they 're like baseball sized , " said general manager Elaine Strader .
Eat it by yourself in an hour and it's free .
Only one or two people a year succeed .
The rest have to pay $ 29.99 .
Winners and losers get their names on a board .
There are a lot more names under the attempt column than the success column .
" It 's a very an elite group , " Strader said .
" I 've personally never seen anybody try it twice . "
Attempting the sundae challenge is about pride more than anything else .
Strader said that most of the challengers tend to be teenage males .
Recessions Bring Promotions
The promotion or giveaway is nothing new .
Companies have always tried to lure customers with something different .
When gas prices were high , hotels and casinos were offering patrons free gas cards .
Today 's economic downturn is bringing back many of those cash giveaways .
For instance , Doritos is asking Americans to create their own Super Bowl ads .
Five finalists will win $ 25,000 each .
The top prize is $ 1 million .
When Clyde Volte was hired 15 years ago to help J&R's Steak House brand itself , he thought up the 76 - oz .
Steak Challenge .
Basically , he found the largest steak challenge in the country and decided to top it at the New York restaurant .
" The primary thing was to have us different than somebody else , " he said .
" Everybody has to have a gimmick . "
Vlote said that few people are looking to save money by trying the challenge .
" It 's more of a pride of this point , " he said .
" I do n't think anybody came in seeking a free meal .
That might be in the back of their head but the ego is mainly the thing .
They usually come in with two or three friends .
Very few people come in by themselves . "
It 's All About Fun
Arnie Chapman knows a thing or two about eating .
He heads the Association of Independent Competitive Eaters , which works with different venues to host competitions .
The key for restaurants is that they usually get a lot of publicity , especially from the local media .
Some challenges are doable , others are in Chapman 's mind nothing more than " suckers bets , that nobody 's ever going to do . "
The key , he said , is that the owners with the best events are the type of people with a great sense of humor .
" The one thing I 've tried to do with competitive eating is never take the silliness out of it , " Chapman said .
" It 's all about going back to the best time in my life , which was sixth grade . "
What is the attraction of Mad Men ?
There 's the clothes , of course : every single woman wears spotless dresses with waists in the natural place , swishing or very tight - one could enjoy that in the same way as one fancies the high - waisted Jane Austen frocks or the long skirts of Cranford .
But there 's a ghastly fascination , too , in the way the women were treated , the extraordinary taken - for - granted chauvinism of every single man .
All the women were either wives - to be kept firmly in their place at home - or secretaries to be laid and / or ignored .
And when a bright secretary actually did a bit of excellent copywriting , the response of her bosses was : " It 's like watching a dog play the piano . "
The women seem to accept this , though with their own subversive strategies for coping .
They accept , too , that they all had to be perfect at all times ; they all without exception have large cone - shaped breasts and shining hair , even in bed - surely we did n't wear bras in bed in those days ?
If the series did nothing else , it made you realise exactly why bra-burning became a symbol of the women 's movement - indeed why it should n't have surprised anybody that Betty Friedan 's 1963 book The Feminine Mystique lit such a forest fire .
Not that anyone on this side of the Atlantic ever did actually burn their bra - but things were different for us .
A major part of the Mad Men plot concerned a really bright secretary who finally morphed into a junior copywriter ( though not without paying the immemorial female price of being left holding - or in her case refusing to hold - the baby ) .
Even in 1950 a friend of mine went straight from Cambridge to a copywriting job in J Walter Thompson ; Fay Weldon was achieving fame with " Go To Work on an Egg " long before she wrote novels ; most British graduates , even then , thought of something well beyond shorthand and typing .
Of course different bits of a society move at different rates .
But the assumption that getting your man was the only goal that mattered - and I suppose that having got him you did what he said - was a far stronger conviction in America .
Even in the 50s , when I was at Cornell , there were perfectly intelligent girls who said openly : " I 'm here to get my Mrs degree . "
Whether it was because the second world war had n't been fought at home , as the European one was , so the changes on the home front had been less marked , or for some other reason , it is odd that American women were shoved so much more firmly back into the kitchen and the nursery than we were .
I remember once having an argument about this with Marilyn French , who wrote the classic feminist novel The Women 's Room ; I was quite unable to convince her that educated European women often had a far better shake than the Americans she was writing about , that we were not necessarily so downtrodden ; and that this was perhaps why the whole women 's movement took a milder form here than it did in the States .
It is odd , though , that American women should - at least in theory - have been so dedicated to domesticity , when you think of the toughness that they must have had as pioneers , coping with twisters and locusts and being left on their own for months on end if their men were herding cattle .
Yet this picture of a totally male - dominated workplace rings true enough .
In 1978 I happened to be in the offices of the Chicago Herald Tribune : there was one white - haired woman who dated from the Depression , and a cheerful horde of young post - women 's - movement ones : nothing in between .
As late as the mid 70s a friend of mine was told , admittedly in Alabama : " We do n't hire women reporters . "
Nobody had told them , I suppose , that there were women reporters in America even in the 19th century - or perhaps someone had , and they were terrified .
We can sit back , gin in hand , comfortably watching this 60s scene and thinking how awful it was in the olden days .
But is it really that different now ?
The 80s surge of women into boardrooms has , if anything , reversed ; there are women in all sorts of top jobs and the working mother , rare enough when I was young , is now standard .
There are even one or two newspaper editors who are women ; but Murdoch 's empire has an overwhelmingly male boardroom ; and among the handwringing about our financial crisis is an admission that raging testosterone , unchecked by female influence , has been half the trouble .
An apparently immovable assumption that really the important jobs are done by men is pretty deeply ingrained .
Why should this be so ?
I do n't know , but I 'm greatly attracted to the theory of Janet Radcliffe Richards , she of The Sceptical Feminist , who said that if women really could n't do the jobs men kept them out of , there would be no need for discrimination .
It was because they could ( and Margaret Mead said she knew of no job that had n't been an all - male job in one community and an all - female job in another ) that men were so keen to corral their women in separate jobs .
Why ?
The answer , she thought , lay in the realm of genetics : men did not want their women to be exposed to other men ; they did not want to risk bringing up the product of another man 's genes .
It was segregation they were really after .
But were n't these advertising Mad Men surrounded by secretaries , tea ladies , servants , waitresses ?
Ah yes , but those were n't the ones you married .
The ones you actually bred from were stuck out in Westchester County looking after " those little people - a job you do better than anyone else in the world " .
So how will it all work out in the Mad Men series ?
There were signs at the end of the first series that Peggy , the bright , friendly secretary , was becoming a stereotypical harsh career woman ; will she turn out to be an aggressive single mother ?
Will the plot soften and give her a nice clean husband ?
And what about Don Draper , abandoned by his family at the end of the first series ?
We shall have to wait and see .
Ryan , one of the guys in the office where I work has had some issues with this company , so promised I ’d blog about it .
So my loves , here goes :
Ryan bought his girlfriend a gift for her 21st birthday – a ‘ Deluxe Fashion Experience ’ at New ID Photographic Studios in London – 17 - 18 Margaret Street , London W1W 8RP .
The experience included a haircut , a makeover and a photoshoot .
He paid £ 50 for the ‘ makeover session ’ , and an additional £ 50 to put towards any photos which she wanted to purchase .
Initially everything was going really well – the hair and makeup was lovely , and she really enjoyed the photoshoot .
They fully intended to purchase a couple of photos – ( as a momento if you will ) however , at New ID they employ some fairly sneaky selling tactics .
They rolled out the ‘ you should really consider modelling ’ line .
Buoyed up with a couple of free glasses of bubbly , seeing the photos , and the photographer ’s reaction Ryan and his girlfriend ( both 21 ) were swayed a little .
As Ryan ’s girlfriend had previously modelled as a child the idea of going back to it did n’t seem too outrageous .
The staff at New ID then went on to suggest that she ’d need a portfolio of pictures if it was something that she wanted to pursue …
That was the clincher .
End game is – they fell for it .
At a terrifying cost of around £ 1,400 they decided to purchase all of the pictures .
As you ’d expect a couple of 21 year olds do n’t have that sort of money knocking about , so they took out a credit agreement .
Come Monday – the realisation dawned that they ’d been had .
Having called around a couple of modelling agencies they found out that not only was Ryan ’s girlfriend too short to model – even if she was taller – she would not need a portfolio to approach an agency .
Typically modelling agencies simply require a couple of photos – and it really does n’t matter how professional or otherwise they are .
Perhaps unsurprisingly – it seems that New ID make it very difficult to get your money back .
They claim that the agreement which Ryan & his girlfriend entered into cannot be cancelled .
To add insult to injury , they then called up Ryan ’s girlfriend to ask permission to use her photos for promotional purposes on their website .
Without wishing to sound like a Daily Mail reader , I think that the policies and indeed the behaviour of this company are reprehensible .
Let ’s face it , a couple of 21 year olds , who ’ve had a really nice day , who ’ve been loosened up with the complimentary bubbly are pretty easy prey .
I ’m not a lawyer , but it may be that from a legal standpoint their ‘ no cancellation ’ policy can be upheld .
But this company ’s business practise of encouraging young girls to purchase ‘ portfolio pictures ’ which they do not even need is , as far as I ’m concerned , morally devoid .
There is a fundamentalist anxiety that I hold in great sympathy .
My sympathy is driven by the fact that I lived for many years under the burden of that very anxiety .
It is the hidden fear that possibly , despite all faith exercised in the opposite direction , the Bible may not , in fact , be true .
A great deal of energy is spent in maintaining the integrity of the dike that withstands this anxiety .
I grew in the shadow of Bob Jones University , one of the most prominent bastions of American fundamentalism .
The ideas of that university permeate not only the students who study there , but in many ways the surrounding culture of Christianity in the area .
The fear is pointed towards Darwin and any possibility of his evolutionary theory .
It drives biology students at the university to reach strange conclusions , regardless of the science .
I was taught at age ten by a biology student from Bob Jones , in a Baptist summer camp , that blacks were simply biological inferior to whites based on false information that he shared with a group of young , impressionable kids .
Perhaps his biology was not the product of his university classes .
But it was as baseless as much of the science that was done there .
The same fear drives the concern for the Flood of Noah and the age of the planet ( not to mention any possible hint of evolutionary science ) .
Thus the earth must be young , the flood must be literal ( with perhaps a still existing Ark on Mt. Ararat ) .
Science has an answer that it must prove , rather than a question to be answered .
The agenda of such fundamentalist science is set by the need to refute anything that possibly undermines a peculiar view of Scripture .
One flaw and the entire house of cards comes tumbling down .
It makes for bad science and even worse Biblical interpretation .
I am no friend of liberal Biblical studies .
I suffered under such oppression for a number of years and can say that fundamentalism also has a liberal form .
I was punished ( intellectually ) for believing all of the articles of the Nicene Creed as much as a Darwinist would suffer at Bob Jones .
But that is its own story .
The history of literalism is a checkered affair .
Some of the early fathers leaned in a literalist direction for many parts of Scripture , though leaving room for other , more symbolic approaches , where appropriate .
The great battles over the historical literalism of Scripture arose in the 18th and 18th centuries in Europe and America ( battles over certain scientific matters versus literalism began even earlier ) .
Part of the tragedy in these battles was that the battlefield itself was a fairly newly - defined area and failed to take into account the full history of Biblical interpretation .
For a young believer in the midst of America ’s own intellectual religious wars in the late 20th century – my question was whether the choices presented were the only choices available .
I should preface my remaining remarks with the simple affirmation : I believe the Bible is true .
Having said that , I must add that the Scriptures do not stand as an independent work of literature or a self - contained Holy Book .
The Bible is not God ’s revelation to man : Jesus Christ is God ’s revelation to man .
The Scriptures bear witness to Him and are thus “ true ” as a true witness to the God / Man Jesus Christ .
As others have noted , the Scriptures are true as they are accepted and understood by the Church that received them .
They are Scripture as recognized by the Church and cannot be removed from the Church only to turn them against the Church .
They are unique writings , and must be read in a unique way .
That way is found in the liturgies of the Church and the commentaries of the Fathers .
It is also true that within the writings of the Fathers there can be a variety of opinion on a number of Scriptural matters .
The essential agreement is their testimony to Christ .
Genesis is about Christ .
Exodus is about Christ , and so forth .
Read any other way , the books are interesting , but they will not be read in a manner that has been received by the Orthodox Christian Church .
Of course , the historical method ( whether literal or historical critical ) represents only two possibly ways of reading the text of Scripture .
There are assumptions behind both that are problematic from an Orthodox perspective .
For many , the notion of “ salvation history ” has become so dominant that they cannot think about history in any manner other than that which they have been taught .
I can think of a number of problems :
First – the traditional modern view ( whether fundamentalist or otherwise ) of history , is a matter of chronology .
It sees a beginning at some point in the past and a progression to some point in the future .
This same chain of events is generally viewed as reality , or the ground of reality , and championed above all other things .
God acts in history , they will argue , but history is somehow the reality with which God has to deal .
This is highly problematic for an Orthodox theological understanding .
Not only does Scripture treat history as quite relative ( Christ is the Alpha and the Omega , the beginning and the end , He is also the “ Lamb slain from the foundations of the earth ” ) , it in fact makes history subject to the end of things – making history simply one aspect of lived eschatology .
Thus time and chronology do not govern reality – God governs reality .
By the same token , Holy Scripture is a Divine account of reality , not itself explained by chronology nor subject to historical validation , but subject to the Truth as it is made known to us in Jesus Christ .
Thus the New Testament is Scripture , though the writings of Josephus or Tacitus are mere history .
There is a nervousness that runs through the body fundamentalist when phrases such as “ mere history ” are uttered .
It is a nervousness that is born of the attempts of liberal modernists to dismiss as “ myth and fiction ” what are seen as events essential to our salvation in Christ .
No one who is a believer could treat such anxiety with anything but sympathy .
In many ways , with the tools at hand , conservatives in Western Christianity have fought a valiant fight to defend the faith against a serious contender .
But that fight does not justify every argument advanced by fundamentalism .
Orthodoxy offers a different approach .
I recognize a nervousness that occurs among many conservatives if “ truth ” is approached in any manner other than literal .
Liberals have played games with words for so many years that believers are rightly wary of word - games .
On the other hand , for theological accuracy , it is necessary to speak of truth and its character in Christian revelation .
The Scriptures tell us that Jesus Christ Himself is the Truth .
This is not to say that He is the Truth as compared to some external criterion of truth , but rather that He Himself is the criterion and definition of what is true .
Things are true and false only as they are compared to Him .
He may be compared to nothing else .
By that token , it is problematic to define “ truth ” by some particular standard of “ historicity . ”
I understand the importance of saying , “ This is really true , ” and would never want to deny such a thing .
The tomb on Pascha was empty , Christ is truly raised from the dead by every standard and then transcending every standard .
His resurrection is the true ground of all reality .
Having said that , it must also be said that the Scriptures are true ( as Scriptures ) only inasmuch as they reveal Christ as the risen Lord and what that means for all creation .
The witness of the Church is that these writings do precisely that and are thus Scripture .
But it is the resurrection of Christ that undergirds the Scriptures and not vice versa .
The disciples did not understand the Scriptures until they understood the risen Lord .
And this remains the case .
Thus the import of Noah ’s flood is to be found in Holy Baptism and not the other way around .
Creation as shared in the first chapter of Genesis is an unfolding of the Paschal mystery and it is from that mystery that it derives its value .
I could multiply such examples .
When this principle is forgotten , Christians find themselves arguing over points of geology or archaeology and not over the triumphant resurrection of Christ .
If Christ is risen from the dead , everything else becomes moot .
If Christ is not risen from the dead , then all Christian statements become moot .
Christ is risen from the dead .
What can we say to these things ?
The Scriptures are true because Christ is risen from the dead and this is their message .
The faith of the Orthodox is that all things find their beginning and their end – their meaning and their fulfillment in the Pascha of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ .
This is the good news .
What other good news could there be ?

The Colorado Springs Gazette reports :
Northern Command is providing help in the disaster response to flooding in North Dakota , the command said Thursday in a press release .
The command will stage at the Grand Forks Air Force Base to aid the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
NorthCom will help distribute supplies and coordinate the relief effort .
A defense coordinating officer dispatched by NorthCom will act as the liaison between FEMA and NorthCom , relaying capabilities available to FEMA and coordinating movement of active - duty personnel and equipment to assist should the need arise .
NorthCom is based at Peterson Air Force Base .

Apparently sending the military out in response to natural disasters is so common place now the corporate media does not bother to report on it .
Section 1076 of the John Warner Defense Appropriation
Act essentially nullified Posse Comitatus , as Sen. Patrick Leahy argued at the time .
The bill states the armed forces will be used to : “ Restore public order and enforce the laws of the United States when , as a result of a natural disaster , epidemic , or other serious public health emergency , terrorist attack or incident , or other condition in any State or possession of the United States . ”
The the John Warner Defense Appropriation
Act was subsequently repealed in its entirety .
However , you would n’t know it if you live in North Dakota .

Investigators discovered that Fritzl had secretly built a four - room dungeon underneath the garden of the family home , where he kept his daughter and their three children imprisoned behind a series of eight locked doors .
He allegedly told them he had booby - trapped the cellar and that they would be gassed to death if they tried to escape .
Overpopulation and rampant crime has led the Chinese to develop a rolling lethal injection bus complete with a live video feed of the killings .
Details inside .

Jinguan Auto , a popular Chinese ambulance manufacturer , has developed a rolling execution studio .
Convicts are strapped to a power sliding stretcher that extends out of the rear of the bus as it's allegedly " too brutal " to haul people on board for their final cocktail .
The executions are broadcast to local law enforcement authorities to make sure they are conducted up to code .
This trumps the traditional firing line - style executions as small cities do not need to build expensive specialized death structures .
We thought you just needed a stained wall , a blindfold and a pack of cigarettes to dole out the harshness , but it seems this is a new , caring China .
The lethal injections are supposedly much more humane than having someone kneel and play catch the bullet with their brain .

Not so fast with the China lovin ' , though .
The Chinese have gotten in trouble in the past for harvesting the organs of their prisoners to sell to Westerners in need of a transplant .
Critics claim that the new death bus simply makes it much easier to harvest organs in secret while they 're still usable instead of rushing some bleeding guy into the back room for a hasty slicing .
Nobody is allowed to view the bodies of prisoners before they are cremated , so this rumor could prove to be true .
It 's great fun to be poking sticks at the Chinese for being immoral , but we 're sure more than a few of you would be calling up your buddy Mao right quick when your liver is shot from years of pounding squeeze .
Whatever the case , the Chinese had a vision .

After the MacRuby 0.4 release brought a new graphics library and improvements such as a Threaded GC , the next version of MacRuby will feature improvements in performance .
A blog entry now explains the new LLVM based VM , which will replace YARV , in an experimental branch of MacRuby :
The new VM transforms the abstract source tree ( AST ) directly from the parser into LLVM 's intermediate representation ( IR ) , which is then compiled into optimized machine code .
A number of other key optimizations have also been completed , such as fast fixnum arithmetic , cached method dispatch , zero - cost IA64 exceptions , fast instance variable access , constants caching , fast break / next , cheap local variables , tail call optimization and much more .
The source for Roxor , the new VM , is available in an experimental SVN branch .
The compile_node method basically takes the Ruby AST and turns it into LLVM instructions consisting of either primitives or calls to the Ruby runtime .
While MacRuby is based on Ruby 1.9.1 , some of the changes such as the new experimental VM and use of Objective - C types can cause compatibility issues .
To keep compatibility in check , MacRuby 's integrated with RubySpec ( from the blog entry ) :
The current experimental branch is already able to pass most of the language specifications and will be a standard part of our regression test suite .
We are also actively working on upgrading the specifications to match the Ruby 1.9 behaviors .
RubySpec is an executable spec for the behavior of Ruby implementations , and was started by the Rubinius project .
Antonio Cangiano ran a few language feature microbenchmarks on the experimental MacRuby version , which yielded very good results compared to MRI and standard 1.9.1 .
It remains to be seen how the performance develops over the next release (s ) .
Antonio also points out some of the advantages of MacRuby :
Rather than relying on a mix of Objective - C and Ruby ( through a bridge like RubyCocoa ) , developers can use MacRuby which integrates with Mac OS X core technologies and acts as an alternative language to Objective - C .
To be exact , Objective - C's runtime and generational garbage collector are at the heart of MacRuby , but from an API standpoint , programmers can write code in Ruby , instead of in the more verbose and low level Objective -C .
Considering the long list of GUI libraries and abstractions for Ruby , developers targeting OS X can simply MacRuby to build applications that tightly integrate with the Cocoa libraries , instead of having to use Objective -C .
When the maximum number of bits output from a PRNG is equal to the 2 ^ blocksize , the resulting output delivers the mathematically expected security level that the key size would be expected to generate , but the output can be distinguished from a true random number generator .
When the maximum number of bits output from this PRNG is less than 2 ^blocksize , the expected security level is delivered and the output appears to be indistinguishable from a true random number generator .
In the next revision , limiting the total number of generate requests and the bits provided per generate request will show security strength .
Dual_EC_DRBG
is part of the standard though it is not cryptographically secure due to a kleptographic NSA backdoor .
NIST SP 800- 90A Rev.1 is essentially NIST SP 800-90A with the Dual_EC_DRBG removed .
CTR_DRBG , another PRNG , is based on a block cipher running in counter mode and whilst its design is uncontroversial , it has been proven to be weaker than others in distinguishing an attack .
The standards for statistical testing of new CSPRNG designs are maintained by NIST along with a good reference of standard CSPRNGs .

Taking this variation on the timeless precept word for word , Google has launched a new Google Apps Reseller Program that allows third parties to bundle customized Google Apps subscriptions with their services .
The program may boost market share and make it easier for small and medium businesses to make the switch , but it could also be a quiet admission that Google 's software - as - a - service ( SaaS ) approach is n't exactly bowling over customers yet .
Announced on the Official Google Blog , Google 's new authorized reseller program allows technology consultants and other IT professionals to become service providers for Google Apps for Business , the search giant 's collection of cloud - based e-mail , calendaring , and other collaboration applications .
After applying to Google 's reseller program , resellers will have access to Google - produced training and sales documentation and can begin selling tailored Google Apps deployments alongside their established services .
Resellers can handle all aspects of branding the Google Apps applications , creating end user accounts , switching DNS records , migration , and any other rollout steps and preparation for each customer .
This should be a boon to small and medium businesses that are interested in experimenting with the cloud , but have neither the time nor technical resources to embark on the journey by themselves .
Google expresses multiple times at its program site that resellers more or less take over the Google Apps relationship with their customers .
Resellers are billed according to the number of Google Apps accounts they create , which means they are in charge of billing and collecting from their customers .
Google will still provide customer support , but it encourages resellers to take over the front line of support requests , allowing them to customize the contact information that customers see in their admin control panels .
Google is effectively encouraging middlemen to become one - stop Google Apps armies , hoping to stay as much out of the way as possible while enabling its soldiers to fight the war .
Google 's Reseller Program introductory video
A Google Apps reseller program was inevitable , though it still has its shortcomings .
In particular , Google did n't have any sort of certification or fancy letterhead ready for the launch ; those are still on the way .
That said , it is n't hard to see this as a sign that Google Apps may be struggling .
Google has seen some notable success since beginning to charge businesses for using Google Apps about two years ago , with a handful of colleges and 1.3 million addresses from the New South Wales , Australia Department of Education among Google 's touted one - million - strong customer base .
But despite a report concluding that Gmail costs about one - third the price of hosted e-mail and Google Docs ' new ability to go offline , web apps like Google 's offerings do n't seem to be making any major , concerted dents in Microsoft Office 's stronghold around office productivity .
Between Google Apps ' lack of niche - but - critical features , continued concerns over privacy and data security , and the fact that most users still do n't office in the cloud , Google Apps ' resellers surely have quite a battle ahead of them .
A variety of personal , social , economic and religious pressures can make some transgender people reverse transition , but " going back does n't automatically clear the conundrum that causes you to get there in the first place , " says Donna Rose , a female - to - male postoperative transsexual .
Enlarge By JasonSmith.com Christine Daniels , speaking at the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association convention in San Diego in August 2007 , resumed her L.A. Times job as Mike Penner in October 2008 .
JOIN THE DISCUSSION JOIN THE DISCUSSION
Talk back :
Does the courtesy reminder at the bottom of a story hurt or harm the conversation ?
The day Mike Penner left the Los Angeles Times made the news .
The longtime sportswriter wrote the article himself , a personal essay explaining that he was taking some time off and , upon his return , he would be known from then on as Christine Daniels .
Penner 's public acknowledgment in April 2007 that he was transgender and would soon live as a woman shocked the world of sports journalism and turned his new identity , Daniels , into an instant celebrity .
Daniels gave speeches , was profiled in Sports Illustrated , collected honors for courage from transgender groups and wrote a blog for the Times titled " Woman In Progress . "
Except that the transition did n't last .
In mid-October 2008 , after a lengthy leave of absence , Penner , 51 , returned to the sports pages and the Times newsroom as a man .
And just as suddenly , Penner 's story , heralded in its early days as a triumphant example of transgender progress , has instead become a cautionary tale of the lesser - known phenomenon : transgender regret .
" It 's unfortunate and it 's relatively uncommon but certainly not unheard of , " says Denise Leclair , executive director of the International Foundation for Gender Education , a Waltham , Mass . - based transgender advocacy group .
" The simplest way to think about it is being trans is something that never goes away .
...
There 's just a fairly constant social pressure to just go back .
You do n't have to be a genius to understand that society does n't really accept this . "
Penner , a 24 - year veteran of the newspaper , did not respond to calls and e-mails for comment and has not written about his decision to resume life as a man .
The blog and bylines as Christine Daniels have been removed from the newspaper 's website .
Though there 's no data available on how many transgender people abandon their new gender , psychologist Ron Lawrence of the Community Counseling Center in Las Vegas says about 5 % of his transgender patients revert .
Leclair echoes that estimate .
Adhering to a code Transgender advocates say the case of Penner , who never had sex - change surgery , reflects the success of a system in which American sex - change surgeons , adhering to their own code of conduct , wo n't operate until the patient has had a year of intense psychotherapy while living publicly in the new gender .
" We 're required ( by doctors ) to go through all this stuff for a reason , even though there are a lot of trans people who bristle at being told what they can and can't do , " says Donna Rose , a male - to - female postoperative transsexual in Rochester , N.Y .
" The thing that people have to understand is that even though Mike decided to retransition , that does n't mean he 's not trans .
It 's not like you go all of a sudden , ' Uh , I 'm better . '
Going back does n't automatically clear the conundrum that causes you to get there in the first place . "
Rose reversed course on her own transition at first because her then - wife became so distraught and co-workers were insensitive .
Six months later , she went through with it and ended the marriage .
Transitioning carries with it the prospect of losing jobs , friends and family , as well as mockery from strangers who find the gender change visibly jarring , Rose and others attest .
" You become a very visible minority , " Leclair says .
" The average male - to - female transsexual is taller , has bigger hands and feet , has more facial hair than most women .
There are a lot of physical attributes that are hard to hide in a society that does n't like you . "
Religion sometimes comes into play .
Joseph Cluse of Newport News , Va. , lived his life as Joanna for 30 years after having the surgery in the 1970s .
Yet Cluse , who was married twice and raised one husband 's children , became religious in recent years and decided that God wanted him to resume his life as a man .
Cluse , 54 , stopped taking hormones and had breast implants removed .
Cases such as Penner and Cluse raise questions about the causes of transgenderism .
Paul McHugh , director of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore , is a leading proponent of the notion that the cause is not biological , that transgender people have chosen this path .
He halted the university hospital 's practice of performing gender reassignment surgeries in the late 1970s because , he says , a study indicated that postoperative transsexuals were no happier than they were before the operation .
" You can live any way you want , but do n't come to us and ask us to give medical resources to this proposal of yours , because we think it 's a social construct and not a condition of nature , " McHugh says .
" No one has demonstrated any physical mechanism or physical problem that causes this .
The burden of proof is on them to prove that . "
Debating the cause Such comments are anathema to the transgender advocates , who insist the decades - old study McHugh cites was debunked .
Like most transsexuals , Daniels told Sports Illustrated in 2007 that her urges to be female began as a child , and she wrote in the Times that same year : " We are born with this .
We fight it as long as we can , and in the end it wins . "
Claire Winter , a transsexual from Seattle who mentored Penner and spoke to him late last year , doubts the sportswriter 's reversal will further confuse the general public about transsexualism .
" I think people are so bloody confused , I do n't know if this has a significant effect , " Winter says .
" But maybe this will help people to understand that this is a very complex , highly difficult situation .
This indicates the fundamental problem of trying to shove people into either end of the gender pole .
It serves to point out the fact that it is n't as simple as flipping a coin .
" I would say give ( Penner ) some time , " Winter says .
" We have to wait for him to let us know when he figures it out . "

ON MAIN STREET , GREEN IS THE NEW BLACK .
On Wall Street , however , most green investments generated a sea of red ink last year .
When the wheels came off stock markets around the globe in the fourth quarter of 2008 , alternative - energy and clean - technology shares were among the hardest hit .
The 88 - stock WilderHill New Energy Global Innovation index , a popular green - industry benchmark , ended the year down 61 % , versus a 38.5 % slide in the Standard & Poor 's 500 .
This year , the NEX -- a mix of mostly small - to mid-capitalization wind , solar , biofuel and energy - conservation leaders from 21 countries -- is off about 22 % , lagging the S&P 's 17 % decline .
Washington is targeting billions for new clean - tech programs .
But it 's old companies with fresh ideas that will deliver the goods .
Nicholas Eveleigh for Barron's
Other clean - tech indexes , exchange - traded funds and mutual funds , including the vaunted Winslow Green Growth Fund ( ticker : WGGFX ) , have n't fared much better , and in some cases have done worse , while venture - stage green companies have been starved of capital or blocked on their way to the public markets .
Brian Fan , senior director of research for the Cleantech Group , cites 80 green companies in the latter boat , burning through a collective $ 2 billion of venture - capital money with little prospect of going public any time soon .
" The companies we talk to are trying to stay solvent , " says Fan .
Indeed , the same might be said of their financial backers , and other green - oriented investors .
A global recession and bear market deserve much of the blame for the carnage in green - tinged shares , as does a $ 100 - a - barrel plunge in oil prices , which suddenly made the drive for sustainable - energy alternatives seem less pressing .
Moreover , many clean - tech companies are small and speculative in nature , and serve end markets that depend on government subsidies -- not a particularly attractive investment attribute .
Former solar - energy highfliers such as First Solar ( FSLR ) and LDK Solar ( LDK ) faced additional challenges last year from sharply escalating prices for polysilicon , the raw material used in solar cells .
In toting up the losses , it is tempting to wonder whether green - themed investing was just a sustainable version of sock puppets -- that is , another Wall Street fad .
But such musings could n't be more misguided .
In the U.S. , President Barack Obama has just pledged to spend billions on environmentally friendly technologies , while Congress is planning to put more money and muscle behind the search for energy alternatives and pollution controls ( see " Obama 's Blueprint for a Daring Green Machine " ) .
Energy Secretary Steven Chu recently told Barron 's sister publication , The Wall Street Journal , that his agency intends to fast - track billions of dollars in loans for alternative - energy projects already " in the pipeline , " and that he will try to get roughly half the $ 37 billion already set aside for clean - tech capital projects distributed within the year .
That is just a down payment on much more ambitious economic initiatives , and is mirrored by similar endeavors abroad .
GREATER GOVERNMENT
FUNDING BODES well for some pure plays in the solar , wind , ethanol and biomass industries .
But it bodes even better , near term , for well - established , diversified and financially healthy companies like Switzerland 's ABB ( ABB ) , Florida utility FPL Group ( FPL ) , Waste Management ( WMI ) , Jacobs Engineering ( JEC ) and electrical - products supplier Eaton ( ETN ) .
All are visible and increasingly powerful players in areas given spending priority : energy conservation , infrastructure renewal and the build - out of a " smarter " power grid .
To be sure , more public and private spending will benefit alternative - energy giants like General Electric ( GE ) , the biggest U.S. supplier of wind turbines , and United Technologies ( UTX ) , a leader in making buildings more energy - efficient .
Johnson Controls ( JCI ) , Honeywell ( HON ) , AES ( AES ) and others that make sensors and systems needed to optimize HVAC ( heating , ventilating and air - conditioning ) also belong on any list of likely green winners .
So do a handful of midsized players in the fast - growing wind - energy - generation supply chain , such as Kaydon ( KDN ) , a maker of ball bearings critical to wind - turbine efficiency ; Woodward Governor ( WGOV ) a specialist in energy - generation and transmission components ; MasTec ( MTZ ) , a builder of generation and transmission facilities , and Valmont ( VMI ) , which makes transition towers and other utility structures .
" All are profitable , old - line industrials projecting double - digit growth in 2009 and trying to reinvent themselves , " says Ed Mitby , an analyst at Van Eck Associates .
But we consider ABB , Waste Management , FPL , Jacobs and Eaton a sort of green dream team , for all the reasons , and then some , explained below .
They probably are n't the first names that come to mind when you think " green , " but they have the products , technologies and , not least , the financial strength to deliver for investors .
Even better , their stocks are bargains .
A PROVIDER OF POWER AND AUTOMATION systems , ABB tops most shortlists of companies likely to benefit from large - scale energy projects and conservation initiatives .
Among other things , the 125 - year - old industrial giant is one of the world 's biggest builders of electricity grids .
With credit frozen and demand constrained , ABB faces the same challenges as other industrial outfits .
But the company , profiled favorably in Barron 's last spring ( " The GE of Europe Is a Major Power Player , " May 19 , 2008 ) , is better positioned to benefit from more government and industry spending on infrastructure upgrades around the world , says Van Eck 's Mitby .
Headquartered in Zurich , ABB sells large - scale electrical circuitry , robotics and energy - monitoring and automation systems .
It seems to land one multimillion - dollar infrastructure contract after another , including a recent $ 63 million deal to upgrade a power station in Saudi Arabia .
Renewable - energy projects will need ABB 's products and services , and its technology , including power - management sensors and load - balancing systems , has kept it ahead of most competitors , says Morningstar analyst Daniel Holland .
ABB 's shares have been cut by almost two - thirds , to 12 , from their high last May , and now trade for nine times 2009 estimated earnings of $ 1.32 a share , a discount to the S&P 500's price / earnings multiple .
Granted , last year 's earnings were higher , at $ 1.74 a share , slightly exceeding expectations .
Morningstar puts the company 's fair value at 19 a share , some 62 % above last week 's close .
Investors can collect a 46 - cent annual dividend ( for a current yield of 3.8 % ) while waiting for the global economy to jump - start .
ABB recently shed some poorly performing assets in an efficiency drive of its own .
The company boasts a strong balance sheet , and net cash ( cash minus debt ) of $ 5.4 billion , or $ 2.40 a share , Holland notes .
It has used excess cash to boost its payout and buy in shares .
Twelve - month return on equity of 28.39 % is more than three times that of its peer group , which includes industrial outfits such as Emerson Electric ( EMR ) and Danaher ( DHR ) .
" We are in the sweet spot of energy efficiency and of climate change , " chief financial officer Michel Demaré told Barron 's last spring .
For ABB , it is about to get sweeter .
AS THE NATION'S LEADING PRODUCER of energy from wind and solar power , FPL Group is at the forefront of commercialization of these technologies .
The Juno Beach , Fla . - based company also is the largest power generator in one of the nation 's most populated states .
Its regulated utility arm , Florida Power & Light , serves 4.5 million customers and contributes just over half of revenue , which totaled $ 16 billion last year .
A slightly smaller , but faster - growing revenue stream flows from FPL 's recently re-christened NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary .
This unregulated clean - energy producer sells power throughout the U.S. , using a diverse set of low - cost generation assets strategically situated around the country to balance the load .
Last year , 38 % of Next - Era 's capacity came from wind power , which has benefited from the recent extension of production tax credits .
Next Era 's net income roughly tripled in 2008 .
The credit crisis and weakening consumer demand have led NextEra to slow the pace of expansion in its wind - power operations , but the company " already controls a fourth of this nation 's installed wind - energy capacity , " notes Morningstar analyst Ryan McLean .
" Nationwide , total capacity is somewhere around 25,000 MW [ megawatts ] , and NextEra has 6,375MW and growing . "
Wind is a relatively low - cost and profitable revenue stream for the company , which expects total profit to grow by double - digits through 2010 .
FPL reported adjusted earnings of $ 3.84 a share last year , of which Next - Era contributed $ 2.04 .
The company could $ 4.07 this year , and $ 4.54 in 2010 .
Although its regulated utility has experienced reduced demand , FPL is better - positioned than most .
Moreover , Florida 's relatively favorable regulatory environment encourages additional investments in capacity that could boost the utility 's earnings .
FPL emits less carbon than most other utilities , and will benefit from a " greenhouse gas - constrained regulatory environment , " says Ken Stern , a San Diego money manager .
But the company stands to profit most from national initiatives to expand wind - energy generation and bolster transmission facilities .
" Transmission development had double - digit growth prospects before the credit crunch , and now , favorable legislation is coming in terms of taxes and the fast - tracking of capex [ capital - spending ] opportunities , " says Van Eck 's Mitby .
Barrons.com penned a positive piece on FPL late last year ( " This Utility Will Inherit the Wind , " Dec. 29 , 2008 ) , when the shares were 49.12 , near the midpoint of their 52 - week range .
FPL recently closed around 46 , and has a 4.14 % dividend yield .
Even a modest improvement in the economy could jolt the stock , lifting it into the mid-50s .
WITH THE LARGEST NETWORK OF landfills in the U.S. , Waste Management is hip - deep in conservation and recycling programs .
The Houston - based company also is a major generator of energy from methane gas , landfill waste and other recoverable waste materials .
As the nation 's largest waste - disposal concern , WMI processes an eye - popping 116 million tons of garbage a year for 20 million municipal , commercial and residential customers .
By its own estimate , only 6 % of that goes into so - called traditional landfills , without making some contribution to green energy .
Almost half of Waste Management 's revenue comes from recycling and various forms of energy recovery from waste , or EfW , while traditional waste - management activities chip in the rest .
Total revenue topped $ 13 billion in 2008 .
Garbage - hauling is n't a glamorous business , but it is essential .
That helps explain why the company 's earnings have held up at a time when corporate profits generally are heading down a slippery slope .
Waste Management earned $ 2.22 a share last year , flat with 2007 results , and could earn $ 2.08 this year .
Its unmatched national network of 277 landfills gives it both pricing power and a moat against competitors , such as the industry 's No. 2 , Republic Services ( RSG ) .
Waste Management generated $ 2.58 billion in cash from operations last year , and has found plentiful uses for its money .
The company recently paid down $ 1.2 billion in debt , and bought back $ 1.4 billion of stock .
It increased the dividend 7.4 % in February , to an annual $ 1.16 a share , and yields 4.3 % .
On the down side , waste volume typically contracts in recessions .
The company 's profitability could suffer , as well , if the price of diesel -- the drink of choice for garbage trucks -- rises , or if smaller competitors start a price war , as sometimes happen in the industry .
But any setback would be an opportunity to buy stock in this century - old workhorse , which now trades around 27 , or for about 13 times prospective earnings .
Morningstar pegs fair value at 33 a share .
At only 80 % of fair value , says analyst Bradley Meeks , Waste Management is still a " good buy . "
The growing use of sustainable energy , mandated in part by the government , could give the company 's earnings , and its shares , a big push .
Utilities and industrial companies long have bought electricity produced by the methane gas released from Waste Management 's landfills .
The company 's waste - to - energy incinerators , strategically placed around the country , burn about a fourth of the 30 million tons of trash incinerated in the U.S. each year .
Each ton of garbage burned replaces about a ton of coal , and reduces carbon emissions significantly .
Waste Management plans to double its overall energy - generation capacity by 2020 , producing enough energy to power two million homes .
In February it was tapped by two Maryland counties to build an EfW plant that could meet those counties ' total electricity and disposal needs .
The project is expected to replace the burning of 130,000 tons of coal , and lower greenhouse - gas emissions by 500,000 tons a year .
EfW is widely practiced in Europe and China , which hopes to produce 30 % of its energy by such means by 2020 , says Meeks .
Waste Management also recycles electronic equipment and medical waste , both growing revenue streams , and acts as a conservation consultant to non-U.S. recyclers .
If there is green in garbage , the company is going to find it -- and convert it to greenbacks for shareholders .
IF AMERICA'S POWER GRID IS TO BECOME bigger and smarter , somebody will have to build it out .
And somebody will have to design the project and monitor the construction .
That is where Jacobs Engineering comes in .
The vertically integrated Pasadena , Calif. , contractor , has all of the engineering , design , architectural and other skills needed to build and manage large infrastructure projects , many that increasingly will have a green component .
Jacobs has additional expertise in managing government projects in the U.S. and overseas -- work that is sometimes more art than science , and which accounts for more than a fourth of revenue , which totaled $ 11 billion last year .
Revenue has increased by an average of 19 % a year in the past decade .
Then there is a history of beating sales and earnings forecasts by at least a few percentage points .
In the quarter ended Dec. 31 , the first of its fiscal year , Jacobs delivered earnings of 94 cents a share , up from the 89 cents analysts expected , on revenue that jumped 31 % .
Management guided full - year earnings downward slightly , to $ 3.55 to $ 3.90 a share , but if past is prologue , the final results might offer a pleasant surprise .
Not surprisingly , Jacobs also has a fortress - like balance sheet , with gobs of cash ( nearly $ 788 million as of Dec. 31 ) and little long - term debt ( $ 40 million ) .
The company has n't used its cash horde to pay a dividend , but may deploy it to pick up faltering rivals in markets it wants to enter , says Morningstar analyst Patricia Oey .
That said , Jacobs operates in a highly competitive market , with many successful companies , including Fluor ( FLR ) , Valmont and MasTec , above and below it on the construction and project - management food chain .
Jacobs ' recent contract wins include a five - year , $ 17.5 million commission to manage three transportation programs in the San Francisco Bay area , and a $ 200 million deal to build and manage a water - reclamation project for Pima County , Ariz .
That is in addition to contracts for work on oil and gas facilities , prisons , petrochemical plants and transportation systems .
About 80 % of its wins are from repeat customers , and 90 % include cost - reimbursement , Oey notes .
Jacobs ' shares hit the skids last year , losing about 60 % of their value ; they now trade around 34 .
Morningstar puts the company 's fair value in the low - 60s , but it may be closer to the mid-40s so long as the economy and financial markets continue to quake .
Stimulus spending on infrastructure projects , transportation systems and facilities designed to use less energy more efficiently likely will help Jacobs maintain its balance , and continue delivering upbeat earnings news .
OUR FIFTH DREAM -TEAM MEMBER , Eaton , makes energy - efficient power - management systems that help reduce fossil - fuel use .
Specifically , Eaton manufactures hydraulic and electric - power control systems used in automotive , industrial and aerospace applications -- and in windmills .
The company recently launched a new venture : hybrid hydraulic / electric alternatives for fleet - vehicle propulsion , including one system built with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
Designs vary , but basically capture energy from braking and other subsystems to augment or replace the traditional diesel engine .
Particularly promising for city buses , delivery trucks and other vehicles that start and stop frequently , the EPA estimates such powertrains could produce fuel savings of 20 % to 40 % , and cut carbon emissions by as much as 40 % .
So far , those vehicles are limited to pilot programs , but the " pilots " include big customers like United Parcel Service , Federal Express and Wal - Mart , as well as school buses used as far away Melbourne , Australia and Guangzhou , China .
Eaton has many competitors , but unlike others that dream of replacing the combustion engine , it has been an automotive - technology leader since 1911 .
With 2008 sales of $ 15.4 billion , the Cleveland - based company has the design , manufacturing and financing in place to scale its ideas .
Its truck group alone sells $ 2.3 billion of transmission and hybrid - power and exhaust systems for trucks , buses and agricultural equipment .
Eaton knows its customers , and the costs and challenges of operating in 150 different countries .
But its strengths also raise concerns .
" I like Eaton , but I 'm worried about its earnings [ expectations ] earnings being overly optimistic due to its heavy exposure to the auto industry , " says Ken Stern , the San Diego investment manager .
Morningstar analyst John Kearney is more upbeat , noting an aggressive acquisition strategy has diversified the company 's revenue and profits .
Draconian cost - cutting measures also have helped .
Eaton earned $ 6.83 a share in 2008 .
This year , management is guiding profit expectations downward to between $ 4.20 and $ 5.20 a share ; the wide range reflects economic uncertainties .
Eaton has paid a dividend for 85 years , and yields 5.41 % .
Its current payout , $ 2 a share , must have been of some comfort to investors , whose shares have lost about half their value in the past year , and now trade around 36 .
At least one savvy holder used the opportunity to snap up more stock : Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKA ) upped its stake in Eaton in the fourth quarter to 3.2 million shares , from 2.9 million .
LIKE BUFFETT , WE DON'T KNOW where Eaton will trade in a month or a year , only that the products , services and ingenuity of Eaton and companies like it are making the world greener and cleaner .
When the smoke -- or is it carbon ? -- clears , they and their shareholders are likely to rewarded .
DO AMERICANS CHERISH FREEDOM ANYMORE ?
By Chuck Baldwin
February 6 , 2009
NewsWithViews.com
I am often guilty of using the term " freedom - loving Americans . "
But I think the question now needs to be asked , Do Americans really cherish freedom anymore ?
I believe an argument could be made that not many do .
In fact , I doubt that most Americans today remotely understand what freedom -- as envisioned by our Founding Fathers - - even is .
Freedom is more than not being in prison ( although America incarcerates more people than any nation on earth ) .
Freedom is more than driving a car , or taking a vacation , or being able to choose your place of residence , or attending a sporting event .
People in totalitarian regimes have , for the most part , been able to do the equivalent of all that .
The freedoms upon which America was founded are outlined in our Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights .
The first principle of freedom is that freedom is a gift of Almighty God .
As God is the Giver of life , He is also the Grantor of liberty .
This was plainly stated by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration : " We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty , and the pursuit of Happiness . . . "
Ask the average American today , Where do our rights come from ?
Most will look at you funny and then blurt out , " From government . "
And , of course , this is evidently the same opinion held by most of today 's politicians .
To them , freedom is whatever civil government says it is .
Yes , I am saying it : most politicians have a God-complex .
And , unfortunately , it seems that most Americans today are willing to go along with this calamitous charade .
Jefferson and the rest of America 's founders , however , rightly understood that the only legitimate purpose of government was " to secure these rights . "
The only legitimate purpose of civil government is to secure or protect the freedoms and liberties that have been given to man by our Creator .
Jefferson went on to say that " whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness . "
In other words , whenever government stops protecting liberty and starts destroying liberty , it is the right and duty of freedom - loving people to reform or replace such illegitimate government with a government that will fulfill its legitimate purpose .
And that is exactly what our forefathers did in the late 1700s .
Sadly , here we are in the twenty - first century , the descendents of some of the wisest and bravest men and women in history , and we do not even seem to know what freedom is , much less have the courage to defend it .
For example , we will work for 30 years or more to purchase our own property .
After having done that , however , the property still does not belong to us .
We are required to pay the State - - for the rest of our lives -- a property tax ( to support concepts and ideas that many of us find reprehensible and detestable , no less ) , or armed agents will confiscate our property and throw us on the street .
Pray tell me , what is the difference between this and the feudal system of old ?
In reality , none of us own any property .
We are all serfs paying the feudal lord .
Beyond that , our feudal masters even dictate to us what we can and cannot do with this property we supposedly own .
We do not even have the right to manage and control our own land .
And yet , we Americans put up with this illegitimacy and still have the audacity to say , " We are free . "
Again , we do n't know the meaning of the word .
Virtually everything we do and say is monitored by the great Nanny State .
Practically every service , every act is regulated by the State .
Ask any independent business owner how many regulations , laws , acts , etc. , demand fulfillment , and how many fees , taxes , permits , etc. , are required by various government agencies and bureaucracies before he can perform a single task .
For example , the federal government actually dictates how some restaurants can seat people or serve tables .
Farmers are told what and how much to plant -- and even to not plant .
We can not buy a gun , drive a car , marry the person we love , or even install a toilet without saying , " Pretty please ? " to a dozen despots .
And we still wave the flag every Independence Day and brag about how " free " we are .
Again , we do n't know the meaning of the word .

And the people who should be more " jealous over " their liberties than anyone -- born - again Christians - - are among the first to gladly relinquish their freedom .
I know of hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of Christian College employees who happily allow the school Gestapo to barge into their homes -- unannounced and uninvited -- to inspect their private reading material , or CD and video collections , and even their wardrobes .
School officials tell them where they must go to church , what attire their wives and children can and cannot wear in public ( off the job ) -- AND IN PRIVATE -- and what amusements they may and may not attend .
I am not making it up .
Adolf Hitler never had the kind of control that some of these Christian Colleges exert over their employees .
And the remarkable thing is , these Christian employees would still assume that they are " free . "
Again , they do not know the meaning of the word .
And one would think that our veterans -- of all people - - would be among the first to jealously guard freedom .
How , then , can former and retired military personnel sit back and allow the government they once proudly served to lie to them , renege on promises , withhold medical care , abandon their friends and family members still missing in action , and not utter a word of protest ?
How can they allow their comrades - in - arms to sleep on the streets outside VA clinics ?
While they were willing to travel halfway around the world -- and risk life and limb -- to defend America against foreign enemies , many will sit back right here at home and complacently watch while these glorified miscreants -- known as politicians -- systematically strip this nation of the very freedoms and liberties they swore to defend .
Did they not take an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies , foreign AND DOMESTIC ?
If the statistics I read are accurate , most veterans do not even vote .
I ask , if we do not know what freedom is at home , how can we fight wars across the world and understand what we are fighting for ?
Obviously , people who are receiving welfare , or other government handouts , seldom complain about there being too much government , because they personally benefit from the growth of the socialist state .
This is also true for many ( but not all , thank God ) government employees , of course .
And please remember that government cannot give a blessed thing without first stealing it from someone else .
Big Government is totally incompatible with freedom .
For that matter , so is Big Business and Big Religion .
In fact , Big Anything is incompatible with freedom .
Even Big Cities .
So , I repeat the question , Do Americans really cherish freedom anymore ?
And , if we do , what are we going to do about it ?
I believe that there are specific and constructive steps that can be taken to restore liberty in this land .
( I will develop these thoughts later . )
I further believe that there are still millions of Americans who really do understand and cherish freedom .
We may be in a minority , but remember , we were also a minority in 1776 .
Freedom is laborious , onerous work .
And not everyone enjoys hard work .
So be it .
Let lazy , indolent fools wallow in their servitude .
God will yet see to it that there is a land of liberty for those who truly desire it and are willing to fight for it .
I firmly believe that .
Remember , liberty is a precious gift from our Creator .
For those who fear God , respect Natural Law , and love liberty , there is yet a " promised land . "
We may have to do a little searching ; we may have to rethink our priorities ; we may have to adjust our lifestyles ; and yes , we may have to " pledge our lives , fortunes , and sacred honor " in order to obtain it ; but our forebears thought it was worth it -- and so do I .
As Friedrich Schiller wrote in William Tell :
" By this fair light which greeteth us , before
Those other nations , that , beneath us far ,
In noisome cities pent , draw painful breath ,
Swear we the oath of our confederacy !
A band of brothers true we swear to be ,
Never to part in danger or in death !
" We swear we will be free as were our sires ,
And sooner die than live in slavery !
" We swear , to put our trust in God Most High ,
And not to quail before the might of man ! "

Dissident republicans , the Continuity IRA , have said they murdered a policeman in Northern Ireland .
He was Constable Stephen Paul Carroll , 48 , a married man with children from the Banbridge area of County Down .
He died just 48 hours after two soldiers were shot dead by the Real IRA at an army base in Antrim .
Monday night 's shooting happened at Lismore Manor , in Craigavon , County Armagh , after a woman called police when her window was broken .
Map : Northern Ireland shootings Constable Carroll was shot through the rear window of his police car when he arrived at the scene at about 2145 GMT on Monday .
Police say they are looking for a man in a light coloured top who was seen running from the area after the shooting .
At least two houses have been searched in the nearby Drumbeg estate .
At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon , Chief Superintendent Alan Todd said the constable had given 23 years of service to the community , working with the police service .
Constable Stephen Paul Carroll , 48 , was from Banbridge " We have this morning , colleagues without a workmate , a wife without a husband , a son without a father and grandchildren without their grandfather , " he said .
" It is a desperate loss ... we are working with people to provide safer communities , my question to the people who perpetrated this is ' What have they got to offer ? ' "
The Continuity IRA is one of a number of dissident republican paramilitary groups opposed to the peace process which have carried out bomb and gun attacks on civilians and the security forces .
There is believed to be cross-over and co-operation between the Continuity IRA and the larger Real IRA , which bombed Omagh in 1998 killing 29 people and injuring hundreds more .
Chief Constable Sir Hugh
Orde called it a " sad day " for Northern Ireland 's force and said the gunmen were " criminal psychopaths " , but said he would not ask for the Army to help patrol NI 's streets .
" I have no intention to ask the Army for routine military support , it 's not necessary and it does n't work , " he said .

Sir Hugh held a joint press conference with the first and deputy first ministers Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness at Stormont .
Mr Robinson said : " This is a battle of wills between the political class and the evil gunmen - the political class will win . "
Mr McGuinness said the dissidents ' actions were futile : " These people are traitors to the island of Ireland , they have betrayed the political desires , hopes and aspirations of all of the people who live on this island . "
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has condemned the murderers and insisted there would be " no return to the old days " in Northern Ireland .
This is the first murder of a police officer in NI since 1998 .
Constable Frank O'Reilly was killed by a loyalist blast bomb during disturbances linked to the Drumcree dispute in 1998 .
The last police officers murdered by republicans , RUC constables Roland John Graham and David Andrew Johnston , were shot dead by the IRA in Lurgan , County Armagh in June 1997 .
Constable Carroll was the first PSNI officer to have been murdered by paramilitaries since the force was formed in 2001 .
Dissident republicans tried to kill two PSNI officers in shootings in Derry and Dungannon in November 2007 .
They have also been linked to a booby trap bomb which exploded under a police officer 's car in Spamount , County Tyrone in May 2008 .
HAVE YOUR SAY
These events show that the peace process is still under threat E Breen , Chelmsford Politicians from all parties condemned Monday 's killing , which Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward insisted would not damage the peace process .
Asked if the killing was linked to the soldiers ' shooting at the weekend , Sir Hugh Orde said : " I think you are giving ( the attackers ) credit they ill deserve .
" I think these are disparate groups , badly infiltrated and indeed many awaiting trial north and south of the border .
The first and deputy first ministers have again postponed an investment visit to the US following the murder .
In the weekend attack , Sappers Mark Quinsey , 23 , from Birmingham and Patrick Azimkar , 21 , from London , were shot dead at Massereene Army base , Antrim .
The soldiers were killed as they accepted a pizza delivery at about 2120 GMT on Saturday .
Four other people , including two pizza delivery men - Anthony Watson , 19 , from Antrim , and a Polish man in his 30s - were injured in the attack .
One of the men is in a critical condition , another is seriously ill .

In our noisy world , we often find ourselves longing for peace and searching to find it somewhere else .
While it 's true that there are places we can visit where we can experience peace , such as sacred sites or buildings , we do not need to wait until we get to one of these places to feel at peace .
Instead , we can learn to locate the seed of peace inside ourselves and cultivate it so that it grows into a reliable source of serenity that we can always access , no matter where we are .
We experience peace when we are in a state of mental calm and serenity .
It might surprise you to notice how infrequently you allow yourself to be free from anxiety .
Realizing this is the first step to inner peace .
If you wait until all the details of your life are taken care of to allow yourself to experience peace , you will never feel peaceful because there is always something that your mind can grab onto to create anxiety .
It is important to consciously set aside your worries and make time to cultivate inner peace .
Ideally , you could schedule time each day to meditate on peace and experience what it feels like to be calm and serene .
It takes practice to learn how to let go of your worries , so give yourself some time .
Inhale deeply , and feel your worries dissolve with every exhale .
Remind yourself that soon enough you will be able to take care of everything you need to , but right now you are taking a break .
As the clutter of your thoughts and concerns clear away , you will start to feel more serene .
Allow yourself to move deeper into this state with each inhale .
Realize that you have the power to free yourself from anxiety simply by deciding to do so .
The more you practice feeling peaceful , the easier it will be for you to feel at peace .
If you ’re new to gardening and not sure where to start , growing herbs is an easy way to get your green thumb going .
There ’s no large plot to prepare or maintain ( which can be daunting for newbies ) and by growing different varieties , you ’ll gain experience working with plants that have different watering and care needs .
Here ’s a project sheet highlighting a few different ways you can grow them with many suitable for your patio or balcony ( and even indoors too ) .
I also added instructions at the bottom of this page for building a clever spiral structure .
Enjoy !
Hanging Coffee Cups :
Make a charming outdoor display and grow your own herbs at the same time !
Use enamel coated metal coffee cups as pots ( drill a hole in the bottom first for drainage ) , paint in cheery colors then hang against an outer wall with twine , metal rings and screws drilled at cascading levels for a lovely display .
Hanging Pockets : Grow plants “ vertical style ” by simply filling each pocket of a shoe organizer with soil and herbs .
This is also a clever way to hang your plants out of reach from inquisitive cats .
Tip :
Test the fabric of the organizer first to see if it will allow water to drain , if not , just make a few small holes in each pocket .
Vertical Gutter :
Here ’s a neat idea for those with limited space , attach plastic gutters to the side of the house ( making sure to first drill small holes at the bottom of the gutters for good drainage ) then fill with soil and plants or seeds .
Tip :
Add time release fertilizer to the soil when planting to help maintain the soil ’s nutrient levels .
Strawberry Jar :
Here ’s an easy way to pack a variety of different herbs into one container while keeping them separated neatly ( they ’ll grow into a nice & decorative display ) .
Tip :
Mix a time - release fertilizer into the soil when planting , one dose can last all summer .
One - Pot Indoor Garden :
Here ’s a way to grow them year round indoors , all you need is a sunny spot , a big pot filled with soil and a few plants .
Also see this page on chow.com for a nice reference that gives some ideas of different herbs you can try growing indoors .
You ’ll find watering , soil and potting tips on the second page .
Tip :
You can move the pot outside during warm summer months , the plants will love it !
Kitchen Container : No garden ?
No problem !
You can grow a variety of kitchen herbs in a large pot or container , just use plant markers to label each and help distinguish which plant is which ( they ’ll eventually grow into one bushy mass of greenery ) .
Tip :
Keep the pot at the back door for easy access to snipping while cooking .
BBQ Container :
Here ’s a neat way to use an old hibachi or portable bbq !
Fill with potting soil , a selection of your favorite plants and voila !
a smart DIY garden .
You do n’t need the lid or grate to make this project and if you do n’t have anything on hand , watch garage sales , craigslist , kijiji , etc. , since you can pick up old barbecues and grills on the cheap .
Also see this page using a hibachi for a similar project .
Tower :
Five terra cotta planters in assorted sizes are cleverly stacked to form three plantable tiers , filled with potting soil and then an assortment of herbs are planted .
Situate this compact garden in a sunny spot near the kitchen door for easy snipping .
Mason Jar Herb Garden : Mason jars are secured to an old wooden board with pipe clamps , triangle ring hangers and hanging wire .
Suitable for indoors .
Space Saving Vertical Garden : Ideal for balconies , plastic pots ( with a lip ) are hung on a square - frame trellis using “ S ” hooks .
Also has instructions for making your own garden markers using wooden paint stirrers ( spray paint and label with a marker ) .
Tiered Wooden Planter :
You ’ll need some woodworking experience but it ’s a relatively simple project .
Built with weather - resistant cedar , herbs are grown on the top level so they ’re easy to tend to and pick .
Spiral Project
This is a clever trick to grow several varieties of herbs , each with different environmental needs ( full sun , moist , dry , shade , etc. ) , in a minimal amount of space .
It ’s also a clever way to conserve water since each watering flows from the top down to the plants at the bottom , water reaching each of them effortlessy .
Here is a collection of resources that provide information on what they are and how to build one .
The first is from Welcome To Voluntary Simplicity :
Many people seem to be interested in herb spirals , and rightly so if done properly they need little maintenance and can keep you in herbs all year round .
For me they encompass all manner of permaculture principles from how close to house you can get it to including a a small pond so frogs can do some of the slug hunting for you .
Basically the idea behind them is to get as many different herbs as possible in a confined area .
The spiral and the subsequent height differences mean that you create a number of different environmental conditions which normally would not be possible in a small space .
The small area also means that they are ideal for a small garden and harvesting and watering is easy .
The next resource is this video :
Summary :
You can increase the planting space of a circle about 2 meters in diameter by raising the soil into a spiral which will give you about 9 meters of planting space .
Keep size in mind when designing , everything should be easily reachable by hand .
To start , take a rock and place it at arm ’s length to the center , then build around .
If you build the formation with rocks then fill with dirt , the plants wo n’t get the nutrition that they need .
Instead , do a sheet mulch which will provide nutrients and create soil that will break down over time .
The spirals provide different microclimates and soil types for different types of plants .
Top center will be a warm , dry and sunny area that is well drained .
The bottom will be cool , wet and shady .
Choose plants that are well suited to each part of the structure .
The final resource is another video :
Summary :
As the foundation , lay cardboard over compostable items ( peels , veggies , etc. ) .
The cardboard will break down eventually and the veggies left will have broken down and then add more nutrients to the soil inside the structure .
The cardboard also helps prevent grass from growing underneath and from across the yard .
Sketch out the design on the cardboard then start laying the bricks over the pattern .
Do as much building as possible in the center as the center can be up to 4 ft high .
Use straw to fill up the spiral then water well .
The mulch will break down over time as well as do a good job of holding moisture .
For each spot that will hold a plant , make a hole in the mulch and put one or two handfuls of soil in there .
Plant then water .
Very interesting stuff !
You do n’t need to build a huge one either , you can start with something small - ish near the kitchen door and just grow a handful of your favorite and most - used cooking herbs .
You can also build them and fill with flowers or do a mixture of both .
The US has deported to Austria a former Nazi death camp guard , Josias Kumpf .
The move sheds light on the continuing search - in some countries , at least - for World War II war criminals .
Mario Cacciottolo examines a hunt now entering its final phase .
Efforts to bring war criminals to justice faltered as the Cold War set in " Looking for Nazi war criminals is the ultimate law enforcement race against the clock . "
Eli Rosenbaum , director of the Office of Special Investigations ( OSI ) in the United States , has a list of thousands of suspects .
But working out whether any of them are alive and in the US is a laborious job .
A full check could take 100 years at current rates , he says - but in 10 years " the World War II biological clock will come to an end " .
Contrary to popular belief , most former Nazis did not go into hiding after the war .
Most did not even change their name .
There were some - such as Adolf Eichmann , who planned the transport of Jews to death camps , and Dr Joseph Mengele , Auschwitz 's " Angel of Death " - who slipped away amid the post - war chaos and assumed false identities .
But the majority simply took off their uniforms , went home , and got a job .
And for a crucial period in the 1950s , little was done to track them down , experts say .
Justice ' not done ' " More could have been done , but there was a lack of political will .
Not from 1945 to 1948 , but after that , " says Jean - Marc Dreyfus , lecturer in Holocaust studies at the University of Manchester .
" Around 1953 the Nazi trials stopped , and it's important to note that the Cold War was the reason why .
The Allies even dealt with the same army generals that Hitler did
Jean - Marc Dreyfus , Holocaust Studies lecturer " The West needed a strong West Germany and did not want to spend time hunting for Nazis , many of which were now part of the society and even the Federal Republic government .
" Removing those individuals would have weakened the nation , and for the West it was more important by then to have a strong West German position against Russia .
" There were doctors , engineers , the army , who were all involved in Nazism and who were left to carry on after the war ended .
The Allies even dealt with the same army generals that Hitler did . "
In the 1950s and 1960s , the German judge and prosecutor Fritz Bauer estimated there were 100,000 Germans who were responsible in one way or another for mass killings of Jews .
Other estimates suggested as many as 300,000 .
Bauer also said less than 5,000 people had been prosecuted , which amounts to a " tear drop in the ocean " according to Dr Dreyfus .
" Based on these estimates , justice has not been done . "
Turning point
But in the 1970s there was a shift in Holocaust consciousness , a demand from the public to know more about it .
As the second generation began to question what their parents did in the war , and historians began to ask questions about governments and their policies toward Jews , so too did interest in war crimes increase .
The Adolf Eichmann trial may have helped revive interest in Nazi- hunting " The turning point was around 1976 to 1978 , and with this increase in consciousness , it was then considered that the Nazis should be hunted once again .
" Before then , there was n't the kind of interest that there is today , " Dr Dreyfus says .
Professor David Cesarani , author of Justice Delayed , a book that explains how the UK came to grant citizenship to numerous Nazi collaborators from Eastern Europe in the post - war years , says both Britain and the US knowingly recruited war criminals to fight the Cold War .
Recently declassified US documents show US intelligence often hunted Nazi war criminals in order to use them , rather than to bring them to justice , he says .
" It had far more information than it disclosed to investigators or prosecutors .
As a result , key Nazi personnel involved in genocide and atrocities went free for decades - if they were ever caught , " he told the BBC .
He agrees that enthusiasm for Nazi- hunting picked up in the 1970s , attributing this partly to the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1960 - 61 and a renewed interest in the Holocaust among academics and writers that the trial helped to generate .
Simon Wiesenthal
During the years that Western countries did little to identify former Nazi war criminals in their midst , however , private investigators fought a tireless battle .
NAZI WAR CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS 2001-2008 United States : 37 Italy : 26 Canada : 6 Germany : 3 Lithuania : 2 Poland : 1 France : 1 Source : Simon Wiesenthal Center ( figures include denaturalisations , deportations and extraditions ) Simon Wiesenthal , who founded the Jewish Historical Documentation Centre in Austria in 1947 , and contributed to the capture of Eichmann , also helped track down Franz Murer " the Butcher of Vilnius " ; Erich Rajakowitsch , responsible for transporting Dutch Jews to the death camps ; Franz Stangl , the commandant of the Treblinka and Sobibor death camps ; Karl Silberbauer , the gestapo officer who arrested Anne Frank , and many others .
A generation younger , Serge and Beate Klarsfeld pursued Nazis and collaborators who had played leading roles in occupied France .
They also carried out daring stunts to open West German eyes to the war criminals living in respectable society , and sometimes in positions of power .
A centre named in honour of Simon Wiesenthal continues today to search for surviving Nazis and monitor the performance of national governments .
Its last annual report in April 2008 noted that there were 608 investigations under way across the world , and that 76 convictions had been achieved in the preceding seven years .
It gave the USA an A grade for its efforts to bring Nazis to trial , an accolade that no other country has achieved .
The UK , which received a C as recently as 2001 - for " minimal success that could have been greater " - had dropped to the X category , indicating that it " failed to take any action whatsoever to investigate suspected Nazi war criminals " .
' Most wanted '
The work carried out in America by the OSI involves a team of historians examining archives that contain 70,000 names - including 40,000 " senior core SS officers " - and then matching them against lists of US residents .
Once a match is found , an investigation can begin .
The result , if a war criminal is successfully prosecuted , is denaturalisation and deportation or extradition .
At 83 , Josias Kumpf is younger than anyone on the SWC 's most - wanted list
The first to be extradited from the US , in 1973 - thanks largely to Simon Wiesenthal - was Hermine Brauensteiner - Ryan , who was accused among other things of whipping and stamping women to death at the Majdanek camp .
The most recent to be deported , last Thursday , was 83 - year - old Josias Kumpf , alleged to have taken part in the extermination of 8,000 Jews in one day at the Trawniki camp in Nazi- occupied Poland .
" The removal of Josias Kumpf to Austria has achieved a significant measure of justice on behalf of the victims of Nazi inhumanity and it reflects the unswerving commitment of the US government to continuing that quest for justice , " Eli Rosenbaum said in a statement .
The 83 - year - old was freed by the Austrians because the country 's statute of limitations made prosecution impossible .
Even at his advanced age , Josias Kumpf is younger than any of the men the Simon Wiesenthal Center ( SWC ) has on its " most wanted list " .
The oldest , Alois Brunner , is coming up to his 97th birthday , if he is still alive - a possibility the SWC itself admits is " slim " .
The SWC is not yet convinced about recent reports that Aribert Heim died in Egypt in 1992 .
If he is alive , he is 94 .
The youngest on the list , Mikhail Gorshkow , is thought to be 85 .
Those whose whereabouts are known are mostly involved in lengthy legal battles to avoid prosecution or extradition , with time heavily on their side .
For example , 87 - year - old Heinrich Boere , accused of murdering three Dutch resistance fighters , has been ruled too old and too ill to stand trial in Germany .
The prospect of any of these suspects being convicted and sentenced is , while not impossible , growing ever more slim .

Not to be confused with Wakeboarding
Torture method simulating drowning
Waterboarding is a form of torture in which water is poured over a cloth covering the face and breathing passages of an immobilized captive , causing the person to experience drowning .
In the most common method of waterboarding , the captive 's face is covered with cloth or some other thin material and immobilized on his / her back at an incline of 10 to 20 degrees . [ 1] [ 2 ]
Torturers pour water onto the face over the breathing passages , causing an almost immediate gag reflex and creating a drowning sensation for the captive . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
Normally , water is poured intermittently to prevent death .
However , if the water is poured uninterruptedly it will lead to death by asphyxia , also called dry drowning .
Waterboarding can cause extreme pain , damage to lungs , brain damage from oxygen deprivation , other physical injuries including broken bones due to struggling against restraints , and lasting psychological damage . [ 6 ]
Adverse physical effects can last for months , and psychological effects for years .
[ 7 ]
The term " water board torture " appeared in press reports as early as 1976 . [ 8 ]
Waterboarding has been used in diverse places and at various points in history , including the Spanish and Flemish Inquisitions , by the United States military during the Philippine - American War , by U.S. law enforcement , by Japanese and German officials during World War II , by the French in the Algerian War , by the U.S. during the Vietnam War ( despite a ban on the practice by U.S. generals ) , by the Pinochet regime in Chile , by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia , by the British Army in Northern Ireland , and by South African police during the apartheid era .
While there is international debate over whether waterboarding constitutes torture , many 21st century authorities assert that it is .
Waterboard on display at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum : prisoners ' feet were shackled to the bar on the right , wrists restrained by shackles on the left .
Water was poured over the face using the watering can .
The use of this type of waterboard is depicted in a painting by former Tuol Sleng prisoner Vann Nath , shown in that article .
The use of waterboarding became a matter of public controversy in the United States during the War on Terror in the 2000s .
In December 2005 , the United States passed the Detainee Treatment Act , which banned U.S. military from using torture ( including waterboarding ) ; the bill was signed into law by President George W. Bush . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
However , the law did not affect the CIA 's use of waterboarding . [ 10 ]
In late 2007 , it was widely reported that the United States Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) had waterboarded extrajudicial prisoners and that the Office of Legal Counsel , Department of Justice , had authorized the procedure ( among other enhanced interrogation techniques ) . [ 12 ]
In 2008 , the CIA confirmed having waterboarded three Al - Qaeda suspects : Abu Zubaydah , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri , in 2002 and 2003 . [ 13 ] [ 14 ]
When Congress passed a bill restricting the use of waterboarding by the CIA in 2008 , President Bush vetoed it .
In January 2009 , U.S. President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13491 , which banned the use of waterboarding and other forms of torture in interrogations of detainees by any government agency .
Etymology
While the technique has been used in various forms for centuries , [ 15 ] the term water board was recorded first in a 1976 UPI report : " A Navy spokesman admitted use of the ' water board ' torture ... to ' convince each trainee that he wo n't be able to physically resist what an enemy would do to him . ' "
The verb - noun waterboarding dates from 2004 .
[ 8 ]
First appearance of the term in the mass media was in a New York Times article on 13 May 2004 :
In the case of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , a high - level detainee who is believed to have helped plan the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , C.I.A. interrogators used graduated levels of force , including a technique known as ' water boarding ' , in which a prisoner is strapped down , forcibly pushed under water and made to believe he might drown . [ 8 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]
U.S. attorney Alan Dershowitz is reported to have shortened the term to a single word in a Boston Globe article two days later : " After all , the administration did approve rough interrogation methods for some high valued detainees .
These included waterboarding , in which a detainee is pushed under water and made to believe he will drown unless he provides information , as well as sensory deprivation , painful stress positions , and simulated dog attacks " .
[ 18 ]
Dershowitz later told the New York Times columnist William Safire that , " when I first used the word , nobody knew what it meant . " [
8 ]
Techniques using forcible drowning to extract information had hitherto been referred to as " water torture " , " water treatment " , " water cure " or simply " torture " . [ 8 ] [ 17 ]
Professor Darius Rejali of Reed College , author of Torture and Democracy ( 2007 ) , speculates that the term waterboarding probably has its origin in the need for a euphemism .
There is a special vocabulary for torture .
When people use tortures that are old , they rename them and alter them a wee bit .
They invent slightly new words to mask the similarities .
This creates an inside club , especially important in work where secrecy matters .
Waterboarding is clearly a jailhouse joke .
It refers to surfboarding " – a word found as early as 1929 – " they are attaching somebody to a board and helping them surf .
Torturers create names that are funny to them . " [ 8 ]
Webster 's Dictionary first included the term in 2009 : " [ A ] n interrogation technique in which water is forced into a detainee 's mouth and nose so as to induce the sensation of drowning . " [ 19 ]
Technique
Waterboarding was characterized in 2005 by former CIA director Porter J. Goss as a " professional interrogation technique " . [ 20 ]
According to press accounts , a cloth or plastic wrap is placed over or in the person 's mouth , and water is poured onto the person 's head .
Press accounts differ on the details of this technique – one article describes " dripping water into a wet cloth over a suspect 's face " , [ 21 ] while another states that " cellophane is wrapped over the prisoner 's face and water is poured over him " . [ 5 ]
The United States ' Office of Legal Counsel in August 2002 responded to the request by the CIA for a legal opinion regarding the use of certain interrogation techniques .
It included the following account of the CIA 's definition of waterboarding in a Top Secret 2002 memorandum as follows :
In this procedure , the individual is bound securely to an inclined bench , which is approximately four feet by seven feet .
The individual 's feet are generally elevated .
A cloth is placed over the forehead and eyes .
Water is then applied to the cloth in a controlled manner .
As this is done , the cloth is lowered until it covers both the nose and mouth .
Once the cloth is saturated and completely covers the mouth and nose , air flow is slightly restricted for 20 to 40 seconds due to the presence of the cloth ...
During those 20 to 40 seconds , water is continuously applied from a height of twelve to twenty - four inches .
After this period , the cloth is lifted , and the individual is allowed to breathe unimpeded for three or four full breaths ...
The procedure may then be repeated .
The water is usually applied from a canteen cup or small watering can with a spout ...
You have ... informed us that it is likely that this procedure would not last more than twenty minutes in any one application . [ 22 ]
Historically in the West , the technique is known to have been used in the Spanish Inquisition .
The suffocation of bound prisoners with water has been favored because , unlike most other torture techniques , it produces no marks on the body .
[ 23 ] CIA officers who have subjected themselves to the technique have lasted an average of 14 seconds before capitulating .
[ 5 ]
According to at least one former CIA official , information retrieved from the waterboarding may not be reliable because a person under such duress may admit to anything , as harsh interrogation techniques lead to false confessions .
" The person believes they are being killed , and as such , it really amounts to a mock execution , which is illegal under international law " , says John Sifton of Human Rights Watch .
[ 5 ]
It is " bad interrogation .
I mean you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture 's bad enough " , said former CIA officer Bob Baer . [ 5 ]
There was considerable dissension within the Bush administration over the use of these techniques ; both military investigators and the FBI opposed them .[ citation needed ]
Reported demonstrations
Demonstration of waterboarding at a street protest during a visit by Condoleezza Rice to Iceland , May 2008
In 2006 and 2007 , Fox News and Current TV , respectively , demonstrated a waterboarding technique . [ 24 ] [ 25 ]
In the videos , each correspondent is held against a board by the " interrogators " .
Christopher Hitchens voluntarily subjected himself to a filmed demonstration of waterboarding in 2008 , an experience which he recounted in Vanity Fair . [ 26 ]
He was bound on a horizontal board with a black mask over his face .
A group of men said to be highly trained in this tactic , who demanded anonymity , carried out the torture .
Hitchens was strapped to the board at the chest and feet , face up , and unable to move .
Metal objects were placed in each of his hands , which he could drop if feeling " unbearable stress " .
The interrogator placed a towel over Hitchens ' face , and poured water on it .
After 16 seconds ,
Hitchens threw the metal objects to the floor and the torturers pulled the mask from his face , allowing him to breathe . [ 27 ]
In his article on the topic , he stated " Well , then , if waterboarding does not constitute torture , then there is no such thing as torture . " [ 26 ]
In 2016 , conservative commentator Steven Crowder demonstrated waterboarding on his YouTube channel . [ 28 ]
Mental and physical effects
Allen Keller , the director of the Bellevue Hospital / New York University Program for Survivors of Torture , has treated " a number of people " who had been subjected to forms of near - asphyxiation , including waterboarding .
In an interview for The New Yorker , he argued that " it was indeed torture .
' Some victims were still traumatized years later ' , he said .
One patient could n't take showers , and panicked when it rained .
' The fear of being killed is a terrifying experience ' , he said " . [ 7 ]
Keller also gave a full description in 2007 in testimony before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the practice : [ 29 ]
The CIA 's Office of Medical Services noted in a 2003 memo that " for reasons of physical fatigue or psychological resignation , the subject may simply give up , allowing excessive filling of the airways and loss of consciousness " . [ 30 ]
In an open letter in 2007 to U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , Human Rights Watch asserted that waterboarding can cause the sort of " severe pain " prohibited by 18 U.S.C. § 2340 ( the implementation in the United States of the United Nations Convention Against Torture ) , that the psychological effects can last long after waterboarding ends ( another of the criteria under 18 USC 2340 ) , and that uninterrupted waterboarding can ultimately cause death . [ 6 ]
Classification as torture
Waterboarding is considered to be torture by a wide range of authorities , including legal experts , [ 6 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] politicians , war veterans , [ 33 ] [ 34 ] intelligence officials , [ 35 ] [ 36 ] military judges , [ 37 ] and human rights organizations . [ 20 ] [ 38 ]
David Miliband , then United Kingdom Foreign Secretary , described it as torture on 19 July 2008 , and stated " the UK unreservedly condemns the use of torture " . [ 39 ]
Arguments have been put forward in the United States that it might not be torture in all cases , or that it is unclear . [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ]
The U.S. State Department has recognized " submersion of the head in water " as torture in other circumstances , for example , in its 2005 Country Report on Tunisia . [ 44 ]
The United Nations ' Report of the Committee Against Torture : Thirty - fifth Session of November 2006 , stated that state parties should rescind any interrogation techniques , such as waterboarding , that constitutes torture or cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment or punishment . [ 45 ]
Classification in the U.S .
Whether waterboarding should be classified as a method of torture was not widely debated in the United States before it was alleged , in 2004 , that members of the CIA had used the technique against certain suspected detained terrorists . [ 46 ] [ 47 ]
Subsequently , the U.S. government released the Bybee memo , a memorandum dated August 1 , 2002 , from Jay Bybee at the Office of Legal Counsel for White House Counsel Albert Gonzales .
The OLC memo concluded that waterboarding did not constitute torture and could be used to interrogate subject ;
Bybee reasoned that " in order for pain or suffering to rise to the level of torture , the statute requires that it be severe " and that waterboarding did not cause severe pain or suffering either physically or mentally . [ 22 ]
A separate memo in July 2002 , written by the Defense Department 's Joint Personnel Recovery Agency , described the use of waterboarding and other techniques of extreme duress as " torture " and said that the its use could yield unreliable information , and warned that " The unintended consequence of a U.S. policy that provides for the torture of prisoners is that it could be used by our adversaries as justification for the torture of captured U.S. personnel . " [ 48 ]
This memo was forwarded to the Defense Department Office of the General Counsel , and then to the CIA 's acting general counsel and Justice Department , even as the George W. Bush administration authorized waterboarding and other measures . [ 48 ]
For over three years during the George W. Bush administration , the Justice Department 's Office of Professional Responsibility conducted an investigation into the propriety of the Bybee memo and other memos by the Justice Department on waterboarding and other " enhanced " interrogation techniques . [ 49 ]
The OPR report findings were that former Deputy AAG John Yoo committed intentional professional misconduct and that former AAG Jay Bybee committed professional misconduct .
These findings were dismissed in a memo from Associate Deputy Attorney General David Margolis who found that Yoo showed " poor judgment " but did not violate ethical standards . [ 50 ] [ 51 ]
Commentators have noted that the memos omitted key relevant precedents , including a Texas precedent under then - Governor George W. Bush when the state convicted and sentenced to prison for 10 years a county sheriff for waterboarding a criminal suspect . [ 52 ]
Bush did not issue a pardon for the sheriff . [ 52 ]
Former George W. Bush administration officials Dick Cheney [ 53 ] [ 54 ] and John Ashcroft [ 55 ] have stated since leaving office that they do not consider waterboarding to be torture .
At least one Republican member of the U.S. Congress , Ted Poe , [ 40 ] has taken a similar position .
Other Republican officials have provided less definitive views regarding whether waterboarding is torture .
Andrew C. McCarthy , a former Republican prosecutor including in the George W. Bush administration , has stated that when used in " some number of instances that were not prolonged or extensive " , waterboarding should not qualify as torture under the law . [ 56 ]
McCarthy has also stated that " waterboarding is close enough to torture that reasonable minds can differ on whether it is torture " and that " [t ] here should n't be much debate that subjecting someone to [ waterboarding ] repeatedly would cause the type of mental anguish required for torture " . [ 56 ]
Many former senior George W. Bush administration officials , on the other hand , have seriously questioned or directly challenged the legality of waterboarding .
These include former State Department Counselor Philip Zelikow , [ 57 ] [ 58 ] former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage , [ 59 ] former Homeland Security Chief Tom Ridge , [ 60 ] former head of the Office of Legal Counsel Jack Goldsmith , [ 61 ] General Ricardo Sanchez , [ 62 ] FBI Director Robert Mueller , [ 63 ] and former Convening Authority for the Guantanamo military commissions Susan J. Crawford . [ 64 ]
During his tenure as head of the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel in 2003 –2004 , Jack Goldsmith put a halt to the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique because of serious concern over its legality , but Goldsmith 's order was quickly reversed by others within the George W. Bush administration . [ 61 ] [ 65 ]
A Republican 2008 candidate for president , Senator John McCain who himself was tortured during his ​5 1 ⁄ 2 years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam during the Vietnam War , has stated unequivocally several times that he considers waterboarding to be torture : [ 66 ]
waterboarding , ... is a mock execution and thus an exquisite form of torture .
As such , they are prohibited by American laws and values , and I oppose them . [ 67 ]
Professors such as Wilson R. Huhn have also challenged the legality of waterboarding . [ 68 ]
In May 2008 , author and journalist Christopher Hitchens voluntarily underwent waterboarding and concluded that it was torture . [ 69 ] [ 26 ] [ 70 ]
He also noted that he suffered ongoing psychological effects from the ordeal . [ 70 ]
On 22 May 2009 , radio talk show host Erich " Mancow " Muller subjected himself to waterboarding to prove that it is not torture , but changed his mind because of the experience . [ 71 ]
Sean Hannity , another commentator who claims that waterboarding is not torture and has described those who oppose waterboarding as " moral fools " , had declared on 22 April 2009 that he would similarly subject himself to waterboarding to prove that it is not torture . [ 72 ] [ 73 ]
In an 11 May 2009 interview with Larry King , former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura stated :
[ Waterboarding is ] drowning .
It gives you the complete sensation that you are drowning .
It is no good , because you — I 'll put it to you this way , you give me a water board , Dick Cheney and one hour , and I 'll have him confess to the Sharon Tate murders .
...
If it 's done wrong , you certainly could drown .
You could swallow your tongue .
[ It ] could do a whole bunch of stuff to you .
If it 's done wrong or — it 's torture , Larry .
It 's torture . [ 74 ]
On 15 January 2009 , U.S. President - elect Barack Obama 's nominee for Attorney General , Eric Holder , told his Senate confirmation hearing that waterboarding is torture and the President cannot authorize it . [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ]
In a press conference on 30 April , President Obama also stated , " I believe waterboarding was torture , and it was a mistake . " [ 79 ]
Description by U.S. media
In covering the debate on the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique by the U.S. government , U.S. reporters had to decide whether to use the term " torture " or " enhanced interrogation techniques " to describe waterboarding .
National Public Radio's ombudsman detailed this debate and why NPR had decided to refrain from using the word torture to describe waterboarding . [ 80 ]
Due to criticism of the policy by the media [ 81 ] and to NPR directly , a second piece was written to further explain their position and a desire to describe the technique rather than simply describe it as torture . [ 82 ]
Examining the four newspapers with the highest daily circulation in the country ( The New York Times , The Los Angeles Times , The Wall Street Journal and USA Today ) a student group of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press , Politics and Public Policy found that newspapers " almost uniformly " characterized waterboarding as torture from the 1930s until the September 11 attacks , at which point a " significant and sudden shift " occurred .
Between 2002 –2008 , newspapers only seldom referred to waterboarding as torture . [ 83 ]
The group also noted the newspapers described waterboarding as torture far more frequently when it was performed by countries other than the United States . [ 83 ]
Historical uses
Praxis Rerum Criminalium , Antwerp , 1556 .
The Water Torture — Facsimile of a woodcut in J. Damhoudère 's , Antwerp , 1556 .
Spanish Inquisition
A form of torture similar to waterboarding is called toca , and more recently " Spanish water torture " , to differentiate it from the better known Chinese water torture , along with garrucha ( or strappado ) and the most frequently used potro ( or the rack ) .
This was used infrequently during the trial portion of the Spanish Inquisition process .
" The toca , also called tortura del agua , consisted of introducing a cloth into the mouth of the victim , and forcing them to ingest water spilled from a jar so that they had the impression of drowning " . [ 84 ]
William Schweiker claims that the use of water as a form of torture also had profound religious significance to the Inquisitors . [ 85 ]
In general , waterboarding seemed to be very extended in the Spanish detention centers in the 1500s .
Books from the time explain how to treat persons in custody , and used this " light " form of torture .
After a specific way of beating , body , legs and arms , it was detailed how to pour 4 cuartillos ( approx . 2.5 liters ) of water over mouth and nose , with a covering cloth , making sure there was some cloth introduced in the mouth so water could also get in . [ 86 ]
Flemish Inquisition
In Joos de Damhouder 's Praxis rerum criminalium ( 1554 ) , a manual on the practice of criminal law , the chapter on torture and interrogation is illustrated with a woodcut of waterboarding , which it describes in detail . [ 87 ] [ 88 ]
The Martyr 's Mirror depicts one incident of waterboarding used against the early Mennonites thus : [ 89 ]
And as they did still not obtain anything from me , to the implication of my neighbor , Master Hans took water ( during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face ) , and holding my nose shut with one hand , began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast , and into my mouth ; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty .
I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints .
And when I was at the end of my breath , and wanted to fetch such , I drew the water all into my body , whereupon I suffered such distress , that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it ; but the Lord be forever praised :
He kept my lips .
And when they could still not obtain anything from me , they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place , and wound it much tighter than before , so that I thought he would kill me , and began to shake and tremble greatly .
He then proceeded to pour water into me again , so that I think he emptied four such cans , and my body became so full of it , that twice it came out again at the throat .
And thus I became so weak .
that I fainted ; for , when I recovered from my swoon , I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser .
And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords , that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me .
But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time ; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it , my members became as dead .
Eternal praise , thanks , honor , and glory be to the Lord ; for when it was over I thought that , by the help of the Lord , I had fought a good fight .
Colonial times
Torture of the English by the Dutch according to the English account
Agents of the Dutch East India Company used a precursor to waterboarding during the Amboyna massacre of English prisoners , which took place on the island of Amboyna in the Molucca Islands in 1623 .
At that time , it consisted of wrapping cloth around the victim 's head , after which the torturers " poured the water softly upon his head until the cloth was full , up to the mouth and nostrils , and somewhat higher , so that he could not draw breath but he must suck in all the water " .
[ 90 ] [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ]
In one case , the torturer applied water three or four times successively until the victim's " body was swollen twice or thrice as big as before , his cheeks like great bladders , and his eyes staring and strutting out beyond his forehead " .

An editorial in The New York Times of 6 April 1852 , and a subsequent 21 April 1852 letter to the editors documents an incidence of waterboarding , then called " showering " or " hydropathic torture " , in New York 's Sing Sing prison of an inmate named Henry Hagan , who , after several other forms of beating and mistreatment , had his head shaved , and " certainly three , and possibly a dozen , barrels of water were poured upon his naked scalp " .
Hagan was then placed in a yoke . [ 96 ]
A correspondent listed only as " H " later wrote : " Perhaps it would be well to state more fully the true character of this ' hydropathic torture . '
The stream of water is about one inch in diameter , and falls from a hight [ sic ] of seven or eight feet .
The head of the patient is retained in its place by means of a board clasping the neck ; the effect of which is , that the water , striking upon the board , rebounds into the mouth and nostrils of the victim , almost producing strangulation .
Congestion , sometimes of the heart or lungs , sometimes of the brain , not unfrequently [ sic ] ensues ; and death , in due season , has released some sufferers from the further ordeal of the water cure .
As the water is administered officially , I suppose that it is not murder ! "
H. then went on to cite an 1847 New York law which limited prison discipline to individual confinement " upon a short allowance . " [ 97 ]
Prisoners in late 19th - century Alabama , and in Mississippi in the first third of the 20th century , also suffered waterboarding .
In Alabama , in lieu of or in addition to other physical punishment , a " prisoner was strapped down on his back ; then ' water [ was ] poured in his face on the upper lip , and effectually stop [ ped ] his breathing as long as there [ was ] a constant stream ' . " [ 98 ]
In Mississippi , the accused was held down , and water was poured " from a dipper into the nose so as to strangle him , thus causing pain and horror , for the purpose of forcing a confession . " [ 99 ]
During the Philippine–American War
1902 Life magazine cover , depicting water curing by U.S. troops in the Philippines
The U.S. army used waterboarding , called the " water cure " , during the Philippine–American War.[ citation needed ]
It is not clear where this practice came from ; it probably was adopted from the Filipinos , who themselves adopted it from the Spanish . [ 100 ] Reports of " cruelties " from soldiers stationed in the Philippines led to Senate hearings on U.S. activity there .
Testimony described the waterboarding of Tobeniano Ealdama " while supervised by ... Captain / Major Edwin F. Glenn ( Glenn Highway ) " .
[ 101 ]
Elihu Root , United States Secretary of War , ordered a court martial for Glenn in April 1902 . " [ 102 ]
During the trial , Glenn " maintained that the torture of Ealdama was ' a legitimate exercise of force under the laws of war . ' " [ 101 ]
Though some reports seem to confuse Ealdama with Glenn , [ 103 ]
Glenn was found guilty and " sentenced to a one - month suspension and a fifty - dollar fine " , the leniency of the sentence due to the " circumstances " presented at the trial .
[ 101 ]
President Theodore Roosevelt privately rationalized the instances of " mild torture , the water cure " but publicly called for efforts to " prevent the occurrence of all such acts in the future " .
In that effort , he ordered the court - martial of General Jacob H. Smith on the island of Samar , " where some of the worst abuses had occurred " .
When the court - martial found only that he had acted with excessive zeal , Roosevelt disregarded the verdict and had the General dismissed from the Army . [ 104 ]
Roosevelt soon declared victory in the Philippines , and the public lost interest in " what had , only months earlier , been alarming revelations " .
[ 101 ]
By U.S. police before the 1940s
The use of " third degree interrogation " techniques to compel confession , ranging from " psychological duress such as prolonged confinement to extreme violence and torture " , was widespread in early American policing .
Lassiter classified the water cure as " orchestrated physical abuse " , [ 105 ] and described the police technique as a " modern day variation of the method of water torture that was popular during the Middle Ages " .
The technique employed by the police involved either holding the head in water until almost drowning , or laying on the back and forcing water into the mouth or nostrils .
[ 105 ]
Such techniques were classified as " ' covert ' third degree torture " since they left no signs of physical abuse , and became popular after 1910 when the direct application of physical violence to force a confession became a media issue and some courts began to deny obviously compelled confessions .
[ 106 ]
The publication of this information in 1931 as part of the Wickersham Commission 's " Report on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement " led to a decline in the use of third degree police interrogation techniques in the 1930s and 1940s . [ 106 ]
World War II
During World War II , both Japanese military personnel , especially the Kempeitai , and the officers of the Gestapo , [ 107 ] the German secret police , used waterboarding as a method of torture .
[ 108 ]
During the Japanese occupation of Singapore , the Double Tenth Incident occurred .
This included waterboarding , by the method of binding or holding down the victim on his back , placing a cloth over his mouth and nose , and pouring water onto the cloth .
In this version , interrogation continued during the torture , with the interrogators beating the victim if he did not reply and the victim swallowing water if he opened his mouth to answer or breathe .
When the victim could ingest no more water , the interrogators would beat or jump on his distended stomach . [ 109 ] [ 110 ] [ 111 ]
Chase J. Nielsen , one of the U.S. airmen who flew in the Doolittle raid following the attack on Pearl Harbor , was subjected to waterboarding by his Japanese captors . [ 112 ]
At their trial for war crimes following the war , he testified " Well , I was put on my back on the floor with my arms and legs stretched out , one guard holding each limb .
The towel was wrapped around my face and put across my face and water poured on .
They poured water on this towel until I was almost unconscious from strangulation , then they would let up until I 'd get my breath , then they 'd start over again ...
I felt more or less like I was drowning , just gasping between life and death . " [ 32 ]
In 2007 , Senator John McCain claimed that the United States military hanged Japanese soldiers for waterboarding American prisoners of war during World War II . [ 113 ] [ 114 ]
A minimal sentence for Japanese soldiers convicted of waterboarding American soldiers was 15 years . [ 115 ]
By the French in the Algerian War
The technique was also used during the Algerian War ( 1954 –1962 ) .
French journalist Henri Alleg , who was subjected to waterboarding by French paratroopers in Algeria in 1957 , [ 116 ] is one of only a few people to have described in writing the first - hand experience of being waterboarded .
His book La Question , published in 1958 with a preface by Jean - Paul Sartre subsequently banned in France until the end of the Algerian War in 1962 , [ 117 ] discusses the experience of being strapped to a plank , having his head wrapped in cloth and positioned beneath a running tap :
The rag was soaked rapidly .
Water flowed everywhere : in my mouth , in my nose , all over my face .
But for a while I could still breathe in some small gulps of air .
I tried , by contracting my throat , to take in as little water as possible and to resist suffocation by keeping air in my lungs for as long as I could .
But I could n't hold on for more than a few moments .
I had the impression of drowning , and a terrible agony , that of death itself , took possession of me .
In spite of myself , all the muscles of my body struggled uselessly to save me from suffocation .
In spite of myself , the fingers of both my hands shook uncontrollably .
" That 's it !
He 's going to talk " , said a voice .
The water stopped running and they took away the rag .
I was able to breathe .
In the gloom , I saw the lieutenants and the captain , who , with a cigarette between his lips , was hitting my stomach with his fist to make me throw out the water I had swallowed .
[ 116 ] [ 118 ]
Alleg stated that he did not break under his ordeal of being waterboarded .
[ 119 ]
He also stated that the incidence of " accidental " death of prisoners being subjected to waterboarding in Algeria was " very frequent " . [ 33 ]
Vietnam War
Waterboarding was designated as illegal by U.S. generals in the Vietnam War . [ 120 ]
On 21 January 1968 , The Washington Post published a controversial front - page photograph of two U.S soldiers and one South Vietnamese soldier participating in the waterboarding of a North Vietnamese POW near Da Nang . [ 121 ]
The article described the practice as " fairly common " .
[ 121 ]
The photograph led to the soldier being court - martialled by a U.S. military court within one month of its publication , and he was discharged from the army . [ 120 ] [ 122 ]
Another waterboarding photograph of the same scene , referred to as " water torture " in the caption , is also exhibited in the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City . [ 123 ]
Chile
Based on the testimonies from more than 35,000 victims of the Pinochet regime , the Chilean Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture concluded that provoking a near - death experience by waterboarding is torture . [ 124 ]
Khmer Rouge
The Khmer Rouge at the Tuol Sleng prison in Phnom Penh , Cambodia , used waterboarding as a method of torture between 1975 and 1979 .
[ 125 ]
The practice was perfected by Duch 's lieutenants Mam Nai and Tang Sin Hean [ 126 ] and documented in a painting by former inmate Vann Nath , which is on display in the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum .
The museum also has on display boards and other actual tools used for waterboarding during the Khmer Rouge regime . [ 127 ] [ 128 ]
Northern Ireland
Evidence shows that the British Army in the Troubles subjected prisoners in Northern Ireland to torture and waterboarding during interrogations in the 1970s .
Liam Holden was wrongfully arrested by British forces for the murder of a British soldier and became the last person in the United Kingdom to be sentenced to hang after being convicted in 1973 , largely on the basis of an unsigned confession produced by torture . [ 129 ]
His death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he spent 17 years behind bars .
On 21 June 2012 , in the light of CCRC investigations which confirmed that the methods used to extract confessions were unlawful , [ 130 ] Holden had his conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal in Belfast , at the age of 58 . [ 131 ] [ 132 ] Former Royal Ulster Constabulary ( RUC ) interrogators during the Troubles admitted that beatings , sleep deprivation , waterboarding , and the other tortures were systematic , and were , at times , sanctioned at a very high level within the force . [ 133 ]
Apartheid in the Union of South Africa
The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission received testimony from Charles Zeelie and Jeffrey Benzien , officers of the South African Police under Apartheid , that they used waterboarding , referred to as " tubing " , or the " wet bag technique " on political prisoners as part of a wide range of torture methods to extract information .
[ 134 ] [ 135 ] : pp.206
Specifically , a cloth bag was wet and placed over victim 's heads , to be removed only when they were near asphyxiation ; the procedure was repeated several times .
[ 134 ] [ 135 ] : pp.206
The TRC concluded that the act constituted torture and a gross human rights violation , for which the state was responsible .
[ 136 ] : pp.617,619
U.S. military survival training
Until 2007 , [ 137 ] all special operations units in all branches of the U.S. military and the CIA 's Special Activities Division [ 138 ] employed the use of waterboarding as part of survival school ( Survival , Evasion , Resistance and Escape ) training , to psychologically prepare soldiers for the possibility of being captured by enemy forces . [ 139 ]
By 2002 , many branches of the military had backed away from waterboarding trainees , at least in part " because it hurt morale " , [ 140 ] and in November 2007 the practice was banned by the Department of Defense because it " provided no instructional or training benefit to the student " .
[ 137 ]
John Yoo , former Deputy Assistant Attorney General under President Bush stated that the United States has subjected 20,000 of its troops to waterboarding as part of SERE training prior to deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan . [ 141 ]
Dr. Jerald Ogrisseg , former head of Psychological Services for the Air Force SERE School has stated in testimony before the U.S. Senate 's Committee on Armed Services that there are fundamental differences between SERE training and what occurs in real world settings .
[ 142 ]
Dr. Ogrisseg further states that his experience is limited to SERE training , but that he did not believe waterboarding to be productive in either setting . [ 143 ]
Jane Mayer wrote for The New Yorker :
According to the SERE affiliate and two other sources familiar with the program , after September 11th several psychologists versed in SERE techniques began advising interrogators at Guantánamo Bay and elsewhere .
Some of these psychologists essentially " tried to reverse - engineer " the SERE program , as the affiliate put it .
" They took good knowledge and used it in a bad way " , another of the sources said .
Interrogators and BSCT members at Guantánamo adopted coercive techniques similar to those employed in the SERE program . [ 144 ]
and continues to report :
many of the interrogation methods used in SERE training seem to have been applied at Guantánamo . [ 144 ]
However , according to a declassified Justice Department memo attempting to justify torture which references a still - classified report of the CIA Inspector General on the CIA 's use of waterboarding , among other " enhanced " interrogation techniques , the CIA applied waterboarding to detainees " in a different manner " than the technique used in SERE training :
The difference was in the manner in which the detainees ' breathing was obstructed .
At the SERE school and in the DoJ opinion , the subject 's airflow is disrupted by the firm application of a damp cloth over the air passages ; the interrogator applies a small amount of water to the cloth in a controlled manner .
By contrast , the Agency interrogator ... applied large volumes of water to a cloth that covered the detainee 's mouth and nose .
One of the psychiatrist / interrogators acknowledged that the Agency 's use of the technique is different from that used in SERE training because it is ' for real ' and is more poignant and convincing . [ 145 ]
According to the DOJ memo , the IG Report observed that the CIA 's Office of Medical Services ( OMS ) stated that " the experience of the SERE psychologist / interrogators on the waterboard was probably misrepresented at the time , as the SERE waterboard experience is so different from the subsequent Agency usage as to make it almost irrelevant " and that " [ c] onsequently , according to OMS , there was no a priori reason to believe that applying the waterboard with the frequency and intensity with which it was used by the psychologist / interrogators was either efficacious or medically safe . "
[ 145 ]
Contemporary use and the United States
Use by law enforcement
In 1983 , San Jacinto County , Texas sheriff , James Parker , and three of his deputies were convicted for conspiring to force confessions .
The complaint said they " subject prisoners to a suffocating water torture ordeal to coerce confessions .
This generally included the placement of a towel over the nose and mouth of the prisoner and the pouring of water into the towel until the prisoner began to move , jerk ( twitch ) , or otherwise indicate suffocation and / or drowning " .
[ 112 ]
James Parker was sentenced to ten years in prison , and the deputies to four years .
[ 112 ] [ 122 ]
Use by intelligence officers
The 21 June 2004 issue of Newsweek stated that the Bybee Memo , an early August 2002 legal memorandum drafted by John Yoo and signed by his boss , Jay S. Bybee , then head of the Office of Legal Counsel , described interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists or terrorist affiliates the George W. Bush administration would consider legal , was " prompted by CIA questions about what to do with a top Qaeda captive , Abu Zubaydah , who had turned uncooperative ... and was drafted after White House meetings convened by George W. Bush 's chief counsel , Alberto Gonzales , along with Defense Department general counsel William Haynes and David Addington , Vice President Dick Cheney 's counsel , who discussed specific interrogation techniques " , citing " a source familiar with the discussions " .
Amongst the methods they found acceptable was waterboarding .
[ 21 ]
Jack Goldsmith , head of the Office of Legal Counsel ( October 2003 - June 2004 ) in the Department of Justice , later said this group was known as " the war council " .
In November 2005 , ABC News reported that former CIA agents claimed that the CIA engaged in a modern form of waterboarding , along with five other " enhanced interrogation techniques " , against suspected members of al Qaeda .
On 20 July 2007 , U.S. President George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13440 , banning torture during interrogation of terror suspects . [ 146 ]
While the guidelines for interrogation do not specifically ban waterboarding , the executive order refers to torture as defined by 18 USC 2340 , which includes " the threat of imminent death " , as well as the U.S. Constitution 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment . [ 147 ]
Reaction to the order was mixed , with the CIA satisfied that it " clearly defined " the agency 's authorities .
Human Rights
Watch said that answers about what specific techniques had been banned lay in the classified companion document and that " the people in charge of interpreting [ that ] document do n't have a particularly good track record of reasonable legal analysis " . [ 148 ]
Photo from a protest against waterboarding
On 14 September 2007 , ABC News reported that sometime in 2006 , CIA Director Michael Hayden asked for and received permission from the Bush administration to ban the use of waterboarding in CIA interrogations .
A CIA spokesperson declined to discuss interrogation techniques , which he or she said " have been and continue to be lawful " .
ABC reported that waterboarding had been authorized by a 2002 Presidential finding .
[ 149 ]
On 5 November 2007 , The Wall Street Journal reported that its " sources confirm ... that the CIA has only used this interrogation method against three terrorist detainees and not since 2003 . " [ 150 ]
John Kiriakou , a former CIA officer , is the first official within the U.S. government to openly admit to the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique , as of 10 December 2007 . [ 151 ] [ 152 ]
On 6 February 2008 , CIA director General Michael Hayden stated that the CIA had waterboarded three prisoners during 2002 and 2003 , namely Abu Zubaydah , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri . [ 13 ] [ 153 ]
On 23 February 2008 , the Justice Department revealed that its internal ethics office was investigating the department 's legal approval for waterboarding of al Qaeda suspects by the CIA and was likely to make public an unclassified version of its report . [ 154 ]
On 15 October 2008 , it was reported that the Bush administration had issued a pair of secret memos to the CIA in June 2003 and June 2004 explicitly endorsing waterboarding and other torture techniques against al - Qaeda suspects . [ 155 ]
The memos were granted only after " repeated requests " from the CIA , who at the time were worried that the White House would eventually try to distance themselves from the issue .
Field employees in the agency believed they could easily be blamed for using the techniques without proper written permission or authority .
[ 155 ]
Until this point , the Bush administration had never been concretely tied to acknowledging the torture practices .
In December 2008 , Robert Mueller , the Director of the FBI since 5 July 2001 , had said that despite Bush Administration claims that waterboarding has " disrupted a number of attacks , maybe dozens of attacks " , he does not believe that evidence obtained by the U.S. government through enhanced interrogation techniques such as waterboarding disrupted one attack .
[ 156 ] [ 157 ]
In an interview in January 2009 , Dick Cheney acknowledged the use of waterboarding to interrogate suspects and said that waterboarding had been " used with great discrimination by people who know what they 're doing and has produced a lot of valuable information and intelligence " .
[ 158 ]
On 1 July 2009 , the Obama administration announced that it was delaying the scheduled release of declassified portions of a report by the CIA Inspector General in response to a civil lawsuit .
The CIA report reportedly cast doubt on the effectiveness of the torture used by CIA interrogators during the Bush administration .
This was based on several George W. Bush - era Justice Department memos declassified in the Spring of 2009 by the U.S. Justice Department . [ 145 ] [ 159 ] [ 160 ]
Abu Zubaydah
Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded by the CIA . [ 13 ]
In 2002 , U.S. intelligence located Abu Zubaydah by tracing his phone calls .
He was captured 28 March 2002 , in a safehouse located in a two - story apartment in Faisalabad , Pakistan .
One of Abu Zubaydah 's FBI interrogators , Ali Soufan , wrote a book about his experiences .
He later testified to Congress that Zubaydah was producing useful information in response to conventional interrogation methods , including the names of Sheikh Mohammed and Jose Padilla .
He stopped providing accurate information in response to harsh techniques . [ 161 ]
Soufan , one of the FBI 's most successful interrogators , explained , " When they are in pain , people will say anything to get the pain to stop .
Most of the time , they will lie , make up anything to make you stop hurting them .
That means the information you 're getting is useless . " [ 161 ]
Participating in his later interrogation by the CIA were two American psychologists , James Elmer Mitchell and R. Scott Shumate . [ 162 ] [ 163 ]
In December 2007 , The Washington Post reported that there were some discrepancies regarding reports about the number of times Zubaydah was waterboarded .
According to a previous account by former CIA officer John Kiriakou , Abu Zubaydah broke after just 35 seconds of waterboarding , which involved stretching cellophane over his mouth and nose and pouring water on his face to create the sensation of drowning . [ 164 ]
Kiriakou later admitted that he had no first hand knowledge of the interrogation and accused the CIA of using him to spread disinformation .
[ 165 ] [ 166 ] [ 167 ] [ 168 ]
Former CIA operative John Kiriakou in 2007 told CNN's " American Morning " that the waterboarding of Al Qaeda 's Abu Zubaydah indirectly led to the arrest of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed : [ 169 ]
The former agent , who said he participated in the Abu Zubayda interrogation but not his waterboarding , said the CIA decided to waterboard the al Qaeda operative only after he was " wholly uncooperative " for weeks and refused to answer questions .
All that changed – and Zubayda reportedly had a divine revelation – after 30 to 35 seconds of waterboarding , Kiriakou said he learned from the CIA agents who performed the technique .
The terror suspect , who is being held at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , reportedly gave up information that indirectly led to the [ sic ] 2003 raid in Pakistan yielding the arrest of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , an alleged planner of the 11 September 2001 , attacks , Kiriakou said .
The CIA was unaware of Mohammed 's stature before the Abu Zubayda interrogation , the former agent said . [ 169 ]
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times while being interrogated by the CIA . [ 170 ] [ 171 ]
Pakistani intelligence agents say Mohammed was carrying a letter from bin Laden at the time of his arrest , but there is no evidence he knew bin Laden 's whereabouts .
By this point , any information Mohammed had would have been years out of date . [ 172 ] [ 173 ]
After being subjected to repeated waterboarding , Mohammed claimed participation in thirty - one terrorist plots . [ 174 ]
On 15 June 2009 , in response to a lawsuit by the ACLU , the government was forced to disclose a previously classified portion of a CIA memo written in 2006 .
It recounted Mohammed 's telling the CIA that he " made up stories " to stop from being tortured .
[ 175 ]
Legal experts cast serious doubt as to the validity of Mohammed 's " confessions " as being false claims , and human rights activists raised serious concerns over the " sham process " of justice and use of torture . [ 176 ]
During a radio interview on 24 October 2006 , with Scott Hennen of radio station WDAY , Vice President Dick Cheney agreed with the use of waterboarding .
[ 177 ] [ 178 ]
The administration later denied that Cheney had confirmed the use of waterboarding , saying that U.S. officials do not talk publicly about interrogation techniques because they are classified .
White House Press Secretary Tony Snow claimed that Cheney was not referring to waterboarding , despite repeated questions refused to specify what else Cheney was referring to by a " dunk in the water " , and refused to confirm that this meant waterboarding . [ 179 ]
On 13 September 2007 , ABC News reported that a former intelligence officer stated that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had been waterboarded in the presence of a female CIA supervisor . [ 180 ]
On 2 June 2010 , while speaking to the Economic Club of Grand Rapids , Michigan , former President Bush publicly confirmed his knowledge and approval of waterboarding Mohammed , saying " Yeah , we waterboarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ... I 'd do it again to save lives . " [ 181 ]
Obama administration
President Barack Obama banned the use of waterboarding and several other interrogation methods in January 2009 .
He reported that U.S. personnel must stick to the Army Field Manual guidelines . [ 182 ]
In early April 2009 , the Obama administration released several classified Justice Department memos from the George W. Bush administration that discussed waterboarding . [ 183 ]
Obama opposed prosecuting CIA personnel who committed waterboarding while relying on legal advice provided by their superiors .
The American Civil Liberties Union has criticized his stance . [ 183 ]
In early April 2009 , news reports stated that Obama would support an independent investigation over the issue as long as it would be bipartisan .
[ 182 ] [ 183 ] [ 184 ]
On 23 April 2009 , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs stated that the administration had changed its position and no long supported such an idea .
The topic was the subject of heated internal debate within the White House . [ 184 ]
National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair has stated that " high value information " came from waterboarding certain prisoners during the George W. Bush administration .
He also commented that he could not know for sure whether or not other interrogation methods would have caused them to talk , had they been tried . [ 182 ]
In an administration memo that was publicly released , he wrote , " I do not fault those who made the decisions at that time , and I will absolutely defend those who carried out the interrogations within the orders they were given . " [ 185 ]
An April poll by Rasmussen Reports found that 77 percent of voters had followed the story in the media and that 58 percent believed that releasing the memos compromised American national security .
On the issue of a further investigation , 58 percent disagreed while 28 % agreed . [ 186 ]
Obama detailed his view on waterboarding and torture in a press conference on 29 April 2009 . [ 187 ]
In May 2011 , Obama authorized a successful commando raid to kill Osama Bin Laden .
The extent to which waterboarding assisted in ascertaining the whereabouts of Bin Laden is a matter of dispute .
Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey criticized the Obama administration for denying future missions the intelligence capability that made the raid possible : " Acknowledging and meeting the need for an effective and lawful interrogation program , which we once had , and freeing CIA operatives and others to administer it under congressional oversight , would be a fitting way to mark the demise of Osama bin Laden . " [ 188 ] CIA Director Leon Panetta , who supervised the operation that found and killed bin Laden , stated in an interview with NBC reporter Brian Williams : " ... they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of these detainees .
But I 'm also saying , that the debate about whether we would have gotten the same information through other approaches , I think , is always going to be an open question . " [ 189 ]
Republican Senator John McCain , in a Washington Post opinion piece , [ 67 ] disputed Mukasey 's account , saying :
I asked CIA Director Leon Panetta for the facts , and he told me the following :
The trail to bin Laden did not begin with a disclosure from Khalid Sheik Mohammed , who was waterboarded 183 times .
The first mention of Abu Ahmed al - Kuwaiti — the nickname of the al - Qaeda courier who ultimately led us to bin Laden — as well as a description of him as an important member of al - Qaeda , came from a detainee held in another country , who we believe was not tortured .
None of the three detainees who were waterboarded provided Abu Ahmed 's real name , his whereabouts or an accurate description of his role in al - Qaeda .
In fact , the use of ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' on Khalid Sheik Mohammed produced false and misleading information .
He specifically told his interrogators that Abu Ahmed had moved to Peshawar , got married and ceased his role as an al - Qaeda facilitator — none of which was true .
According to the staff of the Senate intelligence committee , the best intelligence gained from a CIA detainee — information describing Abu Ahmed al - Kuwaiti's real role in al - Qaeda and his true relationship to bin Laden — was obtained through standard , noncoercive means .
In December 2014 , the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence issued a declassified 500 page summary of its still - classified 6,700 page report on the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) Detention and Interrogation Program .
The report concluded that " the CIA 's use of Enhanced Interrogation Techniques ( EIT ) was not effective for acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees . "
According to the report , the CIA had presented no credible proof that information obtained through waterboarding or the other harsh interrogation methods that the CIA employed prevented any attacks or saved any lives .
There was no evidence that information obtained from the detainees through EIT was not or could not have been obtained through conventional interrogation methods .
[ 190 ]
The Committee examined in detail the specific question of whether torture had elicited information helpful in locating Osama Bin Laden , concluded that it had not , and further concluded that the CIA deliberately misled political leaders and the public in claiming otherwise .
[ 191 ] [ 192 ]
U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announced on 30 August 2012 that no one would be prosecuted for the deaths of a prisoner in Afghanistan in 2002 and another in Iraq in 2003 , eliminating the last possibility that any criminal charges will be brought as a result of the interrogations carried out by the CIA . [ 193 ]
The Justice Department closed its investigation of the CIA 's use of severe interrogation methods , because investigators said they could not prove any agents crossed the lines authorized by the Bush administration in the " war on terror " program of detention and rendition .
[ 194 ]
According to the New York Times the closing of the two cases means that the Obama administration 's limited effort to scrutinize the counterterrorism programs , such as waterboarding , carried out under President George W. Bush has come to an end . [ 193 ]
Use by Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
In October 2014 , John Cantlie reported that ISIS had waterboarded prisoners , " Some of us who tried to escape were waterboarded by our captors , as Muslim prisoners are waterboarded by their American captors . " [ 195 ]
Before and during the 2016 presidential election
In 2015 , various Republican presidential candidates indicated their willingness to bring back waterboarding as an interrogation technique .
Donald Trump ( the eventual winner of the election ) stated he believed in the effectiveness of the technique . [ 196 ]
Trump also stated that it is a " minimal " form of torture , and that it was necessary .
[ 197 ]
Ben Carson had not ruled out approving its use , [ 198 ] nor did Jeb Bush . [ 199 ]
Carly Fiorina endorsed its use , [ 200 ] as did Rick Perry and Rick Santorum . [ 201 ]
In June 2015 , in response to a critical assessment of China in the U.S. State Department 's annual human rights report , China noted that the U.S. , among other alleged human rights abuses , had engaged in torture of terrorism suspects by waterboarding . [ 202 ]
Effectiveness
Waterboarding and other forms of water torture have historically been used for 1 ) punishing , 2 ) forcing confessions for use in trials 3 ) eliciting false confessions for political purposes , and 4 ) obtaining factual intelligence for military purposes .
For eliciting confessions
Its use principally for obtaining confessions rather than as punishment dates back to the 15th century and the Spanish Inquisition .
It was also in use for the same purpose , albeit illegally , by U.S. police officers as recently as 1981 .
During the Korean War , the North Koreans used several enhanced interrogation techniques ( EIT ) to achieve prisoner compliance and false confessions .
[ 203 ]
Such techniques caused a U.S.airmen to falsely " confess " that there was a plan to use biological weapons against North Korea . [ 204 ]
After 9/11 , CIA interrogators , sought to waterboard suspected terrorists to obtain actionable intelligence , but prisoners falsely confessed to whatever interrogators accused them of in order to stop the EIT .
Khalid Shaykh Muhammad fabricated stories to give his tormentors " everything they wanted to hear . "
Later , he recanted , citing he was being tortured when he made up the stories .
The same was true for the " confessions " elicited by EIT on Riduan Isamuddin , aka Hambali .
[ 190]:85 , 91 , 95 , 108–9
For obtaining actionable intelligence
Waterboarding 's effectiveness as a technique for reliably obtaining truthful , useful intelligence has not been established .
In May 2003 , a senior CIA interrogator told the CIA 's Office of Inspector General that the EIT then being used by the CIA was modeled after U.S. resistance training to prepare servicemen for " physical torture " by North Vietnamese .
This torture , including waterboarding , was intended to extract " confessions for propaganda purposes " from U.S. airman " who possessed little actionable intelligence . "
If the CIA wanted to obtain useful information rather than false confessions , he said , the CIA needed " a different working model for interrogating terrorists . " [ 190 ] :33 Nonetheless , with the active support of former Vice President Dick Cheney , the CIA embraced the EIT approach proposed by two psychologists , James Elmer Mitchell and Bruce Jessen , neither of whom had interrogation experience .
[ 190 ] :21 , 32 While Cheney continues to maintain that waterboarding has " produced phenomenal results " including tracking down Osama bin Laden , [ 205 ] the report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded that " the CIA 's use of its enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees . "
There was no proof , according to the 6,700 page report , that information obtained through waterboarding prevented any attacks or saved any lives , or that information obtained from the detainees was not or could not have been obtained through conventional interrogation methods .
[ 190 ] :2–3 , 13–14
Legality
International law
All nations that are signatory to the United Nations Convention Against Torture have agreed they are subject to the explicit prohibition on torture under any condition .
This was affirmed by Saadi v. Italy in which the European Court of Human Rights , on 28 February 2008 , upheld the absolute nature of the torture ban by ruling that international law permits no exceptions to it . [ 206 ]
Article 2.2 of the Convention Against Torture states that " [ n ] o exceptional circumstances whatsoever , whether a state of war or a threat of war , internal political instability or any other public emergency , may be invoked as a justification of torture . " [ 207 ]
Additionally , signatories of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are bound to Article 5 , which states , " No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . " [ 208 ]
Many signatories of the UN Convention Against Torture have made specific declarations and reservations regarding the interpretation of the term " torture " and restricted the jurisdiction of its enforcement .
[ 209 ]
However , UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , Louise Arbour , stated on the subject " I would have no problems with describing this practice as falling under the prohibition of torture " , and that violators of the UN Convention Against Torture should be prosecuted under the principle of universal jurisdiction . [ 210 ]
Bent Sørensen , Senior Medical Consultant to the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims and former member of the United Nations Committee Against Torture has said :
It 's a clear - cut case : Waterboarding can without any reservation be labeled as torture .
It fulfils all of the four central criteria that according to the United Nations Convention Against Torture ( UNCAT ) defines an act of torture .
First , when water is forced into your lungs in this fashion , in addition to the pain you are likely to experience an immediate and extreme fear of death .
You may even suffer a heart attack from the stress or damage to the lungs and brain from inhalation of water and oxygen deprivation .
In other words there is no doubt that waterboarding causes severe physical and / or mental suffering – one central element in the UNCAT 's definition of torture .
In addition the CIA 's waterboarding clearly fulfills the three additional definition criteria stated in the Convention for a deed to be labeled torture , since it is 1 ) done intentionally , 2 ) for a specific purpose and 3 ) by a representative of a state– in this case the US . [ 211 ]
Lt. Gen. Michael D. Maples , the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency , concurred by stating , in a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee , that he believes waterboarding violates Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions . [ 212 ]
In a review of The Dark Side : The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals , by Jane Mayer , The New York Times reported on 11 July 2008 , that " Red Cross investigators concluded last year in a secret report that the Central Intelligence Agency 's interrogation methods for high - level Qaeda prisoners constituted torture and could make the Bush administration officials who approved them guilty of war crimes " , [ 213 ] that the techniques applied to Abu Zubaydah were " categorically " torture , [ 213 ] and that Abu Zubaydah had told investigators that , contrary to what had been revealed previously , " he had been waterboarded at least 10 times in a single week and as many as three times in a day " .
[ 213 ]
Shortly before the end of Bush 's second term , news media in other countries were opining that under the United Nations Convention Against Torture , the U.S. is obligated to hold those responsible to account under criminal law . [ 214 ] [ 215 ]
On January 20 , 2009 , Manfred Nowak — the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment — stated that following the inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States , George W. Bush had lost his head of state immunity ; Nowak opined that under international law , the U.S. was mandated to start criminal proceedings against all those involved in violations of the UN Convention Against Torture . [ 216 ] [ 217 ]
Law professor Dietmar Herz asserted that under U.S. and international law , Bush was criminally responsible for adopting torture as interrogation tool . [ 216 ] [ 217 ]
United States law and regulations
The United States Supreme Court in Sosa v. Alvarez - Machain , said that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights " does not of its own force impose obligations as a matter of international law . " [ 218 ]
However , the United States has a historical record of regarding waterboarding as a war crime , and has prosecuted individuals for such practice in the past .
In 1947 , during the Yokohama War Crimes Trials , the United States prosecuted a Japanese civilian who had served in World War II as an interpreter for the Japanese military , Yukio Asano , for " Violation of the Laws and Customs of War " , asserting that he " did unlawfully take and convert to his own use Red Cross packages and supplies intended for " prisoners , but , far worse , that he also " did willfully and unlawfully mistreat and torture " prisoners of war .
The charges against Asano included " beating using hands , fists , club ; kicking ; water torture ; burning using cigarettes ; strapping on a stretcher head downward . " [ 219 ]
The specifications in the charges with regard to " water torture " consisted of " pouring water up [ the ] nostrils " of one prisoner , " forcing water into [ the ] mouths and noses " of two other prisoners , and " forcing water into [ the ] nose " of a fourth prisoner . [ 220 ]
Asano received a sentence of 15 years of hard labor . [ 121 ]
Following the September 11 attacks , several memoranda , including the Bybee memo , were written analyzing the legal position and possibilities in the treatment of prisoners .
[ 221 ]
The memos , known today as the " torture memos " , [ 222 ] advocate enhanced interrogation techniques , while pointing out that refuting the Geneva Conventions would reduce the possibility of prosecution for war crimes . [ 223 ] [ 224 ]
In addition , a new definition of torture was issued .
Most actions that fall under the international definition do not fall within this new definition advocated by the U.S. [ 225 ] [ 226 ]
In its 2005 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices , the U.S. Department of State formally recognized " submersion of the head in water " as torture in its examination of Tunisia 's poor human rights record , [ 44 ] and draws parallels between the two techniques , citing the similar usage of water on the subject . [ 227 ]
On 6 September 2006 , the U.S. Department of Defense released a revised Army Field Manual entitled Human Intelligence Collector Operations that prohibits the use of waterboarding by U.S. military personnel .
The department adopted the manual amid widespread criticism of U.S. handling of prisoners in the War on Terrorism , and prohibits other practices in addition to waterboarding .
The revised manual applies only to U.S. military personnel , and as such does not apply to the practices of the CIA . [ 228 ]
Nevertheless , Steven G. Bradbury , acting head of the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) Office of Legal Counsel , on 14 February 2008 testified :
There has been no determination by the Justice Department that the use of waterboarding , under any circumstances , would be lawful under current law . [ 229 ]
In addition , both under the War Crimes Act [ 230 ] and international law , violators of the laws of war are criminally liable under the command responsibility doctrine , and they could still be prosecuted for war crimes .
[ 231 ]
Commenting on the torture memos , Scott Horton pointed out :
the possibility that the authors of these memoranda counseled the use of lethal and unlawful techniques , and therefore face criminal culpability themselves .
That , after all , is the teaching of United States v. Altstötter , the Nuremberg case brought against German Justice Department lawyers whose memoranda crafted the basis for implementation of the infamous " Night and Fog Decree " . [ 232 ]
Michael Mukasey 's refusal to investigate and prosecute anyone that relied on these legal opinions led Jordan Paust of the University of Houston Law Center to write an article for JURIST stating :
it is legally and morally impossible for any member of the executive branch to be acting lawfully or within the scope of his or her authority while following OLC opinions that are manifestly inconsistent with or violative of the law .
General Mukasey , just following orders is no defense ! [ 233 ]
On 22 February 2008 , Senator Sheldon Whitehouse made public that " the Justice Department has announced it has launched an investigation of the role of top DOJ officials and staff attorneys in authorizing and / or overseeing the use of waterboarding by U.S. intelligence agencies . " [ 234 ] [ 235 ]
Both houses of the United States Congress approved a bill by February 2008 that would ban waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods , the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 .
As he promised , President Bush vetoed the legislation on 8 March .
His veto applied to the authorization for the entire intelligence budget for the 2008 fiscal year , but he cited the waterboarding ban as the reason for the veto . [ 236 ]
Supporters of the bill supporters lacked enough votes to overturn the veto . [ 237 ]
On 22 January 2009 , President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13491 , which requires both U.S. military and paramilitary organizations to use the Army Field Manual as the guide on getting information from prisoners , moving away from the Bush administration tactics . [ 238 ] [ 239 ]
Examples in fiction
Images of waterboarding in use
While waterboarding has been depicted in several films and demonstrated at protest gatherings , images of its actual use are scarce .
The CIA allegedly destroyed all videos it made of the procedure .
The 1968 Washington Post photo of a captured North Vietnamese soldier being interrogated is arguably different because instead of being strapped to a board , the prisoner is held down by two soldiers as a third pours water from a canteen over a cloth covering face . [ 244 ] [ 245 ]
One eyewitness depiction of waterboarding is a painting by Vann Nath , a Cambodian artist who was held captive and tortured by the Khmer Rouge .
After his release in 1979 from Tuol Sleng Prison , he began to paint pictures of the abusive practices used there , including waterboarding , to let people know about them , saying of the prisoners he heard screaming for help : " I would like their souls to get something from what I paint . " [ 246 ]
One of his waterboarding paintings depicts a sparse room with a man affixed to a board by iron bars .
A cloth covers his head .
Another man pours water from a watering can over his face .
A similar board and watering can are on display at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum .
Waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah , a drawing by Dmitry Borshch [ ru ] , has been exhibited at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences , DePaul University , Brecht Forum , The Graduate Center , CUNY , and Palace of Culture and Science . [ 247 ] [ 248 ] [ 249 ]
In 2008 , the Coney Island waterboarding thrill ride went on display in Coney Island amusement park : viewers would see two models , one a captive wearing an orange uniform who was spread - eagled on a tilted table , the other one a masked interrogator .
When viewers inserted a dollar the interrogator figure would pour water onto a rag over the captive figures ' nose and throat , upon which the captive figure would start convulsing .

Bundesfamilienministerin Ursula von der Leyen kündigte in einem Interview mit der Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung an , dass die Eckpunkte für ihre Internet - Sperrliste am Mittwoch im Kabinett beschlossen werden sollen .
Derzeit befinden sie sich den Angaben der Ministerin nach in der Ressortabstimmung .
Von der Leyen geht davon aus , dass sich ausschließlich kinderpornographische Seiten auf der Liste befinden sollten ; sie führt dafür drastische Beispiele von Vergewaltigungen vor der Kamera an .
Bereits in der vergangenen
Woche jedoch meldeten sich mehrere Politiker mit Forderungen , auch Glücksspielangebote , Bombenbauanleitungen und " Killerspiele " auf die Sperrliste zu setzen .
Auch auf bekannt gewordenen Sperrlisten aus Finnland , Dänemark und Australien waren zahlreiche Seiten zu finden , die mit Kinderpornographie nichts zu tun hatten .
Auf der australischen Liste fand sich unter anderem die Website eines Zahnarztes , der sich das Geschehnis damit erklärt , dass diese in der Vergangenheit einmal von Russen gekapert worden war .
Zudem konnte ein Verein mit Hilfe der dänischen Sperrliste nachweisen , dass sich ein großer Teil der darauf befindlichen Seiten mit einfachen Briefen an die Provider vom Netz nehmen ließ , was wiederum die Frage aufwarf , warum Regierungen diesen
Weg nicht gehen .
Weitere Probleme ergeben sich dadurch , dass der Begriff der Kinderpornographie seit der im November in Kraft getretenen Ausweitung auf Jugendanscheinspornographie relativ schwer eingegrenzt werden kann .
Verboten ist seitdem nicht nur das , was man sich gemeinhin unter Kinderpornographie vorstellt , sondern jegliches Bildmaterial , in dem Darstellerinnen in aufreizenden Posen so aussehen , als ob sie möglicherweise unter 18 Jahre alt sein könnten .
Vor dieser Gesetzesänderung lag die Altersgrenze bei 14 Jahren .

From RogueBasin
History and Rationale
In 2005 , the roguelike community established a yearly event , the 7DRL Challenge , in which all the world is challenged to create a roguelike in a one - week span .
This allows one to have the shared misery of knowing you are not the only one tracking down a bad pointer at the 167th hour .
As a suggested schema for proposing the challenge the 7DRL Voting Specification has been created .
The annual event occurs during a week in late February or early March .
There is a chance that some other challenges may arise out of schedule , thus allowing more than one challenge per year .
7DRL Challenges are NOT about being a fast coder , but rather proving you can release a finished , playable roguelike to the world .
There is no winner of the challenge , but rather all those who finish are honoured for their work , the criterion is completeness .
Event rules
You CAN use external libraries , game engines , pre-existing generic code / algorithms , pre-existing generic art , etc .
You can even start your game from an existing game , if you are willing to turn it out into something unique , you must however say what resources were reused .
It is allowed and recommended to have a rough design idea of your project before starting
Check out this article by Darren Grey for a few pointers on how to succeed at the challenge , and the 7DRL episodes of Roguelike Radio .
But ultimately follow your own advice !
You 're the only one who can make your game .
How to participate
After the initial date chosen for the challenge , sign up in the jam page for the year .
Whenever you are ready to start working , take note of your starting time .
You can optionally post a notice of you starting development in the game jam forum .
168 or less hours after this initial post , submit your game entry on the portal and mark it as successful or unsuccessful
The challenge is always Saturday to Sunday ; if you start after Sunday you will have less than 168 hours as in - challenge 7DRLs must be completed by the closing time .
You can still use 168 hours and have a normal , out of challenge , 7DRL , however
Community
One of the joys of the set challenge week is that you know you are not alone in your struggles with pointer errors and inscrutable bugs .
A community of developers and players comes together during the week and after to revel in the challenge .
To join in here are some useful links :
Challenges
To the date , there have been fifteen annual 7DRL challenges
Besides the main annual 7DRL Challenge , there was a smaller event on October 15th to October 23rd , 2006 , called the Orange October Minigun 7DRL Contest 2006
There are few things more exciting to a journalist than being among the first to report important news , and we here at LinuxInsider are no exception .
So it was with great glee that we learned of recent rumors that Internet Explorer 8 could be the end of the line .
Special thanks to Slashdot blogger hairyfeet for calling them to our attention !
Yes , there were several such reports circulating on the virtual grapevine in recent days , including Randall Kennedy ’s post at InfoWorld , Scott Fulton ’s post at Beta News , iAurora ’s post at JCXP and others .
It ’s not yet clear what Microsoft ’s replacement for IE will be — Microsoft ’s apparently not talking , one way or the other — but WebKit and a brand - new engine dubbed “ Gazelle ” are said to be the top contenders .
IE6 Left in the Dust
Now , news on the doings in Redmond is almost always of at least some interest to those in the FOSS community , but this news was particularly interesting given the ongoing browser wars between Explorer and our beloved Firefox .
Just the other day , in fact , a report was released by StatCounter indicating that Firefox 3 recently became the first non-Microsoft browser to overtake Internet Explorer 6 in market share .
Not only that , but it ’s threatening IE7 too , the report suggested .
“ Me ( webdeveloper ) happy , ” wrote munikho on Digg , where the news garnered close to 2,000 Diggs and more than 350 comments .
“ Good Riddance to IE6 , ” Montreal consultant and Slashdot blogger Gerhard Mack told LinuxInsider .
“ It ’s a travesty that needs to be dropped off the Web as soon as possible . ”
‘ Excellent Extension System ’
Firefox has also done several things right — in particular , its “ excellent extension system , ” hairyfeet told LinuxInsider .
“ I have several customers that are always ‘ cutting edge , ’ and while they tried IE7 / * as well as Safari and Chrome , they always come back to FF in short order , ” hairyfeet explained .
“ Why ?
For the same reason my 67 - year - old father , who knows nothing about technology , refuses to use any browser other than FF3 — the ease of the FF3 extension system allowed him to customize the browser to HIS needs instead of simply taking the Web as given by IE and the others . ”
That ’s why Chrome is working to add its own extension framework , hairyfeet added , “ though frankly I think it will be a case of too little too late , as there is a robust developer network surrounding the FF extension network that — even with their money —
Google simply wo n’t be able to match .
It is simply too rich and varied to replicate , ” he said .
‘ The Operating System Is Next ’
“ I like to use Beagle and Firefox , ” blogger Robert Pogson told LinuxInsider .
“ In GNU / Linux we have choice , thank goodness .
Consumers enjoy choice and are waking up to the fact that they have choices .
The operating system is next . ”
Of course , speaking of operating systems , it was already revealed earlier this month that Windows 7 will make it possible for users to “ unplug ” IE and other components .
But to now learn that IE8 itself is being unplugged permanently , and replaced by something else ?
The possibilities are simply mind - boggling .
‘ Truly Wonderful News ’
“ For Linux users this will be truly wonderful news , as the reason why many Web pages do n’t work correctly to this day on Linux is IE and their hobbled page designs , ” hairyfeet asserted .
“ I think the big work cut out for Linux next will be replacing the Windows Server / Sharepoint / Exchange stack , ” he said .
“ Because like it or not , that combo makes integration and policy management of Windows clients beyond easy .
I have gone over to friends that manage Linux servers and seen their solutions , and frankly nothing I have seen so far is even close to that combo for ease of use . ”
Linux has already won users who embrace freedom “ along with the self - proclaimed nerds , ” hairyfeet noted .
What it needs now “ is a way to get John Q. Public to use it , and I still believe that way is through the office , ” he said .
“ If you are paid to use it at work , you will want to use it at home .
“ I know many home users that in 2009 STILL insist that any machine I build them has Win2 K pro on it , ” he added .
“ Why ?
Because that is what they use at their workplace . ”
‘ Some New Ploy ’
If IE8 really is Microsoft ’s last release , “ it would be a good thing , ” Pogson agreed .
“ Unfortunately , M$ integrated IE into Lose ’95 deliberately to mess with competition , so I cannot see them turning over a new leaf at this late date and getting out of the messing - with - competition business , ” Pogson asserted .
“ Whatever they are planning will be simply some contortion to seem to be complying with EU and other directives while creating some new ploy . ”
Microsoft is “ so big that they can delay justice while billions more are dumped on them , ” he added .
“ They may rename it or come up with a different technology , but I can not see them ever playing well with the Web .
They will lever their monopoly until it is gone in a few years . ”
Once a Stick , Now a ‘ Schtick ’
IE has become “ schtick , ” Slashdot blogger yagu told LinuxInsider .
“ It used to be a stick . ”
Specifically , Microsoft used that stick to “ effectively beat down the browser market , ” yagu explained .
“ DOJ [ Department of Justice ] and markets rallied , and we have a more level and balanced browser market . ”
Now Microsoft is likely not so much ceding the browser competition as shrugging it off , he added .
“ It is n’t ‘ where the money is ’ anymore .
Microsoft knows IE gives them little of the leverage they want and need to stay relevant . ”
‘ One of My Biggest Headaches ’
With its “ entrenched , huge monopoly , ” Microsoft succeeds today mostly through momentum , yagu said .
Now , it ’s looking for a way “ to re-establish dominance before that momentum slows .
“ They are trying to be a search engine , irrelevantly , ” he noted .
“ They are trying to bring online Office ( more than a step or two behind Google ) , irrelevantly .
They are in the gaming business , but losing money .
They are in ‘ the music bidnez , ’ irrelevantly . ”
It remains to be seen if Microsoft figures out “ how they get back on track , ” yagu said .
“ One thing they do seem to have recognized is that IE is n’t the killer app anymore , and it is n’t worth tons of their time and attention anymore , ” he concluded .
“ I wo n’t miss IE if it goes away ; both as a user and as a developer , it ’s been one of my biggest headaches . ”

Paul BuchheitCEans , We are addicted to Gmail .
We eat , drink & sleep Gmail .
So we began our hunt for the engineer who created it .
We found out that theWe seached more and found out that the creator of Gmail & Adsense is also the man who gave Google its world famous tagline .
We digged deeper and found out that the man behind Gmail , Adsense , ' Do n't Be Evil ' is also the man behind FriendFeed !
We requested him for a Small Talk and he agreed .
We jumped with joy .
We are extremely proud and happy to have the engineer who changed the world forever - Check out our Small Talk with Mr. Paul Buchheit : - It 's a lot of fun .
For me , work is much more enjoyable if I know that it matters to other people and that it 's somehow improving their life .
This is also one of the reasons that I like the " launch fast and iterate " approach to development that has become popular on the web -- it enables me to get my work out to the world in a matter of hours and very quickly get feedback .
I never finished the project so I never completely settled on a name .
My college ( CWRU ) had a campus wide high speed network , and it quickly became obvious to me that all of my information should be " online " so that it could be accessed from anywhere , not trapped on a single computer .
Email includes some of the most interesting and timely information , so I thought it would be nice to have a web - based email client .
That way I would be able to access my email from any computer that was connected to the web .
At the time , I was working at Intel , which is very much a big company , and I 'm not really a " big company " person , and also I was interested in startups .
I looked around for interesting startups in the area , and happened to apply to Google .
I was skeptical of their business ( there were many competitors who were much larger than Google and had more resources and users ) , but the people seemed smart , so I thought that it would be a good learning experience if nothing else .
Google 's " mission " is to organize and make useful all of the world 's information , and they recognized that much of the useful information is inside of email , so they asked me to build something that would improve email .
I started out by taking the code from the Google Groups Usenet search ( which was my previous project ) and loading it up with all of my own email .
That was version zero , and it only took a few hours to build .
From that point , I simply continued iteratively adding features and refining the product .
Somebody asked for a feature that could n't be implemented in plain HTML .
I did n't really know any Javascript at the time , but I spent a little while learning enough to implement the feature .
Over time we did more and more of that , and eventually realized that we should simple rewrite the whole interface using Javascript .
It has to be kept fast , efficient , and manageable .
We used Gmail internally and all had a lot of email , so we never even considered designs that would n't allow for a lot of mail .
The fact that we were making it free meant that we also needed to keep costs low , so that eliminated the possibility of using expensive storage systems .
We also wanted to have many millions of users , so that meant that the system was going to have to be very highly automated -- we can't afford to have an army of sysadmins managing the systems , so the systems have to manage themselves to a large extent .
Keep it simple .
A lot of times people think that hard problems demand complex solutions , but we 've found that the opposite is often the case , because complex things quickly become unmanageable and incomprehensible .
If the system is simple , then it 's generally easier to understand and easier to scale .
It 's also important to know where all of the time is going -- if something is slow , you should know why .
Fortunately , this is easy -- just add timers to your code and log everything that takes more than a few milliseconds .
We needed a way for Gmail to make money .
The idea of targeting ads to content instead of keywords had been around for quite a while , but was believed to be impractical .
We decided to do a little experiment to test anyway .
I wrote more about this story here : https://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2009/01/communicating-with-code.html
It was at a meeting on " corporate values " .
I do n't really have any great tips though .
I just wanted something that was different and memorable and that would make people a little uncomfortable .
We 're building a tool to make sharing and discussing things with friends very easy and enjoyable .
Our development model and product planning is very iterative , so what we do will depend a lot on user feedback and simply watching which things work well and which do n't .
Build more stuff .
I think empirical and experimental methods tend to work the best because the world is simply too complex to predict what will happen in advance .
Therefore , we should make an effort to find easy and low cost methods of testing new ideas .

CHARLESTON --
When the economy is stacked against you , you do n't need more hurdles .
Two years ago , the Catalano family purchased a piece of property on Androvette Street in Charleston with high hopes .
They had not idea the would have to pay for past errors , even though the mistakes were n't their own .
Over that time , the Catalanos have spent close to $ 600,000 to transform the once rundown site of the Black Garter strip club into a family - oriented steakhouse called Hoof N Finz .
The idea was was to create a versatile restaurant that could cater to everyone .
They wanted to set up cooking classes for kids , tying together pizza and vegetables to make eating healthy a fun experience .
As the renovations came to a close this past July , they began filing the necessary paperwork to get their fledgling restaurant off the ground and set their grand opening date for mid-January .
Unbeknownst to the Huguenot residents , the State Liquor Authority ( SLA ) had already placed a lockdown on that site .
" We had no inkling that there were any problems with the property , " said Frank Catalano , the property owner .
" The title report was clean .
It did n't show any problems with the SLA . "
Title searches do not show when there are proscriptions on properties .
The former owner , Wagon Wheel Enterprises , found itself in trouble with the SLA 's Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control in 2001 , according to agency records .

The legal troubles mounted over the next few years until finally the SLA board voted to revoke the premise 's liquor license and institute a two - year proscription on the site - meaning no one , not even a new owner , could receive a liquor license there until April 19 , 2009 , at the earliest .
" We understand that it 's the law , but we just feel that it 's unfair , " Mr. Catalano continued .
Filing to have a proscription lifted is not an easy task .
" The owner of the building needs to make a request to the SLA Board and articulate their reasons as to why a proscription should be lifted , " said Bill Crowley , spokesman for the agency .
" The request should be sent to the SLA 's Counsel Office first .
Then it would be scheduled for a Full Board meeting for a decision . "
By the time the Catalanos discovered this , however , they were too far in to delay the opening .
The early goings have not been easy .
" This is making our business so much harder , " said Mr. Catalano 's daughter - in - law Lina , the restaurant 's proprietor .
" We have two or three cancellations a night now . "
Losing those small groups hurts , but according to executive chef Mike Lombardi , it 's struggles with big parties and the big holidays that have really done some damage .
" A very close friend of mine had a 50th birthday party scheduled for March for about 60 or 70 people , and they just canceled because we may not have a liquor license , " he said .
CANCELED RESERVATIONS
" For Valentine 's Day , we had 23 reservations in advance , and 16 have canceled already .
How can you set the ambiance of Valentine 's Day without offering a glass of wine or an after - dinner cordial ? "
Local politicians have tried to reach out to the SLA to help expedite the process , but it remains to be seen how much assistance they can offer .
" This is a business owner in the community that , because of conduct engaged in by a complete stranger who happened to have run a completely different business there , is suffering , " said state Sen. Andrew Lanza ( R - South Shore ) , who has already reached out to the governor 's office .
" This offends the sense of fairness . "
State Assemblyman Lou Tobacco ( R - South Shore ) echoed those sentiments , saying the situation " defied logic . "
" It 's frustrating how inflexible the bureaucracy can be , " Tobacco said .
" Now more than ever , government should be there as a resource , not a foe .
Mr. Catalano's lawyer is sending me over all the documents this week , and after I go through them , I 'm going to call the SLA and make them justify this situation to me . "
For the time being , however , Hoof N Finz will remain a dry establishment .
" This is really a beautiful place , " said patron Loretta Cassino , a nearby resident of The Tides .
" I hope they do n't go out of business because of all this .
It would be a real shame . "
Legislation passes to create multi-million civilian “ army ” in line with Obama ’s compulsory national service agenda

Tuesday , March 24 , 2009
The Senate last night rubber stamped a nightmare domestic draft bill that legislates mandatory national service and creates an “ army ” of at least 7 million civilian enforcers working at the the behest of the government , while also containing language that threatens to ban free speech and the right to protest .
Last week , we reported on the House passage of the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act , known as the GIVE Act , which was carried with a 321-105 margin vote .
A passage contained in section 6104 of the original House version entitled “ Duties , ” in subsection B6 , states that a commission will be set up to investigate , “ Whether a workable , fair , and reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people could be developed . ”
This language has been dropped from the version passed by the Senate .
However , Section 120 of the bill discusses the “ Youth Engagement Zone Program ” and states that “ service learning ” will be “ a mandatory part of the curriculum in all of the secondary schools served by the local educational agency . ”
This part remains in the version passed by the Senate .
Roles which will be staffed by members of the programs , labeled “ Required National Service Corps , ” include “ criminal justice , ” “ environmental stewardship , ” and “ public safety ” .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Aside from the programs aimed at college students and young people , others will be specifically targeted towards , “ Retired and other former law enforcement , fire , rescue , and emergency personnel , and other individuals with backgrounds in disaster preparedness , relief , and recovery . ”
The bill was rubber stamped by the Senate last night in a 74 to 14 motion , in what is described as a “ procedural vote , ” a move that creates “ An army dispersed to help with education , health services and the environment , ( which ) would vastly enlarge the notion of “ community organizing , ” and allow , as Senator Barbara Mikulski , Democrat of Maryland , said tonight , for about 7 million people to be engaged in such work , ” reports the New York Times .
The Senate will meet tomorrow morning to formally ratify the bill and finalize amendments .
Call your Senator and demand that at least the mandatory language contained in this bill be removed .
References to the program as the creation of a civilian “ army ” have dominated mainstream news coverage of the legislation .
7 million members of this civilian “ army ” equates to about one member for every 50 Americans , a similar figure to the number of East Germans who collaborated with the Stasi and informed on their own citizens during the cold war .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The GIVE
Act is just one of many pieces of legislation that vastly expand service organizations in line with Obama ’s agenda to create a “ national civilian security force ” .
In January we also reported on the introduction by the Department of Defense of a “ civilian expeditionary workforce ” that will see American civilians trained and equipped to deploy overseas in support of worldwide military missions .
The DoD report states , “ Management retains the authority to direct and assign civilian employees , either voluntarily , involuntarily , or on an unexpected basis to accomplish the DoD mission . ”
Though the civilian expeditionary workforce program is restricted to DoD employees , similar programs have already been established for public sector workers .
One such program has seen hundreds of police , firefighters , paramedics and utility workers recently trained and dispatched as “ Terrorism Liaison Officers ” in Colorado , Arizona and California to watch for “ suspicious activity ” which is later fed into a secret government database .
Similar initiatives have been introduced in other western countries , including recently in the UK with the announcement that MI5 is currently training up to 60,000 UK citizens as part a civilian network of terrorist spotters , according to Prime Minister Gordon Brown and home secretary , Jacqui Smith .
In addition , Obama ’s Chief of Staff , Rahm Emanuel , publicly stated his intention to help create “ universal civil defense training ” in 2006 .
In an interview with Ben Smith of the New York Daily News , Emanuel outlined the agenda for military - style training , essentially a domestic draft , aimed at preparing Americans for a chemical or biological terrorist attack .
Asked by Smith about the universal service plan and whether people would have to live in military barracks , Emanuel laughed before responding , “ We ’re going to have universal civil defense training , somewhere between the ages of 18 to 25 you will do three months of training …. but there can be nothing wrong with all Americans having a joint similar experience of what we call civil defense training or civil service in service of the country , in preparation , which will give people a sense of what it means to be an American . ”
“ It will be a common experience and we will be prepared , God forbid , God forbid that there is a chemical hit , another terrorist act or natural disaster becoming more frequent – there ’ll be a body of citizens who are ready and capable and trained – that ’s all you have to think about , ” said Emanuel before smugly declaring , “ We ’re all here for you OK ?
It ’s a circle of love . ”
Asked if the training would be military style , with people wearing uniforms , Emanuel stated , “ If you ’re worried about are you going to have to do 50 jumping jacks the answer is yes , ” adding that the service could be done through state national guard .
Shockingly , the GIVE legislation also contains language that could completely demolish the 1st amendment .
The 12th amendment to the act states , “ Amendment to prohibit organizations from attempting to influence legislation ; organize or engage in protests , petitions , boycotts , or strikes ; and assist , promote , or deter union organizing . ”
As Gary Wood writes , “ Those in support of this legislation will argue this amendment is limited in scope and is not meant to interfere with the rights of citizens to protest , petition , boycott , or strike in resistance to government proposed laws .
However , the people associated through service under the GIVE
Act are considered volunteers , still free citizens , yet it will be unlawful for them to take part in any protests against any legislation .
This is as close to a sedition act , a violation of 1st Amendment rights , as has been proposed in recent history .
A basic right as a part of our natural , inalienable rights , is to resist government .
Our founders not only knew it was a right but it was a responsibility .
This legislation begins to break that down significantly . ”
Fears about Obama ’s plans to create involuntary servitude and domestic spy squads were first stoked in July 2008 , when Obama told a rally in Colorado Springs , “ We can not continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we ’ve set .
We ’ve got to have a civilian national security force that is just as powerful , just as strong , just as well funded . ”
Despite denials that Obama plans to institute a mandatory program of national service , his original change.gov website stated that Americans would be “ required ” to complete “ 50 hours of community service in middle school and high school and 100 hours of community service in college every year ” .
The text was only later changed to state that Americans would be “ encouraged ” to undertake such programs .
Numerous other national service bills have been introduced which target everyone from schoolchildren to the elderly .
They include the Service For All Ages Initiative , the Summer of Service Act , the Semester of Service Act , the Encore Service Act and the ACTION Act .
Regarding the GIVE Act , “ The bill ’s opponents — and there are only a few in Congress — say it could cram ideology down the throats of young “ volunteers , ” many of whom could be forced into service since the bill creates a “ Congressional Commission on Civic Service , ” reports Fox .
“ We contribute our time and money under no government coercion on a scale the rest of the world does n’t emulate and probably can’t imagine , ” said Luke Sheahan , contributing editor for the Family Security Foundation .
“ The idea that government should order its people to perform acts of charity is contrary to the idea of charity and it removes the responsibility for charity from the people to the government , destroying private initiative . ”
Lee Cary of the conservative American
Thinker warns that Obama ’s agenda is to , “ tap into the already active volunteerism of millions of Americans and recruit them to become cogs in a gigantic government machine grinding out his social re-engineering agenda . ”
The passage of such shocking legislation with barely a whimper from political activist groups goes to show how well the corporate media has performed in camouflaging the legislation with flowery characterizations of helpful volunteerism , when in reality the bill creates the pretext for mandatory national service and the creation of a multi-million man domestic civil defense unit who will be tasked with spying on their fellow Americans under the justification of protecting the country from terrorism .

Comment on this article
There is no shortage of discussion about Internet business models these days .
And they almost always focus on revenues .
But revenues are only half of the value creation equation .
The other half is costs .
Let me explain .
Businesses are worth the net present value of future cash flows .
Cash flows means profits basically ( capital expenditures are important but I 'm going to leave them out of the discussion on this post ) .
So a business is worth the sum of all of its future profits , discounted back to a net present value .
For those who do n't want a lesson in finance , you can simplify this theory even more by using a cash flow multiple as a proxy for a net present value .
I like to use a 10 x multiple for cash flow as a simplistic proxy for net present value .
So with that simplification , the value of a business is approximated by 10 x ( revenues – costs ) .
You can focus on creating value by driving revenues or you can focus on creating value by driving profits .
And they are not the same .
Because costs do n't have to grow linearly with revenues .
Chris Anderson wrote a very good piece in today 's WSJ called The Economics Of Giving It Away .
In that essay , Chris wrote :
Meanwhile YouTube is still struggling to match its popularity with
revenues and Facebook is selling commodity ads for pennies after its
effort to charge for intrusive advertising led to a user backlash .
And
news - sharing site Digg , for all its millions of users , still does n't
make a dime .
A year ago , that hardly mattered :
The business model was
" build to a lucrative exit , preferably in cash . "
But now the exit doors
are closed and cash flow is king .
Chris goes on to suggest that Internet entrepreneurs are going to have to get people to step up and pay for something instead of just giving everything away for free because advertising is n't going to foot the bill for every company .
That may well be true and we are certainly thinking that way for most , if not all , of our portfolio companies .
But Chris 's examples , particularly Facebook and Digg , are examples of companies that might benefit from looking at the cost side of the profit equation at some point ( maybe not yet ) .
Let 's look at Craiglist .
I 've heard people estimate that they are doing close to $ 100 mm in annual revenues at this point .
Many say , " they could be doing so much more " .
But the Craigslist profit equation is interesting .
They apparently have less than 30 employees .
That 's about $ 4 mm / year in employee costs .
Let 's assume that they spend another $ 6 mm per year on hosting and bandwidth costs and other costs .
So it 's very possible that Craigslist 's annual costs are around $ 10 mm / year .
Their value equation then is 10 x ( 100 - 10 ) = $ 900 mm .
That 's almost a billion dollars in value for a company with only 30 employees .
The web can do that in more than one company .
Last month , Spencer Ante reported that Digg 's annual revenues were around $ 8.5 m m .
Everyone was saying how bad that was .
And maybe it is , but I do n't know .
It was n't the revenues that shocked me .
It was the costs .
Apparently Digg 's costs for 2008 were about $ 14 mm and they have over 70 employees and are planning on growing that number to 150 in 2009 .
Digg is entirely peer produced .
It could take a Craigslist approach to its business and keep its headcount to around 30 .
Then it might be close to breakeven and could grow over time to a business with $ 30 mm to $ 50 mm in revenue and $ 10 mm in costs and $ 20 mm to $ 40 mm in profits .
Apparently Digg has been looking for an exit in the neighborhood of $ 300 mm .
They could get there with a lean cost structure possibly more easily than investing heavily in new stuff .
Facebook also comes to mind .
Last winter , Kara Swisher reported that Facebook was planning on generating revenues of $ 300 mm to $ 350 mm in 2008 and that it would have profits of $ 50 mm , meaning its costs would be $ 300 mm in 2008 .
She also reported that Facebook would take its headcount to about 1000 by the end of 2008 .
As Chris said in his WSJ piece , Facebook has been widely derided for the low CPMs it generates ( pennies in Chris ' words ) .
But instead of deriding the revenues that Facebook is generating , maybe we should be in awe of a $ 350 mm revenue stream coming from a company that produces no content of its own .
Why does Facebook need 1000 employees ?
Why does it need to spend $ 300 mm per year ?
There may be good reasons .
International expansion can be expensive and so is building out a large sales organization .
But of course , none of that has to happen .
Could Facebook instead cut is headcount back to 500ish and become incredibly profitable and still grow like a weed ?
I do n't know that much about what is going on inside of Facebook and I am not trying to be critical of any one company .
I am just trying to make a larger point .
Let 's talk about the biggest and most valuable Internet company of them all , Google .
Google has one incredibly amazing business – keyword advertising .
It relies on its own search service and deals with other search services and content partners for the audience that drives the keyword business .
If you stripped that business out of Google , you 'd probably have a business that has gross revenues of $ 20bn , net revenues of $ 13bn , and operating profits of $ 8bn to $ 10bn .
That business is worth the approximately $ 100bn of market value that Google has right now .
Everything else is valued at zero becuase it has a lot of costs and no revenue .
Could Google unlock a lot of value by giving up on everything else they are doing ?
Maybe not , but they probably would n't lose much value either .
I am not suggesting they do that , by the way .
But again , I just want to make a point .
The web can create incredibly high operating margin businesses .
Craigslist has an operating margin of 90 % .
Google 's keyword business has an operating margin north of 60 % ( based on net revenues ) and possibly higher .
Could Facebook and Digg copy those models and create a lot of value on revenue numbers that many think are pitifully small ?
I think so .
We have a bunch of companies in our portfolio that have done a lot with very little .
For example , Tumblr has less than 10 employees , Disqus has 5 , Twitter has around 20 , Boxee has around 10 .
These companies are reaching large audiences and creating scale that can be monetized in many ways .
We did n't tell these companies to stay small .
They told us they could do a lot with a little .
And watching them do just that has taught me a lot .
Yes , they will all grow this year , most of our companies will .
But if they continue to do a lot with a little , their business models will be built on operating margins that are very high and can create a lot of value without a lot of revenue .
I think that 's an important part of the economics of the web that are left out of most discussions of Internet business models .
Yes , we are turning analog dollars into digital pennies in many cases .
But we are also doing the same thing on the cost side , maybe even more so .
And I think that " operating leverage " is going to create a lot of value .

To get out of a car without getting shocked by static electricity , either touch something that lets the charge balance out or prevent the static from gathering in the first place .
Most shocks happen because you and the car have picked up opposite charges , so try holding the metal frame as you get out of the car to balance the charge out .
Another way to protect yourself from getting shocked is to touch the car with a coin or other metal object after you get out .
However , do n’t use a key that has an electronic chip since the shock could destroy the chip and make the key unusable .
To prevent the charge from gathering in the first place , rub fabric softener sheets on your seats every few days .

Updated population controls are introduced annually with the release of January data .
The Elders of Zion , the venerable and shadowy Jewish organization that controls the international banking industry , news media and Hollywood , has announced that it is disbanding so that members can retire to Florida and live out their golden years on the golf course .
“ We had a good run , ” said one senior Elder , reminiscing over old photographs of world leaders in his musty , wood - paneled office at an undisclosed location .
“ Maybe we ran the world for just a little too long .
Anyway , now it ’s Obama ’s problem . ”
After a humiliating year left most of its financial holdings , as well as the entire civilized world , on the verge of collapse , the organization has re-defined its mission in terms of bridge games and making it to restaurants for the Early Bird Special .

The Wild Bunch : The Elders of Zion , pictured here in younger , more rambunctious days , are hanging up their fezzes and heading south .
Noted Morris ( third from left ) , " The only thing I 'm looking to dominate now is a Piña Colada . "
The announcement comes after a year in which many of the Elders ’ most prized institutions suffered disheartening failures .
The vaunted global banking system , which lay at the heart of Jewish world domination for almost two centuries , collapsed with astonishing rapidity , requiring trillions of dollars in bailout funds .
The newspaper industry , through which the Elders have controlled world opinion , is in shambles , with prominent papers declaring bankruptcy and forcing millions of readers to form their own opinions .
And , in the unkindest cut , Hollywood suffered the humiliation of losing the Oscar for Best Picture to Indian film “ Slumdog Millionaire . ”
The organization ’s reputation for financial probity had also taken a hit amidst rumors of billions in losses in private Kalooki games against Sheikh Hamad bin ‘ Isa of Bahrain .
According to inside sources , the organization also lost close to $ 1 trillion with disgraced investor Bernard Madoff .
Even before this past year , though , the Elders were facing hard times as they struggled to stay relevant and attract young members .
The organization has tried to project a more youthful image , setting up a Facebook page and founding a new “ Hipsters of Zion ” youth division , which has sponsored a number of singles nights .
But youngsters have n’t been interested .
“ World domination just does n’t resonate with the younger generation of Jews , ” said Marvin Tobman , a professor of non-profit management at San Diego State University and expert on Jewish communal life .
“ They want the fun of fixing the world , not the responsibility of running it . ”
These recent troubles have worried even some of the Elders ’ sharpest critics .
“ I always used to complain that Jews ran the world , ” said Reginald Weber , author of “ Zionists and Zookeepers : The Unholy Alliance . ”
“ But now I ’m starting to worry that nobody ’s in charge . ”
Chunk extraction is a useful preliminary step to information extraction , that creates parse trees from unstructured text .
Once you have a parse tree of a sentence , you can do more specific information extraction , such as named entity recognition and relation extraction .
Chunking is basically a 3 step process :
Tag a sentence Chunk the tagged sentence Analyze the parse tree to extract information
I ’ve already written about how to train a part of speech tagger and a chunker , so I ’ll assume you ’ve already done the training , and now you want to use your tagger and chunker to do something useful .
Tag Chunker
The previously trained chunker is actually a chunk tagger .
It ’s a Tagger that assigns IOB chunk tags to part - of - speech tags .
In order to use it for proper chunking , we need some extra code to convert the IOB chunk tags into a parse tree .
I ’ve created a wrapper class that complies with the nltk ChunkParserI interface and uses the trained chunk tagger to get IOB tags and convert them to a proper parse tree .
import nltk.chunk import itertools class TagChunker(nltk.chunk.ChunkParserI ) : def __init__( self , chunk_tagger ) : self ._chunk_tagger = chunk_tagger def parse ( self , tokens ) : # split words and part of speech tags ( words , tags ) = zip ( * tokens ) # get IOB chunk tags chunks = self._chunk_tagger.tag( tags ) # join words with chunk tags wtc = itertools .
izip ( words , chunks ) # w = word , t = part - of - speech tag , c = chunk tag lines = [ ' '. join ( [w , t , c ] for ( w , ( t , c ) ) in wtc if c ] # create tree from conll formatted chunk lines return nltk.chunk.conllstr2tree ( '
'.join ( lines ) )
Chunk Extraction
Now that we have a proper chunker , we can use it to extract chunks .
Here ’s a simple example that tags a sentence , chunks the tagged sentence , then prints out each noun phrase .
# sentence should be a list of words tagged = tagger .tag( sentence ) tree = chunker .
parse ( tagged ) # for each noun phrase sub tree in the parse tree for subtree in tree.subtrees ( filter=lambda t : t.node == ' NP ' ) : # print the noun phrase as a list of part - of - speech tagged words print subtree .
leaves ( )
Each sub tree has a phrase tag , and the leaves of a sub tree are the tagged words that make up that chunk .
Since we ’re training the chunker on IOB tags , NP stands for Noun Phrase .
As noted before , the results of this natural language processing are heavily dependent on the training data .
If your input text is n’t similar to the your training data , then you probably wo n’t be getting many chunks .
The Israeli armed forces have announced plans to double their existing force of robot bulldozers , after unmanned " Black Thunder " droid diggers apparently covered themselves with glory during the recent Gaza incursion .
An IDF killdozer in a quiet moment .
According to the Jerusalem Post , the Black Thunder unmanned version of the existing D9 combat dozer was developed in secret by the Israel Defence Forces ( IDF ) Engineering Corps .
It has apparently only recently been declassified .
" The unmanned D9 performed remarkably during Operation Cast Lead , clearing roads of mines and explosive devices , " an unnamed IDF officer told the paper .
" The unmanned version is important since if there is a concern that an area is loaded with mines it can save lives . "
The regular D9 , from Caterpillar , is an imposing brute .
It weighs nearly 50 tonnes - reportedly more than 60 with IDF armour - boasts better than 450 horsepower , and is generally equipped with a normal bulldozer blade at the front and a " ripper " delving tool at the back .
The Black Thunder unmanned version is fitted with cameras and remote actuators , and can operated unmanned or with a driver as may suit .
The mighty machine has already attracted negative publicity in IDF service : its use for house demolitions in Gaza and elsewhere has drawn criticism from human - rights groups .
But the IDF think it 's great , and they like the Black Thunder so much that the Jerusalem Post says Major - general Avi Mizrachi ( CO of the Ground Forces Command ) is considering setting up an extra battalion of robodozer - equipped troops .
Chillingly , a Caterpillar D9 starred in the 1974 TV movie Killdozer , in which a bulldozer possessed by a demonic intelligence attempts to wipe out an isolated construction crew .
Those who have read the short story which was adapted for the film will know that the machine should strictly have been a D7 , but no matter .
It 's plainly time to reach a mutual - defence agreement with the 600 - tonne godzilla lorries while we still can . ®
Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami last night accepted Israel 's prestigious literary award , the Jerusalem prize for the Freedom of the Individual in Society , despite opposition from pro-Palestinian groups .
Murakami was presented with the $ 10,000 ( £ 7,000 ) prize , given to the author whose work " best expresses and promotes the idea of the ' freedom of the individual in society ' " , on Sunday evening at the opening of the 24th Jerusalem international book fair , for a body of work including Norwegian Wood , Kafka on the Shore and The Wind - Up Bird Chronicle , which all reached Israel 's bestseller lists .
Previously , an open letter from a pro-Palestinian group had asked him to reconsider accepting the prize and participating in the book fair .
" Please turn your attention to the Palestinians , who are being denied their freedom and dignity as human beings , " the letter from the Palestine Forum Japan said .
" We would humbly ask you to consider the effects your receipt of the Jerusalem prize would have , what sort of message the world would receive in this Middle East situation , what kind of propaganda value it could have to Israel and the possibility of aggravating the critical situation Palestinians are facing . "
The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel also appealed to Murakami not to accept the prize .
Standing on the stage flanked by Israeli president Shimon Peres and Jerusalem 's mayor , Nir Barkat , Murakami said he had given " some thought " to attending , and that his biggest reason for coming was to thank his Israeli fans for reading his books .
" When I was asked to accept this award I was warned from coming here because of the fighting in Gaza .
I asked myself : Is visiting Israel the proper thing to do ?
Will I be supporting one side ? " the Jerusalem Post quoted him as saying .
" I gave it some thought .
And I decided to come .
Like most novelists , I like to do exactly the opposite of what I 'm told .
It 's in my nature as a novelist .
Novelists can't trust anything they have n't seen with their own eyes or touched with their own hands .
So I chose to see .
I chose to speak here rather than say nothing . "
Murakami went on to compare humans to eggs .
" If there is a hard , high wall and an egg that breaks against it , no matter how right the wall or how wrong the egg , I will stand on the side of the egg .
Why ?
Because each of us is an egg , a unique soul enclosed in a fragile egg .
Each of us is confronting a high wall .
The high wall is the system which forces us to do the things we would not ordinarily see fit to do as individuals . "
We are all " human beings , individuals , fragile eggs " , according to the author .
" We have no hope against the wall : it 's too high , too dark , too cold , " he said .
" To fight the wall , we must join our souls together for warmth , strength .
We must not let the system control us – create who we are .
It is we who created the system . "
Previous winners of the Jerusalem prize include Nobel laureates JM Coetzee and VS Naipaul , as well as Arthur Miller , Mario Vargas Llosa and Milan Kundera .
The award 's organisers said they selected Murakami , whom they described as " easy to read , but not easy to understand " , " out of profound esteem for his artistic achievements and love of people .
His humanism is clearly reflected in his writings , " they said .
How to make a cheap Taser - proof vest
by WSQT Guerrilla Radio Friday , Dec. 21 , 2007 at 2:06 AM
wsqtradio@hushmail.com
I was sickened watching CNN footage of people being pepper sprayed and Tasered ( the combination can set you on fire ! ) in battle before the gates of City Hall today .
Pepper spray defenses are well known , but Taser defenses are less well known , so here 's one concept nearly certain to work .
A Taser - proof vest is simply any ordinary vest with aluminum window screen or any other elecrically conductive material sewn to the outside ( so the vest keeps the wires off your skin ) .
You would probably then want to sew a shirt to it to conceal the protective layer so cops do n't just aim the Taser elsewhere like a gun at someone in a bullet - resistant vest .
As a pirate radio transmitter builder , my electrical and electronic knowledge can help me explain how a Taser works - and how a Taser - proof vest works ,
A Taser works by shocking you with a very high voltage , low current series of shocks .
As a result , the diversion of even a small amount of current through anything but your body " hogs " the available current , lowering the voltage effectively to zero .
Unlike house current , the voltage is applied between the two probes and not between either probe and ground .
If you held one prove in your hand , you would simply force that side to zero voltate while the other goes to full voltage over ground , with no current flowing .
As a result , there is no way for good , solid contact between the probes and your metallic layer to give you a worse shock , unlike , say , a lamp cord .
This makes the vest safe to use .
As your enemy fires the Taser at you , the darts pierce your clothing , and possibly your skin .
The attached wirtes then deliver that low current , high voltage shock .
When you are " vested up , " however , those probes must pass between the wires of the screen and probably will tough them directly , causing all the current to pass through the screen and none through your body .
Even is one probe somehow manages to pass perfectly between the screen wires , it will take very little voltage to jump such a tiny gap - too low to give you anything like a normal Taser jolt .
You might still feel that ( and the needles ! ) , but it wo n't take you down .
In any event , using two layers of screen will prevent that .
Foil would work in your vest too , but would rapidly break up as you wear the vest more than once .
I use it in homemade thermal bags for food , and it cracks up pretty fast .
Just imagine all those cops at City Hall next time if everyone is wearing vests and has googles and breathing protection at the ready !
A cheaper way

I just realized that if you cut aluminum foil to match the front and back of a common T - shirt , then coat the foil on both sides with duct tape , you get a very cheap and very conductive Taser - proof vest , though like the heavy vest best suited for cold weather .
In WET weather , the duct tape / foil rig will double as a raincoat !
Shit - tin hats may be the symbol of UFO nuts , but tin VESTS could become a useful tool of war against the cops and their gentrifying masters , so long as they continue to rely on Tasers .
Do No Harm ??

HAs this been tested Or is this just another urban myth about how to defend yerself from the cops ?
If you have n't actually tryed this please do n't suggest it to others to try first .

Why not test locally
by WSQT Monday , Dec. 24 , 2007 at 5:25 PM
I have volunteered to test this , but nobody I know in DC has a Taser or a stun gun to test it against .
The electrical theory here is utterly obvious ( I build electronic stuff all the time ) .
It has NO ability to increase harm according to any electical theory known at this time .
Still , someone should make and test one - borrow a stun gun and try it - then you can ue it in confidence .
Whatever you test should then be mass - distributed .
The lower powered civilian stun guns are much less likely to cause heart trouble , but the tester must still be free of known heart trouble .
With tasers getting more and more common , we need to develop defenses .
What I described is what I will be wearing if the cops in DC ever start carrying Tasers , and next time I have to go to Alexandria .
I have no funds to travel and am simply trying to help with ideas , radio coverage , and the inspirational youtube video made with stills and clips from this site .

I agree that this should be tested before it 's put into practice on large numbers of demonstrators , but I seriously doubt it has any potential to make getting hit with a taser any more dangerous than it already is .
At the worst , using this method would probably be the same as not using it .
It 's very obviously true from an electrical standpoint that if you short - circuit the two probes , you do n't get shocked , but I wonder about the physical design of the probes .
Maybe they 're designed so that only the very tip - which penetrates the skin - conducts the electricity ?
If this was true then the metal screen would n't short circuit the probes , and would be pretty much worthless except for possibly preventing the needles from sticking you in the first place .

Probes cannot be insulated against shorts
by WSQT Sunday , Dec. 30 , 2007 at 2:59 AM
The entire needle and the wire it is on are hot .
To insulate them against short circuits would require the same materials and diameters ( about 8 mm ) used in automotive spark plug wires , which handle about the same voltages ,
Any insulating material that would fit could impose a minimum voltage of a few hundred , but once the arc formed needle - to - screen , the voltage would drop to a few dozen as the arc path became conductive .
Given the rarity of Taser defenses in use and the physical requirements to insulate a 50,000 volt circuit , I cannot imagine Taser even attempting such a feat .
If they manage to do this the automotive spark plug wire industry , the electric motor industry ( to allow higher voltage , more efficient motors ) , the makers of MOSFET transistors ( static electricity can destroy their insulated " gate " ) , and so many other industries will beat a path to Taser 's door seeking to buy the secret of this new insulating material .

What if you laid out the vest to be put on over the head and strapped around the sides .
Lay out the pattern with several layers of tin-foil , and first duct tape the outside layers .
Before finishing off the inside , obtain some thicker tough plastic layer like you might find in binders or of the likes , still minimally flexible but perhaps dense enough to catch the probe penetration , thus ensuring the probes create the primary arc through the tin foil .
Apply the durable plastic on either inside of the vest and finish off the duct taping job .
Would n't that technically keep the voltage from affecting you as there is nothing conducive against your body ?
Great idea
by naturalthinker Friday , Sep. 11 , 2009 at 4:20 PM
As far as i'm concerned your theory is sound , just wanted to check my thoughts with you if i may ?
According to various sources the taser probes have to be at least 2inches apart for it to work , or the current will simply jump the gap between the probes and therefore give no shock ( hence why the probes arent fired straight but at an angle to acheive the minimum 2inch gap when target is hit ) .
Therefore in theory , even if the probes pass between the mesh NOT touching the metal , as long as the distance between the probe and the mesh is less than 1inch at each probe and therefore less than 2inches in total ( which it easily will be ) then the current will arc onto the mesh anyway giving no shock ?
Also , it shouldnt matter if the darts penetrate the mesh and your skin , as the body is a relatively poor conductor compared to a metal mesh therefore the electrons will take the path of least resistance and travel across the mesh and not your body meaning no shock ?
I 'd still have the mesh sandwiched between 2 layers of kevlar though as i would imagine the mesh would get very hot !!!
Also , how thick would the mesh wires have to be and what material , as i would imagine that some materials would simply act like a ' fuse wire ' and melt as the current passes across it and within milliseconds the short circuit effect will disappear and you 'll be getting a full force taser shock !
Am i on the right lines here ?
Thanks all :)

The idea is sound and very good .
I have zero doubt this would work .
I wonder if nickel - plated plastic could be used - the kind commonly used to pack integrated circuits and hard drives .
It is conductive to high voltage , durable and very flexible .
Electricity and Heat
by Don Monday , Nov. 23 , 2009 at 9:19 PM
For the poster that worried about the mesh heating up , the possibility of that is pretty low as heat through a resistor ( in this case , the wire ) is determined by the square of the current times the resistance .
As the resistance is pretty low in a wire ( < 1 ohm ) the current would have to be staggeringly large to generate heat .
Given that the goal of a taser is to be " less than lethal " they rely not on current but on voltage to wreak havok on your body 's electrical system .
The mesh would conduct that voltage away from your body and should do so without any heating .

Guys , if you short those leads , there is a chance that the battery / capacitor will discharge faster than designed ( ok , it will ) .
If that happens , that power cell could explode .
Think of those cheap cell phone batteries .
You could be charged with assault of a public servant .
A simple brine solution on any absorptive clothing will provide a bypass path for the charge .

Mr ,
Considering that the assailant that is attacking with a tazer , which is a potentially leathal weapon .
If the countermeasure where to cause explosion of the tazer powercell .
Any injury caused to the operator of the tazer could be justified as self defense .
If that tazer operator where a law enforcement officer , and provided that the wearer was being compliant .
The use of a tazer should be seen as an inappropriate use of force .
The right of an officer to enforce the law does not nullify the right of a citizen to defend their own life .
The use of defensive countermeasures could only be considered unlawful when combined with non-compliance or illegal activity .
Mr
by Benjamin Pitkin Friday , Dec. 21 , 2012 at 2:02 AM

Considering everything above .
The safest option would be to defeat the probes without completing the electrical circuit path .
By using a stab proof vest .
This would effectively nullify electrical discharge , as well as preventing injury from the probes .
While at the same time protecting the tazer operator from explosion of the powercell .
However , if a law enforcement officer deployed a tazer while I was wearing this .
I would want to make darn sure I was compliant .
Because the next weapon they will use is the gun .

I had an idea , instead of messing with foil , spray both sides of a vest with a thick layer of aluminium spray paint , best to wear layers under and over it though .
Get it looking good enough and people could just think it 's a thermal / fashion thing .

( CNN ) --
The pilot and co-pilot aboard a FedEx cargo plane were killed when the plane burst into flames Monday while landing at Tokyo's Narita airport in Japan , airport and hospital officials said .
Smoke rises from a FedEx cargo plane that crash landed on the tarmac of the Narita International Airport , Tokyo .

Both crew members were American men , an official at Narita Red Cross Hospital told CNN .
Video from the landing showed the plane bouncing at least twice on the runway and veering left as it turned on its side before bursting into flames .
The fire destroyed the aircraft , which was identified by FedEx as a McDonnell Douglas MD - 11 .
Japan 's Ministry of Transport said it was the first fatal crash at Narita , which opened in 1978 .
Strong winds may have played a role in the crash , said Masaru Fujisaki , an airport official .
FedEx Express Flight 80 took off from Guangzhou , China , and crashed at Narita about 7 a.m. Monday ( 6 p.m. Sunday ET ) , said FedEx spokesman Matt Ceniceros .

According to observations at the airport , wind gusts were reported to be between 30 to 50 mph around the time if the crash .
Japan 's Kyodo news agency reported that Narita firefighters had worked through the flaming wreckage to try to rescue two people believed to be the crew .
The news agency said the cargo plane was landing on Runway A , the longer of the two runways at Narita , a major international airport .
The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington said Sunday night it was sending a team to Japan to assist in the investigation of the crash .

WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration , after months of criticizing Wall Street , has been scrambling to woo top bankers and financiers to back its latest bailout plan .
In recent days , in spite of public furor over huge bonuses paid at American International Group Inc. , the administration has concluded that it needs the private sector to play a central role in fixing the economy .

Meet The New Broad Street Bullies
Total Pro Sports –
For those of you who do n’t know these gentlemen , they are Daniel Carcillo ( Left ) and Riley Cote ( Right ) of the Philadelphia Flyers .
Cote is in his second year with the Flyers and Carcillo was a deadline day acquisition from the Phoenix Coyotes .
Both of these guys love the fisticuffs and are currently ranked 2nd ( Cote ) and 3rd ( Carcillo ) in the NHL for fighting majors .
By adding Carcillo to a team that already had one of the leagues premier fighters , it looks like Philly wants to have a 2009 version of the Broad Street Bullies .
They wont be scoring many goals come playoff time , rather they will be making sure that other teams wo n’t be taking liberties with Philly ’s stars .
I do n’t know how far Pilly will go in this years playoffs with their current goalie situation being what it is , however I know that many teams wo n’t want to play them with these two guys in the line - up .
During their first game together this past Saturday , they both fought , much to the delight of Flyers fans everywhere .
Check out the fights here .

The debate about the cause of the current crisis in our financial markets is important because the reforms implemented by Congress will be profoundly affected by what people believe caused the crisis .
If the cause was an unsustainable boom in house prices and irresponsible mortgage lending that corrupted the balance sheets of the world 's financial institutions , reforming the housing credit system and correcting attendant problems in the financial system are called for .
But if the fundamental structure of the financial system ...

探してみれば、無料で食事が出来るところはいくつかあると思います。
主に、スーパーの試食コーナーですが、
日本にはそうした無料で食事が出来るところがいくつかあるのです。
築地を見てみましょう。
先日、中坊進二は築地に遊びに行きましたが、
いくつか無料で試食が出来るものがありました。
確か、サキイカと干しブドウが無料で食べられたと思います。
中坊進二が行った時には空っぽでしたが、
築地にはそういった試食メインのコーナーがあるのです。
玉子焼きを売っているところの隣なので、探してみてください。
他にも、魚を売っているコーナーでは、
いくつかの刺身を試食として食べることが出来ますよ。
なにがあったか中坊進二はちょっと忘れかけていますが、
マグロのぶつ切りはあったと思います。
あと、築地の端っこの方にパン屋（？）があり、
そこでもパンの切れ端を試食できたかと思います。
カレーパンとか売っていました。
スーパーでもいくつかの試食をやっています。
東京スカイツリーのソラマチでしたら、
精肉コーナーでハムの試食をやっていると思います。
実際に中坊進二は食べましたが、すごく美味しかったです。
でもこの後、浅草に行く用事があったので、その場では買いませんでした。
今から買ったら暑さで腐ってしまいますので。
ソーセージは地元のスーパーで買いましたよ。
あと、ソラマチには漬物専門店があります。
そこも試食し放題です。
中坊進二のオススメは、長芋の漬物です。
ちょっと高いのがネックですが、値段に見合った味は保証します。
浅草の 「まるごとにっぽん」にも、試食コーナーは多いです。
地域の物産展が集結した大型ショップで、

こちらも生ハムの試食があったと思います。
中坊進二はそこまで頻繁にココには行きませんが、
小腹が空いた方はこの中を色々と巡るのが良いかもしれませんね。
試食じゃないですが、日本は水が飲み放題です。
公園や駅にて水が飲み放題ですが、これは日本だけなのでしょうか？
海外の飲食店では水が有料なので、
公園に水の蛇口はないかもしれませんね。
中坊進二は一度も海外旅行に行ったことがないので、
本当のところは知りませんが、
日本と海外では水資源の入手のしやすさが根本的に異なりますので、
もしかしたら安易に水を手に入れられないかもと思っています。
仮に公園に水の蛇口があったとしても、
飲み水に適さないかもしれないと、中坊進二は考えています。
Climate change deniers have media outlets ' everywhere ' now Rachel Oswald
Published : Thursday March 19 , 2009
Print This Email This Despite the success of public awareness efforts on the dangers of climate change by the likes of Al Gore and others , the global warming denial lobby is still going strong , as can be seen by recent polling numbers that show fewer Americans believe climate change is a serious threat .
A poll released last week by Gallup says that while a majority of Americans still believe the seriousness of global warming is either correctly portrayed in the news or underestimated ,  an all - time high of 41 percent of those polled say it is exaggerated .
Peter Dykstra , a climate change columnist for the Mother Nature Network , told RAW STORY that one of the main reasons for this drop in concern can be attributed to the success of climate change deniers in disseminating their message .
While they are no more credible now than they were a few years ago , the difference today , says Dykstra , is that they have more friendly media outlets that are willing to broadcast their message .
 [ Climate change deniers ] have an outlet everywhere ,  Dykstra said .
 A day doesnt go by where you dont hear Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck and whoever crying through the national media that [ climate change deniers ] dont have a [ national news ] outlet . 
He added ,  People will go to somebody they like and admire and believe in , and bestow upon them in many cases far more credibility than they deserve . 
Since Gallup began tracking domestic sentiment on global warming in 1997 , American views that climate change was being underestimated were at their highest in 2001 and 2006 ( the year An Inconvenient Truth came out ) .
The poll also saw declines from last year in the number of people who believe the effects of global warming are occurring now , and in the number that believe global warming will pose a serious threat in their lifetimes .
By age group , the biggest jump ( 13 percent ) from last March in those who now believe global warming claims are exaggerated was in the 65 - and - older demographic .
While other age groups also saw an increase , the 18 - 29 segment had no change at all in the number of those who believe claims are exaggerated .
Picking up on this , Tony Kreindler , media director for climate for the Environmental Defense Fund , told RAW STORY in an e-mail that if I were a member of Congress , I 'd be very interested in the roughly 70 percent of voters between 18 and 29 who think climate change is portrayed correctly or even underestimated by the media . 
Joseph Romm , a former assistant secretary of energy in the Clinton administration and a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress , believes that deniers have been working overtime to convince the American public that climate change is n't a threat .
Reacting to the Gallup poll , Romm wrote on his blog , Climate Progress : " Objectively , in the last two years , the science makes painfully clear that climate risk has grown sharply , far beyond what 99 percent of people I talk to realize .
That means if the public has come to the reverse view , it must be due to the messaging and the media and the misinformers . "
He attributed the poll 's changes to the failures of scientists to impress upon the public the reality of global warming and to the willingness of media - savvy climate change deniers to not hold themselves to the facts when discussing the subject .
Despite overwhelming numbers of the global scientific community who say that climate change is taking place at a rapidly escalating scale and that it can be attributed to man-made global warming , climate change deniers are still going strong in the U.S .
They were recently given a high - profile ally in Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele .
" We are cooling .
We are not warming ,  said Steele during a recent turn guest - hosting Bill Bennetts conservative radio show .
 The warming you see out there , the supposed warming , and I use my fingers as quotation marks , is part of the cooling process . "
Another powerful voice in the denial camp is Sen. James Inhofe ( R - OK ) , ranking member of the Senates Environment and Public Works Committee , who in a floor speech last Friday capitalized on the Gallup poll findings .
 You should never underestimate the intelligence of the American people .
Sadly , that is exactly what the promoters of man-made climate fears have been consistently doing , and the American people have consistently rejected climate alarm ,  Inhofe said .
 Despite world - wide media frenzy , Americans remain as skeptical of global warming fears as they were in 1989 , according to last year 's Gallup poll . 
This is the same senator that once called global warming  the greatest hoax ever perpetuated on the American people  and in 2006 compared climate change activists to members of Hitlers Third Reich .
 Im convinced that the denial lobby is really never going to go away ,  Dykstra said .
 Beliefs die hard and evidence is no antidote to a firmly - held belief , and when something happens like with the economy , beliefs -- no matter how flawed - - can gain more traction . 
Kreindler pointed out that the polling measure of people who believe media coverage is exaggerated has been volatile for the last seven years .
Given the attention climate change has received in recent times , and especially now as President Obama prepares to enact his clean energy agenda , its not surprising that we re seeing more volatility as the political debate surrounding U.S. energy policy heats up . 
Gallup noted that with only 34 percent of Americans saying they worry " a great deal " about global warming , most Americans do not view the issue in the same dire terms as the many prominent leaders advancing global warming as an issue . 
This could pose a challenge to the Obama administration and allies in Congress as they plan to introduce , sometime this spring or summer , cap - and - trade legislation that would regulate carbon dioxide emissions .
If the economy is still viewed as being in a tailspin then , the public may not be very supportive of the measure and the national attention it will likely command .
In addition to climate change denial lobbyists , experts also agree that the national recession plays a part in the changing American attitudes towards global warming as the populace concerns itself with worrying about what they view to be more immediate and pressing problems , such as keeping a job and maintaining health care coverage .
Dykstra said he does think the global economic recession will result in serious climate change treaties being pushed back further as badly hurt nations argue that they must address problems in their economies first .
 Several nations , including China , have already pointed to it as a reason to do less and so yes , I m very concerned about that ,  he said .

Bid to impeach Texas judge in execution case Agence France - Presse
Published : Tuesday February 17 , 2009
Print This Email This A Democratic lawmaker in Texas has introduced a bill to impeach a judge who sent a condemned man to his death rather than receive his last - minute appeal after office hours .
The bill , a copy of which was obtained by AFP on Tuesday , called for a special committee to consider impeaching appeals court judge Sharon Keller " for gross neglect of duty and conducting her official duties with willful disregard for human life . "
The chain of events began September 25 , 2007 when the US Supreme Court decided to take up the question of the legality of lethal injections .
That decision launched lawyers for Michael Richard , who was supposed to be executed at 6 pm by lethal injection , on a race against the clock to draw up an appeal and submit it before the court of criminal appeals closed at 5 pm .
With ten minutes to go before closing time , the lawyers called the court to ask for another 20 minutes but were refused .
Richard was the last man executed before the start of a seven - month moratorium .
" It 's one thing for a banker to close shop at 5 o'clock sharp .
But a public official who stands between a human being and the death chamber must be held to a higher standard , " Texas lawmaker Lou Burnam was quoted as saying in introducing the impeachment bill .
Burnam acknowledged , however , that the bill has little chance of passing .
Keller was cleared by her peers in October after a legal battle with the condemned man 's widow .
In the course of that inquiry , a judge who was on duty to receive after hours appeals on nights when executions are scheduled said she was sickened by Keller 's unilateral decision .

As a second generation Irish girl , nothing makes me happier than a dinner of beef , potatoes and a fresh toasty loaf of Irish Soda Bread .
On St. Patrick ’s Day , this dinner is absolutely essential .
I ’ve made many different forms of soda bread over the years , some containing caraway seeds and flax , others containing generous amounts of roasted garlic .
But as my grandmother taught me , traditional soda bread should be simple ; in fact , real soda bread contains nothing more than flour , butter , baking soda and salt .
Why no yeast ?
Because of the Irish climate , hard wheat could not be grown ( which rises nicely when yeast is added ) .
To make up for this , the Irish used baking soda as a leavening agent , which is why the delicious result is called Soda Bread .
I ’ve never been a fan of the versions containing bits like caraway seeds , raisins or currants ( Martha Stewart ’s , sadly , is one such recipe ) , so the two I ’m including and had success with contain none of those extras .
The key to soda bread is to never overwork the dough .
Only mix until the ingredients are moistened and the dough ball is formed .
Overworking it will destroy the bread .
The first recipe is more savory , slightly more impressive and great for dinner .
The second is more traditional and simple and I love it for breakfast with jam ( although it works for any meal , really ) .
Rosemary Butter Soda Bread
Ingredients :
1/2 stick unsalted butter ( I use Plugra or Kerrygold )
3 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 cup old - fashioned oats
1 tbsp sugar ( I use Muscovado sugar for some extra flavor , but regular works well too )
1 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
3/4 tsp ground black pepper plus extra for topping
1 3/4 cups buttermilk
1 egg white , beaten
Directions :
1. Preheat to 375 °F .
Stir the butter in heavy saucepan over medium heat until melted and golden brown , about 3 minutes and remove from heat .
2 . Mix flour , oats , sugar , rosemary , baking powder , baking soda , salt , and 3/ 4 tsp ground pepper in large bowl to blend .
Pour the buttermilk and melted browned butter over the flour mixture .
Mix with a fork only until flour mixture is just moistened .
3 . Turn dough out onto floured work surface .
Knead gently until dough comes together .
Do not overwork the dough ; it should only take a few kneads to bring the dough together .
Divide in half and shape each half into ball and flatten each into 6 ″ round .
Place rounds on ungreased baking sheet , spacing a few inches apart .
Brush tops with beaten egg white and sprinkle lightly with ground black pepper ( and extra rosemary , if you love the stuff as much as I do ) .
Using small sharp knife , cut 1/2 - inch - deep X in top of each .
4 . Bake breads about 45 minutes or until deep golden brown and tester inserted into center comes out clean .
Let cool about 30 minutes , serve , and enjoy !
Note : I usually serve these with a roasted garlic or garlic and rosemary compound butter .
These also work nicely as individual rolls .
And now for a simpler loaf …
Traditional Irish Soda Bread
Ingredients :
3 1/2 cups all - purpose flour
1 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp salt
1 1/2 cups buttermilk , plus extra if needed
Directions :
1. Preheat oven to 425 °F and lightly flour a baking sheet .
2 . Mix flour , baking soda and salt well in a large bowl .
Mix in only enough buttermilk to form moist clumps .
3 . Gather dough into ball .
Turn out onto lightly flour surfaced and knead lightly just until dough holds together ( about 1 minute ) .
Shape dough into 6 ″ round ( about 2 ″ high ) and place on prepared baking sheet .
Cut 1 - inch - deep X across top of bread .
4 . Bake about 35 minutes or until bread is golden brown .
Transfer bread to rack and cool before serving .
Note : Again , I like to serve this with a compound butter .
Also works nicely for breakfast with jam or with a hearty soup .
If you ’re worried the bread ’s not done , tap it before removing from the oven .
The bread should sound hollow .
If you want to add a little sweetness , add about a tbsp of honey before mixing .
Want to make soda bread but do n’t want to make it from scratch ?
Try Hogan ’s Irish Brown Soda Bread Mix or Katie Reilly ’s Irish Soda Bread Mix .
No time to order these ?
You can probably find Bob ’s Red Mill Irish Soda Bread Mix in your grocery store at home .
Finally , while it ’s not soda bread , I insist everyone must try the Guinness Bread Mix .
It requires some extra work and ingredients , but it leaves you with a dense , delicious , raisin - studded brown bread with a complex maltiness imparted by the Guinness .
More akin to a muffin than anything , it ’s delicious for breakfast with something like butter or cream cheese .
Just grab a Guinness and yell Sláinte !

The following is reprinted from Uncle John 's Unsinkable Bathroom Reader Sometimes , tragically , in the middle of shooting a movie , an actor dies .
It 's actually happened many times .
So what 's a director to do ?
Turns out they have quite a few options : Actor : Oliver Reed Movie : Gladiator ( 2000 ) Story : Reed had a well - earned reputation as an extremely heavy drinker and partygoer , and he died the way he lived .
While shooting Gladiator on the island of Malta in 1999 , he went to a bar and reportedly drank three bottles of rum , eight bottles of beer , and several shots of whiskey .
At the end of the night , Reed , 61 , dropped dead from a heart attack .
Most of his scenes had been shot , but for the few that were n't , director Ridley Scott used a body double and then , using digital technology , placed Reed 's face on the stand - in 's body ( they were fight scenes ) .
Cost of the re-creation : $ 3 million .
Gladiator was released in 2000 and won the Academy Award for Best Picture .

Actor : Frank Morgan Movie : Annie Get Your Gun ( 1950 ) Story : Morgan ( best known as the Wizard in The Wizard of Oz ) was cast as Wild West legend Buffalo Bill Cody in the screen version of this Broadway musical .
Just days into filming , Morgan died and was replaced by Louis Calhern .
But in the scene where Buffalo Bill first rides into town , when the audience sees Cody from a distance , the actor on horseback is Morgan .
The actor in the close - up - and from then on - is Calhern .

At the time , he was on a break from shooting The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus , a fantasy about a magical theater show .
Director Terry Gilliam decided to keep going .
The movie 's premise , in which Ledger 's character travels through different worlds , was adapted so that the character 's appearance could change as well .
Ledger 's friend Johnny Depp , Jude Law , and Colin Farrell split the role between them ( and donated their salaries to Ledger 's three - year - old daughter , Matilda ) .

Actor : Bela Lugosi Movie : Plan 9 From Outer Space ( 1959 ) Story : Plan 9 is often called the worst film ever made , but Director Ed Wood was able to hire horror movie icon Bela Lugosi because the actor was 73 , past his prime , addicted to morphine , and up for anything that paid .
Wood cast Lugosi as " the Ghoul Man . "
After compiling just a few minutes of footage ( with no dialogue because Wood had n't actually written the script yet ) , Lugosi died of a heart attack .
Not wanting to lose out on the publicity from having a recently departed screen legend in his film , Wood shot the rest of Plan 9 with Tom Mason , a Los Angeles chiropractor , standing in for Lugosi .
To account for the two men looking nothing alike , in all of his scenes , Mason held a black cape over his face .

In the fall of 1993 , Phoenix ( Stand By Me , My Own Private Idaho ) was shooting Dark Blood , portraying a man who lived alone on a nuclear testing site and spent his time making strange dolls .
With 11 days to go on the production , Phoenix , then 23 years old , overdosed on cocaine and heroin , and died on the sidewalk outside The Viper Room , a Los Angeles nightclub .
There were too many pivotal scenes left to shoot , so producers completely scrapped the movie .

Actor : Vic Morrow Movie : Twilight Zone : The Movie ( 1983 ) Story :
In a horrific morality tale , Morrow played a vicious racist who has the tables turned on him and suddenly finds himself in the jungles of Vietnam , being hunted down by American soldiers .
While filming a scene involving gunfire and a helicopter , the pyrotechnics used for the gunfire exploded prematurely , causing the helicopter to crash .
The helicopter 's blades decapitated Morrow , 53 , and also killed two extras , both of whom were children .
The movie was released anyway , but it did n't do as well as expected at the box office - probably due to distaste over the accident .
Director John Landis was later charged ( but acquitted ) with involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment .

While partying on a yacht off Catalina Island with her husband Robert Wagner and Brainstorm co-star Christopher Walken , Wood disappeared .
It was later discovered that she had tried to leave the yacht on a dinghy but fell into the water and drowned .
She had one scene left to shoot in Brainstorm .
Paramount Pictures debated for nearly two years about what to do , ultimately completing Wood 's final scene with a body double and dubbed dialogue .
Brainstorm was quietly released in 1983 .

Are All Diets The Same ?
No ( And More Protein Is Still Better )
While number of calories taken in versus used will always be the the biggest factor in weight loss , the type of diet can make a difference too .
If you want to lose fat instead of muscle , for example , or if you want to lower your triglyceride levels so you 'll be less likely to develop diabetes and heart disease .
A new study by Donald Layman , a University of Illinois professor emeritus of nutrition , followed the weight - loss efforts of 130 persons at two sites , the U of I and Penn State University , during 4 months of active weight loss and 8 months of maintenance .
Two previous studies had looked at short - term weight loss ; this one was designed to look at long - term effects , he said .
Although both plans were equal in calories , half the group followed a moderate - protein diet ( 40 % carbohydrates , 30 % protein , 30 % fat ) while the other followed a diet based on USDA 's food - guide pyramid ( 55 % carbohydrates , 15 % protein , 15 % fat ) .
" Our latest study shows you have a better chance of achieving all these goals if you follow a diet that is moderately high in protein , " said Layman .
The research was published in the March Journal of Nutrition .
" Persons in the first group ate twice the amount of protein as the second group , " said Layman .
And the difference in protein made all the difference in improved body composition and body lipids , he said .
Although the amount of weight lost in both groups was similar , at 4 months participants in the protein group had lost 22 percent more body fat than members of the food - pyramid group .
At 12 months , the moderate - protein dieters had lost 38 percent more body fat .
" The additional protein helped dieters preserve muscle .
That 's important for long - term weight loss because muscle burns calories — if you lose muscle , and you used to be able to consume 2,000 calories without gaining weight , you 'll find that now you can only eat , say , 1,800 calories without weight gain , " he said .
What were the effects on lipids ?
Although at 4 months the food - guide pyramid appeared to be more effective in lowering LDL and total cholesterol levels , at 12 months LDL levels came back up until both diets were equally effective , Layman said .
" This is the first study to show that short - term changes in LDL cholesterol are not maintained with long - term weight loss .
Most scientists believe that high cholesterol is more a factor of genetics than of diet , " he said .
But the moderate - protein diet had by far the bigger effect on lowering triglycerides , and that lasted as long as individuals remained on the diet , he said .
" Of the two types of lipid problems , high triglycerides pose a greater risk for heart disease .
Approximately twice as many people have high triglycerides , and people with this condition are approximately four times more likely to die from heart disease , " the scientist said .
To ensure compliance , participants met every week for weigh - ins and nutrition instruction .
" We taught participants how to follow their diet , how to grocery shop , and how to prepare the meals .
They also measured everything they ate three days a week , " he said .
" Studies that report there is no difference among diets also report that subjects were not carefully following the diets , " said Layman .
" It 's very important to realize the difference between diet compliance and diet effectiveness . "
The protein diet was easier to follow and maintain long - term , with 64 percent of the moderate - protein dieters completing the study compared to 45 percent of dieters using the high - carbohydrate diet , Layman said .
" Subjects on the moderate - protein diet reported that they were n't as interested in snacks or desserts , and they did n't have food cravings .
When you eat protein , you feel full longer , " he said .
Average weight loss for the protein group was 23 percent higher than the food - pyramid group , with 31 percent of " completers " in the protein group losing more of than 10 percent of their initial body weight versus 21 percent of the food - pyramid group .
Co-authors of the study are Ellen Evans of the U of I Department of Kinesiology and Public Health ; Donna Erickson , Jennifer Seyler , and Judy Weber of the U of I Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition ; and Deborah Bagshaw , Amy Griel , Tricia Psota , and Penny Kris-Etherton of The Pennsylvania State University Department of Nutritional Sciences .
It was funded by the National Cattlemen 's Beef Association , The Beef Checkoff , and Kraft Foods .
I use both vim and emacs regularly .
For me , the most important difference between the two is n’t the modal / modeless thing .
Nor is it even that emacs encourages working on multiple buffers within a single instance whereas vim users generally fire up a new instance for each file .
No , what emacs has that vim does not is its superb handling of asynchronous processes .
The magic of comint
Comint is an emacs lisp library designed to simplify interaction with external interpreters .
Here is an example of controlling a DOS prompt .
( require ' comint ) ( progn ( apply ' make - comint " cmd " " cmd " nil '( ) ) ( delete - other - windows ) ( switch - to - buffer - other - window " * cmd * " ) ( other - window - 1 ) ) ( comint - send - string ( get - buffer - process " * cmd * " ) " dir
" )
And lo and behold , scroll up and scroll down work properly !
Sure , for a trivial example like this you would probably use dired , eshell or even my shell wrappers .
However , in a similar way to expect , comint makes it easy to interact with anything that provides a stdin / stdout interface .
The potential applications are limitless .
In my next comint post , I ’ll show you how to interact with a simple subscriber .

The debate has stewed for years :
Do wind turbines really deserve the nickname “ bird cuisinarts , ” or has the problem been blown out of proportion by overly concerned wildlife conservationists ?
We ’re on the verge of a renewable energy revolution , and the wind industry is anxious to commence full - scale development .
But conservationists are warning that more attention to wildlife impact is needed to ensure that the quest for clean power does n’t do unintentional harm to wildlife .
There is much yet to learn about the issue — why do birds and bats collide with turbines ?
What can be done to avoid these collisions ?
Is there really a problem at all ?
While many studies have been conducted , they ’re quickly becoming outdated .
New research is underway ( see “ To Learn More ” at the end of this article ) , and as we eagerly await the results , we attempted to gain a better understanding by talking to conservation and wind industry experts who have studied the evolving relationship between wind turbines and avian wildlife .
Laurie Jodziewicz , communications and policy specialist for the American Wind Energy Association
What are your views on the severity of the wind industry ’s impact on birds , bats and other wildlife ?
- Advertisement -
LJ : The wind industry takes any potential impacts to wildlife and its habitat very seriously .
When many people think of wind turbines and bird fatalities , Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area in California usually comes to mind , where unfortunately a large number of birds have died .
This facility was the first commercial wind project here in the United States and was installed without understanding that there might be impacts to the raptor population in the area .
Today , we would n’t construct a project in that same area , and subsequent projects did a much better job at considering impacts to birds before construction began .
These pre-construction studies help us better understand how to mitigate impacts and are now part and parcel of the development process .
Outside of Altamont Pass , we have n’t seen any projects that have significant impacts on birds .
Unfortunately , birds collide with many things — often stationary objects — and we are n’t seeing any big mortality events at wind facilities like you see at communication towers .
Even if we got 100 percent of our electricity from wind turbines , bird mortality would n’t be even close to that which is caused by communication towers , buildings , automobiles or even cats .
Olbermann : ' Fatuous , condescending lunatic ' Cheney failed to prevent 9/11 David Edwards and Muriel Kane

The eight years of Dick Cheney 's memorable vice - presidency will be over and done with two weeks from now , but MSNBC's Keith Olbermann remains determined to get in his parting shots at " Crazy Vice - President Gate . "
On Monday , Olbermann found his opportunity in Cheney 's remarks on Face the Nation when asked whether we are better off than eight years ago .
" I think weve done some very good things in the course of the last eight years , " Cheney replied .
" Defending the country against further terrorist attacks like 9/11 I thinks a major accomplishment , for example . "
Olbermann was clearly offended by Cheney 's claim that preventing another 9/11 meant the nation was now better off than before 9/11 , but it was the remarks which followed that really got him steamed .
" Theres no question about what the new administration ... are going to have their hands full with , " Cheney went on to say .
" The new set of problems , if you will , centered especially on the economy ... just as our task when we came in was ultimately to deal with the aftermath of 9/11 . "
" Listen , you fatuous , condescending lunatic , " Olbermann erupted .
" Your task was not to deal with the aftermath of 9/11 -- it was to prevent 9/11 . "
" And if you utterly whiffed , " concluded Olbermann , " on the most important test of all the presidencies in your lifetime , Mr. Cheney , you do not get credit for getting a C on the pop quizzes that followed . "

In 1966 , Charles " Chuck " Harrison , an industrial designer at Sears , Roebuck & Company , got rid of an everyday nuisance — the early - morning clanging of metal garbage cans — by creating the first - ever plastic garbage bin .
" When that can hit the market , it did so with the biggest bang you never heard , " wrote Harrison in his 2005 book , A Life 's Design .
" Everyone was using it , but few people paid close attention to it . "
And so it was for some 600 other household products that Harrison designed over his 32 years at Sears — everything from blenders to baby cribs , hair dryers to hedge clippers .
Consumers snatched his wares from store shelves and ordered them from Sears ' catalog .
And yet few stopped to consider their maker , who at times sketched one or two product ideas an hour at his drafting table .
Giving credit where credit is due , the Cooper - Hewitt , National Design Museum recently honored Harrison with its Lifetime Achievement Award .
Harrison 's consumers were both housewives who wanted something more sophisticated than their mothers ' in­elegant , Depression - era eggbeaters , and their husbands , who took pride in their riding lawn mowers .
They valued aesthetics , and so did Harrison , as long as they did n't take precedence over function .
" If you look at his products , there 's really nothing superfluous about them , " says Bob Johnson , a former vice president at Sears .
Not surprisingly , Harrison 's pet peeve is seeing a bell or whistle added to an appliance , only to have it break or become vestigial .
" If it does n't do what it 's supposed to do or look like what it does , then I frown on it .
I do n't think a nutcracker needs to look like an elephant , " says Harrison , with a laugh .
Harrison 's objective to make things fit in rather than stand out mirrored his own efforts as an African - American forging a career in the industrial design field .
Sears turned him down in 1956 ; he says a manager told him that there was an unwritten policy against hiring black people .
But he found freelance work at Sears and work at a few furniture and electronics firms .
( He redesigned the popular View - Master at one job . )
In 1961 , Sears reconsidered and Harrison joined its 20 - person product design and testing laboratory .
He eventually rose to become the company 's first black executive .
He was also the last industrial designer to leave , in 1993 , when Sears did away with its in - house design team .
Harrison , 77 , now teaches at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and Columbia College Chicago .
He is lenient when it comes to making his students consider what their designs might cost .
" That can spoil a good piece of pie , " he says .
But he draws a hard line when it comes to quality .
After all , he says , " What designers do will affect so many people . "
After barely 24 hours in prison , the Wall Street fraudster Bernard Madoff has launched an attempt to return to his Manhattan penthouse through an appeal for bail which discloses the true extent of his lavish lifestyle .
Documents filed by defence lawyers estimate that Madoff and his wife , Ruth , have assets worth between $ 823 m and $ 826 m ( £ 589 m to £ 591 m ) including four homes , four boats , a share in a private jet and a Steinway piano .
To maintain their properties , they are burning through cash at a rate of $ 346,757 a month .
In a filing to the US appeals court , Madoff 's lawyer , Ira Sorkin , says his client was fully co-operative with the terms of his release before judge Denny Chin jailed him on Thursday .
Sorkin says the judge 's description of Madoff as a " flight risk " is " clearly erroneous " , pointing out that he made no attempt at escaping during three months under house arrest even though he was " always cognisant of the fact that he would die in prison " .
Sorkin says Madoff and his wife have told the US government that they are " willing to relinquish many of their assets " .
Details of the couple 's wealth are unlikely to please Madoff 's victims .
The financier has in effect been living off the proceeds of crime for nearly two decades , having admitted in court that he began operating his investment firm as a Ponzi scheme as far back as the early 1990s .
The couple 's flat on Manhattan 's upper east side is valued at $ 7 m , while a house in the millionaires ' playground of the Hamptons is worth $ 3 m .
A Palm Beach getaway has a price tag of $ 11 m and a property in the French resort of Antibes is pegged at $ 1 m .
They keep a $ 7 m yacht named Bull on a $ 1.5 m boatslip near their house on the Côte d'Azur .
Another boat , Sitting Bull , is worth $ 320,000 while a vessel in Florida described as a " Rybovich fishing boat " is valued at $ 2.2 m .
Madoff 's lawyers say they need constant access to him so that he can help compensate his victims : " Mr Madoff 's contribution to this effort could be severely hampered , if not altogether eliminated , if he is remanded . "
Much debate has centred around what Madoff 's wife can legitimately keep .
Most of the property is in her name and despite her husband 's change of fortunes , she continues to lease a BMW , has jewellery worth $ 2.6 m and plays a $ 39,000 piano .
Rich list
Bernard Madoff and his wife , Ruth , have assets including :
$ 7 m Manhattan penthouse apartment
$ 3 m Beach residence in the Hamptons
$ 11 m Palm Beach holiday house
$ 7 m A Leopard yacht called Bull "
$ 39,000 Steinway piano
$ 2.6 m Jewellery
$ 12 m 50 % share in a private jet
$ 21,717 His current account balance
$ 17 m Her current account balance
• This article was amended on Thursday 19 March 2009 .
We misstated the value of properties owned by Bernard and Ruth Madoff in the above article .
The correct figures are : for a flat in Manhattan , $ 7 m ; for a house on Long Island , $ 3 m ; for a house in Palm Beach , $ 11 m ; and for a house in Cap d'Antibes , $ 1 m .
The incorrect values previously stated in the article referred to the assets in the properties , not the properties themselves .
This has been corrected .
Karl
Rove made a habit of employing this strategy in the salad days of the Bush revolution : draw out the more voluble , more controversial , more trigger - happy Democratic voices and use them reductively , cutting off more legitimate debate with more legitimate Democrats .
Rove had two goals in mind .
Calling out liberal bugbears is like using cattle prods on the hindquarters of the conservative base .
It wakes them up , gets them paying attention , and helps them rally around the protagonist .
Rove was also focused on Americans with fewer partisan attachments ; nothing pulls independents away from the center like an opposition party that 's lost its moorings .
And this worked for a while .
One of the reasons why Barack Obama 's political team is so confident -- " arrogant , " as Rove would say today , in their success is that even while some of Obama 's signature policies are viewed with healthy skepticism , Republicans are still splashing around in a fetid wading pool .
Obama has room to maneuver because Republicans are giving him room .
And while Rove was a master at strategic communications , his lessons did n't seem to stick .
Take the appearances in the public square of Dick Cheney and Rush Limbaugh .
Cheney remains the principle exponent of Republican national security policy .
A lot of Republicans now disagree with the Cheney Doctrine , but because President Bush left no real political heirs , and because no real independent , conservative foreign policy voice has emerged , Cheney 's grumbles echo .
( Sen . Dick Lugar is a voice , but he is not a partisan persuader .
Rudy Giuliani has been fairly silent since the demise of his presidential campaign . )
The Democratic National Committee could not be more delighted to treat Cheney as the primary political enemy and foil .
Each time Cheney opens his mouth , the DNC -- or Robert Gibbs , if he's in the mood -- finds a way to reduce Republican opposition to President Obama 's plans to the words of someone who is very unpopular with most Americans .
( A side note : Cheney , smarter than the average elephant , understands this .
He has his legacy to defend .
He is worried not about criminal prosecution ; rather , if the Obama mindset over next four - to - eight years sets in , Dick Cheney , a guy who most Americans do n't like , will be the Dick Cheney that Andrew Sullivan knows : truly infamous and even wretched ; someone who sanctioned torture ; someone who abused executive power with relish .
Obama 's Justice Department may soon renounce the legal foundations upon which Cheney 's policies were constructed and may even cite the former administration 's lawyers for misconduct .
If they do this -- once they do this -- the edifice will be nothing but dust . )
Mosler MT900S
From all points of view , Mosler MT900S is one of the strongest supercars in the world .
The stock car had a light body kit made only from carbon fiber , a 7.0L V8 engine that develops 550 HP and it could accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 3 seconds .
But one of the clients that bought a Mosler thought this car is not as good as he wants it so he decided to get help from Nelson Racing Engines to improve this car ’s performances .
The owner of this MT900S built a supreme engine for his supercar : 427ci V8 twin - turbo that will develop up to 1800 HP with racing fuel and up to 1100 HP with high performance fuel .
When they took this racing monster for a test on Dyno the car had 1600 HP .
If you ’re interested in turning your stock cars into breathtaking super cars a set of quality wheels equipped with the right tires would improve the car ’s handling a lot and who knows … maybe one day you can make your own Mosler version starting from a regular car .
In case you missed it , it seems the case brought by Savana Redding against her school for strip - searching her when she was 13 is going to be heard by the Supreme Court .
If you have an aversion to horrifying invasions of privacy , please do n’t read the following :
An assistant principal , enforcing the school ’s antidrug policies , suspected her of having brought prescription - strength ibuprofen pills to school .
One of the pills is as strong as two Advils .
The search by two female school employees was methodical and humiliating , Ms. Redding said .
After she had stripped to her underwear , “ they asked me to pull out my bra and move it from side to side , ” she said .
“ They made me open my legs and pull out my underwear . ”
This was , apparently , all done in the name of “ Zero Tolerance , ” perhaps the stupidest goddamned idea in education since “ No Child Left Behind . ”
What I do n’t understand about this is manyfold :
1 . How can you perpetrate searches like this , then send a teen off to history class , where they will learn that the U.S. is unique amongst the world ’s nations for its intolerance of unreasonable search and seizure ?
2 . When did we devolve into a society so terrified of drugs that searching in a child ’s vagina for Advil became de rigeur ?
3 . What exactly would they have done for “ punishment ” had they found said drugs ?
Suspension ?
How would it be seen as a negative for the girl if she had to go home , and away from the hands of humiliation that had just scoured her every orifice ?
4. Supreme Court ?
This had to go to the Supreme Court ???
This sounds like a goddamned easy call to me .
Then again , I ’m one of those bed - wetting hippie feminazis who ’s against child molestation .
Britain 's complicated music royalty system is killing online innovation , according to one of the founders of internet radio service Last.fm .
Martin Stiksel , who helped oversee the $ 280 m acquisition of the London - based music recommendation site by American media conglomerate CBS in 2007 , told the Guardian that the situation was becoming increasingly problematic .
" Where we 're standing , it 's not only more complicated , but also more expensive , " he said .
" It 's an absolute nightmare in the grand scheme of things .
We are further away from a simple licensing model – the sort of thing FM radio has – than ever before . "
Unlike traditional radio stations - which pay rates for the right to play music over the air , depending on the net revenue they make from advertising - for the right to play music over the air - websites that allow users to listen to music are subject to higher tariffs based on their gross income .
These payments must be negotiated and paid to those holding the rights , including record labels , music publishers and sometimes the artists themselves .
Meanwhile , websites such as YouTube have negotiated flat fees to cover the royalties for any music with a UK copyright that users upload .
Stiksel believes that the increasingly complex rules and mish - mash of collection agencies have become so difficult to navigate that they could stifle innovation , killing new music startups before they have even begun .
" It would n't be that easy to start out again , " he said .
" Expectations are different now , and people want large compensation right from the start .
" To even be allowed to enter the club , you have to pay a fee .
The space is radically changing all the time … but I can't see the fog clearing in the short term . "
Last year the situation became so treacherous and confusing that US - based music service Pandora decided to stop offering its service to British users .
At the time , Pandora founder Tim Westergren said the rates demanded by record labels and music publishers were " far too high to allow ad - supported radio to operate " , and that they were pursuing a course that was " nothing short of disastrous for artists whom they purport to represent . "
Calls for a simplified system have gone unheeded by the British government : indeed , the communications minister , Lord Carter , recently announced plans that would further complicate the situation by creating another agency to oversee the enforcement of copyright .
In his Digital Britain report last week , Carter outlined his plan to create a rights agency to seek out and prosecute people who illegally downloaded music and films over the internet .
Despite concerns about the impact of the licensing regime , Stiksel said that growth at Last. fm had not been affected .
The site now boasts more than 25 million monthly users .
Stiksel attributes some of this success to the sale to CBS and the subsequent redesign .
He said the website would continue to branch out in its search for new users .
In addition to its mobile phone applications , Last.fm was working on building its software into other apps for home use .
The company has deals with sound equipment manufacturers Sonos and Logitech to incorporate Last.fm into their devices and more could be on the way .
" I can't go into details but … we are busily developing a couple of things to bring the Last . fm experience to new platforms , " he said .
" We want to be everywhere where people want to listen to music . "
If any of you have ever read British military history , they are always talking about the “ smell of Cordite ” on the battlefield .
Some folks probably do n’t even know what Cordite is .
I recently bought a 550 round ammo can full of mixed WWII era .303 British ammo .
Here it is .
As you can see , it is a “ mixed bag ” , full of old , dusty , and sometimes corroded ammo .
But it was cheap and it goes Bang most of the time .
Some of the ammo is WRA , meaning Winchester Repeating Arms , and it is Boxer primed and I can save the brass for reloading .
The rest is British , Indian , and Canadian loaded , and is mostly Breden primed , and can not be easily reloaded .
But Tman was able to identify a few headstamps and find out where this stuff was loaded and when .
I had always read about “ Cordite ” , the powder used by the British to load ammo in the past .
Instead of normal powder granules , Cordite is made a “ strings ” of powder , stacked into the case like spaghetti .
I wanted to see what it looked like , and thought you guys might be interested .
I broke down a few rounds to see what we could see .
To pull bullets , it is best to first run the cartridge into a seating die and push the bullet down into the case about 1/16th of an inch , just enough to break the seal .
I did that , and then used my vise - grip pliers and a washer on my press to pull the bullets on a few rounds .
Here is the set - up .
Just pull up on the loading press handle and the bullet comes right out .
I found that the Cordite rounds had a small piece of cardboard over the Cordite .
Here ’s a few rounds .
The one on the left is a round from the Indian ammo factory in Dum - Dum India .
The middle one is a round of WRA , loaded with Ball powder , surprisingly .
The one on the right is from the Royal Laboratory in Woolwich Kent , England .
It was loaded with the Cordite that you can see there .
You can also see the small piece of cardboard that covered the Cordite .
I just had to see how this stuff burned , so I took one piece and held it with a pair of pliers and lit it with a match .
Here it is burning .
I timed it and it took about 5 seconds for the piece to burn from one end to the other .
Like other powders , if it is not confined , it burns fairly slowly .
Of course , if it is contained in a chamber , it burns quickly .
That ’s me , burning some quickly .
Conclusion :
Always interesting stuff to learn .

Abstract
Among the many unresolved questions regarding the determinants of violence is the role of prohibitions against drugs and alcohol .
Conventional wisdom holds that consumption of these goods encourages violence and that prohibitions discourage such consumption ; thus , prohibitions reduce violence .
An alternative view , however , is that prohibitions create black markets , and in black markets participants use violence to resolve commercial disputes .
Thus , prohibitions potentially increase violence .
This paper examines the relation between prohibitions and violence using the historical behavior of the homicide rate in the United States .
The results document that increases in enforcement of drug and alcohol prohibition have been associated with increases in the homicide rate , and auxiliary evidence suggests this positive correlation reflects a causal effect of prohibition enforcement on homicide .
Controlling for other potential determinants of the homicide rate -- the age composition of the population , the incarceration rate , economic conditions , gun availability , and the death penalty -- does not alter the conclusion that drug and alcohol prohibition have substantially raised the homicide rate in the United States over much of the past 100 years .
Word Associations Visualizing Google 's Bi-Gram Data
This series uses the same bigram dataset as the word spectrum visualization .
Please refer to that page for an extended description of the data and processing .
To eliminate occlusion , I developed an entirely different layout .
Now , instead of a continuous spectrum of words , words are bucketed into one of 25 different rays .
Each of these represent a different tendency of use ( ranging from 0 to 100 % in 4 % intervals ) .
Words are sorted by decreasing frequency within each ray .
I render as many words as can fit onto the canvas .
There is a nice visual analogy at play - the " lean " of each ray represents the strength of the tendency towards one of the two terms .
As in the word spectrum visualization , font size is based on a inverse power function ( uniquely set for each visualization , so you can't compare across pieces ) .
Common words ( a , the , for , as , etc. ) are not shown .
I was really pleased at how many interesting details get packed into these fairly simple visualizations .
I think they offer an interesting insight into our language and what topics are prevalent on the web .
Warning : the visualizations use actual word frequencies from the web - foul language is present !

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The world 's eighth largest economy is on the verge of issuing IOUs .
Suffering from both a $ 15 billion budget deficit and a multi-million dollar cash shortfall , California is days away from not having enough money to cover all of its bills .
Starting on Sunday , state controller John Chiang plans to delay sending state tax refund checks , payments to contractors and disbursements to counties and agencies that provide social services .
He estimates that the state will be at least $ 346 million short in February .
" Rather than helping stimulate the economy , withholding money from Californians will prolong our pain and delay our economic recovery , " he said .
" Individuals who already are vulnerable will be hit hard . "
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders are behind closed doors trying to hammer out a solution to the state 's mid-year budget crisis and a projected $ 25 billion gap for 2009 - 2010 .
The governor has proposed draconian spending cuts in virtually every department , as well as hefty tax increases , to close the widest deficit in its history .
California is not alone in its budget troubles .
Some 46 states face budget shortfalls , forcing them to slash funding for many services .
But California is the largest state in the union , and its problems are particularly severe .
Its deficit totals more than 35 % of its general fund .
Some 257,400 jobs in the Golden State evaporated in 2008 , pushing the unemployment rate up to 9.3 % in December , the fourth highest nationwide .
Its median home price plunged nearly 50 % since the spring of 2007 .
Meanwhile , the demand for assistance has risen .
The number of Californians receiving food stamp benefits increased by 13.8 % for the year ending September 2008 , while the number of families receiving cash assistance from the CalWORKs welfare program rose by 5.9 % , according to the California Budget Project .
The state 's fiscal troubles largely stem from its heavy reliance on personal income taxes .
This revenue stream dries up when recessions hit and unemployment soars .
California also never fully recovered from the dot - com bust earlier this decade , which led to big budget problems at the time .
So the state did n't have large reserves to fall back on when the bottom fell out of the economy .
" We went into this downturn in a very weak position , " said Jean Ross , the California Budget Project 's executive director .
On top of its economic troubles , the state is also coping with a near shutdown of the nation 's government bond markets , which had allowed it to borrow to cover its short - term debts .
This fall , the state was only able to borrow half of what it needed to see it through the fiscal year .
The lack of access to the bond markets prompted the state in December to suspend funding for more than 2,000 infrastructure projects , leaving many people and businesses without much - needed work .
And because of California 's financial woes , credit rating agencies are taking a dim view of the state .
Moody 's warned in mid-January it might downgrade California 's general obligation bond rating because of its budget and liquidity problems .
If this happens , it will become even costlier for California to borrow .
Deep cuts and steep tax increases
To shore up California 's budget , the governor wants to slash spending by $ 17.4 billion , according to the California Budget Project .
The cuts include :
$ 7.7 billion from public education
$ 322.9 million from the community college system
Eliminate dental and other benefits for adults on Medicaid
Cut monthly grants to low - income families by 10 % and restrict eligibility for cash assistance
Cap payments to attendants working for the In - Home Supportive Services program
Require state workers to take two unpaid days off per month .
" It will involve pain for Californians , " said Jerry Nickelsburg , senior economist at UCLA Anderson Forecast .
The state " just does n't have the money to cover all the spending that 's been approved . "
Schwarzenegger is also looking to boost revenue by $ 14.3 billion and borrow $ 10 billion more .
His fundraising measures include :
Raising state sales tax by 1.5 points - to 8.75 % - through the end of 2011 .
Broaden the tax base by levying state sales taxes on appliance and car repairs , vet services , sporting events and golf
Raise alcoholic beverage taxes by a nickel a drink
Increase vehicle registration fees by $ 12 per car and driver 's license fees by $ 3 .
" The truth is that California is in a state of emergency , " Schwarzenegger said in his State of the State address on Jan. 15 .
" The $ 42 billion deficit is a rock upon our chest and we cannot breathe until we get it off . "
To conserve whatever cash remains to fund education and meet debt obligations , the state 's controller plans to delay other payments or issue IOUs , which the state has n't done since officials failed to pass a budget in 1992 .
This could mean thousands of businesses and millions of people will be left hanging until a budget plan is hammered out .
The controller was also going to delay payments to more than a million elderly , blind and disabled residents who receive the state 's supplement to Social Security benefits , but the federal government said it would cover the difference .
Likewise , colleges said they would make up for delayed student aid grants that would also be affected .
Funds from Washington D.C .
Some relief may be coming California 's way .
The state stands to receive billions from the $ 819 billion stimulus package that just passed the U.S. House of Representatives .
The state could get as much as $ 63.4 billion , some 12.3 % of which could be used to balance the budget , according to the Center for American Progress .
Some $ 3.6 billion could go for highway construction and transit improvements , restarting some of the projects currently idling .
California will also receive billions to pay for education , Medicaid and other benefits .
Schwarzenegger , however , says the state must still work out its own budget problems .
" I always make it clear that we will not use that money to bail us out , because we have to bail ourselves out , " he said in a speech this week .
" I think we have to be careful not to look at them [ the federal government ] as the savior , but to just look at them as the icing on the cake . "
Several months ago , several Coding the Wheel readers got an email from PokerStars .
We at PokerStars have noticed that recently you have tried out a program called " XPokerBot " by " Coding The Wheel " .
We would like you to know that among this program 's features are automated robot playing that makes it against the rules of Poker Stars .
It 's not the first time the PokerStars secret police have condemned a piece of software , nor will it be the last .
The PokerStars Prohibited Software blacklist currently calls out some fifty ( 50 ) prohibited applications , of which nine ( 9 ) are prohibited while the PokerStars client is running , and forty - one ( 41 ) are prohibited at all times .
Let 's be clear : according to the above document , you 're not allowed to run prohibited software even if you shut PokerStars down first .
Whether PokerStars is actually running does n't matter !
Once you install the PokerStars software , your machine , at least partially , belongs to PokerStars .
Of course , the piece of software in question , XPokerBot , is n't mentioned anywhere on the PokerStars blacklist .
But the email goes on to wag the finger of warning :
Please do n't protest that you did n't use XPokerBot , or that it did not actually play any poker .
We are aware that codingthewheel.com has not yet published a complete working bot capable of poker logic .
Even the degree of experimentation you have done thus far is against our terms of service , and can not be permitted .
Therefore , any reply that does n't include something like " I understand that bots are against the rules and I wo n't use or experiment with them on PokerStars " will only delay the re-opening of your account .
However , I prefer the slightly more poisonous version PokerStars sent me , the XPokerBot author , directly :
I regret that we cannot " fail to notice " your activity going forward , nor that of your readers .
We will continue to detect and warn users of your software , to the point of seizure and confiscation of funds from those who choose not to heed the warnings , or who choose to try to " cloak " the bot process by using various methods to which you alluded , of which we are well aware , and through such veil we are able to pierce .
The implicit ( or not - so - implicit ) threat here is :
Do something we do n't like , and we 'll banish you , and we might even steal your money !
After all , you have no legal recourse !
Ha - ha-ha !
That , I guess , is our reward for buying in at PokerStars : an occasional deposit bonus , plus violation of electronic privacy through authoritarian snooping .
And it all happens behind the scenes , without the informed consent of the user — unless you consider informed consent to be shapeless verbiage buried in the fine print of a Terms of Service nobody ever reads :
5.7 . You agree that PokerStars may take steps to detect and prevent the use of prohibited EPA Programs .
These steps may include , but are not limited to , examination of software programs running concurrently with the PokerStars Software on the User 's computer .
5.7 is the only clause under " Prohibited Uses " which is n't given a bold , capitalized heading .
The wording is purposefully vague :
Compare and contrast those behaviors with the definition of informed consent :
Informed consent is a legal condition whereby a person can be said to have given consent based upon a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts , implications and future consequences of an action .
In order to give informed consent , the individual concerned must have adequate reasoning faculties and be in possession of all relevant facts at the time consent is given .
Now ask yourself this question : when you give an online poker site your money and your action , do you expect to be spied on and investigated by their software , in a way that 's never clearly documented or explained ?
Does that sound like the practice of a legitimate company ?
No ?
Because in every other walk of life , collecting sensitive information on the sly from your customers is considered unethical , dangerous , and possibly illegal .
What makes PokerStars exempt ?
Let 's not pretend PokerStars is legit in the sense of " stamped and branded with the word of law " .
That time has not yet arrived .
While it may be legal for you and I to play online poker , the people who operate online poker do so from a position of extreme legal ambiguity .
Party Poker golden boy Anurag Dikshit was recently fined over a quarter billion dollars for his role in the formation of the U.S. - facing side of the Party Poker business , and Party Poker withdrew from the U.S. market two years ago .
PokerStars , smelling blood in the water , stayed .
And in order to protect windfall profits , they 've forced on their users a Terms of Service which demands powers no sane court would ever grant , even assuming PokerStars had a shred of legal legitimacy ... which they do n't .
What they do have , are all the powers of a bank : they manage hundreds of millions of dollars in player deposits , they operate a general ledger , they maintain privileged financial information .
Yet they enjoy zero effective oversight or liability , and they pay zero taxes in the countries where they take the lion 's share of their profits .
Kind of an ideal situation , really .
For PokerStars , that is .
But what do you think ?
Is it ever acceptable for a company to prohibit their users from running software on private home computer hardware ?
Is it ever acceptable for a company to snoop on their users in order to enforce compliance ?
What if the prohibited software is n't used for cheating , hacking , or defrauding purposes ?
What if it is ?
What if the company operates from a legal gray area ?
What if the prohibition of software is completely ineffective ?
Former Sun CEO Scott McNealy once said :
You have zero privacy anyway .
Get over it .
Was he right ?
Tesla Motors yesterday officially unveiled a new prototype electric sedan that the company hopes will hit the market in 2011 , priced at less than half of the base cost of the company ’s troubled Tesla Roadster .
The Tesla Model S Sedan is expected to have a ticket price of $ 49,900 when production begins in Q3 2011 and will feature a 300 - mile range , an improvement over the company ’s Roadster by 80 - miles .
The sedan features a 45 - minute fast ( partial ) charge capability and will fetch a 0 - 60 mph time of just 5.5 - seconds .
The company plans to release 20,000 units per year and to lease the battery packs to their customers , which should alleviate motorist concerns about the expensive batteries dying after just a few short years .
The car itself will be covered by a 3 to 4 year warranty also .
Inside , the Model S sports 2 LCD displays .
One of them is for the gauges behind the steering wheel and the other , a huge full touchscreen in the center console ( image below ) .
The car will apparently be a seven - seater too , with 2 seats folded into the trunk that flip up when needed – though they ’re probably only large enough for children or pets .
Lets hope Tesla can pull this one off , as it could come close to bringing all - electric motoring to the masses at this price - point .

March 11 , 2009 -- Salmonella - contaminated peanut products are still sickening Americans , the CDC warns .
The reason : People continue to eat recalled , salmonella - contaminated products stored in their homes .
Another possible problem : New , potentially contaminated products are added to the recall list almost every day .
And so , like the children 's song " Found a Peanut , " the outbreak just goes on and on .
Most cases began after Oct. 1 , 2008 ; the latest reported illness was on Feb. 13 .
People who fell ill up to three weeks ago may not yet have been reported to the CDC .
That fact , combined with the CDC 's estimate that only 3 % of salmonella cases usually get reported , means the outbreak likely involves far more people than the numbers reflect .
Those numbers :
Nine deaths among 683 cases in 46 states ( Indiana , with 10 cases , is the latest addition ; one case was in Canada ) .
Half of those infected are under age 16 .
More than one in four cases is under age 5 .
If the true number of cases is only 3 % of those reported , nearly 23,000 people may have become ill during the current outbreak .
The list of recalled , possibly contaminated brands now has passed the 3,500 mark and includes pet foods , candies , ice cream , prepackaged meals , fruit - and - vegetable products , breakfast cereals , brownies , crackers , cookies , cakes , doughnuts , salad dressings , and snack bars among other products .
Even though they were recalled early in the outbreak , the CDC says most cases still are linked to two brands of peanut butter crackers -- Kellogg 's Austin and Keebler brand peanut butter crackers .
Major national brands of peanut butter sold by the jar in grocery stores are not involved in the outbreak .
However , some bulk and self - grind products sold in groceries are on the list .
The CDC is urging people to check their cupboards and pantries for recalled products .
If found , these products should be discarded in a manner that prevents their further use .
A searchable , updated list appears on the FDA 's web site .

Strenuous efforts were being made this weekend by ministers , officials , unions and conciliators to stamp out the wildcat strikes now threatening to become a nationwide protest .
Senior civil servants were ordered to an emergency Cobra meeting on Friday to plan the Government 's response to the disputes .
Police , army and immigration services have been put on alert , and mediators are talking with unions and employers in an effort to resolve the unofficial strikes that erupted at 13 locations last week .
And yesterday there were fears that the disputes over the employment of foreign workers at refineries and power stations could spread to other areas .
Tom Hardacre , national officer for engineering and construction at Unite , the union , told The Independent on Sunday : " I think it is extremely likely that industrial action could continue on Monday ...
There is so much frustration in all sectors of industry , it could escalate to other sectors .
That is not what we want , but if there is no solution we could be faced with serious problems in terms of industrial unrest . "
Unite is now calling for a national protest in Westminster .
Such is the concern in Whitehall that , on Friday , a meeting was convened of Cobra , which meets at times of heightened alert or crisis .
Senior officials from the Home Office , Department for Business , Department for Energy and Ministry of Defence , along with civil contingencies experts , met in the high - security bunker room at the Cabinet Office , off Whitehall .
Gordon Brown and Lord Mandelson , the Business Secretary , who were both in Davos , were kept informed by telephone .
The Government 's response to the disputes is being led by Lord Mandelson 's department .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
At the centre of the disputes is Total 's Lindsey oil refinery at North Killingholme , Lincolnshire .
An Italian firm , IREM , which won a contract to work on a new £ 200 m plant there , decided to bring in several hundred Italian and Portuguese workers for the project .
Workers at the refinery felt the jobs should have gone to unemployed locals , and on Wednesday hundreds downed tools .
On Friday , up to 1,000 demonstrators protested for the third day in a row at the refinery , and there were sympathy strikes at the Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland , Aberthaw power station in South Wales , a refinery at Wilton , Teesside , Kilroot power station near Carrickfergus , Northern Ireland , Marchwood power station in Southampton , a gas terminal at Milford Haven , West Wales , Fiddlers Ferry power station near Warrington , Lancashire , and a number of other smaller sites .
The British disputes are part of a Europe - wide pattern of protests .
Yesterday , rallies were attended by thousands across Russia , mainly by communists unhappy at Kremlin policies .
In Vienna , police arrested nine , as 1,200 students protested about " corporate greed and excess " .
And in France , an opinion poll found that 65 per cent thought Thursday 's violent demonstrations calling for more job protection were likely to be repeated , or to multiply , in the weeks ahead .
Unemployment across the eurozone is now averaging 8 per cent , with Spain 's 14.4 per cent the worst .
Yesterday , all was quiet at North Killingholme .
The village is dwarfed by the huge Lindsey oil refinery , the area 's main source of employment , directly or indirectly , for 40 years .
Total said it had given the contract for a new HDS - 3 unit , allowing the refinery to process crude oil with a higher sulphur content , to the Italian company IREM on the basis that it would supply its own specialist workforce .
Such a policy may make sense on a balance sheet , but not on the ground , among men whose fathers built the original refinery from scratch .
Nick Travers , 40 , who worked as a scaffolder on the site for 20 years , said : " I 'm behind the protest 100 per cent .
I 've worked here all my life and people are angry their jobs are being lost . "
Mr Travers 's 18 - year - old son recently won an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering and hoped , like so many before him , to work at the refinery .
His father said : " It 's not right Italians are coming in .
They should be taking British workers on before anyone else , not putting people like my son out of work .
People will lose their home , their cars , everything .
We are fighting for our livelihoods . "
Total 's argument , that the Italians are a specialist workforce with the necessary skills to build the new plant , has enraged locals .
Kristian Creswell , 19 , an apprentice mechanical engineer , said he felt short - changed by his own country .
" If our training is n't specialised enough , they should change the training programme and help us to get the work first , " he said .
Danny Hooker , 21 , an electrician at the refinery , said the Italian workers , who will be housed on barges in docks off the River Humber , will contribute nothing to the local economy .
" It 's wrong to hire them because the country is in a recession , " he said .
" They wo n't put anything in because they will be staying on the barges . "

An especially sore point has been the pledge Gordon Brown made in 2007 : " British jobs for British workers " .
Terry Hooker , 19 , a worker at the Lindsey oil refinery , said : " Gordon Brown has gone against his word .
We feel our jobs are threatened by foreign labour .
There are 2,000 people a week getting laid off in this country and some could do these jobs . "
Frank Field , the former welfare minister and Labour MP for Birkenhead , said : " These strikes are proving to be a double whammy for Gordon Brown .
' British jobs for British workers ' looks a pretty empty promise .
Worse still , it shows the European Union has us in a double arm lock .
British workers are being specifically excluded from working on contracts by European contractors – contracts won by European contractors to operate in our very own country . "
In response , Downing Street said that the contract at the centre of the dispute had been agreed " some time ago when there was a shortage of skilled labour in the construction sector in the UK " .
Union leaders and representatives of engineering construction firms and contractors are expected to meet in London this week in to try to find a resolution .
The National Joint Council will meet on Wednesday .
This will be followed by a meeting of union shop stewards a few days later .
Pat McFadden , the Employment minister , has asked Acas to examine claims that British workers were being illegally excluded from some major projects .
In Davos , the Prime Minister said that wildcat strikes were " not the right thing to do and it's not defensible " .
And Lord Mandelson said : " It would be a mistake to retreat from a policy where , within the rules , UK firms can operate in Europe and European companies can operate here .
Protectionism would be a sure - fire way of turning recession into depression . "
There are no firm indications this weekend of which direction the disputes – and more general recession - related protests – will take .
There is talk of a large - scale union - led demonstration at Westminster this week , which could be a way of continuing the protests without prolonging what are illegal , unballoted strikes .
Angry Brown urges bankers to give up bonuses as Tory leader hits out at ' insult ' to taxpayers
Gordon Brown and David Cameron both heaped pressure on City bankers to tear up their contractual rights to pocket big bonuses this year .
But although the Prime Minister and the Opposition leader claimed the moral high ground , both were accused of failing to spell out what they would do if the City refused to oblige .
Mr Brown was said to be ' very angry ' about reports that Royal Bank of Scotland , recently bailed out by the taxpayer , was set to hand out a billion pounds ' worth of bonuses to staff .
He said executives should ' consider whether they actually receive ' bonuses even if legally entitled to them .
Earlier he declared there must be ' no rewards for failure ' and told an audience of economists in London that he wanted to ' sweep aside ' the short - term bonus culture in financial institutions .
Gordon Brown speaks during a question and answer session where he discussed the forthcoming G20 Summit in London this morning
Meanwhile , the head of Barclays today defended the bank 's decision to pay hundreds of millions of pounds in bonuses .
Chief executive John Varley said they were entitled to reward top staff because Barclays ' made a profit ' of £ 6.1 billion .
The policy of ' no rewards for failure ' would be pursued ' aggressively ' , said the Prime Minister .
He added that banks in which the state now holds a majority stake would pay no bonuses to board members and no dividends to shareholders this year .
Mr Brown said : ' I believe , as a society , we should support hard work , effort , enterprise and responsible risk - taking .
' We should not in any way condone , but should punish , irresponsible and excessive risk - taking . '
He said the Government 's actions were intended to show that ' the old short - term bonus culture is gone ; that there are no rewards for failure , but penalties for failure ; that in the future there must be rewards for success - but long - term sustainable success and not just short - term gains .
Frost on Sunday : Alistair Darling and George Osborne ignore each other during filming of BBC TV's The Andrew Marr Show yesterday
' In the present and future , the no rewards for failure policy will be pursued aggressively . '
Leading City figure Sir David Walker has been asked by Chancellor Alistair Darling to examine what went wrong in the management of banks to spark the credit boom - fuelled recession .
But the inquiry was branded an ' establishment cover - up ' by critics , who claimed the Treasury was kicking the issue into the long grass rather than taking immediate action to prevent the multibillion - pound bonuses expected to be paid out over the coming weeks .
Although Sir David 's findings will ' inform ' this year 's Budget , he is not due to make his final recommendations until the end of the year .
Shadow chancellor George Osborne said it was a ' totally inadequate ' response .
' The problem of bonuses in the Government - owned banks has been looming for months , but now they have set up another review that will be far too late to do anything about this year 's bonuses , ' he said .
' They should stop dithering and act . '
And Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable called it ' a classic British establishment cover-up ' .
' Instead of dealing decisively with the problem , as ( US ) President ( Barack ) Obama , the Swiss and others have done , the Government is clearly playing for time in order to avoid doing anything to upset the bankers .
' The public will be even more infuriated than before . '
Chief Secretary to the Treasury Yvette Cooper said today that executives at banks dependent on taxpayer support have a ' moral responsibility ' to consider forgoing any bonuses this year .
Bonuses had been ruled out already for the boards of banks in receipt of Treasury support .
But she said that , among the rest of the banks ' staff , there were some ' legal obligations that they can't get out of ' to pay bonuses .
Ms Cooper added : ' For those senior executives , even where they have legal obligations , I think there is a moral responsibility on some of these bankers , even if they are legally entitled to take bonuses , at a time when the bank is only still standing because of Government intervention and where I think there is an important issue about needing to restore trust in the City , senior executives need themselves to take responsibility and consider whether they should be taking bonuses . '
That review would consider why banks entered into binding obligations to pay bonuses at all , Ms Cooper added .
Who 's that scary man ?
Gordon Brown laughs as he talks to children at a daycare centre during a visit to Bromley by Bow in East London today
Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme , she added : ' The Chancellor has also made very clear , even where there may be legal obligations , bonuses should be minimised this year for banks that have taken capital from the Government and are only still standing as a result of the Government 's action , because you simply cannot have bonuses for failure .
' It is simply unfair on everybody else . '
Announcing the Walker Review yesterday , Mr Darling indicated that some staff at a bank bailed out by the taxpayer were likely to receive some bonuses , amid mounting pressure for all payments to be halted .
He insisted that ' absolutely no figure ' had been agreed with Royal Bank of Scotland after it was reported to be proposing a package totalling £ 1 billion , despite being propped up with a £ 20 billion state cash injection .
But he accepted that ' contractual problems ' and the right of staff other than those involved in ' excessive risk - taking ' to be rewarded would rule out a total ban .
RBS , now 68 per cent - owned by the Government , is due to report its 2008 results in three weeks , when it will confirm a loss of several billion pounds .
UK Financial Investments ( UKFI ) , the firm set up by Mr Darling to oversee state investments in the banks , must approve any bonus package at RBS or other state - supported banks .
UKFI was itself at the centre of controversy today after it emerged that its own staff , mainly senior financiers and Treasury officials , were set for bonuses if they performed well in managing the taxpayers ' assets .
Conservative leader David Cameron accused the Government of being ' asleep on the job ' over City bonuses .
It was ' outrageous ' that banks which were effectively owned by the taxpayer were considering paying out bonuses from state money which they received to bail them out , he said .
Mr Cameron said small business people were ' furious ' at the behaviour of the financial services industry .
In banks which are effectively state - owned , the Government should apply the principle 'he who does the paying does the saying ' and ensure that good sense prevails over the payment of bonuses , he said .
Mr Cameron said he and shadow chancellor George Osborne had been warning since last autumn 's party conference about the looming problem of banking bonuses .
' We raised the problems of excessive bonuses and bonuses in banks the taxpayer has put a lot of money into , ' he said .
' The Government seems to have done absolutely nothing about it and yet the bonus season and the results season is now upon us .
' It is not so much that they shut the door after the horse had bolted - they shut the door after the horse had won the 3.20 at Uttoxeter .
They seem to have been completely asleep on the job .
' This review is much too late in coming , but I hope that it will be a review that all parties can contribute to , because clearly if it is going to take a year it may be the next government that will have to implement many of its recommendations . '
He added : ' It is outrageous for the taxpayer to put £ 20 billion into a bank only to see a billion on so of that being used to pay out bonuses .
' The Government owns this bank , it is able to make sure that good sense prevails and I would press them to do that .'
Mr Cameron said the banks needed to realise the public anger at the prospect of bankers taking taxpayers ' money to pay themselves bonuses .
' I think that the bankers have to to have a bit of a ' wake - up - and - smell - the - coffee moment ' and recognise ' Actually , hold on , we would n't be here , we would n't have jobs , we would n't get anything were it not for the taxpayer standing behind us ' , ' he said .
' Frankly , it is insulting , it is shameful , to then take the taxpayers ' money that has gone into the banks and use it for bonuses . '
However , he refused to rule out taking donations to the Tory Party from bankers who accepted bonuses .
' I think , frankly , it would be a much better use of money to give to the Conservative Party to win the election and to help to sort out the regulatory mess that the Government has created rather than buy a new Ferrari , ' he said .
Gordon Brown 's spokesman said today : ' The Prime Minister 's view is that , for those people in potential receipt of substantial payments to which they are legally entitled , they may want to ask themselves some quite searching questions about whether or not they should in fact receive them . '
Responding to the Government 's calls for bankers to forgo bonuses , Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said : ' This is a very limp and belated reaction to the scandal of banking bonuses compared with that of the Obama administration .
40million3YearsDM_Full.jpg
' It is a classic British establishment response to appoint an insider to carry out a report which will be published many months into the future when the issue has lost its urgency .
' The Government must freeze all bonus payments for employees of semi-nationalised banks and ensure that the pay details of those earning over £ 100,000 a year are published .
' The Government must create a new bonus framework which ensures they are linked to long - term performance , payable in shares that are not redeemable within five years .
' To protect taxpayers , ministers must plan to split retail banking on the high street from the very high - risk investment banking operations which have accumulated so much toxic debt . '
Mr Cameron accepted that he was not ruling out all bonus payments at the banks which had been bailed out by the Government .
' I am not dipping my hand right into the organisation and saying the people running the branch in Auchtermuchty should n't get a small cash bonus , ' he said .
The Prime Minister 's spokesman added that any legal commitments to award bonuses would be examined ' very carefully ' by UK Financial Investments .
But he insisted that the Government had been taking action on bank bonuses since last October , and that continued now both in discussions with individual banks and in the terms of agreements under the asset protection scheme .
He added : ' The review announced by the Chancellor this morning is about how we move forward and change the culture within the banks .
This is not just about bonuses . '
The spokesman said Mr Brown shared public anger with the banks .
' Of course he 's angry - he 's very angry , ' he said .
' But he 's also focused on ensuring that we can find the solutions which benefit the economy and the country as a whole . '

Glen Beck is a libertarian so the biggest issue which could ’ve been tackled is one of state ’s rights .
Libertarians are generally die hard supporters and against federal oversight into state issues .
Which is exactly what is happening in California ( as well as other states which have already legalized medical marijuana ) .
The Federal government is overriding the will of the voters by use of the DEA .
I think Glen thought he was going to have a fun softball interview but instead got hit upside the head with the the irrationality of US drug laws concerning marijuana .
He does admit however to being a past marijuana smoker himself , and believes that marijuana should be made legal for all medical patients .

' Post - War Myths ' The Logic Behind the Destruction of Dresden
For years , the anniversary of the World War II bombing of Dresden has been a rallying point for neo -Nazis eager to accuse the Allies of war crimes .
But , British historian Frederick Taylor explains , there was a clear military rationale behind the attack .

Security cameras have long been a fact of Scottish life , viewed with relief by many communities and with suspicion by civil libertarians .
But what if they were listening to you as well ?
It has already happened in Glasgow .
Sigard can tell aggressive voices from other loud noises A Dutch company called Sound Intelligence carried out a two week long trial in a busy city centre street .
They stress that their system , called Sigard , does not record conversations .
It listens not to what is being said but how it is being said .
At the company 's headquarters in the Dutch city of Amersfoort , Bram Kuipers explained that Sigard was listening for the changes that affect the human voice in an aggressive situation .
" It 's a different state that you are normally in , " he said .
" You 're full of adrenalin and your voice gets distorted .
You start to scream and you try to impose on someone . "
Identifying such changes comes naturally to the human brain .
But teaching a computer system to recognise the specific characteristics of aggression has taken more than a decade , building on research at the University of Groningen .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Sound Intelligence say Sigard is able to discriminate between the sound of aggression and other , everyday loud noises like passing trucks and car horns .
Kuipers demonstrated this by clapping his hands .
A display screen noted the sounds but took no action .
Then he shouted aggressively .
This time an alarm sounded and a CCTV camera spun round to look directly at the source of the shouting .
Such systems are already in everyday use on the streets of several Dutch towns and cities .
The company said it also has uses in potential flashpoints like prisons and benefits offices .
There are hopes eventually to sell Sigard in other markets - hence the Glasgow trial .
" We installed a couple of microphones in one of the main streets of Glasgow , " Kuipers said .
" It 's working .
We detected aggression and it's currently under evaluation . "
I 'd rather people trialled them in a more open way so that people know what going to be out there
Patrick Harvie MSP
Sigard is one aspect of what can be considered the next generation of CCTV technology .
Other innovations are also on the market , among them talking cameras and systems to detect suspicious behaviour patterns .
But the co-leader of the Scottish Greens , Patrick Harvie MSP , is sceptical of the spread of new surveillance technologies .
" It 's probably fair enough to trial them .
But I 'd rather people trialled them in a more open way so that people know what going to be out there and we all have a bit of control over it , " he said .
He thinks more visible solutions such as mobile CCTV units are more effective in preventing violence .
Meanwhile Sound Intelligence say they have yet to install a permanent Sigard system in Scotland .
But the next time you get the feeling Big Brother is watching you , perhaps he will be listening as well .

The plan to bring forth a new Soviet man right here in America , and right there in Europe , has become a chilling reality .
George Lucas has even called attention to it in his latest installment of Indiana Jones .
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is set in the 1950’s , Indy has been kidnapped by Russians .
Mid film his captor , Col. Dr. Irina Spalko , straps Jones to a chair and in a hush voice surrounded by ambient music she softly tells us what we have become , and where we are headed , and if you listen close you ’ll hear how its been done .
“ Imagine , to peer across the world and know the enemies ’ secrets , to place our thoughts into the minds of your leaders , make your teachers teach the true version of history , your soldiers attack on our command .
We ’ll be everywhere at once more powerful than a whisper invading your dreams thinking your thoughts for you while you sleep .
We will change you Dr. Jones , all of you , from the inside , we will turn you into us , and the best part — you wo n’t even know it ’s happening . ”
Our dreams have been invaded and a frightening reality has been developed .
Our leaders and teachers , none of them are as they seem , they have been turned from the inside , and we have been lead along for many generations .
We are in the midst of a merger of the Russian and American models , a step closer to forming the perfect system of control .
We are being crushed by the third wave of change .
It is not coming , it is here .
“ The First Wave of change — the agricultural revolution — took thousands of years to play itself out .
The Second Wave — the rise of industrial civilization — took a mere three hundred years .
Today history is even more accelerative , and it is likely that the Third Wave will sweep across history and complete itself in a few decades .
We , who happen to share the planet at this explosive moment , will therefore feel the full impact of the Third Wave in our own lifetimes . ”
( Alvin Toffler , The Third Wave , 1980 . )
The first wave to hit us reveals just how long and far we have been lead , right into our current position , and with each wave of change that crashes our bonds grow tighter .
The agricultural revolution interrupted hunting and gathering and quickly replaced it with the domestication of plants and animals .
Within only a few thousand years the knowledge spread to all parts of the world .
How and why the information was uncovered and implemented at such an expedited pace can be debated in theory , but there are few known facts as to what actually triggered the revolution .
The wanderers became farmers , as hunting grounds became farm land , and by the 17th century the second wave began to roll out , change was slow at first , man became farmer and owner , and with it came barter , money and bondage .
Since then we have been even more hurried through time , the industrial revolution was realized in hundreds of years , as opposed to thousands .
The crushing changes of the second wave were directly aimed at our families , although several families managed to fare quite well through the assault .
Toffler wrote that just like the first wave , “ historians cannot pin down the ‘ cause ’ of the industrial revolution ” ( The Third Wave , p. 358 ) , however we can see those that were involved in shaping the minds of men throughout it .
Industry drove people from the farm , and as families began moving closer to factories , children would no longer work as they did on the farms , an acceptable solution was mass education and it was ushered in .
Toffler points out in The Third Wave , that school was to train children to become good factory workers , punctual , obedient people who can complete mundane tasks repetitively for eight hours a day , which is true , but that describes only half the purpose , mass education was , and still is , much worse than that .
“ … place our thoughts into the minds of your leaders , make your teachers teach the true version of history … ”
In 1954 the Reece Committee [ see “ How America Took Up Where Russia Left Off ” ] investigated the inner workings of tax exempt foundations , such as those run by the Carnegie , Rockefeller and Ford families .
The investigation was brought forth in part because of growing suspicion that these organizations were “ un-American . ”
It was ultimately revealed that these tax exempt foundations were working in tandem , using foundation money to meddle with our minds .
They needed to change our way of thinking , and using the power and influence of their organizations , they promote the idea of global government .
One important way to capture and control us ( “ the enemy ” ) was uncovered , get us young and vulnerable , and teach us to love our servitude .
“… We ’ll be everywhere at once more powerful than a whisper invading your dreams , thinking your thoughts for you while you sleep … ”
America was being slowly lead down a path of collectivism .
One report uncovered by the Reece committee summarized the third wave we were sleepwalking into ( it was from the American Historical Foundation , est. in 1889 ) as “ the day of the individual in the United States of America had come to an end , and that the future would be characterized , inevitably , by some form of collectivism … ”
… We will change you … all of you , from the inside , we will turn you into us , and the best part — you wo n’t even know it ’s happening . ”
The harsh changes of the third wave are aimed at the individual , and the Reece Committee was not the only proof of the war on for our minds .
Former KGB propagandist , Yuri Bezmenov , revealed soviet secrets of psychic warfare that were not only introduced to children by their teachers , but also spread through Hollywood by various artists ( directors , writers , actors , poets , musicians , painters … ) and pushed ahead by government leaders , and the press .
They are all working against the individual , knowingly and unknowingly , in an attempt change our perception of reality .
America has been attacked from the inside , through Soviet ideological warfare .
“ It ’s not a matter of what is true that counts but a matter of what is preceived to be true . ” ( Henry Kissinger . )
Yuri Bezmenov has given some insight as to how effortless brainwashing an entire society can be .
First the people must be demoralized , and that can take about fifteen years to indoctrinate a single generation , and when they are grown they will lead the next generation , parroting the doctrine .
Once the majority has been reprogrammed they will react properly to the planned destabilization , and accept the Stalin or Lenin type leaders that will rise .
Then a generated crisis will be used to make people more agreeable , and finally , normalization ( which may never end ) , making the brainwashed society find normalcy in a way of life that no one of sound mind would ever willingly accept .
We have been lead through these waves of change for many generations , and have ourselves endured life long doses of brainwash .
Many have been changed and the plans to turn us into a collective are nearing completion , a brave new world awaits us .
It is up to those who have refused to be demoralized and have managed to hold on to their conscience to bring the truth forward .
Fight the globalist plan to destroy the individual , stop the birth of the collective or prepare to suffer total enslavement .
Eternal Resistance to Tyranny !
Zimbabwe 's prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , has taken an important step toward establishing the new power - sharing government 's credibility by fulfilling a commitment to pay the army and other public - sector workers in dollars because the national currency is worthless .
Foreign diplomats had questioned whether Tsvangirai would be able to find the estimated $ 100 m ( £ 70 m ) required to meet the public sector 's 130,000 - person payroll given the dire state of Zimbabwe 's economy .
But the new finance minister , Tendai Biti , said he had " juggled " the books and soldiers have received $ 100 each .
Civil servants , teachers , doctors and nurses will all have been paid a similar amount by the end of the week .
Although relatively low compared to what Zimbabwean professionals used to earn , $ 100 is a small fortune against the near worthless wages they had been receiving .
Teachers were paid several trillion Zimbabwe dollars a month but inflation , which is above 10 sextillion ( 10 billion trillion ) percent , wiped out the currency 's value .
Almost all shops in Zimbabwe now accept payment only in US dollars or South African rand .
Biti told a press conference that the hard currency payments are intended to get schools and hospitals functioning again after many teachers and health staff stopped going to work because they were paid so little , in many cases not enough to cover the transport costs of getting there .
Many government workers have also been unable to feed their families and are among 7 million Zimbabweans , about two - thirds of the population remaining in the country , reliant on foreign food aid .
" We have to get Zimbabwe working again ; getting teachers to school is part of efforts to get Zimbabwe to work again , having examination papers being marked is part of having Zimbabwe work again , " Biti said .
Tsvangirai had appealed to civil servants to return to work on Monday .
A Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) official said that some did but that the numbers at work today have risen with the payments – although it is feared that many have fled abroad in search of employment , particularly to South Africa .
The US dollar pay will be particularly important in winning support among the rank and file of the military for Tsvangirai 's authority over the new administration in which Robert Mugabe remains president and both men oversee the cabinet .
The military service chiefs have been particularly hostile to the MDC leader 's inclusion in the government but it may be more difficult for them to move against him if the ordinary soldiers stand to lose .
Biti also scrapped expensive licenses for shops to do business in foreign currency .
But he has previously said that the use of US dollars and rand is a temporary measure and has dismissed a proposal by some in Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party for Zimbabwe to adopt the South African currency permanently .
For now , though , the Zimbabwe dollar is a pariah currency .
The country 's dilapidated power and water utilities have started charging in US dollars .
Even the state - run Herald newspaper , which continues to be highly partisan toward Mugabe , can only be bought using foreign currency except at its head office , where it costs Z$ 1tn .
Biti said that the free use of hard currency should curb inflation .
" Now that the country has embraced the use of multiple currencies which are relatively stable , the government expects all businesses to act responsibly on pricing ... in order to create the necessary confidence in the economy . "
MORE than 60 years after Adolf Hitler died , the details of his private life still grip the public imagination .
Some additional glimpses emerged from a British intelligence report sold last week by the English auction house Mullock’s .
Written by an unnamed British agent and dated May 3 , 1945  three days after Hitler ’s death  it summarizes the interrogation of a German lieutenant colonel who was a staff member at Hitler ’s headquarters in Berlin during World War II .
Known only as “ PW ” ( prisoner of war ) , he had observed Hitler at close quarters , dining with him at least 30 times .
Excerpts from the intelligence summary , which sold for about $ 2,900 to a collector , follow .

The lieutenant colonel told his interrogator that Hitler was a creature of habit .
“ Hitler gets up at about 11 or 11:30 in the morning .
Half an hour later the first reports and briefings are given to him in the operations room of the Führerhauptquartier .
At approx 1400 he eats a frugal meal and then takes his post - prandial nap of about an hour ’s duration .
He again returns to the operations room and continues to receive reports , briefings ; various plans are discussed . ”

At about 8 p.m. , Hitler and his entourage would dine .
“ While this is the main meal , it is as simple as one could imagine .
Hitler ’s repast usually consists of some vegetable stew , followed by stewed fruit as dessert .
This he tops with one or two glasses of beer ( the extent of his alcoholic indulgence ) .
Hitler eats rapidly , mechanically .
For him food is merely an indispensable means of subsistence .
In the course of a few minutes he is finished , but the entire meal usually lasts two hours . ”

Hitler was not one for chitchat .
“ All members of the table engage in general topics of conversation .
Quite often Hitler will sit there throughout the entire meal , turned to his own thoughts , seemingly without listening to the talk going on around him .
However , he does follow the conversation vaguely , to him the conversation seems to have the effect that music has on others : it stimulates his thoughts and relaxes him .
He talks in a mellow baritone , without that raucous , unpleasant stridency of his public speeches . ”

We will be there and tell you all about it , like always .
Someone must have traduced Ryan S. , for without having done anything wrong , he was informed one fine evening that several of his old blog posts had been deleted .
Dealing with aggressive music industry copyright cops is nothing new for music bloggers like Ryan Spaulding , proprietor of Ryan 's Smashing Life , who routinely posts MP3s provided by band publicists for promotional purposes .
What is new , as the LA Weekly reported last month , is that Blogger now appears to be pulling posts without advance notice .
But even when a poster is finally notified , Ars has learned , Blogger appears to be skirting its own stated policy for dealing with takedown notices under the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act , providing such scant information that writers may have little realistic hope of availing themselves of the remedies provided by statute .
DMCA and the vanishing posts
Anecdotal evidence suggests that in recent months Google has switched from a policy of notifying users of takedown notices , giving them a opportunity to remove content themselves , to one of automatically pulling flagged posts .
First , it 's necessary to understand a bit about the way the DMCA works .
The 1998 law sought to protect Internet Service Providers from potentially crippling lawsuits alleging " contributory " or " vicarious " copyright infringement by creating " safe harbors " that immunize providers for user conduct .
But to be eligible for the " safe harbors , " providers must also comply with certain requirements , such as acting " expeditiously " to respond to " cease and desist " or " takedown " notices from copyright owners identifying infringing content .
If a user believes his content has been removed erroneously , he can file a counternotice , at which point the provider is supposed to restore the content ( though not strictly obligated to do so ) unless the copyright holder responds by stating its intention to file an infringement suit against the user .
Google — which owns Blogger — has pretty steadfastly refused to discuss its policy for handling DMCA takedown notices , referring all inquiries to a posted policy and asserting that the company removes content only when " legally appropriate . "
Anecdotal evidence , however , suggests that in recent months it has switched from a policy of notifying users of takedown notices , giving them a opportunity to remove content themselves , to one of automatically pulling flagged posts .
( Sources at the company say that — unlike Google 's YouTube , which makes use of automatic copyright " fingerprinting " and filtering software — Blogger removes content only in response to formal C&D notices . )
That grates on writers like Spaulding , who complain that the new policy ends up deleting their own intellectual property : the reviews or commentary that may accompany an MP3 track marked for removal .
Worse , it means readers who follow links to old posts and find nothing but an error page may conclude the blog is defunct .
Copyright on a borderless network
A post about Those Darlins was mysteriously removed
" Cry me a river , " you might say , if the affected bloggers were all simply pirates .
But many musicbloggers have now entered established symbiotic relationships with artists ' publicity teams , receiving press releases urging them to post sample tracks that labels make available in order to drum up attention for new bands or releases .
Just this weekend , Spaulding lost another post , touting the band Those Darlins , which the band was so pleased with that they saw fit to link it from their MySpace page .
So why are bloggers being targeted for posting legitimate , band - approved tracks ?
Part of the problem is that the complaints sometimes come from international rights holders or their representatives , such as the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry , an aggressive user of C&D notices .
The US rights holder may have provided the track , says Spaulding , but " people in England or Frankfurt are saying we do n't recognize your ability to give away that music . "
According to Fred von Lohmann , an intellectual property attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation , this presents an " unsettled question " for both bloggers and providers .
" Many countries , including the UK , have a ' making available ' right for copyright owners , " says von Lohmann .
" As a result , those copyright owners frequently argue that anything that can be accessed in their country violates their rights .
I think that 's wrong — the making available right is territorial , just like every other copyright interest , and so it only applies if someone is making the work available in the UK ( i.e. , the server is in the UK ) .
But I do n't think any courts have definitively ruled on this issue . "
Blogger 's bind
Analysis of the DMCA statute itself , coupled with interviews with copyright holders who make use of its takedown provisions , provides some insight into why Google may have moved to a " takedown first , notify second " approach .
For Shawn Gordon of Prog Rock records , who actively polices the Internet for piracy , the problem is not that Google is too quick to remove infringing content , but too lax : he complains that he 'll identify a post linking to one of his label 's releases , only to hear that the link has been removed — and then find it restored a few days later .
This presents a potentially tricky legal problem for Google .
Typically , both licit and illicit music content is not hosted on the company 's own servers , but on some third - party host , possibly located overseas , such as Rapidshare .
And someone searching for MP3s generally wo n't immediately get results pointing directly to the hosted content , but rather to a blog post or discussion forum containing a link .
Removing the actual content , then , is often a futile game of whack - a- mole for labels , because a file that 's pulled from Rapidshare is likely to pop up on Mediafire or Megaupload minutes later .
What matters , from the label 's perspective , is whether a link to the file can be easily found by users on a page that shows up prominently in search results for a band or song .
And because high - ranking search results draw plenty of user eyeballs , a dead link on a prominent blog post is likely to be quickly supplemented by a replacement link to another host in the comments .
Google , therefore , may find itself squeezed between two DMCA provisions : one covering content hosted " at the direction of users , " and another covering liability for hyperlinks to infringing content .
In theory , the safe harbor for hyperlinks is supposed to apply unless a ISP has been notified to disable access to a specific link .
But for user - posted content , only a link to the URL where the infringing content is available is required .
Moreover , while ISPs have no affirmative duty to monitor their servers for infringing content , they lose their safe harbor when infringement on a site is supposed to be " readily apparent . "
Exactly what that requires is not itself " readily apparent " — as legal scholar Edward Lee notes in a recent paper , the scant amount of actual DMCA litigation has been " both a blessing and a curse , " because it has allowed a variety of online speech to flourish , but left many DMCA legal obligations ambiguous .
Blogger may reasonably fear that if it lets a user pull content in response to a C&D , it will forfeit their safe harbor if the copyright holder later returns to find a new link posted to the infringing content .
That fear may be especially pressing because Google , with its fixed address and deep - pockets , is a tempting target for a suit alleging large - scale vicarious infringement , more so if the individual bloggers are often both pseudonymous and penurious .

Isolongifolenone , a natural compound found in the Tauroniro tree ( Humiria balsamifera ) of South America , has been found to effectively deter biting of mosquitoes and to repel ticks , both of which are known spreaders of diseases such as malaria , West Nile virus , and Lyme disease .
Derivatives of isolongifolenone have been widely and safely used as fragrances in cosmetics , perfumes , deodorants , and paper products , and new processing methods may make it as cheap to produce as DEET .
The authors found that isolongifolenone deters the biting of the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti ( L. ) and Anopheles stephensi Liston more effectively than the widely used synthetic chemical repellent N , N - diethyl - 3 - methyl benzamide ( DEET ) in laboratory bioassays .
Furthermore , it repelled blacklegged ticks and lone star ticks as effectively as DEET .
Since “ isolongifolenone is easily synthesized from inexpensive turpentine oil feedstock , ” the authors write , “ we are therefore confident that the compound has significant potential as an inexpensive and safe repellent for protection of large human populations against blood - feeding arthropods . ”
In addition , a new , patented method developed by the authors to efficiently produce isolongifolenone would make it even more cost effective .

Advertisement A big increase in the number of " cannabis factories " discovered by police has been revealed .
Figures show rises since 2004 of 174 to 672 finds in the West Midlands , zero to 53 in North Wales , and zero to seven for Scotland 's Northern Constabulary .
Thirty police forces in England , Scotland and Wales responded to Freedom of Information requests from BBC News .
Organised criminal gangs , many from south - east Asia , are responsible for the rise , police believe .
The Home Office said high detection rates were an " encouraging sign " .
Senior officers , government officials and other law enforcement agencies gathered on Tuesday to discuss ways of implementing a new national strategy to help police close the factories down .
Drugs raids
Forces use different definitions for what scale of production they consider to be a cannabis " factory " .
But , whatever criteria they use , all but one of the 30 forces showed significant increases over the five - year period .
Gwent Police said in the past five years the number of " factories " it uncovered rose from five to 151 , while Staffordshire saw a rise from 31 to 74 from 2006 to 2008 , although some of those finds involved only a few plants .
The Metropolitan Police hit a peak of 648 in 2005 / 06 , but numbers have declined since then .
During an operation in Cambridgeshire last week , police officers raided two houses and arrested three men on suspicion of cultivating cannabis .
They recovered and destroyed 800 cannabis plants with a street value of over £ 500,000 .
We are determined to make this country a hostile place for criminals involved in cannabis cultivation
Home Office spokesman Drugs intelligence officer Gavin Guy , who was in charge of the raid , said that all the plants they recovered from such factories were known as " skunk " - cannabis with high levels of tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , which makes the drug more potent .
" If we have one cannabis plant here and it's gone to fruition and it's produced two ounces of cannabis , that is supplying 16 people in this area with their £ 20 - worth of drugs , " he said .
When he began five years ago , he uncovered one cannabis factory in the first 12 months .
Last week 's raid was the fourth factory discovered in his division in a week .
He expects to raid about 40 every year .
Booby traps Energy company EDF estimates that it is called to shut power off at more than 500 cannabis factories every year .
Many are booby - trapped to keep out the police and rival gangs .
" There are quite a few systems they use , the most common is the electrification of door handles and windows .
Electrocution is a real risk , " said Garry Millington , a fire investigations officer with London Fire Brigade .
Although 10 years ago the vast majority of cannabis in the UK was imported , charity Drugscope believes that today more than 90 % is grown in this country .
So far there has not been a nationally co-ordinated crackdown on these illegal factories .
A Home Office spokesman said : " We are determined to make this country a hostile place for criminals involved in cannabis cultivation .
" The high levels of detection of cannabis farms , as revealed in these figures , are an encouraging sign and demonstrate our commitment to catching those who bring cannabis onto our streets .
" Alongside the appointment of a full - time co-ordinator , the National Policing Improvement Agency will soon be publishing guidance for enforcement agencies to help tackle the commercial cultivation of cannabis . "

I ’ve been doing a lot of work on Continuous LINQ ( CLINQ ) , and by that I mean I ’ve written 90 % of version 2.0 .
CLINQ is being developed for a large scale and real life WPF application that must be robust and high performance .
I plan to post quite a bit about the internals if I do n’t get lazy .
I ’ve had to put in so much trickery and ran into so many esoteric things that I figure passing the learning on would be worthwhile .
Kevin Hoffman , the project administrator , and my partner in crime for CLINQ posted about my original implementation for weak events early on in the development of CLINQ 2.0 .
In a WPF application , INotify Property Changed is king .
All objects must implement it in order to be consumed by the UI .
There ’s lots more to discuss about this interface that I ’ll save for other blog posts .
For now , what ’s important is how WPF utilizes this interface .
Whenever a property on an object is data bound to control in WPF , the control must know when the value of that property changes in order to update the UI .
This may sound straight forward , since INotifyProperty Changed exposes the Property Changed event .
WPF must just subscribe to Property Changed and be on its merry way , right ?
I ’m sure the WPF dev team wished it were that easy , as we all did , when we realized that the C# event model is a recipe for memory leaks .
Whenever you subscribe to an event , you must unsubscribe from that event or else the subscriber runs the risk of leaking .
For more information , and an excellent write up of this problem and solutions see this article on code project : Weak Events in C#.
I used one of the solutions here for CLINQ , but I ’ll get to that in a minute .
To avoid event based memory leaks , the WPF team came up with the WeakEventManager pattern .
For listening to Property Changed events , they specifically implemented the PropertyChangedEventManager .
Any system that must manage subscriptions is basically a smart cache , and two level lookup table .
A subscriber wishes to listen to for a specific property change on a specific object .
For example , imagine a TextBlock that is bound to the Age property on an object of type Person .
The manager first needs to keep a lookup table keyed off the monitored object to another table that is keyed off the name of the property .
You can think of it like this :
Dictionary <INotifyPropertyChanged , Dictionary < string , List < IWeakEventListener >>>
This is all well and good but it leads to the requirements of PropertyChangedEventManager , where each listener must implement the IWeakEventManager interface , which is awesome .
( By awesome , I mean not .
Why should your objects be concerned with such things ? )
Now that we have this cache which stores each entry as a WeakReference , we need to somehow clean up this cache as objects get garbage collected .
This is where things start sucking .
For CLINQ we could be monitoring thousands of property changes per second , and if the event management system cleans up too often , then perf goes down the drain .
When I loaded our app in a profiler , I noticed that 30 % of our CPU time was being spent in the PropertyChangedEventManager ’s cleanup code .
It appears that subscribing or unsubscribing from any single object causes them to “ schedule ” a clean up .
This means PropertyChangedEventManger does a BeginInvoke on the UI thread that walks the whole cache looking for dead WeakReferences .
For WPF alone it appears to do the job okay , but as CLINQ ’s bread and butter is to listen to specific property changes on specific objects that are being added and removed from collections constantly , PropertyChangedEventManager chokes and dies .
Before I describe the replacement , I have two people to thank : Daniel Grunwald on the aforementioned Code Project article on weak events , and the author of the WeakDictionary , Nick Guerrera .
The replacement is called WeakPropertyChangedEventManager , and handles things quite a bit differently .
First , there is still a cache :
WeakDictionary <INotifyPropertyChanged , WeakEventBridge >
This keeps track of what objects are being monitored for property changes .
Each object has one WeakEventBridge which is a tiny wrapper that does two things .
First , it follows the Reusable Wrapper approach from Grunwald , in that WeakEventBridge could technically leak .
This only happens the property changed event never fires again and the listeners have not unsubscribed .
Lame ?
Not really .
Property Changed fires all the time , and if a listener has been garbage collected the WeakEventBridge will clean up its subscriptions very quickly .
Also , the listeners still can still explicitly unsubscribe which is what CLINQ does most of the time anyway .
Granted , if you have one object in the system with a million subscriptions combined with not explicitly unsubscribing listeners and that monitored object ’s properties never change , you got a big leak .
Why one would have this many objects monitor property changes on something that never changes is probably a bad idea anyway …
Regardless , there is only ever one instance of the WeakEventWrapper per object in the entire system , which from a footprint perspective is tiny .
Hopefully , you ’re not lost at this point , but fear not as here comes the API :
WeakPropertyChangedEventManager.Register( person , " Age " , this , ( me , sender , args ) => me .
OnPropertyChanged ( sender , args ) ) ;
First , ignore the hard coded string for the property name in the example as this is bad form .
( CLINQ analyzes a lambda expressions to extract property names . )
This call says : listen for changes to person .
Age , and call this .
OnPropertyChanged just like normal events in C# .
The reason for the lambda is to prevent any type of closure from being created as this would lead to a strong reference back to “ this . ”
When person .
Age changes the lambda will be called and get this passed in as the me parameter .
Yes , it is a bit weird , but I got this trick from Grunwald ’s work and it ’s seriously slick .
To unregister :
WeakPropertyChangedEventManager .Unregister(person , " Age " , this ) ;
If you always call these two methods then you are good to go .
However , what would be the point of going to all this trouble then ?
There ’s a method for cleaning up dangling weak references just like the original PropertyChangedEventManager :
WeakPropertyChangedEventManager.RemoveCollectedEntries ( ) ;
I have wrestled with whether or not to put in a scheduled cleanup task like the original but with way less frequency .
However , considering the low overhead of these “ leaks , ” I ’m going to leave it to the clients to call when they feel it is necessary .
When the 4.0 version of the CLR comes out , I hear it will be able to notify when the garbage collector is making a pass , which would be a perfect time to make this call .
Otherwise , I may add a dirty timer with configurable interval and thread priority .
Regardless , the overhead of dealing with property change monitoring has been drastically reduced by using this class .
If you would like to check it out , grab Continuous LINQ and pull up a chair to the ContinuousLinq .

7 habits for effective text editing 2.0 is the title of the Google tech talk given by Bram Moolenaar on 13 February 2007 .
The title is loosely based on the book by Stephen Covey .
The actual presentation was over in about 40 minutes and then it was time for questions – also about 40 minutes .
The talk started a bit slow , but after making a few Vim versus Emacs jokes the pace increased .
First the speaker listed the 3 steps one has to follow to make every habit work .
detect inefficiency find quicker way make it a habit
After that the slides were about the 7 vim habits .
Obviously , there was too much information for a blog , but there were a few gems , I feel obliged to share .
Habit 1 Moving around quickly
First of all use the h , j , k and l keys – not the cursor keys .
If you can touch type this makes much more sense , because these keys are on the home row and are therefore easy to reach .
Many people in IT cannot type , which is surprising knowing that this is an essential part of the day to day work .
Luckily , it is very easy to learn .
All you need is a simple computer program and thirty minutes a day for a few weeks .
As a programmer I need to change code very often .
For instance , to change the name of a function or variable .
Basically , what was described in the video was a kind of Mark Occurrences feature as available in Eclipse .
: set hlsearch highlights whatever you are looking for .
Preferably you should have this in your .vimrc file .
You can then use * to find occurrences .
This is also a vim tip – I think also referred to as the “ super star ” operator .
: nohlsearch removes the highlighting .
In Eclipse you have an on / off button for Mark Occurrences .
Personally I find the vim way a bit confusing .
I do n’t know if other people feel the same way , if so maybe we should do an enhancement request 😉 .
The last step is to set the incsearch option .
I am not a big fan of marks , however I found a vim plugin that visualizes marks in a very convenient way .
ShowMarks is a vim plugin that places a sign in the leftmost column of the buffer .
The sign indicates the label of the mark and its location .
This means that you do not need to remember where your marks were and as a bonus the default marks made by vim are also visualized .
By default the following key mappings are defined :
\mt : Toggles ShowMarks on and off .
\mh : Hides an individual mark .
\ma :
Hides all marks in the current buffer .
\mm :
Places the next available mark .
The plugin is installed by simply unzipping showmarks .zip into the $ HOME /.vim or $ HOME / vimfiles folder .
Signs support has to be enabled , otherwise you get a warning when you start vim .
ShowMarks worked with MacVim immediately , however not on the command line with Terminal .
I found out that you need to compile vim with the ( big or huge ) switch .
If you have MacPorts installed , you can execute
1 sudo port install vim +huge + python
The python switch is needed for the vimpress plugin from my previous post .
1 port info vim
gives the following variants
Variants : athena , big , cscope , gtk1 , gtk2 , huge , motif , nls , perl , puredarwin , python , ruby , small , tcl , tiny , universal , xim
Tiny means that most features are disabled , then in increasing order of features enabled you have small , big and huge .
Probably huge also includes python support .
The MacPorts vim variant that I have now does not give a warning or error anymore , however instead of a mark I see a blue square .
The xterm terminal that comes with the Mac X11 application does not have this problem .
Unfortunately I have been using the Terminal application more often for aesthetic reasons .
Habit 2
Do n’t type it twice
Typing the same thing over and over again costs energy , time and is of course boring .
My favorite command , the dot command , makes life a lot easier .
Ctrl N or Ctrl P does insert mode completion , so you can type a few characters and then let vim complete the word .
This is especially useful when you need to write a long and hard to remember method name .
This might seem obvious , but you can avoid a lot of typing by copy pasting or cut and paste .
The good thing about vim is that you can do this really efficiently without using a mouse .
You can , for instance , select a block in visual mode and paste it somewhere else or delete a line with dd and put it where you need it .
Sometimes you need to repeat a certain sequence of commands .
In such cases you can record a macro .
The usage is very similar to marks .
qa records a macro , which then can be executed with @a .
Unfortunately , it is quite hard to get this right .
I tend to keep my macros short and simple .
Still it seems that there are not many opportunities to record macros .
Habit 3
Fix it when it ’s wrong
Stephen Covey ’s third principle is called “ Put first things first “ .
With a bit of imagination you can equate it to “ Fix it when it ’s wrong ” .
So put fixing errors first .
In the talk this was mainly about spelling and the spelling checker in vim .
The advice was to create a list of spelling mistakes and make vim automatically correct them .
1 : abbr teh the
was the example given in the talk .
My most common mistake is writing “ taht ” instead of “ that ” .
At least that is what I catch myself typing in Skype frequently .
Skype as far as I know does not have any vi key bindings or tabs for that matter .
Another enhancement request is emerging 🙂 .
I find the spellchecker in vim quite useful .
: help spell displays the relevant help page .
]s shows the next error , [s the previous one and zg adds the word to the dictionary .
z= gives suggestions from the dictionary – to get out of the suggestions list type Ctrl C .
Habit 4
A file seldom comes alone
An analogy with Covey ’s fourth “ Win / Win ” principle is completely missing here .
Also I am not too keen on the whole “ Win / Win ” concept .
Maybe I feel that way because as a chess player I translate “ Win / Win ” to a draw .
A draw is no good usually , unless you are in a tournament situation , where you are ahead in points .
As a developer you tend to work on projects , that is why IDE ’s as Eclipse are so project minded .
Projects consist of multiple file , such as source code files , configuration files , all kinds of resource files , documentation etcetera etcetera .
Vim does not have the notion of project as far as I know , but still lets you work on a group of related files easily .
In a previous post I already mentioned using tags files and the TagList plugin .
In the talk Agide is mentioned .
This is an old project also from the creator of vim promising to bring us an IDE based on vim .
You can create projects or debug your code with gdb .
Most operations are performed by mouse just as in conventional IDE’s .
Personally I do n’t like Agide ’s GUI – it is ugly .
Projects can be build from Agide , but you still have to save your program before building .
Not as convenient as Eclipse .
Habit 5
Let ’s work together
About the communication between vim and other applications like for instance Word .
The trick for copying to and from Word is to have
1 : set tw = 0 wrap linebreak
Eclipse apparently has a too complex interface to let it work together with vim .
I am using a commercial plugin that kind of offers a very basic vim functionality subset .
Eclim was not mentioned in the talk , but I feel I should say something about it , because it looks very promising .
The features include Javascript , Python and Maven support .
Three scenarios are described on the Eclim website :
You run a headless instance of Eclipse which all vim instances can then connect to .
You run the Eclim server inside of the Eclipse GUI and then interact with it via external vim instances .
The same as the second scenario , but here gvim is used as embedded eclipse editor .
At first I was only aware of the first scenario , which seemed a bit limited , but now I will definitely give Eclim a shot .
I am just wondering , whether I can use MacVim as well .
Also I am not so clear on the Eclipse and vim plugins situation .
Older version of MS visual studio supported vim and I know at least one commercial plugin , that seems to do the job with the latest version of Visual Studio .
According to Bram Moolenaar – Mutt and Sniff support vim out of the box .
Habit 6
Text is structured
I find this a bold statement .
Text does not need to be structured although it usually is .
The structured text that this habit refers to will have some kind of structure that can be used to our advantage .
In programming there is the edit , compile , test cycle .
Not necessarily test driven .
When I was in university we did not have fancy IDE ’s as Eclipse .
We would run commands like gcc from the command line .
You would then get error messages in the console with line numbers , which were not always correct by the way .
Later I worked with MS Visual Studio , I did not find it very user friendly , however .
The point is that it was very cumbersome to have to remember the line number where something was wrong and then go back to the source file for editing .
In the vim world , a program can be compiled with : make .
: clist lists compile errors and : cnext and : cprevious move through the errors .
There are thousands of vim plugins available that can deal with all kinds of files .
In order to handle a new type of file , one can write a small program in several scripting languages , including a small language created specifically for vim .
I read lately a bit about the vim scripting language .
It appears , that this language at least on the surface looks like Python .
There are some object oriented features and exception handling .
If you get ambitious , you could even write your own libraries .
I made a small plugin for myself to help me blogging .
It gives me the ability to find a suitable link , for something , that I am writing about .
All I have to do is select a phrase I want to search for and yank it into the unnamed register .
You can check the contents of the registers using : registers .
Then I will call my special script with :
1 : execute GoogleLink ( )
This will magically insert the first relevant link that the Google AJAX service can find .
Here is the code , use at your own risk :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 function !
GoogleLink ( ) python << EOF import vim , urllib query = vim .
eval ( " @ \ " " ) url = " http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/web?v=1.0&q= " + urllib .
quote_plus ( query ) handle = urllib .
urlopen ( url ) searchResult = handle .
read ( ) commaSeparatedList = searchResult .
split ( ' , ' ) link = '' for i in commaSeparatedList : if i. startswith ( ' " url " ' ) : i = i. replace ( ' " url " : ' , '' ) link = i. replace ( ' " ' , '' ) break vim .
current .
line = vim .
current .
line .
replace ( query , ' < a href= " ' + link + ' " >' + query + '</a>' ) EOF endfunction
As you can see the plugin is still in the prototype stage .
It seems to work , but I have n’t tested it thoroughly and the feature set is limited .
The AJAX service produces JSON for the search results .
A snippet of the TCP stream dump :
GET / ajax / services / search/web?v=1.0&q=Ivan +Idris HTTP/1.0 Host : ajax.googleapis.com
User-agent : Python- urllib/1.15 HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Cache - Control : no-cache , no - store , max - age=0 , must - revalidate Pragma : no-cache Expires : Fri , 01 Jan 1990 00:00:00 GMT
Content - Type : text / javascript ; charset=utf -8 X- Embedded - Status : 200 X - Content - Type-Options : nosniff Content - Length : 3134 Server : GFE / 1.3 Connection : Close { " responseData " : { " results " : [ { " GsearchResultClass " : " GwebSearch " , " unescaped Url " : " http://ivanidris.net/ " , " url " : " http://ivanidris.net/ " , " visibleUrl " : " ivanidris.net " ...
The Python JSON module was introduced in Python 2.6 .
However , MacVim 7.2 is compiled with Python 2.3 for backwards compatibility with Tiger .
It is possible to recompile MacVim with higher version Python support , but it is a bit of a hassle .
Luckily , I did n’t really need full blown JSON capability .
Instead I just did some simple string manipulation .
Habit 7 Sharpen the saw
The presenter explained , how to slowly , but surely get better at using vim , by continually finding improvements and making them a habit .
You need to take the time , do it step by step – repetition is key .
Repeat after me 🙂 .
Sharpening the saw can be done by searching the documentation using :h or : helpgrep , subscribing to mailing lists and RSS feeds or searching newsgroups .
Here is a list of vim related feeds I have been reading recently :
You can also join the IRC #vim channel at Freenode .
If you have a Mac , I suggest downloading Colloquy .
Together with Growl it makes an awesome combination .
Also recommended for iPhone users .
The vim user manual can be found at the Vimdoc website .
From the video I learned that the user manual was originally based on the book “ Vi IMproved – Vim ” by Steve Oualline .
This book described the features in vim 5.7 .
The user manual has been updated for the most recent vim version .
In fact , I read Steve Oualline ’s book and recently also the vim user manual and to me they seem completely different documents .
In my opinion , they are complementary and you can read them both .
The book has a larger number of pages and has diagrams .
The user manual is on the other hand , as I said , up to date and written by Bram Moolenaar himself , as far as I can tell .
Another interesting resource is the wiki book “ Byte of vim ” .
It has many useful links and information on plugins .
Google can find several vim cheat sheets .
At work I have set the vim graphical cheat sheet as my wallpaper .
The neat thing is that the keyboard image has its keys mapped to vim commands .
This , combined with the pretty colors , makes it visually appealing and also a great touch typing learning aid .
As an added bonus , I also have something to talk about when somebody is staring at my desktop .
I remember somebody saying that there is also a graphical Emacs cheat sheet .
I think that was a joke , because you cannot possibly visualise Emacs key bindings in this way .
Conclusion
At this point , I have written more than the equivalent of a hundred tweets .
This is more characters than in my first attempt .
So this writeup was based on a video , which in turn was based on a book .
In any case I got the opportunity to structure my text better and apply the principle of chunking ( not one of the seven habits 😉 ) .
It turns out that I do n’t have enough material for a vim article series trilogy currently .
Next time I will keep it simple and blog about my Google App Engine experiments – a deadly mix of Python and Flex .
Ladies and gentlemen , I hereby declare the comments section open !
Now to cover the issue of the " fake " controversy associated with Norm 's website .
Norm 's website was not intentionally taken down by anybody within the campaign .
The site is run from a remote location .
I have logically concluded that his site crashed for one of two reasons , ( i ) either an extreme amount of traffic , or ( ii ) poor coding resulting in a memory leak .
If the site was getting hit with a decent amount of traffic , which does appear to be the case , the number of database connections may have exceeded the allowable limit due to poor coding .
When this happens there is essentially nothing that can be done from a remote location .
The server is inaccessible because the processor is always trying to catch up with the current number of requests .
In order to fix the problem , the admin would need access to the server , but they could not gain access because the server was constantly busy .
Their solution was to redirect traffic to the IP address 1.1.1.1 .
They would have been wise to setup of an error page on another server and redirect to that , but I do n't know the details .
Whenever the IP address is changed , the new address must propagate back through the internet ; this can take up to 72 hours .
To compensate for this delay , they changed the TTL to 600 for the 1.1.1.1 IP address , which is a very small amount of time in this application .
They wanted the dummy address to propagate to as many people as possible as fast as possible so that they could attempt to fix the original error .
In changing the TTL they are able to gain access to the original server faster , without the new address propagating through the internet over the actual server address .
In changing the address they made a calculated decision ; one I would guess they currently regret .
When their old server came back online , each and every file they had hosted was available for download .
There were documents available that would not have justified any publicity stunt .
My guess is that somebody outside of the campaign initially discovered the outage and began to push the " excessive traffic from voter database leads to crash " story .
At this point the story was picked up by drudge.com and the Coleman was really left with really no choice but to propel the story .
If they had actually acknowledged the problem , the news would have spread faster than they could have fixed ; which happened anyway , but it took some time for people to figure out that files were available .
I do not believe the initial crash was intentional , I believe it was a very poor implementation of technology that forced the Coleman campaign to run with the spin .

I 've recently been writing client side Java Script for an HTML user interface I 've been building at work , and I ran into an issue with Internet Explorer which I was at least partially responsible for 10 years ago !
Let me explain what it is , why it is and an effective way to work around it .
I was attempting to dynamically replace a number of rows in a table with a different set of rows .
I was using the innerHTML property of an element which takes a string , parses it as HTML and replaces the contents of that element with the new HTML .
In this case , I try to replace the contents of a TBODY with a new set of rows :
This works just fine in Firefox .
The new rows replace the old and the display updates .
However , in Internet Explorer , one gets a script error stating that there was a runtime error !
At first , I thought that IE was not capable of performing the redraw for modified tables with innerHTML , but then I remembered that I was responsible for this limitation !
How many developers get to deal with the consequences of their decisions about products at a later date ?
Probably not many .
Let me describe how this came to be .
About 10 years ago , I was part of the Trident team .
Trident was responsible for implementing the parsing , rendering and object model for the next version of IE , after 3.0 .
Also known as mshtml.dll .
I was a developer responsible for the in-memory representation of the HTML and the dynamic manipulation of that HTML .
One of the things I did during this time was invent the method innerHTML , along with innerText , outerHTML , outerText and the lesser known insertAdjacentHTML and insertAdjacentText methods .
These were methods which took HTML or raw text and replaced / inserted that new content into the document .
Now , Microsoft documents this as not applicable to table elements .
Why ?
They do n't say .
However , I remembered why .
When one sets the innerHTML property of an element , the string containing the HTML is run through the parser .
Now , HTML parsers are not simple , straightforward parsers like XML parsers .
The HTML parser ( implemented brilliantly by David Bau ) takes arbitrary text and , usually , produces an HTML tree of elements .
For example , parsing a file containing only " Foo " will result in the tree :
You can see this for yourself by running the following through IE ( Firefox wo n't work , as they did not implement outerHTML ) : Now , parsing something like "
Foo " where there is no TABLE tag preceding the TR causes the parser to ignore the TR tag altogether .
This was probably done by the IE parser for backwards compatibility with the Netscape browser of the time .
In fact , much of the complexity of the parser is influenced by backwards compatibility .
So , attempting to set the innerHTML of a TBODY with "
Hamas having decided that stoning girls to death is not brutal enough , has enacted a law legalizing crucifixion .
Public decapitation for gays and rape victims was n't bad enough ...
Now they can look forward to being nailed to a cross and left hanging until they slowly suffocate to death .
This will be happening , in modern Palestine .
Would it be acceptable anywhere outside the middle - east ?...--------------------------------------Hamas Enacts Islamic Laws , Including : Amputation , Crucifixion , LashesHamas members of the Palestinian Legislative Council in Gaza have approved a new bill " to implement Koranic punishments , " including hand amputation , crucifixion , corporal punishment and execution .
Drinking , owning or producing wine is punished by 40 lashes , while drinking in public adds three months ' imprisonment .
Several laws are directed against Hamas 's Palestinian rivals , including a law intended to inhibit non-Hamas negotiators by sentencing to death anyone who was " appointed to negotiate with a foreign government on a Palestinian issue and negotiated against Palestinians ' interest .
"
The following is the description as it appears today on the Al Arabiya website : Headline : Hamas approves law of punishment by lashes , amputating hands , crucifying , and execution - in order to implement the Islamic Sharia law .
Hamas members of the Palestinian Legislative Council approved in its meeting in Gaza a new bill proposed by the Hamas who have a majority in the Legislative Council , whose purpose is " to implement Koranic punishments .
"
The newspaper Al Hayat of London reported on Dec. 24 , 2008 , that this step is seen as unprecedented , and has brought criticism and concern from human rights organizations in the Gaza Strip , especially as this law includes punishments by lashes , cutting off of hands , crucifixion , and execution ...
The language of the law proposes " primary and secondary " laws .
Primary laws include : " Koranic laws , blood revenge , lashes , crucifixion , and execution ...
" The text stresses : " These punishments will not be canceled or pardoned ... except if pardoned by the victim himself ...
Section 59 of the law establishes that " punishment of death will be enacted on any Palestinian who intentionally does one of the following : Raised a weapon against Palestine on behalf of the enemy during war , was appointed to negotiate with a foreign government on a Palestinian issue and negotiated against Palestinians ' interest , performed a hostile action against a foreign country in a way that endangers Palestine in war or in harming political relations , served a foreign army in time of war , advised or helped soldiers to enlist in this army , weakened the spirit or the force of resistance of the people , or spied against Palestine especially during war .
"
The punishment of lashes appears in many sections of the law .
Section 84 states that : " Whoever drinks wine , owns or produces wine will be punished with 40 lashes if he is Muslim , and anyone who drinks wine , or angers another person [ with wine ] , or causes him distress when drinking wine in a public place , or goes to a public place while drunk , will be punished with no less than 40 lashes and imprisonment for the minimum of three months . "

In a shocking display of timeliness , Capcom 's Resident Evil 5 game space has been added to PlayStation Home today .
We just went onto PSN to check , and there it is : the Studio Lot , with a facsimile of the game 's African village level to explore , and some interactive features - although it 's not yet complete , according to good old Ted the Dog .
There 's free Resident Evil gear available in the mall , too .
Also added in the latest update are complete Street Fighter costumes , a new multiplayer game in Home Square ( Helicopter Hit ) , and some new Watchmen stuff .
Resident Evil 5 joins Far Cry 2 as the only Home game spaces available in Europe .
Sony has yet to add its long - promised spaces for Warhawk , Uncharted and Resistance .
Resident Evil 5 is out next week .
The bidding process was first conceived last year when oil prices were higher but Petróleos de Venezuela ’s production decline was getting impossible to overlook .
Still , the process is moving into high gear only this month , with the authorities here expected to start reviewing the companies ’ bidding plans on new areas of the Orinoco Belt , an area in southern Venezuela with an estimated 235 billion barrels of recoverable oil .
Altogether , more than $ 20 billion in investment could be required to assemble devilishly complex projects capable of producing a combined 1.2 million barrels of oil a day .
Mr. Chávez ’s olive branch to Western oil companies comes after he nationalized their oil fields in 2007 .
Two companies , Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips , left Venezuela and are still waging legal battles over lost projects .
But Venezuela may have little choice but to form new ventures with foreign oil companies .
Nationalizations in other sectors , like agriculture and steel manufacturing , are fueling capital flight , leaving Venezuela reliant on oil for about 93 percent of its export revenue in 2008 , up from 69 percent in 1998 when Mr. Chávez was first elected .
In the past year , with higher oil prices paving the way , Mr. Chávez also vastly expanded Petróleos de Venezuela ’s power , inextricably linking it to his political program .
He directed the oil company to build roads , import and distribute food , build docks and shipyards and set up a light - bulb factory .
He even expanded it into areas like milk production , soybean farming and the training of athletes after a weak performance at the Beijing Olympics .
One of the oil company ’s ventures sells subsidized food and extols Mr. Chávez ’s leadership at its stores across Venezuela .
At one frenzied store in eastern Caracas , posters hung from the ceiling last Saturday showing Mr. Chávez arm in arm with children beneath the heading , “ fortifying agrarian socialism . ”
Petróleos de Venezuela has also carried out nationalizations in other industries , absorbing companies like Electricidad de Caracas , the utility serving this city of five million .
Top executives like Eulogio del Pino , the Stanford - educated vice president for exploration and production , spent much of 2008 negotiating unfinished deals like the takeover of a cement company .
The animal had cut itself when it crashed through the bedroom window late on Sunday night , and was frantically trying to escape .
During the initial commotion , Mr Ettlin , his wife and nine - year - old daughter Beatrix , cowered beneath the bedsheets .
They only realised the full extent of the danger when the kangaroo bounded into his ten - year - old son Leighton 's bedroom and the boy screamed : " There 's a roo in my room " .
Should you check your chain ?
Bicycle chain links are a half inch long from rivet to rivet .
When you measure a brand new chain with a ruler , the rivets should all line up exactly on the inch and half inch marks .
With use , the chains “ stretch ” so that the rivets no longer line up over the length of a ruler .
Chains do n’t really “ stretch ” — the insides of the chain wear with use , resulting in parts with more play and an elongation of a length of chain .
You measure chain wear ( or stretch ) by lining the chain against a ruler .
Because the links are exactly 1 / 2 inch long , the measure from rivet to rivet should be on 1/2 inch increments .
You can see in this photo that the top , older chain has about a 1 /16 ″ of wear at one foot .
The bottom chain is a brand new , unused 10 speed chain .
Click on the photo to see large if you want .
It ’s not necessary to remove the chain to measure it — just line a ruler up along a straight part of a chain and measure from the middle of a rivet .
If you see more than about 1/16th inch of wear along a six inch segment of chain , it ’s a good idea to replace the chain .
There are also chain wear measuring tools where you pop the tool on the chain to quickly and easily determine if your chain is worn .
Why should I change the chain ?
Chain wear is important mostly for bicycles with rear derailleurs .
Excessive wear leads to poor shifting , and worn chains increases wear on your cogs which makes shifting even worse .
You can get away with a little more chain wear on your singlespeeds , fixed gear bikes and bikes with hub gears .
First of all , you can use beefier — and less expensive — chains .
Derailleur shifting performance is not an issue , so worn cog teeth are n’t too big of a deal .
When the teeth start to get the shark fin look like on the cog below , though , it ’s past time to replace your chain and cog .
Coming later :
How to replace your chain .
SCIENCE and politics are inextricably linked .
At a scientific conference on climate change held this week in Copenhagen , four environmental experts announced that sea levels appear to be rising almost twice as rapidly as had been forecast by the United Nations just two years ago .
The warning is aimed at politicians who will meet in the same city in December to discuss the same subject and , perhaps , to thrash out an international agreement to counter it .
The reason for the rapid change in the predicted rise in sea levels is a rapid increase in the information available .
In 2007 , when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change convened by the UN made its prediction that sea levels would rise by between 18 cm and 59 cm by 2100 , a lack of knowledge about how the polar ice caps were behaving was behind much of the uncertainty .
Since then they have been closely monitored , and the results are disturbing .
Both the Greenland and the Antarctic caps have been melting at an accelerating rate .
It is this melting ice that is raising sea levels much faster than had been expected .
Indeed , scientists now reckon that sea levels will rise by between 50 cm and 100 cm by 2100 , unless action is taken to curb climate change .
Konrad Steffen of the University of Colorado , Boulder , leads one study of the Greenland ice sheet .
He told the conference that this sheet is melting not only because it is warmer but also because water seeping through its crevices is breaking it up .
This effect had been neglected in the earlier report .
The impact of the melting ice has been measured by John Church of the Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research .
He told the conference that satellite and ground - based systems showed that sea levels have been rising more rapidly since 1993 than they were earlier in the 20th century .
He is concerned that more climate change could cause a further acceleration in this rate .
Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research has examined data stretching over 125 years that link increases in sea temperatures to rises in sea levels .
He told the conference that , based on past experience , “ I expect that sea - level rise will accelerate as the planet gets hotter . ”
He was supported in this view by the fourth expert , Eric Rignot of the University of California , Irvine , who called for the world 's leaders to slash the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases .
Advance negotiations on the UN Climate Change Conference are due to begin in Bonn in just over a fortnight 's time .
The scientists hope that their startling warnings will change the outcome of that pre-meeting meeting .
With much still to argue over , they hope that a clear scientific lead will both help to narrow the room for disagreement and galvanise the desire to get a treaty agreed .
COMET LULIN BRIGHTENS--VISUAL
REPORTS : " Today , Feb . 17th at 4 am , I observed the comet with my 3.5 - inch refractor , " reports Mariano Ribas of Buenos Aires , Argentina .
" It is much brighter than it was just a few nights ago .
I estimate the magnitude at + 5.6 .
If this brightening continues , Lulin could reach magnitude + 5.0 or even brighter during its closest approach next week . "
" I observed comet Lulin before dawn this morning , Feb. 17th , and I found it in an instant using 10x50 binoculars , " says Martin Mc Kenna of Maghera , N. Ireland .
" The comet was very bright and large with a coma 20 arcminutes in diameter .
Despite the glare of the last quarter Moon , I was very impressed to see the comet easily with the naked eye with even a hint of green colour .
From a dark country site , Lulin should be an easy naked - eye object , a view which can only get better at close approach to Earth . "
" Lulin is bright and it is moving fast ! " adds Fredrik Broms of Kvaløya , Norway .
" On Feb .
17th the comet was easily detected in a simple pair of 8x42 binoculars , and with a bit of patience it could just be made out with the naked eye .
The comet moved a noticable amount during my 4 - hour observing session . "

Feb. 17 , 2009 # 1 Lulin has brightened so much , telescopic amplification is no longer needed to photograph it .
Using an off - the - shelf digital camera , Alex Roca of Hortoneda , Spain , caught the comet passing 4th - magnitude star theta Virginis on Feb. 17th .
" I mounted the camera , a Nikon D40 , on the back of my telescope to track the stars , " he says .
" Otherwise , the telescope played no part in this 10 minute exposure . "

" Right now I 'm rolling into New Orleans .
I really do n't know what to expect .
An old friend of a new friend offered to pick me up from the station and get me to the house of another friend of a friend .
I am overwhelmingly grateful to the strangers I have met along the way who have been willing to go out of their way to welcome me to their cities .
The sun is setting on the bayou - licked lands and I am truly fortunate .
I have rounded this beautiful Southeast corner on the Crescent line today and from now on I am westward bound . "
Those were the last words she wrote .
Two days later , her dead body was found on a sidewalk in the 3000 block of Laussat Place , in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans .
EMS paramedics responding to a call of a shooting were unable to save her .
For two more days her body lay unidentified in the New Orleans morgue .
Kirsten Brydum , a young woman of 25 , died after being shot multiple times in the head .
Ms. Brydum 's body was finally identified by a friend and by her fingerprints .
Her killer (s ) had apparently taken her wallet and her identification , as well as the bicycle she was riding .
She was traveling about the country , and living off the offerings of strangers .
She began a journey with an Amtrak train pass , in search of what she called " collective autonomy .
Her sojourn first took her to Manhattan where she marveled at the items people threw away .
Brydum was known in San Francisco for her association with the " Really , Really Free Market , " where people barter a variety of goods and services .
Her next stop was the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , where she joined protesters .
Then , she rode the train to Philadelphia , and finally to Louisiana .
Ms. Brydum was last seen leaving the Howlin ' Wolf dance club on South Peters Street in the Warehouse District at approximately 1:30 AM on September 27th .
She wore a green and white striped shirt over an off white dress , with flip flops on her feet and a feather in her hair .
She was alone with her bicycle .
Her killer (s ) remain at large .
Ms. Brydum 's friends , family and acquaintances , in their grief , deserve the utmost respect .
Ms. Brydum herself may be upheld as a model for others to aspire to .
That often occurs when we try to make sense of a death that we believe came too early .
I suspect her mourners will strive to reconstruct her into a free spirited martyr .
She was an idealist with a life of accomplishment ahead of her .
Now she is dead .
" She was a woman with a huge heart and a huge brain , compassionate and wise beyond her years , " declared one friend from San Francisco .
No .
Face the truth .
She was naive .
Kristen Brydum was either in denial or ignorant of the dangers that were around her .
Either that , or she had a death wish .
She depended on dumb luck and the gratuitous indifference of strangers for her very survival .
She was not wise beyond her years .
She was a hippie chick cavorting around the country so she would have stories to tell .
She was not doing research on some " collective autonomy . "
She was accomplishing nothing other than gathering experiences to promote a lifestyle that feeds off productive people in society .
It is that frame of mind which brought about her demise .
Kristen Brydum was twenty - five years old .
An adult .
She was responsible for herself .
I have to wonder if she would have ridden her bicycle through South Central Los Angeles at 1:30 in the morning on a Saturday night .
I doubt it .
She was familiar with the random violence there .
Why did she so blatantly ignore the dangers elsewhere ?
Did she believe she had an invisible aura of protection that would inform predatory vermin that she was there to help them with some ethereal Utopia ?
I do n't know what was in her head , but I do know post - Katrina New Orleans .
I can only consider her actions in that arena , and those actions were stupid .
Damned stupid .
They would be stupid if a 10 year old child proposed them .
That a 25 year old woman did them speaks volumes of her naivete and lack of appreciation for her vulnerability in a hostile world .
In New Orleans , she was an outsider , easily recognized as such by her accent and her wide eyes in a city infamous for it 's drug lords , institutionalized crime and random murder before Katrina .
Post - Katrina New Orleans is even more dangerous as the same resident drug lords and rival gangs searching for a piece of the action jockey for position , and petty criminals kill with impunity for bicycles and crack cash .
Her supposed intellectual superiority born of a life of priviledge would not protect her from predators there .
There are some who will no doubt say Kristen Brydum would be alive today if she had a gun .
That 's doubtful .
A gun is not a panacea for ignorance .
Without the will to use it and the intelligence to keep you from having to use it , a gun is only another good luck charm .
The reality is , people who are " wise beyond their years " do not do stupid things .
They do not do stupid things like traveling around the country to the most violent regions possible , in search of a vague economic hypothesis that is strikingly similar to the age old barter system .
According to the Times - Picayune , there have been 148 murders so far this year in New Orleans , 209 in 2007 , and 161 in 2006 .
People who are " wise beyond their years " avoid such places .
If a person wants to safely travel to these types of places , their way of thinking must change .
They must educate themselves .
They must listen .
They must be willing to learn .
They must gain an understanding of the areas , and they must appreciate the vicious predatory nature of the sociopaths that populate them .
They are stepping through the looking glass into the world of the predatory animal .
They must heed the instincts that keep prey alive .
They must develop street smarts , and learn to trust their instincts , not deny them .
Then they should buy a gun and train to use it in case their primary means of protection , their wits , fail .
One of Kristen Brydum 's friends described her as savy , adept at defusing situations .
If your attacker is willing to kill you to prevent a witness to the theft of your bicycle , the only way to " defuse " the situation is through the threat or the application of deadly force .
By the time her journey reached that point , a gun would only have saved her if she had the willingness to use it .
Somehow I think that those who knew and loved Kristen Brydum would have tried to prevent this journey to the 9th Ward of New Orleans if they had known of the dangers .
The dangers are there .
Waiting .
They are real .
A wise person has an appreciation of those dangers .
I would not travel there at 1:30 PM on a bike myself , and I am a large man with a gun .
It is not because of fear that I would not travel there , but rather because I recognize the dangers and realize my own mortality .
It was not the lack of a weapon that doomed Kristen Brydum .
It was the lack of appreciation of the hazards that she repeatedly injected her life into .
She lived on the edge , and she paid for it with her life .
She espoused " anarchist economics , " the sharing of wealth in a " gift market . "
The true sociopathic anarchists of New Orleans discovered her , disregarded her pleas for mercy , and killed her for her bicycle and her wallet .
An innocent , easily preventable death occurred not because the world is a bad , mean and unforgiving place , but because the victim ignored the fact that some human predators are .
I read with dismay that Kristen Brydum 's mourners are placing ads on Craig 's List and elsewhere to arrange for rides with strangers across the country , to San Francisco in remembrance of her life .
It continues .
I wonder if her spirit mourns for them .

As a distraction from learning about denotational semantics , I took a look at ESCJava2 , which is an extended static checker for Java .
ESCJava2 lets you add annotations to your source code which describe invariants and pre/post - conditions which you expect to be true .
Then it goes away and tries to verify that they are true .
Often , you have to go back and add extra annotations elsewhere ( anyone who has const - ified a C++ program knows this feeling ) .
But eventually you get to a point where you can be fairly confident that your program is ( statically ) free from all sorts of badness – eg. you ’ll never try to pop from an empty stack , you ’ll never get a null pointer exception .
This is all done declaratively , which makes it much tastier than unit tests .
Does it work ?
Well , I got out the source code for my trusty java raytracer , which was literally the first java program I ever wrote .. back in 1996 or something .
At about 1,000 lines of code , it ’s both “ real world ” enough to act as a decent test case , yet simple enough to grok quickly .
Initially , I had to spend a while adding ‘ non_null ’ annotations everywhere – every field in every object had that property .
Dull , but useful to have it all checked .
Next was various bound - checking stuff .
I had an image class with width / height members and a 2d array of pixels .
I ‘ knew ’ that the array was of the right size , but by asserting some invariants to that effect , I could get ESCJava to statically bounds - check all the code that reads / writes pixels .
The invariant were moderately complex things like “ forall i < height ; pixels [ i]. length == width " .
These " forall " quantifiers are what makes this approach tastier than unit tests .
With unit tests , you have to pick " representative " data points and then trust that you chose well .
In the haskell world , Quick Check is a big step above that .
Perhaps ESCJava brings some hint of universal tastiness to Java ?
Well , except that it did n't work in practise .
My key ' raytrace all the pixels ' method could n't be processed by ESCJava .
It gave an error which effectively said " the theorem which I 'd have to prove to be sure that the code is safe is just too complex " .
Disappointing , considering that it was little more than some nested loops plus a bit of logic .
ESCJava had a few other nice features though .
Since my code is old , it the plain old Vector class .
ESC can add a ' phantom ' elementType field to your vector , which gives you 1.5 - like static type checking on pre-1.5 collections .
But in the end , the final nail in the coffin was that ESCJava does not support java 1.5 + features .
So it does n't understand generics .
Oh well , no use for the real code that I work with .
I 'd love to have the time to understand this area more deeply .
I like this kind of " unsound and incomplete but useful in practise " part of the statically - checked spectrum .
In an incident that was n't at all excessive ( nope ) , a 14 - year - old girl in Wisconsin was arrested for refusing to stop sending text messages during class , where she proceeded to hide the phone in her ASS CRACK .

According to the Smoking Gun , the unnamed girl apparently ignored the teacher 's requests to stop using her Samsung phone , but she kept on SMSing as she pleased .
When the school security officer was called in , the girl claimed she did n't have a phone .
The school finally called in the police , who searched the girl , and found the phone under her pants " in the buttocks area . "
The police confiscated her phone and charged her with disorderly conduct .
These are your tax dollars at work , Wisconsin .

Circuit City Stores Inc.’s recent announcement that it would close all 567 of its U.S. stores caused dismay among employees and long - term customers but left some shoppers excited about looking for good deals .
About 34,000 employees of the Richmond , Va. - based company will lose their jobs nationwide , and stores will close throughout the Bay Area , including locations in San Mateo , San Jose , Daly City and Sunnyvale .
But with liquidation sales now under way , customers are complaining that prices are sky - high , and the company has little information on the number of local employees or details of the sales .
Staff at the San Mateo store , located at 1880 S. Grant St. , said liquidators had barred them from speaking to the media .
But one employee said the store officially closed Friday when liquidators took over operations .
A second employee , who also asked not to be identified because he was n’t authorized to speak to the press , said about 45 people work at the store and some of them have been there as long as two decades .
A man who answered the phone at the Daly City store said he could n’t give out any information on the sale to the press .
As of Wednesday , the sale featured discounts of 10 to 30 percent , with most big - ticket items selling for 10 percent off .
“ The liquidation , as of Saturday ( Jan. 17 ) up to today , has totally ridiculous prices , ” San Mateo resident Tim Kelley said Tuesday after visiting the store .
“ They jacked everything up to retail and took 10 to 30 percent off .
That ’s not even a sale . ”
Kelley said he had shopped at the store ’s San Mateo location for more than 15 years and did n’t fault staff for the high prices .
He added that he had gotten good deals in the past because Circuit City would match any competitor ’s prices plus 10 percent .
Scott Carpenter , executive vice president of Great American Group , one of four liquidators handling the closures , said the pre-discount prices were the same as what Circuit City had always charged apart from weekly specials .
“ We discount off of the regular price of the item — the price that Circuit City keeps in their price file , ” Carpenter said .
“ We do n’t change any of those prices ever . ”
Based on customer complaints , the Daily News took Best Buy ’s Jan. 18 advertising pamphlet to the San Mateo Circuit City store and did a comparison shop .
Despite the liquidation sale , most of Best Buy ’s advertised prices appeared to beat Circuit City’s .
Circuit City ’s price for a 46 - inch Samsung 1080 p LCD HDTV television set was $ 1,890 Wednesday afternoon , $ 440 more than Best Buy ’s price of $ 1,450 .
Smaller television sets , such as the Toshiba 22 - inch 720 p LCD HDTV -DVD Combo and the Samsung 22 - inch 720 p LCD HDTV were about the same price at both stores with Best Buy ’s prices coming in slightly lower thanks to a $ 50 discount .
DVDs of the movies “ Step Brothers ” and “ The Incredible Hulk ” were $ 17.59 at Circuit City , 20 percent off the original price of $ 21.99 .
The same titles apparently cost $ 14.99 each at Best Buy , down from a regular price of $ 19.99 .
Carpenter said prices advertised in a competitors ’
Sunday circular might be lower because those publications typically feature big discounts on a few items .
“ The real difference is that other retailer only has , let ’s say , five televisions on sale , ” Carpenter said .
“ We have every single one of the televisions on sale in the store . ”
All sales are final at the liquidation , and Carpenter ’s firm and others have until March 31 to sell all of the inventory — so prices should start to drop significantly in coming days .
During liquidation sales , employees gradually start to take other jobs as the close date approaches , said Carpenter , noting that he did n’t expect to lay anyone off before the end of March .
“ In fact , we ’ll probably need to hire a few additional people , ” he said .

A storyline is emerging in Republican circles and throughout media land that Chris Dodd and the Treasury Department secretly inserted a provision into the stimulus bill that allowed AIG to pay its failure bonuses .
There 's only one problem with this narrative : it is completely false .
With or without the stimulus bill , AIG would have been allowed to pay its failure bonuses .
In fact , at no point in time was there ever a law barring the bonuses .
Given that the bonuses were never illegal , there was never any need to create a new loophole to allow them .
They were allowed all along .
What actually happened was that the stimulus bill put new restrictions on bonuses , but only applied those restrictions on bonuses that were given out after the legislation passed .
Early drafts of those new restrictions were retroactive , and would have applied to the AIG failure bonuses , but by the time the final legislation was passed , the retroactive provisions had been eliminated .
Chris Dodd , who wrote the restrictions , says he agreed to limit their scope at the request of Treasury .
Figuring out why the new restrictions did n't go far enough is a valuable exercise , but it 's also important to get the basic story right , and so far , far too many people are getting the simplest of facts wrong .
Before they go wagging their finger in outrage , they ought to get the story right .
It 's official : With an introduction of " together again , " [ artist id = " 783 " ]
Blink - 182 [ / artist ] confirmed that they are back in the Blink business at the Grammy Awards Sunday night ( February 8 ) when they appeared onstage together for the first time in four years .
Emerging to sounds of their 1999 hit " What 's My Age Again , " bassist Mark Hoppus , drummer Travis Barker — wearing a sling on his injured left arm — and estranged guitarist Tom DeLonge walked out together , with Hoppus joking , " Is n't it great to see the Jonas Brothers and Stevie Wonder back together again ? " after the unlikely pairing performed a medley of the Bros ' " Burning Up " and Wonder 's " Superstition . "
Barker added , " We used to play music together , and we decided we 're going to play music together again , " as DeLonge stood awkwardly to the side .
Hoppus also yelled , " Blink - 182 is back ! "
The band 's official Web site also confirmed the good news , with a banner that read simply , " Summer 2009 . "
A message from the band explained , " Hi . We 're Blink - 182 .
This past week there 've been a lot of questions about the current status of the band , and we wanted you to hear it straight from us .
To put it simply , We 're back .
We mean , really back .
Picking up where we left off and then some .
In the studio writing and recording a new album .
Preparing to tour the world yet again .
Friendships reformed . 17 years deep in our legacy .
Summer 2009 .
Thanks and get ready . "
Hopes were high for the announcement when , on Thursday , it was revealed that the trio would be presenting an award at the Grammys .
And they got even higher when Angels & Airwaves guitarist David Kennedy appeared to let slip in a Web chat that same day that Blink were going to record an album this year .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
These days , getting a college degree does n't guarantee you a job .
And with so many new grads vying for a limited number of openings in the worst job market in years , it 's tough to stand out in a crowd .
Employers expect to hire 22 % fewer new grads this year than they hired last year , according to a new study conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employers .
That 's the first time hiring projections have fallen since 2002 , NACE said .
And students approaching graduation are well aware of the obstacles they face .
When Roy Ma graduated from the University of Maryland in December , he was apprehensive about his job search .
" I was definitely worried about finding a job , " Ma said .
Even though he attempted to get a jump start on his search by going to career fairs , on - campus interviews and information sessions as early as last spring , he had no success .
Desperate to make ends meet after graduation , the economics major picked up some odd jobs walking dogs and washing cars but spent his evenings applying to openings online that fit his criteria , including " even remotely possible job listings on all the major job sites . "
" Eventually you notice that that 's not working , " he said , so Ma honed in on the positions that were particularly interesting to him and that he was qualified for .
Then , for each application , Ma rewrote a new cover letter and resume and crafted it to match the job requirements and preferences according to the posting and his own research on the company .
He also leveraged what he felt made him unique , which was a multicultural background and network , and focused his search on companies for which that would have value .
When Ma finally did land an interview at a Bethesda , Md. law firm , he practiced with his family and friends beforehand and prepared answers to hundreds of common interview questions , he says .
He was hired on the spot .
" He was prepared and his preparation paid off with an offer , " said Ford Myers , president of Career Potential , LLC , a Pennsylvania - based career consulting firm .
But , Ma could have saved a lot of time and energy by being more selective from the start , Myers said .
Dan King , principal of Career Planning and Management Inc. in Boston , says if Ma ultimately wanted to work in a law firm , he may have been able to speed up the process by compiling a list of local firms and going after them directly .
" You can research organizations to get information on who 's inside , " he suggested , and then try calling them to make some contacts or talk to someone you know about getting a referral .
Even though Ma was applying with the masses , he found success by narrowing his search and setting himself apart .
" He learned from what he was doing , rather than blindly and continuously apply for jobs , " said Gerry Crispin , co-owner of Careerxroads , a consulting firm based in New Jersey .
" Importantly , he continued to experiment with what he was doing and learned to become much more targeted . "
Customizing his cover letter and paying attention to the specifics of each opening were a big part of that .
Ma 's customized cover letter helped tie his assets and strengths to the firm 's specific needs and challenges , Myers said .
" People think they 're going to have more success if they cast a really wide net and that is not true , " Myers said .
" The truth is they have to be more selective in this market then ever before . "

I do n’t think it hyperbolic to observe that the prohibition of marijuana appears to be in serious question as a public policy in the United States these days .
Consider for just a moment the major changes promised by the Obama administration to end the federal law enforcement raids in states with legal protections for medical marijuana providers and patients ; the mass questioning of marijuana prohibition via the outing of 14 - time gold medal winner Michael Phelps ; the crushing economy that apparently is disabusing many state legislators that the costs of prohibition can no longer be sustained and lastly , the graying of the Baby Boom generation ( who , in the 1960s and 1970s scoffed at their parent ’s Reefer Madness ) .
What did today ’s ‘ mail ’ deliver to my inbox that just makes my eyes roll :
The Associated Press ran a story entitled ‘ Lawmakers Across Nation Look To Booze for Revenues : Governors and lawmakers faced with budget deficits are advocating loosening laws that restrict alcohol consumption so that the state can increase its tax base . ’
— In Georgia , Connecticut , Indiana , Texas , Alabama and Minnesota , lawmakers are considering legislation this year that would end the ban on Sunday liquor sales .
All but 15 states sell booze on Sundays .
— In Nebraska , a state lawmaker has proposed allowing beer to be consumed in state parks as a way to boost tourism .
— Other states , including Utah , are considering allowing the sale of liquor on Election Day .
Drinkers should n’t break out the bubbly just yet :
Two dozen states , including California , Massachusetts , Oklahoma and Virginia , are looking to help their budgets by raising alcohol taxes .
Meanwhile , some states are trying to eliminate much less onerous hassles associated with buying alcohol .
– In Colorado and Kansas , grocery stores are fighting for the right to sell full - strength beer .
Most of the opposition in those states is n’t coming from morality groups , but instead from liquor stores who like having a corner on the market .
– A similar effort is occurring in Tennessee , where lawmakers are considering allowing the sale of wine in supermarkets .
– In Alabama , a proposal to raise the amount of alcohol allowed in beer from 6 percent alcohol by volume to 13.9 percent is being considered , although some church groups fear it would result in people getting drunker quicker .
Gee , I wonder where else balance budget strapped states could take in billions in unrealized taxes ?
Hmmm …

DEA has 106 planes , so why did it charter private jet for chief ?
McClatchy Newspapers reports that , in these belt - tightening times , especially for the federal government , that 1 ) the DEA has 106 airplanes that cost the taxpayers $ 76 million annually and 2 ) Even with this mini-Air Force , the DEA ’s Acting Administrator Michelle Leonhart still chartered a private jet for over $ 128,000 ?
Ugh !

Laguna Woods ’ retirees still await medical pot dispensary —
Responding to some residents ’ quality - of - life pleas , the city last year agreed to let a marijuana facility set up shop .
But so far no landlord has been willing to risk the wrath of Uncle Sam .
LA Times
As more and more senior citizens and Baby Boomers turn to the non-toxic , safe and affordable cannabis plant as a medicine , media stories about senior citizens being denied viable access to medical cannabis in retirement communities and hospices is only going to increase in the near term as the federal government ’s strict prohibition against medical cannabis continues to loose both credibility and the weight of law in the American mind .
***
State lawmakers looking to increase revenues by increasing public access to a dangerous and addictive drug ( ethyl alcohol products ) , DEA getting long deserved public scrutiny for wasting tax dollars and senior citizens in California complain in the state ’s largest paper about the need for greater retail access to medicinal cannabis …
Yep , America ’s cannabis prohibition laws really are primed now more than ever for substantive reform !

On March 28 , the Houston Zoo will unveil its new star attraction : a rare red panda named Toby .
Holy hell , Toby is cute .
Have you ever seen one of these things ?
Probably not , unless you happen to live in the Himalayan foothills between 5,000 and 13,000 feet .
Red pandas eat exclusively bamboo , live largely solitary lives , and are well known within the animal kingdom for being far too adorable to eat .
" Oh , we never go near them in the wild , " Jammu , one of the Houston Zoo 's tigers , possibly tells Hair Balls .
" It does n't matter how hungry you are , you just do n't do it . "
" It 's easy to sneak up on one from behind , but then they turn around and you look in those big doe eyes , " agreed Pandu the tiger .
" Holy crap .
So effin ' CUTE . "
When asked about Toby , African wild dogs Blaze and Aries cooed in unison , causing the rest of the pack to join in with sighs of deep affection .
" Have you seen his paws ? " gushed Blaze .
" Go look at his widdle paws ! "
However , not every animal at the zoo is happy at Toby 's arrival .
Ginger , a Nyala calf born in October of last year , is finding herself overshadowed .
" It 's difficult , being a child star , " she told us .
" At first everyone is -- excuse the pun -- fawning all over you , telling you you 're the cutest thing they 've ever seen and baby - talking to you ... it 's a good life , until the next big thing comes along .
I 'm lucky if anyone even knows my damn name anymore , thanks to Toby . "
" It definitely takes some getting used to , " said Jack , a giraffe who turned one year old back in January .
" You start making friends with the newer , cuter animals , hoping that maybe you can share the spotlight , but it never turns out that way .
Before you know it the novelty wears off and you 're just another gangly , awkward adult . "
Hadiah , a rare Baribusa pig born in May , was much more blunt : " Yeah , I 've seen the little creep .
Do n't think for a second he does n't know the power he has .
Frankly I 'd like to kick his smug panda face in . "
Hadiah then considered her statement , sighed , and added " Oh who am I kidding .
I could never lay a hoof on Toby . "
Toby will be capering and gamboling about lovably in his new indoor exhibit near the zoo 's Natural Encounters Building .
So this Swedish destination , The Ice Hotel , has linked up with Virgin Galactic to begin selling space travel packages for about $ 200,000 , beginning in 2012 .
Wilson says that 's cheap .
I say that 's relative .

Anyways , Virgin Galactic apparently linked up with five nordic travel agencies to start booking these packages , which will take off from the Swedish town of Kiruna ( also home to an ESA Space Station ) in 2012 , when they expect the first European space tourism to begin .
And even sweeter , prices are supposed to go gradually drop over time .
300 tickets have been sold so far for the trip 110 kilometers above the Earth 's surface , and the Ice Hotel plans to book trips where passengers can travel through Aurora Borealis .
Whoa .
[ The Local via Slashdot ]
Here we go again .
A delicate budget fix crafted by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders was on the brink of collapse early Wednesday after a dramatic move by Republicans in the state Senate .
The Republicans ousted their leader in a late - night coup over tax hikes , replacing Modesto's Sen .
Dave Cogdill with anti-tax hard - liner Sen. Dennis Hollingsworth of Murietta .
Lawmakers view the leadership change as a major setback after they fell short by just one GOP vote , but Democratic leader Darrell Steinberg said he did n't want to speculate what it would mean for the package .
But Hollingsworth did not waffle on where he 's coming from ; he said Wednesday morning that he does n't want a tax increase passed .
The current package contains billions in tax hikes , spending cuts and borrowing .
It took leaders more than three months to put together but still the state has not passed the midyear budget fix that 's needed to avoid fiscal calamity .
Is there anything more satisfying than hitting a nice straight drive deep down the middle of the fairway ?
Probably not .
“ Why ca n’t we hit that shot every hole ” , we wonder .
Well there is a reason for lacking distance or accuracy off the tee , you just might not have the right driver .
Sure you paid 300 $ or more for the top of the line club of your favorite brand , but you never checked if the driver was right for your swing , did you ?
Lets go over some of the things you should be looking for in a driver .
Club Length
Now there is n’t going to be a ton of difference in the length of the drivers , unless you are very tall or short and need one specially ordered .
Most will be between 44 to 46 inches long .
Now that little bit of length can do a big difference as it may be too hard to swing a longer club around .
The basic rule is , the shorter the club the more control you will have .
Just take a look at your irons , which do you have more control over , your 9I or your 5I ?
Shaft Stiffness and Kick
Firstly lets talk about shaft stiffness , then we ’ll get into “ kick ” .
In general your shaft ’s stiffness should be based on your club - head speed .
Normally if your swinging at or over 95 MPH you can start looking at stiff shaft instead of a regular , but I say “ looking ” loosely because again there are more factors than just swing speed .
And if you are swinging the club at around 115 MPH you can start looking into x -stiff shafts .
Two important factors that will come into play is your tempo and your swing type .
If your swing is smooth all the way through you may need a different shaft than a player that whips the club and has a more quick tempo swing .
Finally we must look at the shaft ’s characteristics as well , like the type of kick it will have .
All shafts are made with different “ kick ” points , in other words it ’s he point on the shaft where the club will effectively “ flex ” .
If you have a low kick shaft , the flex will be more towards the bottom of the shaft , mid kick will be a little higher and high kick will be well , high .
All these types of kick will affect the launch of the ball because the whip from the flex will either react quicker or slower depending or your swing .
This is something of a point of attention because it will have to be combined with the loft and spin from your club - head , which happens to be next on the menu .
Club Loft and Spin
Ideally no spin is good spin , the less spin you put on a drive , the further it will go .
That being said it is impossible to have no spin , and every swing you make is different so it will have to be tested with trial and error for the most part .
As I mentioned before the launch angle will depend on the loft of the club and your swing correlated with the kick from your shaft .
Normally this varies from 8 to 10 degrees of loft but you can find the odd driver with an exceptional loft .
The intention here is to get enough launch out of the club without having it go too high or having to much spin .
You want hang - time , not a balloon that looks like its coming back at you .
Brand Loyalty
Everybody has a favorite brand and you should always look to choose something you feel comfortable with , even if you might not have the perfect fitted driver .
If you cant find the right specifications for your club with the brand you want however , try other brands , because these days every company knows what works for clubs and they all use the same basic makes and models .
In fact if you look at one of the new driver ’s out there , the R9 , you can configure the kick of the shaft apparently and use the weights to change the ball flight even more .
That ’s pretty amazing for just one club , but it is n’t for everyone , so go try it out .
As they say though : 90 % of golf is mental , the other 10 % , is in your head .
So with that in mind have fun looking for exactly what you are looking for in a driver and I hope this had some helpful hints of direction towards your next purchase .
1 The Anglo - Zanzibar War : the shortest war in history , only 40 minutes long
Fought between the United Kingdom and Zanzibar on 27 August 1896 , the conflict lasted approximately 40 minutes , making it the shortest war in history .
The immediate cause of the war was the death of the pro-British Sultan Hamad bin Thuwaini and the subsequent succession of Sultan Khalid bin Barghash .
The British authorities preferred Hamud bin Muhammed as Sultan .
In accordance with a treaty signed in 1886 , a condition for accession to the sultancy was that the candidate obtain the permission of the British Consul , and Khalid had not fulfilled this requirement .
The British considered this a casus belli and sent an ultimatum to Khalid demanding that he order his forces to stand down and leave the palace .
In response , Khalid called up his palace guard and barricaded himself inside the palace .
The ultimatum expired at 09:00 on 27 August , by which time the British had gathered three cruisers , two gunships , 150 marines and sailors and 900 Zanzibaris in the harbour area .
A bombardment which was opened at 09:02 set the palace on fire and disabled the defending artillery .
The flag at the palace was shot down and fire ceased at 09:40 .
The Sultan ’s forces sustained roughly 500 casualties , while only one British sailor was injured .
2 The Pig War : triggered by the shooting of a pig
The Pig War was a confrontation in 1859 between American and British authorities over the boundary between the United States and British North America .
The specific area in dispute was the San Juan Islands , which lie between Vancouver Island and the North American mainland .
The Pig War , so called because it was triggered by the shooting of a pig , is also called the Pig Episode , the Pig and Potato War , the San Juan Boundary Dispute or the Northwestern Boundary Dispute .
The pig was the only “ casualty ” of the war , making the conflict essentially bloodless .
3 Three Hundred and Thirty Five Years ’
War : lasted over 335 years with no casualties
The Three Hundred and Thirty Five Years ’ War ( 1651 –1986 ) was a war between the Netherlands and the Isles of Scilly ( located off the southwest coast of the United Kingdom ) .
It is said to have been extended by the lack of a peace treaty for 335 years without a single shot being fired , which would make it one of the world ’s longest wars and the war with the fewest casualties .
Despite the uncertain validity of the declaration of war , peace was finally declared in 1986 .
4 Moldovan - Transdniestrian
War : where both sides ’ officers would drink together during the nights and fight during the days
After the Soviet Union collapsed , two - thirds of Moldova wanted closer ties with Romania and neighbors to the west .
But the area of the country to the east of the Dniestr river wanted to stay close to Ukraine and Russia .
War broke out , and the east split to form Transdniestria , which remains unrecognized by the world .
When Moldova and Transdniestria started fighting , it was a weird war .
The local military called it the Drunken War , as officers of the combatants met every night to have a drink together .
They went away in the morning and opened fire on each other .
At night , they got together again to drink for those they had met with the previous night and who they had killed .
5 Emu War : how Australia lost a war against birds
The Emu War , also known as The Great Emu War , was a week - long military operation undertaken in Australia in November 1932 to address public concern over the number of emus said to be running amuck in the Campion district of Western Australia .
The emus were responding to a long , hot summer , which caused shortages of food and water .
The “ war ” was conducted under the command of Major Meredith of the Royal Australian Artillery , commanding a force of soldiers armed with two Lewis machine guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition .
But shooting blindly into a group of birds which can run up to 50 km/h ( 30 mph ) did not brought the expected results .
The birds simply ran away even after being hit by a machine gun round .
Over the course of a week or so , only a handful of the estimated 20,000 birds were actually killed .
Major Meredith – the Australian commander in the “ Emu war ” – was astonished and famously compared the emus to Zulus .
After a few days the Defence Minister ordered a withdrawal .
And thus the “ Emu War ” ended in a military defeat for Australia .
6 The Football War : started with a football game
The Football War ( La guerra del fútbol , in Spanish ) , also known as the 100 - hours War , was a five - day war fought by El Salvador and Honduras in 1969 .
It was caused by political conflicts between Hondurans and Salvadorans , namely issues concerning immigration from El Salvador to Honduras .
These existing tensions between the two countries coincided with the inflamed rioting during the second North American qualifying round for the 1970 FIFA World Cup ; on 14 July 1969 , the Salvadoran army launched an attack against Honduras .
The Organization of American States negotiated a cease - fire which took effect on 20 July , with the Salvadoran troops withdrawn in early August .
El Salvador ended up going to the 1970 FIFA World Cup1970 FIFA World Cup , where they failed to advance from the Group Stage .
7 War of 1812 : caused by faulty telegraphic communications
Also called Mr. Madison ’s War , the War of 1812 was in many ways the strangest war in United States history .
It could well be named the War of Faulty Communication .
Two days before war was declared , the British government stated that it would repeal the laws which were the chief reason for fighting .
If there had been telegraphic communication with Europe , the war might well have been avoided .
The chief United States complaint against the British was interference with shipping .
But New England , the great shipping section of the United States , bitterly opposed the idea of going to war .
The demand for war came chiefly from the West and South .
It is strange also that the war , fought for freedom of the seas , began with the invasion of Canada .
In addition , the treaty of peace that ended the war settled none of the issues over which it had supposedly been fought .
Finally , both sides claimed victory in the War of 1812 , and it becomes clear that the whole struggle was a confused mass of contradictions .
She is aware of a risk but decides to go ahead
She believes the benefit outweighs the risk
She is aware of a risk and decides not to go ahead
After the triumphs of his recent collections , this was a risky show , entirely uncommercial and intentionally provocative , and it generated extreme reactions .
Dennis Freedman , the creative director of W , was visibly ecstatic watching the show ; but another magazine editor , afterward , compared the trash - bin styling to “ a collection inspired by Wall - E . ”
And some questioned whether Mr. McQueen , by including such obvious references to trash , was targeting John Galliano ’s version of Dior , which , in January 2000 , included a couture collection inspired by hobos and that led to protesters wearing plastic garbage bags outside the Dior ateliers on Avenue Montaigne .
Throughout his career , Mr. McQueen has relished pushing people ’s buttons , though maybe less obviously since moving his shows from London , where he had developed the reputation as the enfant terrible , to Paris in 2001 after he sold his company to the Gucci Group .
Mr. McQueen turns 40 next week , so he is no longer an enfant , though his work remains challenging and confrontational , especially this season , when it seems like the right moment for a deeper exploration .
While he is mocking the establishment for running circles over fashion history , is n’t Mr. McQueen as guilty as the rest ?
From 1997 to 2001 , he was the designer for Givenchy , one of the luxury brands owned by LVMH , and his tenure there was frequently marked by conflicts with management and mostly negative critical reviews .
Before he showed his first collection , succeeding Mr. Galliano , who had moved to Dior , Mr. McQueen offended many French journalists by declaring that the original work of Hubert de Givenchy was “ irrelevant . ”
Amy M. Spindler , the New York Times fashion critic , wrote of Mr. McQueen ’s couture debut in 1997 : “ This was basically a pretty hostile collection from a gifted designer who seems in conflict about his role in the Givenchy studio .
How members of the audience responded to the show depended on whether they were fascinated by that hostility and vulgarity or repelled by it . ”
The same could be said today .

During his early days in London , Mr. McQueen ’s collections were sometimes described as misogynistic .
The shows made audiences uncomfortable , and equally fascinated , most controversially in 1995 when he referenced the ravaging of Scotland by England by showing brutalized women in a collection called “ Highland Rape . ”
He later transformed models into animals with horns on their shoulders or wearing leather masks like falcons ; and in a 2000 collection , he showed models in a setting that looked like a mental hospital .
The historian Caroline Evans , in “ Fashion at the Edge , ” noted that McQueen ’s aesthetic of cruelty was actually culled from historic sources , “ the work of 16th - and 17th - century anatomists , in particular that of Andreas Vesalius , the photography of Joel - Peter Witkin from the 1980s and ’90s , and the films of Pasolini , Kubrick , Buñuel and Hitchcock . ”

The way zsh handles keyboard input can be completely customized .
However , often users run into problems , when their terminal emulator sends charactersequences for special keys , that zsh does n’t know about by default .
If you ’re here , because your special keys , like HOME , DEL etc. do n’t work .
Use the terminfo solution presented on this page .
It will work with almost all terminals on all systems , that provide terminfo ( even NetBSD has that these days ) .
And without any user - intervention .
See EmacsAndViKeys for keybinding nirvana .
zkbd – special keys solution
If you use several different terminal emulators , it ’s likely , that you ’ve run into the problem of neil , that pressing a special key like PageDown will just display a tilde instead of doing what it ’s supposed to .
There is a function described in zshcontrib ( 1 ) that reads and stores keydefinitions for special keys , if it recognizes a terminal , it has n’t seen before .
This is a snippet , that shows how it could be used :
autoload zkbd
function zkbd_file ( ) {
[ [ -f ~/.zkbd / $ {TERM}-${VENDOR}-$ {OSTYPE} ] ] && printf ‘% s ’ ~/”.zkbd /${TERM}-${VENDOR}-$ {OSTYPE} ” && return 0
[ [ -f ~/.zkbd / $ {TERM}-${DISPLAY} ] ] && printf ‘% s ’ ~/”.zkbd/${TERM}-${DISPLAY} ” && return 0
return 1
} [ [ ! -d ~/.zkbd ] ] && mkdir ~/.zkbd
keyfile= $ ( zkbd_file )
ret= $ ?
if [ [ $ {ret} - ne 0 ] ] ; then
zkbd
keyfile= $ ( zkbd_file )
ret= $ ?
fi
if [ [ $ {ret} - eq 0 ] ] ; then
source “ ${keyfile} ”
else
printf ‘ Failed to setup keys using zkbd .
’
fi
unfunction zkbd_file ; unset keyfile ret # setup key accordingly
[ [ -n “ $ key [ Home ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ Home ] ” beginning - of - line
[ [ -n “ $ key [ End ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ End ] ” end - of - line
[ [ -n “ $ key [ Insert ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ Insert ] ” overwrite - mode
[ [ -n “ $ key [ Backspace ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ Backspace ] ” backward - delete - char
[ [ -n “ $ key [ Delete ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ Delete ] ” delete - char
[ [ -n “ $ key [ Up ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ Up ] ” up - line - or - history
[ [ -n “ $ key [ Down ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ Down ] ” down - line - or - history
[ [ -n “ $ key [ Left ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ Left ] ” backward - char
[ [ -n “ $ key [ Right ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ Right ] ” forward - char reading $ terminfo [ ]
To get special keys working , you can also try to ask the terminfo database for the actual key sequences ; this requires a valid terminfo database for the terminal in question , but works in most cases and requires no user interaction .
The following snippet assigns data from the $ terminfo [ ] array to a $ key [ ] hash , that is compatible to the hash created by zkbd ( see above ) .
That makes it possible to switch back and forth between the zkbd solution and the terminfo solution in case something goes wrong .
# create a zkbd compatible hash ;
# to add other keys to this hash , see : man 5 terminfo
typeset - g - A key key [ Home ] =” $terminfo [ khome ] ”
key [ End ] = ” $terminfo[ kend ] ”
key [ Insert ] =” $terminfo[ kich1 ] ”
key [ Backspace ] =” $terminfo[kbs ] ”
key [ Delete ] =” $terminfo[ kdch1 ] ”
key [ Up ] = ” $terminfo[ kcuu1 ] ”
key [ Down ] =” $terminfo[ kcud1 ] ”
key [ Left ] =” $terminfo[ kcub1 ] ”
key [ Right ] =” $terminfo[ kcuf1 ] ”
key [ PageUp ] =” $terminfo[kpp ] ”
key [ PageDown ] =” $terminfo[ knp ] ” # setup key accordingly
[ [ -n “ $ key [ Home ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ Home ] ” beginning - of - line
[ [ -n “ $ key [ End ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ End ] ” end - of - line
[ [ -n “ $ key [ Insert ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ Insert ] ” overwrite - mode
[ [ -n “ $ key [ Backspace ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ Backspace ] ” backward - delete - char
[ [ -n “ $ key [ Delete ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ Delete ] ” delete - char
[ [ -n “ $ key [ Up ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ Up ] ” up - line - or - history
[ [ -n “ $ key [ Down ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ Down ] ” down - line - or - history
[ [ -n “ $ key [ Left ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ Left ] ” backward - char
[ [ -n “ $ key [ Right ] ” ] ] && bindkey — “ $ key [ Right ] ” forward - char # Finally , make sure the terminal is in application mode , when zle is
# active .
Only then are the values from $ terminfo valid .
if (( $ {+terminfo[ smkx ] } ) ) && (( $ {+terminfo[ rmkx ] } ) ) ; then
function zle - line- init ( ) {
echoti smkx
}
function zle - line - finish ( ) {
echoti rmkx
}
zle - N zle - line - init
zle - N zle - line - finish
fi CTRL - V – manually find out esc.- sequences
If you do n’t like automation like zkbd provides , you can get the keysequences like this :
In order to see the sequence to give to bindkey for the key you want , use quoted - insert ( control - V ) and press the key combination .
Another way to do this is to `cat > / dev/null` and then press the key combination .
So , in order to get bind something to your keyboard ’s delete key , you do :
% bindkey ” delete - char
That means you * literally * hit control - v followed by delete .
The angle - brackets are there for the sake of readability .
You DO NOT HAVE TO INCLUDE THEM , in order to get the proper sequence .
Also note , that the single - quotes are probably needed , do not leave them out .
Why is n’t Control - R working ( anymore ) ?
You are probably in vi-Mode , because you have set $ EDITOR or $ VISUAL to something starting with ‘ vi ’ .
And this question sounds a lot like you do not want that . 🙂
The quick fix is to simply switch to emacs - like keybindings via bindkey -e .
However , if you are sure that you want vi-bindings , issue the following commands to enable ‘ history - incremental - search - backward ’ in both vi-keytables :
bindkey -M viins ‘ ^r ’ history - incremental - search - backward
bindkey -M vicmd ‘ ^r ’ history - incremental - search - backward
Swapping Keys
If you would like to swap keys inside zsh ( like `~ ) , i.e. swap keys X and Y so typing X gives Y and vice versa ; check this post from Peter Stevenson :
Link : ZU # 9947 ( IMO the function is a bit too long for this page )
Most Wanted
Here are a few things , that users miss from time to time .
One of the things I most missed about bash when first switching to Zsh was that M-b and M-f ( backward - word and forward - word ) would jump over an entire / path / location , rather than to each word separated by a ‘/’.
To make the behavior more like bash , you can evaluate this command :
export WORDCHARS = ”
If you prefer , you can make WORDCHARS local to the definition of say , backword - word , so that kill - word still deletes an entire path .
To do this , you need to define a widget function .
For example , for backward - word , I use this :
tcsh - backward - word ( ) {
local WORDCHARS = ” $ {WORDCHARS:s@/@} ”
zle backward - word
}
zle - N tcsh - backward - word
PiyoPiyo :
This is what I use in my own setup :
# by default : export WORDCHARS =’*?_-. [ ]~=/&;!#$ %^( ){}<>’
# we take out the slash , period , angle brackets , dash here .
export WORDCHARS =’*? _[ ] ~=&;!#$ %^( ) {} ’
A question about binding keys :
The one emacs keybinging I really miss in zsh is Ctrl - LeftArrowKey ? and Ctrl- RightArrowKey ? as backward - word and forward - word .
I ca n’t seem to find out if it is possible to duplicate these keybindings in zsh .
Is the terminal able to distinguish between LeftArrowKey ? and Ctrl- LeftArrowKey ??
It does n’t seem to be from my investigations .
Has anybody done this ?
Can it be done ?

This appears to work :
bindkey ‘^ [ [ 5D ’ emacs - backward - word
bindkey ‘^ [ [ 5 C ’ emacs - forward - word
This works : – czo
My xterm ( KDE Konsole ) was showing “ ; 5D ” and “ ; 5 C ” , so I just used them instead :
bindkey ‘; 5D ’ emacs - backward - word
bindkey ‘; 5C ’ emacs - forward - word on my urxvt it works with -/- bindkey “ \e\e [ D ” backward - word
bindkey “ \e\e [ C ” forward - word – phelix
If you see such a key sequence , I would try using it before a custom remapping as described below .
–mattflaschen
a terminal has no knowledge of a Ctrl - Arrow keypress , BUT if you use a terminal emulator ( like xterm or rxvt under X11 ) you can assign an X keyboard event to a string sequence like ‘^ [ [ 5D ’ that you then use in bindkey .
Here is a line I have in my .
Xresources
XTerm*vt100 .
Translations : #override
\
Ctrl Left : string ( “ \033[90 ~ ” )
\
Ctrl Right : string ( “ \033[91 ~ ” )
I have remapped shift - enter ( using loadkeys for the console , and xmodmap in X ) to produce Ctrl - J and added
bindkey “ ^J ” self - insert
to my .zshrc .
Thus I can type multiline command lines , and still be able to move the cursor up / down between the lines while editing .
( This also works quite well with Ctrl - A and Ctrl - E , which if they ’re at the beginning / end of a line jumps to the beginning / end of the previous / next line . )

Just a reminder for you Londoners : the National Union of Journalists and the British Journal of Photographers are having a photo - in today at Scotland Yard , a demonstration against the outrageous new law that can put you in jail for ten years for taking a photo of a police officer " a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism "
We 'll be gathering at Scotland Yard today at 11 AM , cameras in hand , to make the point : Nineteen Eighty - Four was not a manual for statecraft .
Tomorrow , [ Ed : today ] Monday 16 February 2009 , the Counter - Terrorism Act 2008 will come into force , potentially making it a crime to take a picture of members of Her Majesty 's armed forces , including constables .
The Act amends the Terrorism Act 2000 regarding offences relating to information about members of armed forces , a member of the intelligence services , or a police officer .
The new set of rules , under section 76 of the 2008 Act and section 58A of the 2000 Act , will target anyone who 'elicits or attempts to elicit information about ( members of armed forces ) … which is of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism ' .
The penalty could be of up to 10 years in prison .
While BJP does not believe the Act will result in the imprisonment of photographers and photojournalists , we believe the Act could be abused by some police officers who are already loosely using Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 to prevent photographers from taking pictures in public places .
So , we have joined the National Union of Journalists ' call for photographers to make their voices heard at a media event on 16 February in front of New Scotland Yard .
The plan is simple , turn up with your camera and exercise your democratic right to take a photograph in a public place .

New tactic in the battle with extremism
By Richard Watson
BBC Panorama reporter
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Britain is once again searching for new answers to terrorism and radicalisation .
We may not have had a major terrorist attack since the London bombings of July 2005 but the ideological battle against al - Qaeda is being lost at home .
Take the case of Nicky Reilly , a young man with Asperger 's Syndrome who lived in Plymouth with his mother .
He was persuaded last year that he would join the ranks of the martyrs if he blew himself up in a packed family restaurant in Exeter .
Fortunately his bomb - making skills were poor , but what is worrying the security services is the intent - he had been convinced by as yet unknown hands that he was acting in the name of God.
Nicky Reilly , the gentle giant as he was known , had never stepped abroad but had been infected by al - Qaeda 's ideology in Britain .
Existing policy Recent demonstrations in London against Israeli attacks in Gaza are causing concern .
They have exposed the raw wounds of grievances felt by many Muslims about Britain 's stance on Muslim affairs abroad .
Legitimate political dissent was exploited by a minority of violent extremists to bolster their hatred of Britain .
" Let 's have a ... war " , one of them shouted as missiles were thrown at the police .
From this pool , new terrorists may come .
Bomb attacker Nicky Reilly was radicalised in the UK
So what action should the government take ?
They could continue with the existing policy called Preventing Violent Extremism .
This , as the title suggests , has been focused on those promoting violence .
Investigate them , place them under surveillance , prosecute or deport them , cut out the cancer of extremism and the threat will subside .
Well it has not proved as simple as that .
Judging by the number of terrorist plots under investigation by MI5 - more than 200 - there is no shortage of young Muslims who are learning to view Britain with hatred .
When the policy was set in 2006 the government was scared of alienating people so it set the bar of what was " unacceptable " very high .
In other words , only those at the far end of the extremist spectrum were to be challenged .
' Lesser of two evils '
The flipside to this meant that those who denounced violence but who promoted intolerance and held offensive , anti-British views were tolerated .
More than this , some radicals were even courted as part of our counter - terrorism strategy .
The idea was that so long as they denounced terror , other views would be ignored .
This was seen as the lesser of two evils - backing certain radicals even if they preached intolerance of homosexuals or women 's rights was seen as a way of protecting Britain .
The Gaza protests were illustrative of the divided loyalties some have But this has been a dangerous path and shows little sign of working .
The radicals took much succour from engagement with the state .
Advising the government or the police is an impressive calling card .
They can claim their deeply conservative views about life in Britain are being endorsed .
This has helped make these views seem legitimate in the eyes of ordinary Muslim citizens and has added to the climate of Islamic conservatism in Britain today .
Take a walk in any city with a large Muslim population and you will see that second and third generation Muslims are far more conservative than their parents .
Ayesha , a young woman I interviewed for my Panorama film Muslim First , British Second , is an example .
She is a medical school graduate who defends those who preach intolerance of homosexuals .
In terms of her faith , she is also more conservative than her liberal parents , covering herself with the niqab against their wishes .
Forced to change
Those driving counter - terrorism policy believe the old policy has failed .
As Panorama will reveal , the government is planning a new approach .
There will be much more emphasis on shared British values and those who preach intolerance will be shunned even if their views do not break the law .
And so the Preventing Violent Extremism policy will effectively change to Preventing Extremism .
Until now efforts have been focused on those who advocate violence
This shift will be uncomfortable for the police - they do not police ideas or ideology unless they contravene the law .
But it is right that they should be careful about who they back and who they fund .
Likewise the government will be more open about criticising Islamic radicals who preach against shared democratic values but stay on the right side of the law .
The argument comes down to the use of public money .
It certainly makes sense to sit down and talk with radicals , so long as they do not promote violence and are willing to act within the law .
For pragmatic reasons the police and counter - terrorism officers need lines of communication into radical communities .
Britain also has a long tradition of tolerating political dissent .
But moderate Muslims argue using taxpayers ' funds to support or endorse isolationist views makes little sense and the government is right to move against this now .
But this is a complex situation , the arguments are not black and white .
While cracking down on divisive preachers may make Britain more resilient to terrorism by creating a stronger sense of community cohesion , this is a 10 or 20 - year plan .
Grand sociological aspirations may be desirable but in the shorter term the police and MI5 must worry about the next attack .
Given there is little evidence that the appetite for extremism is fading , the government has little choice but to try a new approach .

" In the long run , we are all dead , " John Maynard Keynes once quipped .
An influential British economist , Keynes used the line to dodge the problematic long - term implications of his policy proposals .
His analysis of the Great Depression redefined economics in the 1930s and asserted that increased government spending during a downturn could revive the economy .
President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats ( very few of whom likely have read Keynes 's 1936 book " The General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money " ) have dug ...
While a majority of Americans believe the media is either correct or underestimating the threat of climate change , more than ever believe the threat is exaggerated .
According to an annual poll by Gallup on environmental issues 57 percent of American believe that the media is accurate ( 29 percent ) or underestimating ( 28 percent ) the threat of global warming , while 41 percent believes the media is exaggerating .
This is a 6 point jump from last year .
In the poll , Americans rated global warming last in a list of eight environmental problems .
The environmental issue that most Americans worry about ( 84 percent ) is pollution in drinking water .
Sixty percent of Americans say they worry about global warming , 65 percent worry about the extinction of animals and plants , and 68 percent worry about rainforest destruction .
Each of these three issues dropped in concern during the past year .
When asked if they believe if global warming will pose a serious threat in their lifetime only 38 percent of Americans answered in the affirmative .
Views vary widely by age , nearly half ( 47 percent ) of Americans over 61 believe global warming is exaggerated , while 31 percent think it is exaggerated of those under thirty .
The poll highlights the difficulty President Obama ’s administration may have in moving forward with climate change legislation , such as a cap and trade program .
Unlike his predecessor , President Obama has made climate change a serious priority for his administration .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government on Friday imposed the first increase in mileage standards for passenger cars and boosted the floor for sport utilities and pickups beginning with model year 2011 vehicles .
The modest increase of less than 1 mile per gallon for the fleet over current targets for the fleet represents an abbreviated approach by the Obama administration as it confronts industry distress and pressure from California and other states to set their own goals .
“ These standards are important steps in the nation ’s quest to achieve energy independence , ” said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood , who added that work on future mileage programs must take into account the health of U.S. manufacturers .
General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC are seeking new government bailouts to survive .
Ford Motor
Co is restructuring without government help .
The Detroit Three profited for years from larger and less efficient vehicles but now face the double wallop of a market downturn fueled by recession and a consumer shift away from their bread - and - butter products .
The standard , which is expected to cost industry $ 1.4 billion in vehicle design and other changes , would require compacts , sedans and other passenger cars to average 30.2 miles per gallon in combined city / highway driving , up from the 27.5 mpg standard that was established in the late 1970s under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy ( CAFE ) program .
Domestic and some major overseas manufacturers , through their top lobbyist , Dave McCurdy , called the regulation “ an important first step . ”
McCurdy urged the administration to bridge competing federal and state concerns on fuel efficiency and develop a cohesive national standard for 2012 - 15 .

Many passenger cars made by overseas manufacturers already meet or exceed the standard .
Toyota Motor Corp expects its 2010 Prius hybrid to get 46 mpg while estimates for the Insight hybrid made by Honda Motor Co is 41 mpg .
Detroit ’s efforts to revamp its fleet include the Ford Fusion hybrid sedan , due in showrooms this spring , that gets 41 mpg / city .
Light trucks , which include pickups and SUVs , would have to average 24.1 mpg in 2011 , compared with 23.5 mpg the previous year .
Overall fleet performance would be 27.3 mpg , a 2 mpg increase over 2010 , according to the 857 - page regulation .
The new standards would save nearly 900 million gallons of fuel and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 8.3 million metric tons over the lifetime of model year 2011 vehicles , the Transportation Department said .
The administration calculates more than $ 2 billion in overall benefits to consumers from the program , including less money spent on fuel .
Congress has required that the U.S. fleet of cars and light trucks average 35 mpg by 2020 , a 40 percent increase over today ’s performance .
The Bush administration sought to establish annual goals between 2011 - 2015 , but the Obama administration cut that back to one - year , 2011 , while it assesses the future of GM , Ford and Chrysler , factors in potential volatility of fuel costs , and weighs the attempt by California and a dozen other states to move in a different direction .
Current federal efficiency targets are based on vehicle size and calculated by the DOT ’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) , an approach favored by carmakers .
California has adopted and is seeking federal permission to enforce a separate standard based on emissions .

The end of the Pioneer Kuro line of TVs represented a true tipping point in the TV industry , one preceded by long - gestating momentum from opposing forces .
The recession and LCDs tipped over plasmas for good , and the slope downward will be quite steep , and fast .
Last week , Pioneer announced it was killing off its critically acclaimed TV business by March 2010 and will concentrate on car and audio / visual systems .
It was a dramatic fall for a company that just one year ago had CES abuzz with its newest plasma TV , the so - called “ Ultimate Black ” Kuro .
The Kuro ’s tech was impressive because it reduced light emissions from black areas of the screen to such a degree that at its maximum brightness , the contrast ratio was “ almost infinite . ”
The result was a plasma display with the most vibrant , colorful images yet .
But even at the hype ’s peak , problems in the plasma industry were apparent .
Plasmas were at their most popular from 2004 to 2006 , a period that saw them overtake rear - projection TVs as the top big -TV format .
But they had a tough time offsetting their lowest average prices with high sale volumes .
The spectre of LCDs also prompted many customers to hold off on making a purchase .
By February ’ 08 , soon after the recession had officially taken hold , premium - quality Pioneers seemed out of touch .
Most critically , LCDs were sporting features long the domain of plasma : bigger screens , greater contrast ratios , thinner and cheaper sets .
LCD picture quality still failed to reach plasma levels , but to average consumers , the difference was no longer obvious .
Fast - forward to the start of 2009 , and LCDs were outselling plasmas 8 - to - 1 globally , and the dominating the best - selling lists on Amazon.com .
Pioneer tried a last - ditch partnership with Panasonic to create a version of its plasma TVs , contributing its own “ secret sauce ” to keep the Kuro tech flowing , but that effort appears to be over .
The slumping demand is already having consequences : Projected losses of $ 1.41 billion in 2008 - 09 ( following a loss of $ 203 million in 2007 - 08 ) and a nearly 50 percent drop in operating revenue have set the scene for 10,000 jobs cuts and the closing of U.S. , UK and Japanese facilities .
But Pioneer ’s not the only TV maker suffering .
They ’re all taking it on the chin , regardless of display type .
Both Hitachi and Vizio had to end the bleeding by shuttering plasmas to concentrate on LCDs .
And not even the usually flush holiday period buoyed TV companies to a safe financial landing : Sony ( s sne ) , Panasonic , and LG all posted lower quarterly profits .
Component suppliers have similarly been unable to escape the pain .
As Om noted in recent posts , screen manufacturer Corning ( s glw ) posted fourth - quarter 2008 revenues of $ 1.1 billion and still had to let go of 3,500 jobs .
Pioneer ’s decision to end its plasma production was more complicated .
It bought out NEC ’s plasma business in 2004 , used it as an OEM for its glass , but was recently forced to shutter the unit .
Now , the only plasma manufacturers left standing are Panasonic , LG , and Samsung , all of which make their own components .
Panasonic is in good position to benefit from Kuro ’s death .
Most of the Pioneer engineers who came up with Kuro switched sides and are now working for Panasonic .
In addition , recent demos have shown that Panasonic plasmas are nearing Kuro quality .
Already in possession of the biggest plasma market share in the world ( at more than 35 percent ) , the company will be able to build a diversified product line using plasma TVs as a premium screen type that appeals to a niche that still wants them .
Add to that the fact that it receives significant revenues from selling its glass to other companies , including JVC and Fujitsu , and it appears that it ’ll be able to keep plasmas afloat longer than any other company .
Panasonic will inherit the burdens of the difficult economy and the LCD challenge , but once plasma is no longer economically feasible , its own LCDs will have likely caught up in picture quality .
In fact , ultimate black contrast tech is already getting closer to LCDs .
So it ’s only a matter of a few years ( maybe even less ) before plasmas finally die out .
As for Pioneer , not all is lost .
Reps say that the plasma
TVs only accounted for 14 percent of its business worldwide , and patents for the Kuro technology will provide a profit for awhile .
But any positives are bittersweet .
The legacy of the Kuro TV will be that it was another best - in - class technology that was humbled by the force of the economy and the competitive market .

A day after a leading industry analyst reported that Dell cancelled its smartphone due to lack of interest from cellular carriers , a new report says the PC maker ’s handset may be very much alive .
Speaking Tuesday in Japan , CEO Michael
Dell suggested his company is working on either a smartphone or a mobile Internet device , according to an IDG News Service report :
" We already have agreements with many mobile carriers around netbook devices , so it would n't be unreasonable to expect that we would have smaller mobile Internet devices or smartphones in the future . "
The statement seems to contradict an earlier report from Kaufman Bros. analyst Shaw Wu , who said Dell ’s planned smartphone was rejected by cell carriers , which deemed the device too dull to compete with stylish and popular handsets such as the Apple iPhone , RIM Blackberry , Samsung Omnia , and T - Mobile G1 .
It ’s feasible that Dell ’s first attempt at building a smartphone was truly lame , but that the company has multiple efforts under way .
Whatever the case , it ’s obvious that Dell wants into the wireless market in a big way .
Recent rumors even have it making a play for smartphone maker Palm , which is readying its highly anticipated Pre handset for launch .
Another sign that Dell ’s smartphone is n’t dead comes from the Commercial Times in Taiwan .
The newspaper reports that Dell has placed an order with electronics contract manufacturer Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. to build smartphones .
Michael Dell declined to comment on that report , according to IDG News .
Is Dell too boring to make a sexy , marketable smartphone ?
The kneejerk reaction is yes , given the company ’s history of drab , workmanlike design .
But Dell appears to be livening things up , as indicated by the recent rollout of its ultra-sleek Adamo notebook .
Let ’s hope the Dell Dude does n’t make a comeback to market the company ’s smartphone -- unless , of course , the handset has a built - in lighter .
Democracy or dictatorship ?
When it comes to designing the best product , is it better to have a determined leader who 's willing to sacrifice all to fulfil a vision , or a multi- member ruling party where everyone has a say ?
It 's the question that has once again come to the fore with the launch of the HTC Dream , Google 's first Android phone in Australia .
The Android mobile platform is the result of a collaboration of companies , led by Google , called the Open Handset Alliance ( OHA ) .
The goal of the OHA - currently made up of 47 technology and mobile companies - is to build an open and free mobile platform .
A noble cause indeed .

Israeli researchers say they 've developed a way to modify nuclear fuel so that it can be used only in power plants , and can't be recycled later to build nuclear weapons .
Lead researcher Yigal Ronen says the
work could help " de - claw " some countries if nuclear fuel producers - the US , Russia , Germany , France and Japan - agree to put the denaturing additive they have proven effective into all plutonium [ Jerusalem Post ] .
Israeli scientists suggest in their study that the element americium be added to the fuel at a level of 0.1 percent [ Israel National News ] .
According to their research , the addition would neutralize the fissile plutonium produced by nuclear reactors , making that " denatured " plutonium unusable in a weapon .
The research will be published in the journal
Science and Global Security
next month .
Ronen explains that when a country purchases a nuclear reactor from one of the five nuclear fuel producers , the sale includes nuclear fuel for the reactor .
" Thus , if the five agree to insert the additive into fuel for countries now developing nuclear power - such as Bahrain , Egypt , Kuwait , Libya , Malaysia , Namibia , Qatar , Oman , United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia and Yemen - they will have to use it for peaceful purposes rather than warfare " [ The Register ]
, says Ronen .
However , the researchers say that countries with more advanced nuclear programs , like Iran , have other ways to produce weapons - grade fuel .
Ronen explains that Iran has other options besides recycling spent fuel if it wants to make nuclear weapons : Iran has
centrifuges like those Iraq had , and small plutonium reactors .
" Our work could solve only one part of the problem .
The reality is more complicated , and denaturing is not relevant for Iran 's other options .
Iran would be able to continue to threaten the world with the other two options if the world does n't stop it , " he explained [ Jerusalem Post ] .
The news comes just as the
U.N. nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , is looking into U.S. intelligence reports that Syria had almost built a North Korean - designed , nuclear reactor meant to yield bomb - grade plutonium before Israel bombed it in 2007 .
Last month , the IAEA said inspectors had found enough traces of uranium in soil samples taken in a trip to the bombed site granted by Syria last June to constitute a " significant " find , and satellite pictures taken before the Israeli bombing revealed a building resembling a reactor [ Reuters ] .

Sophos Security is warning that the Conficker / Downadup worm ( " Conficker worm " ) is targeting multiple domains -- including Southwest airlines -- that could end up causing Denial of Service ( DoS ) attacks and temporary disruptions .
The Conficker worm has been kicking around since last year and usually spreads via a ) removable storage devices such as USB drives and b ) network sharing .
It exploits a Windows vulnerability that was patched by Microsoft last year .
According to a blog entry by Mike Wood of SophosLabs Canada , those computers infected with the Conficker worm are programmed to contact wnsux.com , which will redirect visitors to the main Southwest.com site on March 13 .
( Source : sophos.com )
Conficker and Southwest : Why Tango ?
The problem with a legitimate site like Southwest.com making it onto Conficker 's radar ?
Wood gives two reasons : without proper investigation , Southwest may end up on a blocklist , and users will be prevented from accessing their services .
In addition , millions of infected machines contacting the domain on the 13th may overload the site and shut it down .
( Source : cnet.com )
Wood says the worm is targeting about 7,750 domains of which nearly 3,900 are active , but only resolve to 42 unique IP addresses .
Of those , only 28 are involved in a covert operation of ISPs and others trying to thwart Conficker / Downadup by pre-registering domains .
The vast majority of those 28 domains are currently up for sale .
Key Sites Targeted By Conficker / Downadup
Key sites listed by Wood whose visitors may see a disruption in service include :
jogli.com -- Big Web Great Music -- March 8
wnsux.com -- Southwest Airlines -- March 13
qhflh.com -- Women 's Net in Qinghai Province -- March 18
praat.org --
Doing phonetics by computer -- March 31
Other less frequented sites of interest that appeared on the list include ' The Tennesse Dogue De Bordeaux ' dog breeders site ( tnddb.com -- March 14 ) and the ' Double Super Secret Message Board ' site ( dssmb.com -- March 11 ) . ( Source : sophos.com )
Wood contacted the owners of the domains to draw their attention to the problem , and thankfully Southwest Airlines has already taken action to prevent the attacks .
Solutions for network administrators to combat the problem were offered in the post by Wood from SophosLabs Canada .
If you have n't done so already , make sure you apply the patch from Microsoft to prevent your computer from being exploited .

However , there are a multitude of consoles for sale , all offering various perks .
It can be tough to know exactly what to buy .
Understanding how the top consoles stack up against the competition will help you know exactly which console is the right one for you .
Best Stationary Gaming Systems
1. Sony Playstation 3 Slim ( 160GB )
Since the release of the original Playstation in 1994 , Sony has been on top when it comes to offering quality gaming consoles to the masses .
In fact , the second generation Playstation , more commonly known as the PS2 , is still on the market and is recognized as the most successful gaming console to date , outselling every other platform available .
The Sony Playstation 3 builds on this success .
Price : $ 250
Pros :
Full of Features .
The Playstation 3 is packed full of features designed to delight a wide variety of media connoisseurs .

Energy Efficient .
First of all , the new Slim version uses a lot less energy than the former “ fat ” version .
This actually has an impact on a couple of key elements : your utility bill and placement of the device .
Since the PS3 uses less energy , it emits less heat and is less prone to overheating like its power - gulping predecessor .
This allows you to keep your console in your entertainment cabinet with your other peripherals instead of setting it on your floor or on an open shelf for proper ventilation .

Wi - Fi Integration .
The PS3 console has built - in WiFi , which allows you to connect to streaming video services , the online gaming community , the Playstation Network , and the Playstation Store wirelessly , keeping cable clutter to a minimum .
You can easily download content ( movies , games , and more ) directly to your PS3 from the Playstation Store .
And Sony even added a fully functional web browser to the mix , making it easy to access your Facebook page , YouTube , or other Internet - based content in a snap .
Who would n’t want to see their profile picture on the big screen ?

Online Player Community .
What ’s truly exceptional about the Playstation Network is that , unlike Xbox Live , access to the Playstation Network is free .
Cons :
Lacks Backward Capability With Previous Models .
The only major flaw with the PS3 is its lack of backwards compatibility with PS2 games .
Every other Playstation console has this capability , and with so many worthy PS2 games on the market today , this is problematic .

No Infrared Remote Compatibility .
While the Bluetooth connectivity of the wireless remotes is n’t really a con , the lack of an infrared detector for non-Bluetooth remotes is .
This means that you are pretty much stuck buying Bluetooth remotes from Sony directly or another Bluetooth remote manufacturer , which equals more expensive remote controls .

Lack of Maturity of Playstation Network .
The Playstation Network is n’t quite as mature as Xbox Live in terms of features and connecting online players together , but it is slowly becoming a more robust experience .

Requires the Purchase of a Stand to Be Placed Upright .
In the previous version , the console was designed to be stored either horizontally or vertically , your choice .
The new slim version on its own can only be placed horizontally , but Sony did decide to market a stand into which you can slide your console vertically without the worry of it tipping over .
Sony did itself a huge disservice by not making the PS3 Slim a backwards - compatible console with the PS2 platform .
This would have put them well over the top of all the competing systems out there .
But , that being said , the superior Blu-ray player , up - converting DVD player functionality , and wireless network capabilities makes this console a welcome addition to any multimedia - loving household .
2. Microsoft Xbox 360 Slim ( 250GB )
The biggest claim to fame for the Xbox was that Microsoft managed to get their next - generation gaming system , Xbox 360 , to market before Nintendo or Sony could , giving it a strong competitive edge .
The addition of the Xbox Live online gaming community catapulted it to the top position rather quickly , where it has managed to live comfortably for quite some time .
Price : $ 299
Pros :
Large Title Availability .
The biggest advantage that the Xbox has over the Playstation 3 is game title availability .
Maybe it ’s because the Xbox was the first on the scene when it comes to high - definition video gaming , or maybe Microsoft just has a stable of prolific game writers , but whatever the reason , there are simply more titles available for the Xbox than for the PS3 .

Cons :
Overheating Issues .
In the early days , Xbox 360 was plagued by overheating units that caused catastrophic failure in one out of every four units .
The Xbox 360 Slim has added a better cooling function , but even this may not be enough to prevent the “ red ring of death . ”

Lastly , Microsoft got a little stingy and did n’t include any HDMI cables in the box , so if true high - def gaming is what you seek , plan on buying your own HDMI cable .
The Xbox 360 Slim is very similar to the original Xbox 360 console , so if Xbox is your thing , I would n’t replace your existing system with this one , unless your three - year warranty against the red ring of death is about to expire .
The availability of game titles and the quality of the Xbox Live online gaming network are the real claims to fame for the Xbox 360 , giving it a slight edge over its competition – at least , if these are attributes that you value in a gaming system .
3. Nintendo Wii Mario Kart Bundle
In the world of high - powered , high - definition gaming systems , the Nintendo Wii left quite a bit to be desired .
However , it was the first and notably the best “ live action ” video gaming system , meaning that the Wii encouraged tons of couch potato gaming enthusiasts to get off the couch and move around .
Price : $ 180
Pros :
User Remote .
The one thing that set the Nintendo Wii apart from its competitors is its unique remote , which you can move around to control the game .

Wi - Fi Integration .
Of course , the Wii is lacking many of the features that make the PS3 and Xbox 360 so great , but this is reflected in its $ 150 price tag .
Online connectivity exists , but is limited by some technology issues .
You can connect with other users online and play multi-player games over the Internet thanks to a built in WiFi connection , but there is currently no online gaming community .
Nintendo announced this past January plans to create such a feature for Wii U users that would mimic the communities offered by Xbox Live and the Playstation Network .
Cons :
No Integrated Browser .
As I mentioned previously , the online connectivity for this device could be an issue , but without an integrated browser to support , you really could n’t call it a con .

Heck , you ca n’t even stream from any video service other than Netflix .

Remedial Game Graphics .
The game graphics are cartoonish and outdated when compared to the offerings of other consoles , but the games are fun and family friendly nonetheless .
And , of course , the novelty of motion game play is no longer exclusive to the Wii .
The Xbox 360 has introduced Kinect and the PS3 has Move .
The Wii gaming system is fun , but is on its way out .
Casual gamers will enjoy playing “ Wii Sports ” and “ Mario Kart ” for years to come , but hardcore gamers will avoid this console like the plague .
It ’s a good thing that there are so many family friendly quality games available for the Wii , as this will help keep it relevant for a few more years .
Best Portable Gaming Systems
It ’s pretty hard to name the “ best ” overall portable system , as there are really only two manufacturers that offer anything notable .
However , both of these systems are wildly popular and are worth mentioning .
1. Nintendo 3DS
Nintendo has long been the leader in portable gaming systems , and the newest iteration of its best - selling DS series , the Nintendo 3DS , is no slouch .
The no-glasses - required 3D gaming experience is quite a bit better than most expected , though the weak launch title availability slightly hampered Nintendo .
Price : $ 180
Pros :
Good 3D Gaming Functionality .
The main claim to fame for this particular system is its ability to produce a good 3D gaming experience , no glasses required .
I love the fact that Nintendo added a 3D “ slider ” that allows each gamer to adjust the 3D experience to their own preferences , and even remove it if they so choose .
This feature helps reduce eye strain during game play .

Wide Range of Preloaded Software .
The preloaded software allows your 3DS to not only recognize WiFi hotspots , but to also “ sniff out ” other 3DS consoles within certain proximity and “ invite ” the other players into multi-player game play .
This is actually a really cool feature , since most of the portable gaming devices have been a solo game playing endeavor .
Cons :
Lack of 3D Titles .
Thank goodness this unit has a backwards compatibility function because the existing library of 3D games is lackluster .

Eye Strain Issues .
While the 3D game play feature is awesome and amazing for some , it can cause eye strain and headaches for others .
I would definitely advise potential customers to take this one on a test drive before diving in head first .

Short Battery Life .
The battery is extremely short - lived .
I ’m not sure what the issue is , though I imagine the energy needed to produce the 3D image must be placing a strain on the battery , which is no doubt the same model found in the 2D versions that have been on the market for some time .
The Nintendo 3DS is the first and so far only 3D gaming system on the market today .
This makes it the best in its category , though with the immense popularity of the DS gaming systems , this newest system would have probably been a big hit without the 3D feature .
There are tons of games available both in physical form and for download , and the ability to play other players via a Bluetooth connection makes this a best pick for anyone looking for a full featured portable gaming system .
2. Sony PSP 3000
The Sony PSP , or Playstation Portable , is one of the most feature - rich portable gaming platforms I ’ve ever experienced .
This device is a true portable entertainment system , allowing users to play fully functional miniature versions of the same titles available on the PS2 or PS3 .
It also offers audio playback functionality , video playback functionality , expandable storage via SD card slots , and an integrated WiFi system coupled with a fully functional browser .
Price : $ 130
Pros :
Sleek Design .
This is a sleek - looking gaming device that does so much more than play video games .

Tough Internet Navigation .
The web browser is fully functional , but a little tough to get information entered into .
Furthermore , there is no support for streaming media services , so if you want to watch video you ’ll need to bring it with you in the form of a UMD disc or via memory card .
This portable gaming system is definitely head and shoulders above the Nintendo 3DS , but many consider it second fiddle .
Regardless , for those of you who are looking for a solid gaming system , you wo n’t be disappointed here .
Final Word
Gaming systems are as unique as the gamers who play them .
Depending on the functionality you are looking for , your interpretation of which one is best may greatly differ from someone else ’s opinion .
Consider your needs carefully before deciding which is the right system for you .
Do you have any experience with gaming systems ?
What do you consider to be the best ?
EPA
THE power plant that heats Congress produces more carbon dioxide than any other facility in Washington , DC .
It is almost 100 years old and runs partly on coal , a grubby fuel .
Last week , protesters marched on it , urging Congress to cut its own emissions of greenhouse gases and to oblige the rest of America to do so as well .
The first demand was easily met : the leaders of the House of Representatives and the Senate instructed their staff to convert the plant to run on natural gas , which burns more cleanly than coal .
But the second one is proving trickier .
Congress is just beginning to grapple with laws to regulate greenhouse gases ( see article ) , at the behest not just of protesters but also of Barack Obama , who has long advocated vigorous measures to curb global warming .
Bringing about a wholesale change in America 's energy supply will be a challenge , to say the least .
And the sort of measures that are currently finding favour in Washington will make it harder still .
The president is right to want to cut emissions .
The alternative , allowing climate change to take its course , would be far more damaging to America and the world .
The economic impact of rising sea levels , reduced crop yields , fiercer storms and many other doleful consequences would be devastating .
But fighting climate change will be costly .
It will involve swapping cheap but dirty fuels for cleaner but dearer ones , as Congress intends , as well as building lots of expensive new power plants to replace older , more polluting ones .
That in turn will lead to higher electricity and fuel prices .
Despite the president 's airy talk of green jobs , cutting emissions , by almost all calculations , will increase costs for most businesses and families .
Those extra costs must be kept to a minimum .
Mr Obama 's preferred device for cutting emissions , a cap - and - trade scheme , is designed to do just that .
It involves placing a limit on the volume of emissions that can be produced around the country each year , and then auctioning tradable permits to pollute .
The intention is to encourage firms that find it cheap to cut emissions to do so , while allowing those with no easy means to pollute less to buy permits instead .
Politicians and bureaucrats , meanwhile , do not need to identify where emissions cuts should be made ; the market takes care of that for them .
Sunshine and moonshine
Many congressmen are unconvinced .
There is a general worry that the required emissions cuts will be harder than expected to find , pushing up the cost of the permits and thus flattening an already slouching economy .
And there are particular fears that , even if the system works well enough overall , states that rely heavily on coal , heavy industry or some other sooty activity will suffer badly .
Both the president and cap - and - trade 's supporters in Congress seem inclined to respond with subsidies for pet technologies that might help those hardest hit , or with mandates to cut emissions in particular ways .
The president , for example , wants to double the amount of electricity that comes from renewables , meaning wind farms , solar - power plants and the like .
Handouts for hybrid cars and for coal plants with low emissions are also popular .
The main effect of these schemes would be to raise the costs of cutting emissions .
Much of the money doled out by the government would inevitably be wasted , adding to the overall bill for fighting climate change .
Worse , such measures would risk distorting the carbon market , steering private capital as well as public money away from the cheapest technologies and towards those that have caught the eye of the politicians .
Under the stimulus bill , renewables benefit from a tax credit , grants , loan guarantees and an expensive overhaul of the electric grid .
No wonder that each tonne of emissions avoided thanks to the measures in the stimulus to encourage renewable energy would cost somewhere between $ 69 and $ 137 , according to a recent study .
Under a cap - and - trade scheme , the price would be less than $ 15 to begin with , by most accounts .
There are some green things on which the government could usefully spend money .
Investments in energy efficiency — of which the stimulus package included a lot — are particularly worthwhile .
Increasing the budget for advanced scientific research may yield technological breakthroughs .
But on the whole , government intervention is only likely to raise the cost of mitigating climate change .
Fat handouts may make the politics of going green easier in the short run , but in the long run they will make it harder .

I write a lot about the FOX stock shows as well as the CNBC network because they are completely unbalanced while they scream at anything that tries to regulate Wall Street .
And they need to have their wingnut welfare tax breaks too .
D - day has a great post up that discussed the abuses that are being documented against CNBC and Jim Cramer in particular :
Obviously , Wall Street rage is aimed at getting the biggest banks paid off and the shareholders made whole so that only taxpayers will bear the burden of the collapse .
There may be a very good reason , however , for outlets like CNBC , in particular Jim Cramer , to claim that Obama is responsible for the fall of the market .
It deflects the blame from themselves .
The story of Deep Capture is epic and needs to be read in full by the investigators who followed it for years to really understand .
But TocqueDeville at Daily Kos does a pretty decent summarizing job .
This rabbit hole involves the thugs surrounding Jim Cramer and some of the top financial " journalists " from the New York Times , WSJ , Fortune magazine and BusinessWeek , top hedge funds , the Mafia , and the DTCC .
It also includes " blackmail , smear campaigns , espionage , fraud , harassment , extortion , bribery , rumor - mongering , sabotage , off - shore money laundering , political cronyism , frivolous lawsuits , witness tampering , biased financial research , false identities , bogus credit ratings , bribery , libelous blogs , bad science , forgery , wiretapping , counterfeiting , collusion , lying , cheating , threats and theft . "
And if that was n't fun enough , it may be the underlying story of what collapsed the entire , global banking system or at least served as the catalyst for the collapse .
We 're talking about financial journalists using the power of their megaphone to trash a stock , or even tout it at the last minute , and then , through naked short - selling , earn millions while destroying public companies .
And Jim Cramer is perhaps the greatest offender .
There needs to be an investigation into the use of the media outlets for ill - gotten gain .
Kind of like Bernie Madoffs for Cable TV .
Every stock show I watch just attacks President Obama 's economic plans mercilessly as if he caused the international crisis the world faces , while they themselves were willing players in the entire charade .
Jon Stewart hit a nerve when he exposed them on his show , which probably took all of a week to put together .
And their response to him was just as ridiculous as the " news " they peddle .
Erin Burnett was so bad on Real Time Friday night that Bill Maher called one of her answers " bullshit . "
Digby saw it too .
I just saw Erin Burnett on Bill Maher and I honestly think Britney Spears could do as well .
She said that nobody on the left and nobody on the right wants nationalization .
And then she said , " At the end , the taxpayers will probably get a check and it will be used to save social security . "
Is n't it in the best interest of America that these networks , with their stranglehold on broadcast information , become regulated ?
Not in an overwhelming way , but in a way that forces them to present hard news , objective information , about the very subjects they cover ?
These networks are the information pipeline to the people .
It 's how we get the data we need on what our money is doing .
And when the people running those pipelines are permitted to lie , distort , slant , and finally manipulate that data for the purposes of getting rich -- and to hell with how it affects the global economy -- then it 's time to make some changes .
TocqueDeville of DKos writes a great post called : Jim Cramer Uses CNBC to Manipulate Stocks that d- day cites and it's well worth a read .
Graham wants spending bill vetoed but own earmarks kept David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Sunday March 8 , 2009
Print This Email This President Obama has been catching flak for his intention to sign a $ 410 billion omnibus spending bill if it passes the Senate on Monday .
The bill includes some 9000 earmarks , distributed among members of both parties , and Republicans like Senator John McCain have been condemning it as pork - laden .
" Should the president veto this bill ? " NBC host David Gregory asked Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) on Sunday .
" I 'll leave that up to the president , " Graham replied .
" I wish he would veto the bill .
We 'd get back together and come up with an earmark reform process . "
Obama campaigned last fall on a promise not to sign any legislation that was loaded with earmarks , but his administration apparently believes that arguing over the details of the stopgap bill -- which was originally written under the Bush administration to authorize spending for the current fiscal year -- would be a distraction from focusing on next year 's budget .
" We want to just move on , " budget director Peter Orszag recently stated .
" Let 's get this bill done , get it into law and move forward . "
Orszag did go on to insist , " We want to make sure that earmarks are reduced and they 're also transparent .
We 're going to work with the Congress on a set of reforms to achieve those , "
Graham similarly told Gregory that he is not opposed to " members designating money to be spent in their state as long as it has a federal purpose , is transparent , and people understand what the money 's going to be spent for . "
Gregory then pointed out that Senator John McCain has been railing on Twitter about Graham 's own earmark of $ 950,000 for a convention center in Myrtle Beach , South Carolina .
" I voted to take all earmarks out , but I will come back in the new process and put that back in , " Graham insisted , saying that the convention center is important to stimulate the local economy .
" I think I should have the ability as a United States senator to direct money back to my state as long as it's transparent and it makes sense . "

Partial transcript
GREGORY : Now , Senator McCain pointed out this is a bipartisan disease , 40 % of the earmarks are from Republicans .
At $ 7 billion .
should the president veto this bill ?
GRAHAM : I 'll leave that up to the president .
We do need earmark reform .
I wish he would veto the bill , get back together and come up with the reform process .
Senator McCain does not object to members of Congress designating money to be spent in their state as long as it has a federal purpose , is transparent and equal to understand what the money is going to be spent for .
We 'll have a say about whether or not it 's a good idea .
That system does n't exist .
I think it would be good for the country if the president and Senator McCain could meet soon -- sooner rather than later , to come up with a package .
GREGORY : And yet Senator McCain has given you a hard time .
He 's on twitter .
Number six on his list of pork barrel spending $ 950,000 for a convention center in Myrtle Beach , South Carolina .
You want the president to veto the spending bill ?
GRAHAM : I voted to take all earmarks out but I will come back in the new process and put that back in .
Myrtle Beach , South Carolina , we 're trying to build an international airport , an international convention center , and open up a new interstate highway to diversify Myrtle Beach 's economy .
This came through the Small Business Administration .
GREGORY : You have 37 earmarks .
Do you think they 're more important than other people 's projects ?
GRAHAM : I think I should have the ability as a United States Senator to direct money back to my state as long as it's transparent and makes sense , yes .

America Has Achieved Victory in Iraq
North Star Writers Group ^ | November 24 , 2008 | Paul Ibrahim
Posted on by Dukes Travels
We have won the Iraq War .
It was a war that saw many enemies , from both within and outside of Iraq .
It was a war that started out without sufficient troops and with dreadful policies on the ground .
And it was a war that saw vigorous attempts of premature withdrawal from within the side that eventually won it .
So it took five years , but with the help and sacrifice of the bravest troops on Earth , we did it .
We still have some cleanup to do , yet it is clear and unambiguous that we have won .
In March 2003 , Iraq was still ruled by one of historys most vicious tyrants .
Saddam Hussein had started wars with his neighbors and launched ruthless campaigns against his own people .
He had used weapons of mass destruction on his own civilians .
He had violated numerous United Nations resolutions .
He built palaces while he starved his people .
He and his two sons received intense thrill and gratification from personally torturing and killing other human beings .

Yes we DID win militarily in Iraq .
Like we won militarily in WW1 and WW2 .
And it was a military victory we really needed .
Saddam was a destabilizing menace who needed to be eliminted for an entire host of valid reasons .
But like WW1 and WW2 , we lost the peace .
We replaced an anit - western Baathist Dictator with a popularly elected anti-American Islamist “ Decmocracy ” ( as closely as that term can be defined in the Islamic mind ) .
The average Iraqi has come away from this experience with very little fondness or appreciation for what we did .
This should not be a surprise as they are Muslims and we are not .
The Saudis came out ahead as did the Gulf Oil states , which , aside from use of a limited area for military staging , contributed not one dollar , not one soldier and not one life to struggle which greatly benefitted their own security .
And once we pull out of Iraq militarliy , it will relapse into the kind of mindless , anarchic , violent society typical of any Islamic polity unless a strong dictator comes along and imposes a degree of military stability on it .

We ’ve won virtually nothing in Iraq unless the government situation is straightened out .
If that does n’t happen , all we ’ve done militarily will be for naught .
Getting rid of Hussein will be but a minor footnote .
IMO , we should have kept more of an eye on Afghanistan and Pakistan .

But when I read about the Iraqi government making overtures to Iran , Red China and working out a deal to have U.S. soldiers tried in Iraqi courts for alleged “ crimes ” committed off - base ( presumably while killing insurgents trying to overthrow the Iraqi government )
I get the feeling they really are n't all that fond of us but merely are taking advantage of a Dhimmi “ tool ” available for the moment .
My guess is the individual Iraqis that our military interact with personally like us - the few that do n't are n't likely to express their opinions as such right now .

We also have the dramatic increase in violence against Chaldean and Assyrian Christians whose ancestors lived there in thriving civilizations when all the Arabs were still in the desert chasing Camels , and I come away with a bitter angry feeling in my mouth .
IT seems like our Middle Eastern policies have recently been policies designed mainly to benefit the Wahhabist fanatics who control Saudi Arabia and their correligionsts in the Gulf States .
Even recently , with the seizure of oil tankers by Somali MUSLIM pirates , the Saudis expected non-Arabs to assume the military burden and loss of life of protecting THEIR oil .
Frankly , I HATE the Saudis and feel pretty much the same about all Muslims .
They hate us in general and everything the west represents , even if SOME of them INDIVIDUALLY do n't hate some of us INDIVIDUALLY .

We took the most secular state in the Middle East and a population who bore the American people no grudge — a potential ally that could anchor a new Western - neutral state , and in our haste to depose a nasty piece of work ( that we helped arm ) plunged said population into chaos that will outlive many of us .
Just because your thumb is purple does n’t mean you have democracy .
We wasted our brave soldiers , we wasted our money and as a country we sullied our good name .
Why ?
Beacuse we could .
Sad , sad waste because of the hubris of a few .
If that is winning ... well , enjoy the parade .

Interesting first post there , so a Saddam Hussein led Iraq was a potential ally who could anchor a new Western - neutral state ?

Java 7 will include several improvements in the collections and concurrency libraries under JSR 166y .
One addition is a new interface called TransferQueue and a corresponding implementation called LinkedTransferQueue .
TransferQueue extends Blocking Queue which extends Queue interface added in Java 5 and adds some new methods .
Blocking Queue expresses the concept of a queue that a producer can block when adding items to a queue until there is space avaliable or a consumer can block when removing an item from the queue until an item exists .
TransferQueue takes this one step further and blocks on put until the item is actually consumed by a consumer ( not just added to the queue ) .
This new constraint is expressed in the key new method called transfer ( ) .
The name is very descriptive – because the blocking occurs until a hand - off is complete from one thread to another , you are effectively transferring the item between threads ( in a way that properly creates happens - before relationships in the Java Memory Model ) .
Several other methods are included as well : two forms of tryTransfer ( ) that perform a transfer but are either non-blocking ( transfer only if it can be done immediately ) or with a timeout .
And then there are a couple of helper methods hasWaitingConsumer ( ) and getWaitingConsumerCount ( ) .
When I first read about TransferQueue , I was immediately reminded of the existing SynchronousQueue implementation , which provides a queue with size 0 .
That seemed inherently useless when I originally looked at it but I ’ve since found it to be one of the most useful queue implementations in the collections framework , specifically for this use case of handing off an item from one thread to another .
TransferQueue is more generic and useful than SynchronousQueue however as it allows you to flexibly decide whether to use normal Blocking Queue semantics or a guaranteed hand - off .
In the case where items are already in the queue , calling transfer will guarantee that all existing queue items will be processed before the transferred item .
Doug Lea says that capability - wise , LinkedTransferQueue is actually a superset of ConcurrentLinkedQueue , SynchronousQueue ( in “ fair ” mode ) , and unbounded LinkedBlocking Queues .
And it ’s made better by allowing you to mix and match those features as well as take advantage of higher - performance implementation techniques .
Joe Bowbeer helpfully provided a link to a paper by William Scherer , Doug Lea , and Michael Scott that lays out the LinkedTransferQueue algorithms and performance tests showing their improvements over the existing Java 5 alternatives .
LinkedTransferQueue outperforms SynchronousQueue by a factor of 3 x in unfair mode and 14 x in fair mode .
Because SynchronousQueue is used as the heart of task handoff in something like ThreadPoolExecutor , this can result in similar kinds of performance improvements there .
Given the importance of executors in concurrent programming , you start to see the importance of adding this new implementation .

It 's nine degrees Fahrenheit in Moscow right now .
That 's the kind of cold that makes a man concentrate on his work so he can keep from remembering that the tears the wind blows out of his eyes will freeze on the side of his face before they hit the ground .
In the middle of this icebox , Dmitry Zavalishin is cooking up a new operating system .
He calls it Phantom .
Phantom is a different approach on the OS than any other out there , with the primary goal of being immortal .
In Phantom , powering off the computer will not cause programs to lose state .
They can pick up where they left off as soon as the machine is turned back on .
There are a few obvious uses to this sort of technology - medical , military , and mobile - where automatic state preservation will save the programmer from a lot of mistakes and wasted time .
But there 's also a possibility that the increased productivity may give Phantom some headway into the commercial server market .
To accomplish this automatic state preservation , Phantom continuously snapshots system memory on to disk .
At first glance , that seems like a big synchronization problem :
All the programs running should have to pause while the snapshot process reads their internal state .
However , if you design the operating system around this goal , the process is n't that intense .
The fundamental competency of Phantom is creating this snapshot cheaply , without disturbing current processes .
As a side effect of this design principle , Phantom 's programming model is different from what developers are used to .
To store persistent data in something like Windows or Linux , you need to explicitly write it to a file .
Inventing an object serialization scheme can be tricky and error - prone , especially if your object structure is highly connected .
Some languages , like Java , provide basic serialization functionality , but in complicated programs , you still need to remember exactly what state needs to be persisted through invocations of the code .
For example , in something like Microsoft Word , you can't just save the user 's document to disk .
You have to know whether they checked the “ bother me every four seconds with helpful hints " or freeze the system for thirty seconds while you launch a help program when I press the button by accident " preference boxes .
All that has to go to a file as well .
Because of this different line of thinking , Phantom does n't have files .
Well , there are no files in the sense that a developer opens a file handle , writes to it , and closes the file handle .
From the user 's perspective , things still look familiar – a desktop , directories , and file icons .
But a file in Phantom is simply an object whose state is persisted .
You do n't have to explicitly open it .
As long as your program has some kind of reference to that object , all you need to do is call methods on it , and the data is there as you would expect .
That 's definitely an advantage in an unstable environment .
The Mythbusters ' passion for explosions got a little out of hand earlier this week when they detonated 500 pounds of ammonium nitrate a mile outside of Esparto , California .
Perhaps two miles would have been better .

The segment was intended to discover whether it was possible , as the saying goes , to knock someone 's socks off .
I do n't know about the socks , but the resulting explosion did manage to break windows throughout Esparto and toss one very surprised woman off her couch .
Afterward , she claimed that the experience was " fun , really fun . "
What a trooper .
At any rate , the Mythbusters crew replaced all the windows that same day and the sentiment around town about the incident seems to be generally positive ( despite the fact that no one in the town was informed of the taping beforehand ) .

U.S. Activist 's Parents Demand Answers From Israel U.S. activist remains in critical condition after being hit by Israeli forces .
JERUSALEM , March 24 , 2009  --
It happens every Friday .
Palestinians , left - wing Israelis and international protestors gather in the Palestinian West Bank village of Ni'ilin to demonstrate against the construction of Israel 's security barrier .
It has been the scene of regular clashes with Israeli security forces .
But Friday , March 13 , the usual stone - throwing clashes took a more serious turn when 38 - year - old American peace activist Tristan Anderson of Oakland , Calif. , was hit in the head by an Israeli tear gas canister .
Activists present said the canister was fired directly at Anderson from close range by Israel 's security forces .
He received treatment from Palestinian medics at the scene , and was then transferred to Tel Hashomer hospital near Tel Aviv .
He has had three brain surgeries since and has suffered serious damage to his frontal lobe .
He remains in critical condition , according to his doctors .
Parents : Israel Must Take ' Full Responsibility for the Shooting '
On Monday his parents , Nancy and Michael Anderson , gave a press conference in Jerusalem .
" We want the Israeli government to take full responsibility for the shooting of our son , " said an emotional Nancy Anderson .
" I do n't carry any negative feelings toward the soldier who shot our son .
All I feel is love for Tristan and fear for his recovery . "
The Israeli army said there was heavy stone throwing in the area at the time with many masked demonstrators involved .
The Israeli foreign ministry said Anderson 's injury was the regrettable result of rioting .
" Anyone taking part in a riot notorious for its violent and aggressive agitators armed with rocks and fire bombs has actively chosen to do so , " read a statement released by the army 's press office .
" Such a person is no doubt aware of the inherent risks and has elected to participate regardless . "
Anderson is a veteran of peace activism , but this was his first trip to Israel .
He was here with his Jewish girlfriend on a three - month trip after which he was due to join his parents for a family vacation in Europe .
" He came to understand for himself what the Israeli - Palestinian conflict was all about , " said Michael Anderson , his father .
" It is ironic that the country in which he was shot is a democracy where it is supposed to be a duty for everyone to follow their conscience .
We want to know what happened to our son . "
Four Palestinians have been killed in the clashes in and around Ni'ilin during the past year .
Israel 's security barrier , which Israel claims is designed to prevent attacks by Palestinian suicide bombers , will separate villagers from 400 acres of their farm land .
Stanford , CA -- Photosynthesis produces the food that we eat and the oxygen that we breathe ― could it also help satisfy our future energy needs by producing clean - burning hydrogen ?
Researchers studying a hydrogen - producing , single - celled green alga , Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , have unmasked a previously unknown fermentation pathway that may open up possibilities for increasing hydrogen production .
C. reinhartii , a common inhabitant of soils , naturally produces small quantities of hydrogen when deprived of oxygen .
Like yeast and other microbes , under anaerobic conditions this alga generates its energy from fermentation .
During fermentation , hydrogen is released though the action of an enzyme called hydrogenase , powered by electrons generated by either the breakdown of organic compounds or the splitting of water by photosynthesis .
Normally , only a small fraction of the electrons go into generating hydrogen .
However , a major research goal has been to develop ways to increase this fraction , which would raise the potential yield of hydrogen .
In the new study by Dubini et al* , published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry , researchers at the Carnegie Institution 's Department of Plant Biology , the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) , and the Colorado School of Mines ( CSM ) , examined metabolic processes in a mutant strain that was unable to assemble an active hydrogenase enzyme .
The researchers , who include Alexandra Dubini ( NREL ) , Florence Mus ( Carnegie ) , Michael Seibert ( NREL ) , Matthew Posewitz ( CSM ) , and Arthur Grossman ( Carnegie ) , expected the cell 's metabolism to compensate by increasing metabolite flow along other known fermentation pathways , such as those producing formate and ethanol as end products .
Instead , the algae activated a pathway leading to the production of succinate , which was previously not associated with fermentation metabolism in C. reinhardtii .
Notably , succinate , a widely used industrial chemical normally synthesized from petroleum , is included in the Department of Energy 's list of the top 12 value added chemicals from biomass .
" We actually did n't know that this particular pathway for fermentation metabolism existed in the alga until we generated the mutant , " says Carnegie 's Arthur Grossman .
" This finding suggests that there is significant flexibility in the ways that soil - dwelling green algae can metabolize carbon under anaerobic conditions .
By blocking and modifying some of these metabolic pathways , we may be able to augment the donation of electrons to hydrogenase under anaerobic conditions and produce elevated levels of hydrogen . "
Grossman points out that it makes evolutionary sense that a soil organism such as Chlamydomonas would have a variety of metabolic pathways at its disposal .
Oxygen levels , nutrient availability , and levels of metals and toxins can be extremely variable in soils , over both the short and long term .
" In such an environment " , Grossman says , " these organisms must evolve flexible metabolic circuits ; the variety of conditions to which the organisms are exposed might favor one pathway for energy metabolism over another , which would help the organism compete in the soil environment over evolutionary time . "
Grossman led the effort to generate a fully sequenced Chlamydomonas genome , which has allowed researchers to identify key genes encoding proteins involved in both fermentation and hydrogen production .
Grossman feels that it is of immediate importance to generate new mutant strains to help us understand how we may be able to alter fermentation metabolism and the production of hydrogen .
NREL 's Michael Seibert , the project 's Principal Investigator , observed that " the overarching goal of the work is to gain a fundamental understanding of the total suite of metabolic processes occurring in Chlamydomonas and how they interact ; this discovery effort will lead to the development of novel ways to produce renewable hydrogen and other biofuels , which will benefit all of us " .
" These are really exciting times in the field , " says Matthew Posewitz .
" The tools developed at Carnegie and by other groups in the field are presenting unprecedented opportunities for scientists to make important advances in our understanding of the basic biology of organisms such as Chlamydomonas . "
As an energy source to potentially replace fossil fuels , hydrogen would greatly reduce the emission of greenhouse gases .
Proponents of algal - based hydrogen production point out that , unlike ethanol produced from crops , it would not compete with food production for agricultural land .

France becomes first country to curb bankers ' bonuses
Rogue trader : Jerome Kerviel lost his bank £ 3.5 billion
France is to become the first country in the world to limit bankers ’ bonuses .
It comes a year after a Paris - based trader lost £ 3.5 billion in illegal deals .
At one stage Jerome Kerviel was staking as much as £ 50 billion on behalf of Societe General - more than the bank 's net worth .
Worldwide economic collapse and the credit crunch followed soon afterwards , with all countries now looking at ways of curbing the excesses of those working in financial institutions .
French finance minister Christine Lagarde wants a ‘ code of ethics ’ aimed at capping the bonuses paid to dealers like Kerviel .
The agreement - between France ’s banks , its market watchdog and its treasury and banking authority - would take affect as early as this year .
It would apply to bonuses paid in early 2010 , stating that ‘ the practice of awarding guaranteed bonuses not linked to performance should be banned . ’
A bank ’s real financial health , as opposed to future profit projections , should be used to determined the size of any bonuses paid , the report says .
A Finance Ministry official confirmed Mrs Lagarde will receive a report addressing financial sector salaries ‘ in the coming days . ’
The official declined to give any further details because the report has not yet been received .
On Thursday , President Nicolas Sarkozy announced there would be no 2009 bonuses at banks that have received state aid .
Crackdown : France 's Economy Minister Christine Lagarde wants a new set of guidelines governing the bonuses and salary structures of traders
France ’s top six banks , including Societe Generale and other giants like BNP Paribas , have received a £ 360 billion bailout package , £ 320 billion of which was in loan guarantees .
On Wednesday , U.S. President Barack Obama ordered $ 500,000 pay caps for executives of firms that accept bailout money .
Kerviel , now 32 and working as an IT consultant in Paris , faces charges of breach of trust , fabricating documents and illegally accessing computers .
He could be jailed for three years and fined £ 300,000 when he finally goes on trial next year .
His former employers at Societe Generale insist they had no idea he was running up such massive losses .

The company that released contaminated flu virus material from a plant in Austria confirmed Friday that the experimental product contained live H5N1 avian flu viruses .
The contamination incident , which is being investigated by the four European countries , came to light when the subcontractor in the Czech Republic inoculated ferrets with the product and they died .
Ferrets should n’t die from exposure to human H3N2 flu viruses .
And an official of the World Health Organization ’s European operation said the body is closely monitoring the investigation into the events that took place at Baxter International ’s research facility in Orth - Donau , Austria .
“ At this juncture we are confident in saying that public health and occupational risk is minimal at present , ” medical officer Roberta Andraghetti said from Copenhagen , Denmark .
“ But what remains unanswered are the circumstances surrounding the incident in the Baxter facility in Orth - Donau . ”
The contaminated product , a mix of H3N2 seasonal flu viruses and unlabelled H5N1 viruses , was supplied to an Austrian research company .
The Austrian firm , Avir Green Hills Biotechnology , then sent portions of it to sub-contractors in the Czech Republic , Slovenia and Germany .
The contamination incident , which is being investigated by the four European countries , came to light when the subcontractor in the Czech Republic inoculated ferrets with the product and they died .
Ferrets should n’t die from exposure to human H3N2 flu viruses .
Public health authorities concerned about what has been described as a “ serious error ” on Baxter ’s part have assumed the death of the ferrets meant the H5N1 virus in the product was live .
But the company , Baxter International Inc. , has been parsimonious about the amount of information it has released about the event .
On Friday , the company ’s director of global bioscience communications confirmed what scientists have suspected .
“ It was live , ” Christopher Bona said in an email .
[ efoods ]
The contaminated product , which Baxter calls “ experimental virus material , ” was made at the Orth - Donau research facility .
Baxter makes its flu vaccine — including a human H5N1 vaccine for which a licence is expected shortly — at a facility in the Czech Republic .
People familiar with biosecurity rules are dismayed by evidence that human H3N2 and avian H5N1 viruses somehow co-mingled in the Orth - Donau facility .
That is a dangerous practice that should not be allowed to happen , a number of experts insisted .
Accidental release of a mixture of live H5N1 and H3N2 viruses could have resulted in dire consequences .
While H5N1 does n’t easily infect people , H3N2 viruses do .
If someone exposed to a mixture of the two had been simultaneously infected with both strains , he or she could have served as an incubator for a hybrid virus able to transmit easily to and among people .
That mixing process , called reassortment , is one of two ways pandemic viruses are created .
There is no suggestion that happened because of this accident , however .
“ We have no evidence of any reassortment , that any reassortment may have occurred , ” said Andraghetti .
“ And we have no evidence of any increased transmissibility of the viruses that were involved in the experiment with the ferrets in the Czech Republic . ”
Baxter has n’t shed much light — at least not publicly — on how the accident happened .
Earlier this week Bona called the mistake the result of a combination of “ just the process itself , ( and ) technical and human error in this procedure . ”
He said he could n’t reveal more information because it would give away proprietary information about Baxter ’s production process .
Andraghetti said Friday the four investigating governments are co-operating closely with the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Control in Stockholm , Sweden .
“ We are in very close contact with Austrian authorities to understand what the circumstances of the incident in their laboratory were , ” she said .
“ And the reason for us wishing to know what has happened is to prevent similar events in the future and to share lessons that can be learned from this event with others to prevent similar events . …
This is very important . ”

Editor ’s note : Yesterday , guest contributor Alexis Madrigal introduced the rationale behind California ’s ethanol mandate , and alluded to some of the “ behind - the - scenes ” changes that the mandate required .
Today , he takes a look at one piece of the California ethanol infrastructure .
II .
The Geography of Green
In northern California , the major incoming station for ethanol is the NuStar Selby Terminal outside Crockett , in unincorporated Contra Costa County .
At places like Selby , rail cars filled with ethanol are unloaded into holding tanks , then eventually transloaded into a truck ( or a pipeline ) that delivers the fuel to a refinery .
The Big Oil refiners splash - blend it with hydrocarbons inside tanker trucks into what the state calls gasoline .
That ’s one of the things that Selby ’s manager , Mike McDonald got shipped to California to do , after his last post at a refinery in the Caribbean .
He ’s sturdily - built with closely cropped hair .
In his blue coveralls , it ’s obvious he ’s no suit or hipster .
When I show up uninvited at Selby early one evening , after weeks of trying to get the NuStar press handlers to call me back , I catch McDonald still working .
And why would n’t he be ?
Selby never stops working .
The terminal operates 24 - hours a day , 365 days a year .
It can store three million gallons of liquid fuels , the vast majority of it being oil .
McDonald ’s office is a trailer that sits in the shadow of a farm of gleaming white tanks .
A random strip of suburban - looking houses lies across the parking lot , the remains of the old company town of Tormey , which was run by the American Smelting and Refining Company , and largely razed in 1971 when the plant closed along with its 610 - foot chimney , once the world ’s tallest .
A local later tells me that the lead coming out of the stack was killing horses in Benicia , miles away .
“ That was back then , though , ” he notes appreciatively .
Now the big employer in the area is the C&H Sugar Factory , a couple miles down the road from Selby in Crockett proper .
The work never stops there , either .
At night , it stays lit - up , almost magical , its machinery convoluted , its processes obscure .
Families play bocce in the warm evenings , the factory rising above them .
Down by the port , people fish the waters a mile from where the old smokestack stood .
Classic cars sit on lawns , half restored .
Despite all this retro civic activity , the town is n’t frozen in time .
On the random Wednesday I visited , a local bar , Toot ’s , featured a DJ playing hip hop to a small , drunk , tattooed crowd .
27 miles from San Francisco , the epicenter of a green movement trying to change the world , and one mile from a fuel terminal that ’s an important node of an equally global but far - less - liberal network , Crockett is just one of many exurban towns ringing our big cities that have become the new battlegrounds in the fight to change how we drive and live .
To push beyond token changes to the energy system , the green movement has to penetrate all the way out to places like this .
Guys like McDonald might not have to convert , but they will have to help design the new industrial processes required for a cleaner world .
The geography of green will have to look more like a map of the nation ’s rails and highways and less like the store locating app for Whole Foods .
The dirty work does n’t just occur when oil comes out of the ground or is burned in a car .
The points in - between matter .

Keynes 's official biographer , Robert Skidelsky , says that Keynes changed his mind on the virtues of Soviet Russia in 1928 , but that review was written in 1936 .
( 4 ) Keynes probably had a certain fascination for Russia due to his hatred of profit and speculation ( even though he himself made a fortune ) while clearly and virulently abhorring its horrors .
However , it is the destruction of the profit motive and the elimination of private property that were at the root of those horrors .
Keynes refused to consider them as root causes and blamed " some beastliness in the Russian nature―or in the Russian and Jewish natures when , as now , they are allied . " ( 5 )
The Noble Experiment He viewed Soviet Russia as a social experiment in planning .
He also seemed to hold the same view concerning Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany .
( 6 ) In the German preface of Keynes 's perennial work The General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money , Keynes wrote the following , which has been dismissed and disregarded by several of his defenders :
[ M]uch of the following book is illustrated and expounded mainly with reference to the conditions existing in the Anglo - Saxon countries .
Nevertheless the theory of output as a whole , which is what the following book purports to provide , is much more easily adapted to the conditions of a totalitarian state [ emphasis added ] , than is the theory of the production and distribution of a given output produced under conditions of free competition and a large measure of laissez - faire .
Keynes actually considered in his essay National self - sufficiency that fascism , Nazism and communism were " social experiments " whose failures and tragedies could be explained by administrative bungling .
( 7 ) Nazi Germany 's economic disaster occurred because it was run by " unchained incompetents , " according to Keynes .
Although he considered that Mussolini was acquiring wisdom , he said that Soviet Russia was the result of " administrative incompetence . "
Keynes disregarded any other explanations that a " liberal " would consider for these failures ; he only viewed them as experiments .
Keynes was a man who often changed his mind ( which is not a reproach in and of itself ) but harboured very deep inconsistencies .
While he probably never tried to destroy capitalism or liberalism , he never tried to save it either .
Instead , he unconsciously adhered to ideas that were to have disastrous impacts on the course of human history .
Keynes was never a liberal .
Markets regulate themselves
Long before the existence of the Securities and Exchange Commission , medieval guilds and trading houses established common standards , accreditation agencies , and accounting rules that have evolved to the present day .
The system of English common law has been evolving since the 12th century 1 , and the accounting system used today was codified in 1495.2 .
Numerous non-governmental bodies have continued to develop accounting rules and set auditing standards for public organizations .
3
It is the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants , not the government , which sets ethical standards for the profession and U.S. auditing standards for audits of private companies ; federal , state and local governments ; and non-profit organizations .
Voluntary oversight organizations are embraced by their participants because they provide executives with a value – they allow them to discover waste and fraud and advertise honesty to partners and customers .
Unlike government regulatory bodies , they are flexible , efficient , and competitive .
When the compliance costs of accounting rules exceed their value , or when lax controls lead to unethical or risky behavior , the markets embrace new standards .
The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 did not begin the process of regulating markets , but nationalized much of the auditing market and turned it over to politicians and bureaucrats .
Regulations hinder competition and raise costs for investors
The SEC subsidizes politically connected corporations at the expense of smaller firms , hindering innovation and encouraging corruption .
Established corporations lobby the government to create burdensome regulations that smaller investment funds and markets cannot afford , thus creating coercive monopolies that raise profits a few firms at the expense of investors .
4
Government bodies like the SEC , the MSRB , the FTC , the USITC , the Fed , the Treasury , the IRS , the OTS , the MSRB , and the state attorney ’s offices issue hundreds of thousands of laws , rules , opinions , bulletins , comment letters and threats and require numerous reports , statements , forms , notices , and approvals that investment firms and public companies must obey .
5
This creates an artificial scarcity of investment products that benefits large corporations and discourages savings and investment .
Smaller companies cannot afford to raise money by issuing stock , and investors are forced to choose between public but expensive mutual funds and secretive and risky hedge funds with entry fees that only the rich can afford .
The SEC creates corruption
Rather than making Wall Street honest , regulatory agencies are the primary instruments of fraud and corruption on Wall Street .
Politicians who control regulatory agencies have an incentive to use their power to extract benefits for themselves and their constituencies , rather than to keep markets honest and efficient .
Power hungry politicians like Eliot Spitzer use the power of the SEC to go on crusades again innocent businessmen 6 , and thus force regulatory bodies to hide the evidence of real corruption .
7
By blocking outsiders from seeing its records , the agency is makes it harder for investors to discover real fraud .
8
The case of Bernie Madoff is a typical case study in how the SEC encourages fraud .
Investors figured out that Madoff could n’t possibly make the profits he claimed , and have been writing the SEC since 1999 , urging them to put a stop to Madoff ’s Ponzi scheme .
However , Madoff used his close family ties to the SEC , and was instrumental in founding key regulatory bodies – and then nominated his family members to serve on their boards .
When skeptical investors inquired about the irregularities in his fund , Madoff told them that the SEC had already investigated and cleared him over a period of three years .
While Madoff stole $ 50 billion dollars under their noses , the SEC ’s budget surpassed $ 900 million dollars , and grew at record rates during the two Bush administrations .
In response to this outrageous case of nepotism and corruption , the government will likely increase its budget and staff once again.9
The SEC makes markets more volatile and risky
By banning crucial market functions like short selling10 and “ insider trading ” 11 the SEC hinders the market ’s ability to react to new information , and makes markets more unpredictable and expensive .
The SEC cannot even oversee itself
While the SEC is charged with enforcing regulations like Sarbanes - Oxley , it consistently fails to control and report on its own processes and receives failing grades from the government ’s own auditing body .
12
This is not surprising – like any socialist organization , it has no incentive to be efficient or responsible to stockholders .
The chief source of fraud and corruption in the United States is not Wall Street , but Washington D.C .
Notes
Carol
Thatcher was in talks over her future as a BBC contributor today after she referred to a tennis player as a " golliwog " .
The daughter of the former prime minister made the remark after filming the One Show last Thursday during a conversation with presenter Adrian Chiles and several guests .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
She was immediately challenged about the remark , but only apologised yesterday and dismissed the comment as a " joke " .
Thatcher , crowned Queen of the Jungle in the 2005 series of I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here ! , is a regular contributor to the magazine show and the programme 's website praises " her dry , self - deprecating wit and tenacious spirit " .
A decision has yet to be reached about her future on the show but it is thought
Thatcher will not be invited back until she acknowledges that using the word " golliwog " is unacceptable even when apparently in jest .
A BBC spokesman said : " Carol Thatcher has not been dropped from the One Show .
" Talks about the incident are ongoing and we expect a resolution within the next 24 hours . "
The remark was made during a conversation about the Australian Open tennis tournament , in reference to a player who had recently been knocked out of the men 's singles draw .
Mount Redoubt , a volcano 100 miles from Anchorage , Alaska has blown its top and is erupting , nearly two months after experts predicted it would .
The eruption started at 11:38 p.m. Sunday local time but was obscured by darkness and snow .
The height of the initial burst is believed to be 0,000 ft , with a warning of bursts to 50,000 ft .
Notably aircraft between Asia and the East Coast of North America pass in the vicinity for fuel stops on their trips .
For example , Hong Kong to Toronto stops in Anchorage .
Alaska Airlines is reported to have turned back four flights bound for Anchorage to their cities of origin .
An ash cloud warning is in effect for Anchorage , with ash expected to land at 2 am local time across the entire Anchorage area .
Scientists had upped their warning of an eruption in the 12 hours before it happened after a series of some 60 odd small earthquakes in the area .
Genetically modified food is one of great controversies of our time .
Supporters point to wonderful possibilities of nutrient - packed food and solving world hunger , while critics fear unknown effects on human health .
But whatever one ’s opinion the matter , one thing is clear : some genetically modified fruits and vegetables are awfully intriguing !
Here are 7 of the most interesting examples :
Graisins
( Image via Elanso )
The graisin ( or giant raisin ) is a raisin which has been genetically re-programmed to grow far beyond its normal size .
It was produced by Japan ’s National Institute of Genetics , which is unsurprising given that nation ’s love for large fruits of all kinds .
And while they taste exactly the same as small raisins , graisins are sure to make dinner guests stare in awe !
Grapples
( Image via Wikipedia )
Originally funded by UNICEF and created for Third World aid efforts , a grapple is simply a genetic cross between a grape and an apple .
The fruit keeps the size and shape of the apple , the texture of the grape , and the flavor of both while providing a potent , high - strength dose of vitamin C. OK , so someone went a bit afield with their research here – turns out the Grapple is not a genetic cross but is instead created via “ a totally safe process [ done to ] apples after picking , which imparts the grape flavor throughout the apple . ”
See : GrappleFruits for more information .
Pluots
Plums and apricots are delicious fruits in their own right , but combined , they form the genetically modified treat known as the pluot .
Described by WiseGeek as “ an intensely flavored fruit ” , pluots are heavily fortified with vitamin C and have no sodium or cholesterol .
Tangelo

“ Should I have a tangerine or a grapefruit ? ”
No longer need this question be asked !
Lovers of each fruit can now get the best of both worlds with this sweet hybrid , which boasts a ton of fiber , vitamin C , and a slightly tart taste !
Colorful carrots
( Image via MSNBC )
Could colorful , genetically - modified carrots like those pictured here be the secret to absorbing more calcium ?
Two Texas researchers say yes – and they ’ve created a carrot they claim allows people to absorb 40 % more calcium than normal carrots to back up their claims !
Diabetes - fighting lettuce
( Image via FloridaTrend )
Diabetes is one of the most frustrating and life - threatening illnesses out there .
Living with it ( at minimum ) means daily , sometimes painful insulin injections – until now .
University of Central Florida professor Henry Daniell has created a genetically modified strain of lettuce ( pictured above ) that carries the insulin gene .
The lettuce cells protect the insulin on its journey through the digestive tract , and when the insulin reaches the intestines , the body ’s natural insulin - producing response is triggered .
Lematos
( Image via FreeWebs )
Okay , so a lemon and a tomato are n’t the most natural of pairs , but that did n’t stop Israeli researchers from bringing us the Lemato !
Unlike other genetically altered fruits and veggies ( which were created primarily for health reasons ) , it appears that the lemato was solely an experiment to determine if it was possible to make tomatos give off the scent of lemons .
Mission accomplished !

Oldie but goody .
For those unaware , the GOP and the Democrats are playing good cop - bad cop on the American people .
The two political parties work direcly for the international banking cartel currently working very hard to destroy the dollar , bring about a collapse of the economy , then offering a solution to the crisis to the American people by erasing our soveriegnty , creating a regional ( multi- country ) currency and signing on to robust international treaties which undermine and render the US Constitution dead .
They use terrorism and economic crisis to prompt the American people to acquiesce to demands .
By creating fear and a general sense of helplessness the public curls up and takes it .
Sometimes the truth comes out in humor , the public laughs and continues to take it .
Sometimes it comes out in public but the corporate news media refuses to investigate the truth and the media no longer serves the public interest .
The cure will be seen by the masses as a ' lesser of two evil ' solution to the crisis they themselves engineered .
The Council on Foreign Relations , the United Nations , the World Bank , Federal Reserve , Internal Revenue Service , the Department of Homeland Security , the Conservative Underground , NeoConservatives ( NeoCons ) , the CIA and countless other think tanks , corporate powers / laws , standing armies , etc are the enemies of liberty .
They are you guaranteed oppressors who enslave you by incremental alterations in the fabric of law , society and culture .
Do not forget , security of the nation does not equal patriotism , rather defending freedom and an individuals liberty is patriotism .
The Redcoats and many of the first colonists were loyal to King George .
They were known as Loyalists .
Those that espoused liberty , taxation with representation and the formation of a new Republic , the signers of the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution were not Loyalists , they were known as Patriots ..
And so it is today that we find ourselves at the same juncture , a continuation of the revolution that began so long ago .
Be you Loyal to the Government or be you a defender of the Constitution , for they are not synonymous .

Calling all Phish fans who have been spinning their wheels of late following Widespread Panic and moe . :
Your leaders have returned .
After a five - year hiatus from touring , Phish will take to the road after a March reunion performance in Hampton , Va .
But the bummer continues for any , ahem , " phans " residing west of the Mississippi : St. Louis , Mo. , is as far west as the band is traveling this summer , and questions to the band 's publicist about possible plans for a second leg were met with a curt , " The press release contains all confirmed information . "
So , pack up the Subaru if you want to be on the safe side , left coasters -- it 's not like the hardcore fans are averse to such road trips , anyway .
And hey , you can even stop in Branson on the way back for a real hallucinogenic experience .
But there may be a nugget of hope buried among the tour dates for those who want to get the most bang for their concert dollar .
There 's a curious series of open dates on Phish 's itinerary between June 9 and 16 , coincidentally the scheduled dates for Bonnaroo 2009 ( a hot , yet still unconfirmed rumor Rolling Stone reported back in December ) .
Let the speculation " run like an antelope . "
As if that were n't enough for jam - band fans , Phish 's inspiration -- or at least a modified version -- is hitting the road as well this spring .
The Dead , or the Grateful Dead minus Jerry Garcia , is back on the tour bus for , coincidentally , the first time since 2004 .
And , with a stop at the Forum they even acknowledge that a few of their fans might live in California .

Back in 2006 , the US Congress passed an eleventh - hour update to the Wire Act aimed at preventing United States citizens from gambling online .
The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 ( UIGEA ) has caused the US no small amount of trouble on the international stage due WTO rulings .
UIGEA bans citizens from betting online if the games are hosted in a foreign nation ; US - based financial institutions are also prohibited from processing international gambling - related transactions .
In a statement on Thursday , the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank vowed to seek the repeal of UIGEA as part of a package of US financial reforms .
It 's unclear if the act ever actually succeeded at retargeting scurrilous online gamblers back towards resorts or riverboats .
It did , however , succeed at costing a number of foreign websites quite a bit of money ; a fact that angered a number of countries .
The sat particularly badly with the island nation of Antigua , which complained to the WTO over what it saw as discriminatory trade practices .
The WTO agreed and ruled against the United States back in April of 2007 — a fact the US has more - or - less ignored .
Gambling laws have always been a patchwork of contradictions ; the federal government prohibits gambling across state lines but allows states to set their own laws when it comes to intra-state betting .
Many states have laws that favor particular types of gaming over others ; Kentucky has gone so far as to try to seize control of online gambling sites and makes no secret of its stance on horse racing .
Taken as a whole , the US policy of simultaneously condemning and supporting gambling is uglier than the hypothetical love child of Janet Reno and Alan Greenspan .
The Bush Administration settled the initial Antigua complaint by offering the country concessions in other trade - related areas , but multiple European countries remain angry ; the UK - based Remote Gambling Association has claimed that the US Department of Justice ( DOJ ) has discriminantly targeted certain websites while ignoring the operations of others .
The European Commission reportedly plans to file its own complaint with the WTO .
In the face of international bad feeling and an uncertain positive impact at home , it may be time for the UIGEA to fold its hand .

February 26 , 2009  -- Bank of America President Ken Lewis was confronted by the lawyers for New York Attorney General Anthony Cuomo this afternoon over his statements that he had " no authority " over $ 3.6 billion in bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch executives last December .
Investigators say corporate documents obtained by the attorney general suggest otherwise .
Lewis arrived at the attorney general 's offices after a flight from Charlotte , N.C. , on a $ 50 million G - 5 luxury corporate jet , one of nine corporate jets owned by the giant bank .
A spokesperson for the Bank of America told ABC News : " This was an important meeting which we felt justified the use of corporate aircraft for timing and efficiency . "
The spokesperson refused to answer questions regarding the cost of the travel or any plans for the company to scale back on their use of private aircraft .
" The Whole Story "
Since receiving $ 45 billion in federal bailout money , Bank of America announced it would sell three of the jets .
The immediate issue for Lewis , say investigators , is whether he has told " the whole story " about the huge bonuses paid shortly before Merrill Lynch merged with Bank of America .
Appearing before Congress earlier this month , Lewis said he had " no authority " over the bonuses .
The corporate merger documents , however , say the bonuses would be awarded " in consultation " with Bank of America .
Lawyers for the attorney general are expected to confront Lewis over his congressional statements , which were not made under oath .
The Bank of America / Merrill Lynch merger documents , read to ABC News , state the bonuses " may be awarded at levels that do not exceed $ 5.8 billion . "
Two Bank of American officials met with Merrill Lynch president John
Thain to get him to lower the total bonus amount to $ 3.6 billion , according to investigators .
Thain Met With Cuomo's Office This Week
Thain testified before Cuomo's investigators earlier this week and provided a list of bonus recipients and amounts .
Investigators say 696 employees received bonuses of $ 1 million or more .
Four top employees were given bonuses totaling $ 121 million .
Thain , in his first deposition Feb. 19 , had initially refused to answer questions regarding the bonuses , according to a partial transcript of that session .
On Monday , he was ordered to reappear after the attorney general 's office sought and received a court order compelling him to answer the questions .
The bonuses became a subject of the investigation into Merrill 's merger with Bank of America by Cuomo 's office after the attorney general raised whether the two banks -- which together received about $ 45 billion in taxpayer dollars -- worked together to arrange the early bonus plan just weeks before the merger was completed
The bonus package , called the Variable Incentive Compensation Package , provoked outrage when it was revealed that Merrill Lynch lost $ 25 billion in 2008 .

Barack Obama entered the presidency as one of the most rhetorically pro-civil liberties politicians in recent memory .
And shortly after taking office , he drew applause from friends of liberty for promulgating executive orders closing Guantanamo and CIA secret prisons , ending CIA torture , suspending kangaroo proceedings at military tribunals , and pledging more openness than the secretive Bush administration .
Unfortunately , instead of prosecuting Bush administration officials , including George W. Bush , for violating criminal statutes against torture , illegal wiretapping of Americans , and other misdeeds thus avoiding the bad precedent of giving a president a free pass on illegal acts Obama appears ready to vindicate the prior administrations anti-terrorism program by adopting Bush Lite .
Warning signs that Obama was softer on civil liberties than advertised came even before he took office , when as a Senator , he voted for blatantly unconstitutional legislation that allowed federal snooping into some e-mail messages and phone calls without a warrant .
The Constitution implies that all government searches and seizures of private property require a judicially - approved warrant based on probable cause that a crime has been committed with no exceptions mentioned , including for national security .
Politicians love symbolic acts and Obamas rapid pledge to shutter the high profile prison at Guantanamo and secret CIA prisons was widely praised .
But if civil liberties continue to be violated elsewhere , have we made much progress ?
Obamas nominees have said the administration will continue the CIAs policy of extraordinary rendition of terrorism suspects a euphemism for secret kidnapping without the legal nicety of extradition or any other procedural due process rights .
Prior to the Bush administration , such government - sanctioned kidnapping was authorized only to return the suspects to their home countries .
The Bush administration began using such renditions to abduct suspects and send them to third - party nations that practiced harsh torture presumably to keep U.S. hands ( relatively ) clean .
Leon Panetta , Obamas CIA director , has said that the new administration will continue the Bush administrations practice of rendition to third party countries and relying on those countries  suspect diplomatic promises not to torture .
Also , Obama supposedly banned CIA torture by executive order , but such orders are not laws and can be reversed with the stroke of a pen .
What s worse , although CIA director Panetta has admitted that water boarding ( simulated drowning ) is torture , he has also asserted publicly that if regular interrogation techniques did not produce information from a prisoner suspected of being involved in an imminent attack , he would request the authority to use harsher methods .
In perhaps the most important of the civil liberties waffling , Elena Kagan , the administrations nominee for solicitor general at the Justice Department , pledged to continue detaining indefinitely prisoners without trial , even if they were noncombatant terrorist financiers arrested far from a combat zone .
Ominously , the Obama administration is stalling on taking a position on the even more important Bush - era policy of perpetually incarcerating enemy combatants  without trial on U.S. territory .
To stay within the U.S. Constitution , such vital habeas corpus rights , one of the pillars of the rule of law , should only be suspended by Congress in areas where combat has rendered the civilian courts inoperable hardly the case in the United States during the never - ending war on terror . 
Although Obamas executive order suspended the Bush administrations kangaroo military tribunals , which have insufficient legal procedural safeguards , it has kept its options open on their resumption .
Finally , the new administration has mimicked the Bush administrations use of the state secrets  doctrine to try to nix lawsuits by former CIA detainees and , for the same reason , pressured another countrys court not to release information about U.S. torture of a prisoner .
Traditionally , the doctrine was usually used to withhold specific evidence in a legal proceeding , not to nix entire cases against the government for malfeasance .
So much for a more open government .
The Obama administration is new and should be given a chance to do the right thing .
Although certainly better than the lawless Bush administration , the new boss unsurprisingly resembles the old boss .
Historically , party label has been a less good indicator about actual presidential policies than the era in which the chief executive served .
For example , in terms of actual programs , Richard Nixon was the last liberal president , a chief executive who largely continued Lyndon Johnsons government penetration into American society and even further expanded it .
Similarly , Jimmy Carter started the move back to the right and Ronald Reagan continued it ( but in practice he really wasnt all that conservative ) .
Civil liberties follow the general trend .
After the first Word Trade Center bombing in 1993 and the Oklahoma City and Tokyo subway attacks in 1995 , Bill Clinton signed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 , which augmented the governments powers of surveillance on Americans and paved the way for the further vast expansion of such authority ( and other aforementioned dramatic civil liberties violations of the Bush administration ) after 9/11 .
Typically in American history , any crisissuch as 9/11 causes an expansion of government power .
After the crisis recedes , a public reaction to government excesses usually ensuesas now exists with Bush policies .
Yet government power never quite recedes to its pre-crisis level .
Unfortunately , what we are likely to see from a post - 9/11 Obama presidency is that same historical phenomenon playing out .
Basketball great Shaquille O'Neal , rock ' n ' roller Jon Bon Jovi , comedian Jerry Lewis and civil rights activist Paul Robeson have been elected to the New Jersey Hall of Fame .

The Swiss are deliberately weakening their own currency after yesterday ’s rate and quantitative easing announcements .
Is this the beginning of a Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœcurrency warÃ¢â‚¬â „¢?
They have implemented a covert form of protectionism , similar to a tariff on foreign goods .
The excuses and reasons have begun .
Apparently this policy change is to help some eastern European countries , whose economies are heavily in debt with CHF related mortgages .
This is not a calculated collective decision for EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s benefit but for the benefit of the Swiss economy !
How will other policy makers react at the G20 meeting ?
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 14 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœsubduedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range so far .
YesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s US retail sales delivered a surprise to the market .
No biggie , it fell as predicted ( - 0.1 % ) , but less than the expected decline ( - 0.5 % ) .
More importantly analysts are quick to point out that next WednesdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s US CPI report is now more important .
It will tell us if yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s surprising number was just a reversal of January discounting and hence a price effect .
If CPI print is higher than expected it says that sales were unwound last month .
Digging deeper , it was not surprising to notice that motor vehicle sales fell - 4.3 % and sales of building materials and food were also down modestly .
However gas station sales popped + 3.4 % higher on higher prices and that distorted the print .
Revisions are everything and once again there was a sharp upward revision to JanuaryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s data ( +1.8 % vs. +1.0 ) , while core ex-autos is now shown to be up + 1.6 % m/m vs. +0.9 % .
A decline on big ticket purchases like homes and autos still suggests a defensive consumer .
Not a friendly number was witnessed for the US labor market .
It continues to deteriorate as businesses pare expenses due to weakening profits and pushing up initial jobless and continuing claims .
This further solidifies the thought that the US can expect many more months of job weakness and further downside risk to economic growth .
Initial jobless claims printed once again above the +650 k benchmark last week .
This does not bode well for next months NFP number ; it suggests we may see another mirror image of last weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s print ( - 650 k ) .
More importantly results from the previous week were also revised up suggesting we will see February ’s NFP revised down next month .
Continuing claims unexpectedly jumped +193 k to +5.317 m ( the largest 1 - month increase since Nov. and a new record high ) .
The US$ currently is higher against the EUR - 0.10 % , GBP - 0.32 % , CHF - 0.35 % and JPY - 0.38 % .
The commodity currencies are mixed this morning , CAD - 0.06 % and AUD +0.07 % .
Yesterday , the loonie was little changed against its southern rival and all this despite crude prices rallying in favor of the commodity based currency .
The main culprit for little movement is this morning Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s employment report .
The market fears a Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœlargerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ negative surprise ( consensus - 55 k ) , which of course is very much in line with other global economies .
Already this week the currency has strengthened from a 5 - year low ( 1.3064 ) after advances in global equities signaled investors were stepping up their purchases of riskier assets .
Is this rally sustainable ?
Traders have been hesitant to drag the currency to lofty heights until the employment report is revealed .
Year - to - date the loonie has declined - 5.5 % , after a record - 18 % loss last year vs. its southern partner .
It is the 2nd worst performer just ahead of the USD in a pool of the 16 most traded currencies .
Expect investors to continue to look for better levels to sell the CAD $ .
The AUD $ printed a new 1 - month high O/N as global equities rallied after Japan and China signaled further stimulus measures .
This has led to renewed risk taking with speculators seeking higher yielding assets like the AUD and NZD .
As long as both commodities and bank stocks are in demand , down - under currencies will follow suit ( 0.6574 ) .
Crude is little changed in the O/N session ( $ 46.27 down - 27 c ) .
The crude market is caught between concerns over the decline in demand , and the prospect of another reduction in OPEC production levels this weekend .
Yesterday the market was able to pare all of the 10 % loss witnessed over the last two trading sessions .
Algerian Energy Minister Khelil said that OPEC is likely to reduce output again at this weekendÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s meeting , while some ministers favor a halt to production cuts .
Further cuts are expected to shore up the price of crude and lower global stocks .
But remember too high a price can be detrimental to promoting global economic growth .
This commodity has only one supporter and that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s OPEC ( they pump 40 % of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s oil ) .
Since Sept. they have cut production 3 - times to slow the slump in prices and prevent a glut on world markets .
The weekly EIA report was a surprise , crude stocks increased +0.7 m w/w vs. a market expectation of +0.1 m .
That is the 20th increase in the last 24 - weeks .
Global economic data does not lend support to crude prices .
China earlier this week said that their oil purchases have dropped to + 11.73 m metric tons .
Year - to - date their imports have fallen - 13 % to +24.55 m tons , or +3.12 m barrels a day .
Combine this with a horrid German manufacturing order number collapsing - 38 % in Jan .
y/y , clearly a stronger indication that demand destruction is alive and kicking .
OPECÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Secretary General said that they must remove another +800 k barrels a day to reduce output by - 4.2 m since their objectives were established last Sept .
If they do decide to reduce production targets this month , the technical charts indicate that prices may rise to $ 55 a barrel .
With gold eroding close to 5 % over the last 2 - trading sessions , investors had been drawn to the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ as a safer heaven asset class ( $ 924 ) .
After witnessing s strong equity rally in the O/N session , perhaps we will see more offers on the top side this morning .
The Nikkei closed 7,557 up +358 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,018 up +62 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 3,771 up +71 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is lower .
The 10 - year Treasury yield backed up 4 bp yesterday ( 2.91 % ) and is little changed in the O/N session .
The fear of a deepening recession continues to attract bond investors despite an elevating US Treasury supply concern .
Traders all week quite rightly cheapened the curve ahead of each tranche of a $ 63b issue in total .
But with equities finding some traction risk aversion trading strategies are taking a back seat at the moment .

A 60 - year - old woman delivered twins at Calgary 's Foothills Hospital Tuesday , family members confirmed .
She is believed to be the oldest person in Canada to give birth .
Family members said Ranjit Hayer and her husband have been trying to have a child for years , to no avail .
Reports say Hayer , originally from India , returned to the country to receive in vitro fertilization after being turned down in Canada because of her age .
Hayer gave birth to two boys , Manjot and Gurpreet .
Hayer 's family said the birth is especially significant , considering the importance of offspring in Indian culture .
" ( Hayer ) 's always treated her nieces and nephews as her own , " said a family member who asked not to be identified .
" We always prayed for them to have children .
It 's a very special moment .
" In Indian culture , children are a blessing .
It 's very , very uncommon for a married couple to not have children . "
The oldest known mother to give birth was last year in India when 70 - year - old Omkari Panwar gave birth to twins after receiving in vitro fertilization .
In 2006 , a 67 - year - old Spanish woman had twins , her first children , in Barcelona .
That woman also received in vitro fertilization .
Prior to that , Romanian Adriana Iliescu , at age 66 , was the oldest woman known to have given birth .
She had twins in early 2006 , but one child died hours after birth .
Also in 2006 , a 64 - year - old Turkish successfully gave birth to a baby boy in Istanbul .
Dear Cecil :
With all your scatological insight , what exactly is a fart ?
Is it , as some surmise , a burp gone wrong ?
Is it a relative of the hiccup ?
The sneeze ?
And is it not healthier to vent oneself than to squelch ?
Phillip S. , Chicago
Cecil replies :
Your question comes at an opportune moment — I ’ve just been reading up on the subject in the Harvard Medical School Health Letter .
Harvard is a veritable gold mine when it comes to flatulence .
Intestinal gas , we learn , is made up mostly of five gases : nitrogen , oxygen , carbon dioxide , hydrogen , and methane .
The first two you get from swallowing air during eating , while the last three are generated in the large intestine .
From this we deduce that burps and belches , which emanate from the stomach , consist mostly of air .
Hiccups and sneezes , of course , are wholly unrelated .
Hydrogen and carbon dioxide are produced by bacteria nibbling on undigested food in the colon .
Beans , for instance , contain complex sugars that ca n’t be broken down by the body ’s digestive juices .
Upon arriving in the colon , these sugars are set upon by the resident microbes , and the resultant fermentation produces the cheerful calliope effect celebrated in such masterpieces as Blazing Saddles .
Methane , another digestive byproduct , is responsible for the blue flame that has absorbed the attentions of college freshmen for generations .
It ’s recommended , incidentally , that persons contemplating experiments in this line wear fireproof undies when doing so .
Unca Cecil speaks from experience .
A friend of mine , who has reason to worry , has inquired whether there are any cases on record of persons exploding as a result of smoking in bed after a bean barbecue .
To date I have n’t been able to find any .
However , internal detonations have resulted from careless use of an electrocautery device inside the bowel .
The eating of beans before surgery , therefore , is definitely contraindicated .
The characteristic fragrance of the fart is produced not by any of the aforementioned gases but by “ minute amounts of volatile chemicals formed by bacterial metabolism of residual protein and fat , ” we read .
Persons whose flatulence is especially notable in this regard may be suffering from dietary maladjustment — for example , people with lactase deficiency who drink a lot of milk .
Other foods said to produce farts of unusual pungency include broccoli , onions , cauliflower , cabbage , radishes , and raw apples .
Not to give anyone ideas , but those seem like the perfect salad ingredients for an eventful sorority lunch .

The Price of America 's Prison Gulags Editor ’s Note :
For the last three decades , the United States has been dominated by a philosophy that might be called “ tough - guy-ism , ” confronting every problem whether foreign or domestic with a swaggering commitment to force and punishment .
Not only has “ tough - guy-ism ” led the United States into military quagmires like the Iraq War but it has saddled the nation with a vast prison gulag system where millions of Americans are warehoused for excessively long sentences , as the Independent Institute ’s Anthony Gregory notes in this guest essay :
A three - judge panel has tentatively ruled that “ [ t ] he California prison system must reduce overcrowding by as many as 55,000 inmates within three years to provide a constitutional level of medical and mental health care , ” according to the New York Times .

Printer friendly Taxpayers rightly resent the price tag of the prison system , and many might understandably think that prisoners should have no right to expensive care at their further expense .
But if the prisons cannot afford to care for its prisoners , we obviously have far too many .
Now is a good time to seriously reassess the whole system altogether .
There were virtually no prisons in this country when it was founded .
The modern criminal justice system grew out of the institution of slavery ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) .
Prisons exploded in their growth in the 20th century .
The Progressive Era , whose leaders dreamed of recreating society and redeeming mankind through an active and expansionist state , accelerated the development of today ’s system .
It grew steadily .
Before Reagan ’s presidency , there were half a million Americans in prison or jail and fewer than one and a half million on parole or probation .
Now there are more than two million behind bars and seven million total in the correctional system .
In California , prisons grew by 500 percent from 1982 to 2000 .
This is madness .
And it ’s expensive .
Some worry about the strain on social infrastructure if prisoners were mass - released , but they could not possibly cost the state more than they do now .
They would also at least have the chance to create wealth as workers and consumers in the market , rather than just being a drain in the public sector .
Each prisoner costs taxpayers $ 35,000 a year .
Victims are not made whole , but forced to foot the bill to house their perpetrators .
The state used to have some restitution centers through which white - collar convicts could work and pay back their victims as well as some of their detention costs — but these were closed down last month .
State officials said the program was too expensive .
Only government could lose more money making people work than just locking them up , feeding and clothing them .
Most offenders never get the opportunity to pay restitution , but are simply jammed in obscenely overcrowded cages .
California ’s system is designed to hold about 100,000 but instead holds 171,000 .
Judges used to have wide discretion in sentencing , which minimized overcrowding .
In 1977 , Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown stripped judges of this authority .
“ Over the next decade , California ’s legislature , dominated by Democrats , passed more than 1,000 laws increasing mandatory prison sentences , ” according to the Washington Post .
Brutal violence is all too common .
Human Rights
Watch estimates that nationwide one out of fifteen male inmates is raped .
Many prisoners are effectively the slaves of their cellmates .
Gang violence is endemic .
The institution has become a totalitarian hell for those inside .
What ’s worse , most people incarcerated should not be .
A quarter of the inmates are locked up for non-violent drug offenses .
They committed no act of violence against anyone ’s person or property , and their imprisonment is part of a destructive drug policy that has boosted crime , trashed civil liberties , uprooted the social order and corrupted the whole legal system .
Many others are in prison for other non-violent offenses against the state — unapproved gun ownership , tax evasion , and so forth .
Many petty criminals do not deserve anything like today ’s prisons , and their incarceration helps no one .
Most prisoners can and should be released .
The number of those who actually must be isolated from society would not lead to overcrowding or be an ungainly financial burden .
California ’s recidivism rate is the highest in America .
The system does not work .
Indeed , people go in as small - time thieves and come out far worse .
They go in as drug users and come out desensitized to savage violence .
They go in as burglars and come out as rapists .
Prisons increase crime .
Conservatives talk about the good old days when there was more civility , more freedom , lower taxes and less crime .
There were also far fewer prisons .
Until the modern system is rethought , we can never restore the liberty and social peace we once had .

Oh sure , technically COPS is still a current show , but seriously , the formula has n't changed in eons .
TASER International 's AXON / EVIDENCE.com tandem is gearing up to change all that -- so long as officers agree to strap the hardware on their person , that is .
In short , AXON is an on - officer recording system that captures audio and video of arrests , and after the scuffle is complete , it sends the data ( encrypted heavily , of course ) to EVIDENCE.com servers that are managed far , far away from the potentially dubious grasp of police departments .
There are built in sensors to see if any data has been tampered with , and if all goes to plan , the entire system should be ready for deployment in Q3 of this year .
In other words , go ahead and get all your stupidity out before the summer ends .

Two American hate preachers have been banned from entering the UK where they planned to picket a play by a gay youth group , the Home Office said today .
Extremist Christian leaders Fred Phelps and daughter Shirley Phelps - Roper were to protest outside a performance of The Laramie Project , the story of an American man killed for being gay , being performed at a school arts centre in Basingstoke , Hampshire , tomorrow .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has barred them and a UK Border Agency spokesman said : " The Home Secretary has excluded both Fred Phelps and his daughter Shirley Phelps - Roper from the UK .
" Both these individuals have engaged in unacceptable behaviour by inciting hatred against a number of communities .
" The Government has made it clear it opposes extremism in all its forms .
" We will continue to stop those who want to spread extremism , hatred and violent messages in our communities from coming to our country .
" That was the driving force behind the tighter rules on exclusion for unacceptable behaviour that the Home Secretary announced on October 28 last year .
" The exclusions policy is targeted at all those who seek to stir up tension and provoke others to violence regardless of their origins and beliefs . "
Phelps , 79 , and his daughter Shirley , 51 , belong to the US Westboro Baptist Church based in Kansas which calls for homosexuals to be killed .
Its members , mostly Phelps 's relatives , regularly picket US soldiers ' funerals as the sect believes their deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan are punishment for America 's tolerance of gays .

Their homophobic exploits were exposed in 2007 by TV documentary - maker Louis Theroux .
Other church members could also be stopped if they try to enter Britain , according to reports .
It follows the ban on Dutch MP Geert Wilders entering the UK last week for his extremist views on Islam .
Peter Tatchell , from gay rights group OutRage ! , said : " The Phelps are odious , homophobic bigots .
They give Christianity a bad name .
" Objectionable though they are , I do n't agree with them being banned but since the Home Secretary banned the Dutch MP Geert Wilders at least she is being consistent by also banning these Christian preachers of hate .
" It makes it all the more odd that the Home Secretary has not banned Jamaican reggae singers who incite the murder of gay people .
" Why are they allowed in to the country but not the Phelps ?
" Inciting murder is even worse than inciting hatred .
Why the double standards ? "
Add Full - Text Search to your Django project with Whoosh
Whoosh is a pure - python full - text indexing and searching library .
Whoosh was opensourced recently and makes it easy to add a fulltext search to your site without any external services like Lucene or Solr for example .
Whoosh is pretty flexible , but to keep it simple let 's assume that the index is stored in settings .
WHOOSH_INDEX ( which should be a path on the filesystem ) and that our application is a Wiki and we want to search the Wiki pages .
Indexing Documents
Before we can query the index we have to make sure that the documents are indexed properly and automatically .
It does n't matter if you put the following code into a new app or an existing app .
You only have to make sure , that it lives in a file , which is loaded by Django when the process starts , resonable places would be the __init__.py or the models .
py file ( or any file imported in those of course ) in any app .
The following code listing is interrupted by short explanaitions but should be saved into one file :
import os from django.db. models import signals from django.conf import settings from whoosh import store , fields , index from rcs.wiki.models import WikiPage WHOOSH_SCHEMA
= fields .
Schema ( title = fields .
TEXT ( stored = True ) , content = fields .
TEXT , url = fields .
ID ( stored = True , unique = True ) )
At the top of the file a Schema is defined .
The Schema tells Whoosh what data should go into the index and how it should be organized .
In this example every indexed document is stored as three fields by whoosh :
title : A title of the document is stored in the index .
: A title of the document is stored in the index .
content : Content is the content of the document , Whoosh will not store the whole content in the index but will only use the data to build it 's index .
: Content is the content of the document , Whoosh will not store the whole content in the index but will only use the data to build it 's index .
url :
To make it easier to uniquely identify a document in the index and to link to the document on the search result pages without fetching the document from the database I decided to store the url to the document in the index .
def create_index ( sender = None , ** kwargs ) : if not os .
path .
exists ( settings .
WHOOSH_INDEX ) : os .
mkdir ( settings .
WHOOSH_INDEX ) storage = store .
FileStorage ( settings .
WHOOSH_INDEX ) ix = index .
Index ( storage , schema = WHOOSH_SCHEMA , create = True ) signals .
post_syncdb .
connect ( create_index )
To make sure the index , which is stored on the filesystem , is available the function create_index is called by Django 's post_syncdb signal and creates the index if it is not already present .
This method uses the Schema defined earlier .
def update_index ( sender , instance , created , ** kwargs ) : storage = store .
FileStorage ( settings .
WHOOSH_INDEX ) ix = index .
Index ( storage , schema = WHOOSH_SCHEMA ) writer = ix . writer ( ) if created : writer .
add_document ( title = unicode ( instance ) , content = instance .
content , url = unicode ( instance . get_absolute_url ( ) ) ) writer .
commit ( ) else : writer .
update_document ( title = unicode ( instance ) , content = instance .
content , url = unicode ( instance . get_absolute_url ( ) ) ) writer .
commit ( ) signals .
post_save .
connect ( update_index , sender = WikiPage )
To make sure the index is automatically updated everytime a page on the Wiki changes , the function update_index is called whenever a WikiPage object sends the post_save signal via Django 's signal framework .
If the instance was created it is added as a new document to the index and if it was edited ( but existed before ) the entry in the index is updated .
The document is identified in the index by it 's unique URL .
Query the Index
At this point we have made sure , that Whoosh will always keep an up - to - date index of our WikiPage pages .
The next step is to create a view , which allows querying the index .
A single view and a template is all we need to let users search the index .
The template contains a simple form :
< form action = " " method = " get " > < input type = " text " id = " id_q " name = " q " value = " {{ query | default_if_none : " " }} " /> < input type = " submit " value = " { % trans " Search " %} " /> </ form >
By setting method to GET and action to an empty string we tell the browsesr to submit the form to the current URL with the value of the input field ( named q ) appended to the url as a querystring .
A search for the term " Django " will result in a request like this :
http://server/somwhere/?q=Django
I 've also added the parsed query back to the search form while displaying the results .
Therefore the user - experience is further improved , because the user can now easily edit the query and submit it again .
If you have a special search page ( instead of a search box on every page ) you might also consider giving focus to the input field to save the user an extra click .
If you do n't use a JavaScript framework a very simple solution would be to use the onload attribute of the body tag :
< body onload = " document.getElementById('id_q ').focus ( ) ; " >
Now lets have a look at the view - code which handles the requests :
from django.conf import settings from django.views.generic.simple import direct_to_template from whoosh import index , store , fields from whoosh .
qparser import QueryParser from somwhere import WHOOSH_SCHEMA def search ( request ) : " " " Simple search view , which accepts search queries via url , like google .
Use something like ?q=this+is+the+serch+term " " " storage = store .
FileStorage ( settings .
WHOOSH_INDEX ) ix = index .
Index ( storage , schema = WHOOSH_SCHEMA ) hits = [ ] query = request .
GET . get ( ' q ' , None ) if query is not None and query != u " " : #
Whoosh do n't understands '+' or ' -' but we can replace # them with ' AND ' and ' NOT '.
query = query .
replace ( '+' , ' AND ' ) .
replace ( ' -' , ' NOT ' ) parser = QueryParser ( " content " , schema = ix . schema ) try : qry = parser .
parse ( query ) except : # do n't show the user weird errors only because we do n't # understand the query . # parser.parse ( " " ) would return None qry =
None if qry is not None : searcher = ix .
searcher ( ) hits = searcher .
search ( qry ) return direct_to_template ( request , ' search.html ' , { ' query ' : query , ' hits ' : hits } )
The view imports the previously defined WHOOSH_SCHEMA and gets the index location from the settings .
Most of the clutter is only there to improve the user - experience by tranforming some chars found in search queries into their Whoosh equivalents and by catching all exceptions raised by the Whoosh QueryParser .
Displaying the search results in the template is pretty straight - forward :
{ % if hits %} < ul > { % for hit in hits %} < li >< a href = " {{ hit.url }} " > {{ hit.
title }} </ a ></ li > { % endfor %} </ ul > { % endif %}
Conclusion
With Whoosh and not more than 100 Lines of code ( including the template ) it is possible to add full - text search capabilities to your Django project .
I 've already added the code above to two projects and I 'm pretty impressed by the ease of use and the performance of Whoosh .
The result is that I can now make my Django powered sites a bit more awesome by adding full - text search ( if applicable ) and the best is : at ~100 LOC it comes almost for free .
Related Projects
For a different approach to add Whoosh to your Django project you might also want to have a look at django - whoosh by Eric Florenzano which is available on GitHub .
Django - Whoosh is basically a Manager which is added to your objects and will take care of indexing and lets you fetch objects by querying the Whoosh index .
The idea is clever but only works if you want to edit the Model classes to add the manager .
My approach is completely based on signals and will therefore work with any reuseable app without editing the app itself .
Another app which combines Whoosh and Django is djoosh , also available on GitHub but it seems as if it 's not finished at the moment .
Djoosh aims to provide a mechanism which allows registering of Models with the Indexing infrastructure in a similar way as contrib.admin does .

Bentos are just starting to penetrate the consciousness of people outside of Japan , though judging from the growing interest in bento sites like this one and several others , it 's definitely trending up .
However , the bento or obento ( the more polite honorific term ) in its many guises is an integral part of life in Japan .
Here are the many different types of bento that a typical Japanese person might eat at different stages of life .
The Preschool Years
Pre-school institutions in Japan are nursery school ( 保育園 ほいくえん hoiku - en ) , which is for children aged about 2 to to 4 , and kindergarten ( 幼稚園 ようちえん yoh - chi- en ) , for age 5 to 1st grade .
Most pre-schools do not have school lunch facilities , so children are required to bring bentos for lunch .
For mothers , making bentos every day for their children can be a stressful yet exciting challenge .
Some mothers ( and even a couple of fathers ) knock themselves out making charaben or kyaraben ( キャラ弁） , those highly decorated , cute bentos that still get the lion 's share of attention outside of Japan when it comes to bentos .
The most - often stated reason for charaben is to encourage picky eaters to eat their food , but I 've always thought that their role as a creative outlet for the mothers , as well as the urge to compete against other kids ' bentos ( and by extension , their mothers ' bento skills ) are just as strong incentives .
Every lunchtime can be a contest of sorts as to who has the cutest bento .
There are also numerous formal contests that a charaben enthusiast can enter to win prizes , money and more .
Elementary ( Primary ) School Years
Most elementary or primary schools ( 小学校 しょうがっこう shoh - gakkou ) have school lunch programs , so mothers are relieved from everyday bento duty .
However , bentos are still necessary for school outings ( 遠足 えんそく ensoku ) , which occur once or twice every school year .
( Read about my ensoku bentos when I was a kid , which were a lot simpler than this one . )
Another occasion when bentos are needed is the annual Sports Festival （運動会 うんどうかい undohkai ) .
This is a school - wide event where the kids are divided into two teams , Red and White , and compete in various athletic events .
Parents are supposed to attend , and at lunchtime the whole family sits somewhere within the school grounds and tucks into a big family bento .
This is another opportunity for the creative bentoist to show his or her skills off .
And of course , during summer vacation the family might go on a trip to the mountains or the seaside , with some onigiri ( rice balls ) or even a picnic basket .
The High School Years ( Grades 7 to 12 in the U.S. )
High school is divided into junior high , or middle school ( 中学校 ちゅがっこう chuugakkkoh ) and senior high , or upper school ( 高校 こうこう kohkoh or 高等学校 こうとうがっこう kohtoh gakkoh ) .
Many high schools do n't have cafeterias or school lunch programs , so it 's back to bento again .
Boys of this age are growing rapidly and have huge appetites , so their mothers pack them big bentos ( ドカ弁 dokaben ) .
The boys are often still hungry , so they supplement their bentos with sweet ( お菓子パ ン）or savory ( おかずパン ）filled breads like a yakisoba pan ( a roll filled with fried noodles ) , anpan ( a roll filled with sweet red bean paste ) , hotdogs and so on , bought at a convenience store or bakery .
Some girls are as hungry as the boys ( especially if they participate in after - school sports ) and require big bentos too , but others like small , pretty bentos that help them to watch their weight （ダイエット弁当 , diet bento ) , made by their ever obliging mothers .
Ronin-sei and College / University Years
In Japan , the best way to assure future success in life is to enter a good university .
Because of this , competition for entry into the best schools like Tokyo University is extremely fierce - so fierce in fact that if someone does n't get in on the first try ( they can take the entrance exams in their last year of high school ) they will try once , twice , even more times , going to exam prep schools .
These in - between students are called 浪人生 ( ろうにんせい rohninsei ) , which comes from the word 浪人 ( ろうにん rohnin ) , which were what out - of - work samurai were called in the olden days .
Rohnin-sei , as well as college kids , have notoriously poor eating habits , especially the boys .
These students rely a lot on what 's available at their local konbini ( コンビニ , convenience store ) .
Konbini stock a lot of readymade bentos .
They are n't necessarily healthy choices , since they tend to have a lot of deep fried or otherwise high - fat foods in them , but they are probably better than cup noodles and hamburgers .
Girls of this period in life might also go for pretty food with a pseudo - European flair .
This is typically served at cafes and is called ' Cafe style ' .
Cafe style bentos ( カフェ弁当 , cafe bento ) come in alternate packaging and in small portions .
There 's usually a dessert too .
( For some reason , desserts , fruit and other sweet things are considered the domain of women in Japan , and not very manly . )
( See also :
Take a virtual bento trip in Japan , a photo trip through a department store food hall 's bento section . )
Young Adults , Newlyweds
After graduating from university , both single guys and girls continue to rely on konbini bento and the like for their sustenance , though many women , and some men , start making their own , health - conscious bentos .
( Incidentally , this type of bento is what Just Bento is mostly about ! )
Once they get married , a guy might be lucky enough to get a wife who takes the time to make him ' Loving Wife Bento ' , or 愛妻弁当 ( あいさいべんとう aisai bento ) .
These tend to be cute , colorful bentos , nutritonally balanced , often with little love messages ( edible or not ) in them - sort of a grown up version of charaben .
The honeymoon period does not last long for most couples .
The Child Rearing and Working Years
When the kids come , there 's no time to make heart shapes on Dad 's bento , so his bentos become purely practical , tasty and nutritious .
The thermal bento packed with hot rice ( hokaben , ホカ弁 ）is popular amongst men of a certain age .
Also popular amongst those men of a certain age , but across all ages too , are train station bentos ( 駅弁 , ekiben ) .
Many people dream of taking a leisurely trip around the country , riding local rail lines and enjoying regional bentos .
Most people do n't have that kind of time though , so they content themselves by buying ekiben in the food halls of department stores .
Once the kids are bigger , Mom has a bit more leisure time .
She might take advantage of that by enjoying lunches out with her friends .
They might enjoy an elegant bento lunch ( 幕の内弁当 , makunouchi bento ) at a traditional Japanese restaurant , but might keep it a secret from their husbands .
These ladies of a certain age have a lot of influence on which restaurants become popular .
( A cliché is that if you see a lot of middle - aged women at a restaurant around lunchtime , that place is bound to be good and a good value too . )
The Golden Years
A retired couple , if they do n't get divorced ( ' retirement divorce ' is an increasing phenomenon in Japan ) have a lot more leisure time .
With the kids grown up and hopefully gone ( though many adult children in Japan continue to live with their parents , especially if unmarried ) they can indulge in things like home delivered bento （お取り寄せ弁当） without breaking the bank .
The older a Japanese person gets , the more they tend to prefer simple , traditional food .
Simple onigiri ( rice balls ) , perhaps filled with homemade umeboshi , are a perfect bento snack or lunch .
In fact , onigiri are universally loved - they are soul food for Japanese people .
A few other bento types and vocabulary
Kouraku bento ( 行楽弁当 ) - any type of bento eaten on an outing , such as for cherry blossom viewing .
Can be an elaborate makunouchi bento , or something assembled at a convenience store .
Ohanami bento ( お花見弁当） - a bento eaten while admiring the cherry blossoms .
Omotenashi bento ( おもてなし弁当 ) - bentos served to guests ; usually a makunouchi bento type .
Shoukadou bento ( 松花堂弁当） - related to makunouchi bento ; a formal bento served at restaurants , where a deep bento box is divided into 4 equal sections , each section with a small serving dish .
Hinomaru bento ( 日の丸弁当 ） - the simplest kind of bento ; the box is filled with white rice , and an umeboshi ( pickled plum ) is placed in the middle .
Jukuben ( 塾弁） - a light bento eaten in the evening at juku ( exam prep school ) .
Most Japanese schoolkids go to a juku at some point in their lives .
And just in case you were wondering , all of the bentos in the photos are Re-ment miniatures .

RiffTrax , the Mystery Science Theater 3000 spinoff whose creators dare to make fun of good movies , is taking down a set of horror and sci- fi classics .
Bill Corbett , RiffTrax commentator and former star of the movie - mocking show famous for tackling B-movies , is joining fellow MST3K alums Kevin Murphy and Michael J. Nelson to record a series of commentaries on fright flicks like Night of the Living Dead and The House on Haunted Hill – available for $ 4 a pop .
The final title in the series , the low - budget cult classic Carnival of Souls , arrives online Tuesday .
It 's a return to an old haunt for Nelson , who did funny DVD commentary tracks for Legend Films ' genre titles in the days before RiffTrax .
Now Corbett ( pictured , center ) and Murphy have joined Nelson to give Legend 's titles the full RiffTrax treatment .
" It seems that the ( RiffTrax download of ) Plan Nine From Outer Space we did together was a big success , " Corbett said .
" So Legend Films wanted to transform some of their other titles .
Most of these originals were done in a very different style by Mike , before RiffTrax became what it is today .
More conversational , with trivia , information about the actors , etc .
They were sort of like goofy versions of actual DVD commentaries , as opposed to riffing the movie . "
RiffTrax is attracting an impressive following , and some of that might be credited to the team 's controversial decision to riff on high - quality movies .
While MST3K and Cinematic Titanic , Joel Hodgson 's movie - mocking DVD line , focus exclusively on B- movies , RiffTrax has gone after well - received recent hits Casino Royale and The Dark Knight , as well as all - time classics like Raiders of the Lost Ark .
" The decision ( to riff quality movies ) was an experiment to see if we could make some good movies funny , " Corbett said .
" So , we went after films that were well - received by the public – and by us .
For some people , it does n't work .
I enjoy doing the cheesy movies more , but I enjoy the challenge . "
Corbett 's roles as Brain Guy and the second realization of movie - mocking machine Crow T. Robot on the final three seasons of MST3 K put him in a position to branch out into RiffTrax .
A new DVD set from Shout Factory , Mystery Science Theater 3000 : XIV , features two episodes ( " Final Justice " and " Soul Taker " ) from Corbett 's time on the show .
Corbett , a Minneapolis - based teacher and playwright , took a long path to the movie - mocking profession .
He originally came to MST3K when the show was well into its run on Comedy Central .
Corbett knew several of the long - lived series ' regulars from the local comedy and theater scenes , and worked up the nerve at a party to ask Nelson if he needed any writers .
" He said to come down and try it out , " Corbett said .
Corbett clicked with the team and worked on the show 's final , stripped - down season on Comedy Central before its cable network contract ended , leaving him to believe his Satellite of Love adventure was over .
He moved to Los Angeles , but was quickly pulled back into MST3 K 's orbit .
" Mike called me and said The Sci Fi Channel had picked up the show , " Corbett said .
" Would I want to return as a writer ?
I was n't finding anything in L.A. , so I moved back to work on Mystery Science Theater . "
Trace Beaulieu , the puppeteer who originally operated and voiced Crow T. Robot , had moved on from the show .
That left the robot lacking a voice and a personality .
While there was some talk of introducing a new robot , it was decided that Crow 's design was too well - known to replace – so Corbett stepped in as the character 's performer and operator until the show 's conclusion in 1999 .
RiffTrax and its tackling of the horror classics are at the center of Corbett 's universe now , and he 's enjoyed taking on the famous titles .
" ( The commentaries ) have been rewritten and added to pretty substantially , as I can attest since I wrote whole big chunks without referring back to Mike 's original work , " he said .
" Night of the Living Dead – and newest , Carnival of Souls , had never really been ' riffed ' in our style before . "

Set along a slope in the mountains of Alto Palancia , Jérica is a beautiful village with an abundance of sights .
Easily reachable from Valencia by regional train , it makes an excellent day trip .
No more than 200 meters from the railway station ( “ Jérica - Vivier ” on the C5 , one stop past Navajas ) , Jérica has a population of less than 2000 people , but offers plenty to see .
The first stop should be to the tourist office , unmissable & found near the entrance to the city walls .
Apparently , Jérica is not exactly overrun with tourists — the man working in the office absolutely came to life when we entered , brushing the cobwebs off his shoulder and eagerly launching into his long forgotten art of Advice Giving .
The first dated accounts of a settlement in Jérica are from Muslim times , in the 11th Century .
The city towers — its most recognizable and impressive landmarks — date from this time .
Walking around Jérica means a lot of ascending and descending .
The city is small enough to make getting lost nearly impossible , and around nearly every curve , something else impressive reveals itself … an old church , a covered alleyway , a strange Christ icon , an old lady selling olive oil from her window , an ancient gate .
It makes for a great couple hours of exploration .
Once you ’ve had lunch ( we enjoyed an excellent € 8 menú del día at Tonico ) , you ’ll have the necessary strength to walk up to La Torreta , an abandoned watchtower in need of repair set on Jérica ’s highest point .
From here , you ’ll have an amazing view of the region .
To the northwest you can see Viver , a similarly - sized town 2 kilometers away , and an impressive cliff face and valley to the south .
A round trip ticket on the Renfe train costs around € 8,40 .
Jérica itself does n’t demand more than a few hours , but there ’s excellent hiking and biking opportunities in the area , as well .
In that case , you ’d probably want to stay the night .
This was a wonderful day trip .
I think next time , we ’ll be taking our hiking boots — the Alto Palancia area has a lot to offer the intrepid .

It would take astronauts many months to get to the Red Planet
A Big Brother - style experiment to test whether humans could travel to Mars and back has begun in Moscow .
Six volunteers from Russia , France and Germany have been locked into a capsule to simulate the conditions of a manned flight to the planet lasting two years .
Those who survive more than 100 days experiencing the same isolation and claustrophobia as astronauts will earn a $ 20,000 ( £ 14,000 ) reward .
If any of the six men get homesick , they will be allowed to come out early .
Inside the mock spacecraft , the volunteer astronauts will also have the same daily work routine and the same communication problems with mission control that real astronauts face .
CAPSULE 'ASTRONAUTS '
Sergei Ryazansky , Russian cosmonaut Oleg Artemyez , Russian cosmonaut Alexei Baranov , Russian doctor Alexei Shpakov , Russian sports physiotherapist Cyrille Fournier , French pilot Oliver Knickel , German engineer
That means , for example , the time delay of 20 minutes that a spacecraft near to Mars would encounter sending an astronaut 's voice back to Earth .
" The experiment wo n't be fun but it is an honour , " Sergei Ryazansky , the Russian commander of the mock spacecraft , admitted to the BBC .
Although any of the volunteers could leave if they could stand it no longer , every effort would be made to persuade them to stay for the full 105 days , he added .
" How do I feel ?
I am very motivated .
There is a kind of relief .
We have been working for a long time and finally were are getting to the start point , " said Cyrille Fournier just hours before entering the capsule .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The challenge is to live with the same people for a long period but it is a positive challenge .
I think we are going to learn a lot about each other , " his fellow volunteer , Oliver Knickel , added .
The experiment is a joint project between the Institute for Medical - Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences , and the European Space Agency .
" This is a preliminary , short experiment while the main 520 - day research is scheduled to begin at the end of 2009 or the beginning of 2010 , " said Pavel Morgunov , a spokesman for the Moscow institute .

There may not be an open war , quite yet , between the Secretary of Defense and the leadership of the Air Force .
But there is serious , palatable tension .
And a nasty game of brinksmanship over the use of drones in the Middle East has only made things worse .
Last fall , the Pentagon 's civilian chiefs shot down an Air Force move to take over almost all of the military 's big unmanned aircraft .
" There has to be a better way to do this , " complained Air Force chief of staff , Gen. Michael " Buzz " Moseley .
Things only got more tense when Gates said that the future of conflict is in small , " asymmetric " wars – wars in which the Air Force takes a back seat to ground forces .
Then Gates noted that the Air Force 's most treasured piece of gear , the F - 22 stealth fighter , basically has no role in the war on terror .
And when a top Air Force general said the service was planning on buying twice as many of the jets – despite orders from Gates and the rest of the civilian leadership – he was rebuked for " borderline insubordination . "
Now comes word from * L.A. Times ' * ace Peter Spiegel that Gates " has ordered the Air Force to put nearly all of its unmanned Predator aircraft into the skies over the
Middle East , forcing the service to take steps that officers worry could hobble already - stressed drone squadrons . "
**
Pressure from the Defense secretary in recent months has nearly doubled the number of Predators available to help hunt insurgents and find roadside bombs in Iraq .
But it has forced air commanders into a scramble for crews that officers said could hurt morale and harm the long - term viability of the Predator program . *
Some officers said pressure from Gates resulted in one plan that could have taken the Air Force down a path similar to the German Luftwaffe , which cut back training in World War II to get more pilots in the air . *
" That was the end of their air force , " said Col. Chris Chambliss , commander of the Air Force 's Predator wing .
The Air Force plan , presented to the military leadership in January , eventually was scaled back ...*
In response , the Air Force has stepped up training .
Next year , commanders will train 200 two - man crews to remotely fly a fleet of
Predators that numbers more than 100 , as well as a larger version called the Reaper , mostly out of a spartan air base in the Nevada desert .
Trainers will turn out more pilots for Predators next year than for all other Air Force fighter planes combined .
** But in the most dramatic example of brinkmanship in the struggle , the plan debated by the military leadership in January would have shut down the Predator training operation in order to increase to 36 the number of Predators continuously flying combat patrols in the Middle East by
August .
** The plan was dubbed " all in " by its developer , Gen. T. Michael Moseley , the Air Force chief of staff .
** Although the most drastic parts of Moseley 's " all in " plan have not been carried out , the Predator program has been forced through three makeovers since July , and the service has had to take aggressive steps to meet the new demand .
** At first , the Air Force extended the tours of the Predator crews .
By
September , however , officials began to recall many of the pilots who had completed their Predator duty and left for fighter and bomber assignments elsewhere .
** Then , as part of the January deal , Predator and Reaper crews were frozen .
Even pilots who have been flying drones nonstop for three years will have to remain in Nevada for at least two more years .
Many of them originally were trained as fighter and bomber pilots .
** Air Force officials are acutely aware that their concerns may seem like whining , particularly compared with Army counterparts who serve
15 - month tours in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Still , Predator crews have been working 13 - hour days , sometimes six days a week , for three years with no end in sight .
** " Now we 're saying : ' Hey , you guys are just going to be here until we stop , ' " said Chambliss , the Predator wing commander , comparing the tours of duty to " a prisoner with a finite term versus a prisoner with a life sentence . "
It 's funny .
A yew years back , flying a Predator was considered a pretty cushy gig .
" Most of the time , I get to fight the war , and go home and see the wife and kids at night , " one Predator pilot told me .
Now the guy 's a " prisoner ? "
I 'm not sure the Air Force is really helping themselves in this fight , by throttling up the rhetoric so high .

Ex -UN prosecutor : Bush may be next up for International Criminal Court Stephen C. Webster
Published : Saturday March 7 , 2009
Print This Email This
An ex-UN prosecutor has said that following the issuance of an arrest warrant for the president of Sudan , former US President George W. Bush could -- and should -- be next on the International Criminal Court 's list .
The former prosecutor 's assessment was echoed in some respect by United Nations General Assembly chief Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua , who said America 's military occupation of Iraq has caused over a million deaths and should be probed by the United Nations .
" David Crane , an international law professor at Syracuse University , said the principle of law used to issue an arrest warrant for [ Sudanese President ]
Omar al - Bashir could extend to former US President Bush over claims officials from his Administration may have engaged in torture by using coercive interrogation techniques on terror suspects , " reported the New Zealand Herald .
The indictment of Bashir was a landmark , said Crane , because it paved a route for the court at The Hague to pursue heads of states engaged in criminality .
" Crane also said that the [ Bashir ] indictment may even be extended to the former president George W. Bush , on the grounds that some officials in terms of his administration engaged in harsh interrogation techniques on terror suspects which mostly amounted to torture , " said Turkish Weekly .
" All pretended justifications notwithstanding , the aggressions against Iraq and Afghanistan and their occupations constitute atrocities that must be condemned and repudiated by all who believe in the rule of law in international relations , " Brockmann told the Human Rights Council .
" The illegality of the use of force against Iraq can not be doubted as it runs contrary to the prohibition of the use of force in Article 2 ( 4 ) of the United Nations Charter .
It sets a number of precedents that we cannot allow to stand . "
The Bush administration boycotted the Human Rights Council .
The day Brockmann made his accusations happened to be the first in which the United States had observers at the council , on orders from President Obama .
According to Iranian news network PressTV , the Iranian government called the Bashir indictment " a blow to International justice " and an " insult directed at Muslims . "
Iran 's plainly stated sentiment toward the court 's legitimacy is similar in spirit to that of the United States .
Because the US Government has refused to recognize the court by becoming a signatory in its statute , " the only other way Bush could be investigated is if the [ UN ]
Security Council were to order it , something unlikely to happen with Washington a veto - wielding permanent member , " said the Herald .
Due to the International Criminal Court 's lack of any real police force , it has traditionally relied upon signatory states for enforcement of its rulings .
But when the leader of one such state is indicted , the court 's authority and enforcement capability is called into question .
Even the arrest of Bashir is a far cry , for now .
And without a UN Security Council order , former US President Bush would not go on " trial " before the court any time soon .
However , on January 26 , United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture Manfred Nowak insisted that the pursuit of Bush and members of his administration for the torture of terror war prisoners is crucial if justice is to be served .
Nowak added that he believes enough evidence exists currently to proceed with the prosecution of Donald Rumsfeld , the former Secretary of Defense who was credited as being highly influential in the crafting and push for America 's invasion of Iraq and the prior administration 's abusive interrogation tactics .

Pictured : World 's first truly blue roses go on display in Japan
They are the stuff of legend - signifying mystery and traditionally believed to be able to grant the owner youth .
For years breeders have crossed different colours of roses in an effort to create the impossible .
But rose petals lack the enzyme needed to create a blue pigment and the breeders always failed .
Now for the first time , thanks to genetic engineering , blue roses finally exist .
The stuff of legend : Blue roses have gone on display in Japan and will be on sale next year
The very first truly blue roses have gone on display in Japan and will be on sale to the public next year .
After 13 years of research the Japanese Suntory company have finally perfected the mythical flower .
Working with the Australian company Florigene the researchers took the delphinidin gene , which creates the blue colour , from a petunia .
They then inserted it into a mauve rose called the Cardinal de Richelieu .
The resultant flower was a dark burgundy colour due to an excess of the blue pigment cyanidin .
After using RNAi technology to reduce this the final blue rose was today unveiled at the annual Flower Expo held at Makuhari Messe in Chiba , Japan .
Genetically engineered :
The flowers have a gene from a petunia inserted in them
BURLINGAME , Calif . 
In the span of just a couple of years , Hadoop , a free software program named after a toy elephant , has taken over some of the world ’s biggest Web sites .
It controls the top search engines and determines the ads displayed next to the results .
It decides what people see on Yahoo ’s homepage and finds long - lost friends on Facebook .
It has achieved this by making it easier and cheaper than ever to analyze and access the unprecedented volumes of data churned out by the Internet .
By mapping information spread across thousands of cheap computers and by creating an easier means for writing analytical queries , engineers no longer have to solve a grand computer science challenge every time they want to dig into data .
Instead , they simply ask a question .
“ It ’s a breakthrough , ” said Mark Seager , head of advanced computing at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .
“ I think this type of technology will solve a whole new class of problems and open new services . ”
Three top engineers from Google , Yahoo and Facebook , along with a former executive from Oracle , are betting it will .
They announced a start - up Monday called Cloudera , based in Burlingame , Calif. , that will try to bring Hadoop ’s capabilities to industries as far afield as genomics , retailing and finance .
Born in late February at the Schwerin Zoo in Northern Germany , this baby gibbon was abandoned by its mother and is now being hand raised .

A hoary truism teaches us that crisis reveals character , rather than shaping it .
To the extent the word “ character ” applies to the government ruling us , that maxim certainly applies with respect to the state of permanent crisis we have experienced since 9 - 11 .
The tyrannical practices and powers associated with Homeland Security — from aggressive war to torture — are not a novelty of the " post - 9- 11 era . "
The open - ended “ war on terror ” simply provided an opportunity for the State ’s agents to institutionalize official crimes that had been committed on a more informal basis prior to The Day Everything Changed .
At the malignant heart of this system we find the extraordinary claim — now embraced , to the surprise only of the professionally gullible , by Obama the Blessed and his ruling clique — that the president has the power to order the open - ended detention of anyone he designates an “ enemy combatant . ”
This claim , which was embraced by Congress in the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 , is a de facto repeal of habeas corpus .
This is the foundation of due process in the Anglo - Saxon tradition of liberty and perhaps the most important concession wrested from King John at Runnymede in 1215 .
Absent the protection provided by habeas corpus , rulers can forego such formalities as indictment and trial and simply lock people up until they run out of birthdays .
The Bush Regime insisted that the president , through the exercise of a protean , extra-constitutional “ commander - in - chief ” power , can designate individuals as “ enemy combatants ” and imprison them indefinitely , even having them tortured as he saw fit .
In order to preserve that supposed authority , Bush and his handlers released “ enemy combatant ” Jos Padilla from military confinement into the civilian criminal justice system in an attempt to avoid a Supreme Court challenge to the policy of presidentially ordered detention that they probably would n’t win .
This was done after the administration had insisted for years that Padilla was too dangerous to be tried in the civilian courts .
Now the Obama administration is pursuing exactly the same course with respect to a case involving a second “ enemy combatant , ” Ali Al - Marri .
Although media commentators insist that Obama is “ likely to handle accused terrorists in a significantly different way ” from that followed by his predecessor , the crucial point here is that he , like Bush , sought to render Al - Marri ’s case moot , preserving the presidential claim by default .
The Military Commissions
Act was not the only , or even the first , assault on the habeas corpus guarantee .
An earlier , and more damaging , attack came in the form of the “ Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 , ” which permits the open - ended “ civil confinement ” of those who are designated “ sexually dangerous persons ” ( a category that sounds a lot like the old Soviet concept of “ socially dangerous persons ” ) .
“ Civil confinement ” is a variation on “ civil commitment , ” under which the several states , acting on the malevolent doctrine of parens patriae ( the “ parenthood ” of the state ) , institutionalize the mentally ill for treatment .
As the Soviets ( and their proxies ) demonstrated through their use of psychiatry as an enforcement arm of the State ( the assumption being that only the mentally ill would dissent from the Party - ordained consensus ) , this practice is pregnant with awful abuses , one of which is its subtle expansion to include sex offenders who have served their allotted sentences but are still confined to state custody .
Massachusetts recently became the first state to have a “ sexually dangerous person ” civilly committed to the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons under the Adam Walsh Act .
This amounts to a life sentence inflicted , “ Minority Report ” - style , for hypothetical crimes yet to be committed .
In January , the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the federal civil confinement of sex offenders on narrowly federalist grounds .
That court quite properly pointed out that Congress had exceeded its constitutional authority by creating a federal system of civil confinement .
But the deeper question — can any government , state or federal , simply amend a court - prescribed punishment into a life sentence ? — was left untouched by that court .
The issue is headed to the Supreme Court and , once again , the Obama / Holder “ Justice ” Department has adopted the perspective of the Bush administration on this issue , namely that the end of a prison term does n’t necessarily mean the end of an individual ’s imprisonment .
The practice of open - ended imprisonment is not limited to convicted sex offenders .
In fact , through judicial " civil contempt " citations , self - renewing prison terms have been inflicted on U.S. citizens who have not even been accused of criminal offenses .
One of the sitting Supreme Court Justices , Samuel Alito , has already ruled in favor of indefinite detention without trial in the “ civil contempt ” case of H. Beatty Chadwick , a cancer - stricken 73 - year - old former attorney who has been imprisoned for 14 years on a civil contempt charge .
The charge against Chadwick grew out of a contentious and bizarre divorce in 1992 .
His ex-wife Barbara made extensive and uncorroborated claims of suffering from abuse , manipulation , and pathological control at the hands of her ex-husband .
She demanded millions in alimony , and the trial judge ordered Chadwick to put the funds in a court - controlled account .
Chadwick claimed that the sought - for millions did n’t exist .
When investigators hired by the court could n’t find more than a small fraction of the expected sums , the Judge found Chadwick in contempt and sent him to prison , presumably to jar his memory or at least break his will .
And he remains in prison to this day , despite the fact that he has never so much as been accused of a crime , let alone tried or convicted for one .
When the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year that some detainees at Guantanamo are covered by the habeas corpus guarantee , a writer who has chronicled the Chadwick case took note of the ironic fact that accused terrorists actually enjoy due process protections Chadwick has been denied .
Just a few months earlier , a three - judge federal panel dismissed a habeas corpus petition filed by Chadwick on the remarkable grounds that if he were permitted to challenge his detention he would go free , and thus will have “ beaten the system . “
We can’t have that , of course .
Samuel Alito ’s contribution to this matter was a ruling in 2002 that Chadwick ’s imprisonment without trial — which at that time had lasted merely seven years — was permissible because the purpose of civil contempt is coercion , rather than punishment .
Thus it is a form of extortion through confinement , which — Alito ’s schoolboy sophistries aside — is unambiguously a form of cruel and unusual punishment , in addition to a violation of the guarantee of a fair and speedy trial and the protection against self - incrimination .
All of those abuses , according to Alito and his ilk , are acceptable when a Judge recites the incantatory phrase “ civil contempt . ”
Chadwick ’s case , though exemplary in its cruelty , is hardly unique .
Political prisoner : Former investment manager Martin Armstrong , imprisoned for years without benefit of trial .
Ten years ago , Martin A. Armstrong — who dealt in precious metals , antiquities , and other investments — was accused of securities fraud by the federal government ( which prefers to have a monopoly on the practice of securities fraud and related corruption ) .
Ordered by a judge to produce $ 5 million in gold and other assets , Armstrong replied that he did n’t have them .
Insisting that Armstrong was lying , the judge ordered him imprisoned for civil contempt — indefinitely .
Denied access to a jury trial , cut off from the resources needed to mount a defense , Armstrong has now served a longer prison term than he would have been given if convicted of the fraud charge of which he remains legally innocent .
His former clients have been repaid the money they lost in what was , according to Armstrong , a devastating loss growing out of high - risk transactions he did not authorize .
In 2006 , shortly after being ordered into solitary confinement in “ the hole ” in Manhattan ’s Metropolitan Correctional Center , Armstrong was brow - beaten into a guilty plea on one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud .
This was the end result of the government ’s strategy of attrition , according to his attorney , Thomas Sjoblom : “ I think the government just wore Marty out . ”
Through the practice of judicial extortion called “ civil contempt , ” notes the New York Times , “ criminal prosecutors have never had to prove their 24 - count indictment at trial … .
Nevertheless , they have gotten their desired result — a lengthy prison term for Mr. Armstrong . ”
Federal prosecutors , it should n’t be necessary to point out , are formed from the congealed scum that suppurates out through the cracks of our most prestigious law schools .
Their mission is to climb the career ladder to ever - greater heights of wealth and prestige by vindicating the federal government in every legal conflict , irrespective of the truth of a given case .
Federal attorneys have long made use of “ civil ” lawsuits to compel inoffensive citizens and business owners to comply with bureaucratic enactments .
They , along with law enforcement agencies both federal and local , have made extensive use of “ civil ” asset forfeiture to steal untold amounts of money and property from people never formally charged with crimes .
And , acting in collusion the infinitely vain , dress - wearing chair - moisteners who call themselves “ Judges , ” prosecutors can use “ civil contempt confinement ” to circumnavigate the criminal justice system altogether .
Soviet - style arbitrary , extra- juridical imprisonment did n’t begin with the Bush Regime , which refined and institutionalized that abuse by listing it under the prerogatives of the “ unitary executive ” ( a concept , incidentally , that was pioneered with the help of a young Reagan Justice Department lawyer named … Samuel Alito ) .
I ca n’t help but suspect that Obama and his legions of plunderers and social engineers will find novel and terrifying uses for the practice in the service of their vision of “ social justice . ”

Measuring the Design Process
Measuring the Design Process
Posted Mar 21 , 2009 — 43 comments below Posted Mar 21 , 2009 — 43 comments below
Both John Gruber and Buzz Anderson have commented on the experiences of former design lead at Google , Doug Bowman .
Doug 's observation is that at Google , every design decision must be backed by data .
In essence , you mustyou 're right .
The post is quite short , but it resonates with me because I 've seen the same thing at other companies .
Let me say first that I have enormous respect for Google .
Not only have I benefitted from their products , but also their culture .
The company is famous for being an unapologetically engineering - centric environment .
And this is at the core of the discussion .
The most contentious point between software engineering culture and visual design culture is the question of whether important things can be always seen in absolutes .
The engineering approach values measurable , reproducible results which can be represented in a graph or a checklist .
Unit tests and benchmarks illustrate progress .
The nature of computers calls for this kind of mindset — it 's a good match .
Computers are incapable of making true judgement calls or subjective decisions .
And inconsistent crashes are the hardest to debug .
Predictability in computers is a very good thing because we would be in a lot of trouble if routers got bored , for example .
Packets , thankfully , also do n't have an preference for which kinds of routers they pass through .
But when we talk about end - user software that humans directly interact with , things change quite a bit .
If you want to have a successful end - user product , you need to involve a designer .
Visual design is often the polar opposite of engineering : trading hard edges for subjective decisions based on gut feelings and personal experiences .
It 's messy , unpredictable , and notoriously hard to measure .
The apparently erratic behavior of artists drives engineers bananas .
Their decisions seem arbitrary and risk everything with no guaranteed benefit .
Designers , though , are just as frustrated by the apparent blind allegiance toat the cost of human experiences .
They often feel as if engineers lose sight of the actual goal .
Artists see data as a tool only , not a purpose onto itself .
The reason for this is simple : data in isolation makes no guarantees about whether the correct thing is being measured , or whether the measuring itself is skewing the results .
If the decision affects humans , a human must intervene to interpret the results .
Humans are willing to risk being wrong if it means there 's a chance of finding something better .
Artists are used to working on these terms .
I 've seen some quite negative reactions to Doug Bowman 's post , which insinuated he was ungrateful for his position at Google .
Most of this seemed to hinge on the phraseBut I think this phrase was widely misinterpreted .
It does n't mean " I do n't like working in this environment " .
Rather , it means " You are forcing me to deliver an inferior result based on a flawed belief .
" That belief is that data can't lie .
Even though individuals in Doug 's position are brought in as experts in their field , eager to share their insights , they are often hired under the incorrect assumption that a designer has amassedin his or her career , not experiences .
That assumption leads to a second flawed assumption : that all decisions will be based on hard facts .
An experienced designer knows that humans do not operate solely on reason and logic .
They 're heavily influenced by emotions and perceptions .
Even more frustratingly , they oftento you about their reactions because they do n't want to be seen as imperfect .
But it 's not just empathy that data lacks .
The one indisputable advantage humans have over data is imagination .
I realize this is often overplayed and sounds like hyperbole .
But I mean it literally .
The ability to step outside of what you 've seen and consider how something that does n't exist yetis at the center of everything we do .
Imagination is what allows us to consider if we should try to gather a different kind of data .
If a designer in Bowman 's position has to spend every day trying to educate an unreceptive audience , that person will eventually no longer be able to do the job they were hired for .
It 's no surprise , then , that designers gravitate towards places where they can skip the education step and get right to work .
History books portray Einstein as a brilliant physicist , which he was .
His understanding of scientific methods allowed him to refine and articulate his ideas .
But that alone was n't the reason he changed the world .
His genius wasthings that no one else had thought of , which he then set out to describe .
He was two things in one : a scientist and a dreamer .
Data and measurements are essential in software , and can take you a long way on their own .
But feelings and instincts are necessary too if you want to do something remarkable .
Republicans in Washington and New Hampshire are mounting a full - court press to keep Sen. Judd Gregg in the Senate and out of the Obama administration .
GOP fights to keep Gregg in the Senate
Republicans in Washington and New Hampshire are mounting a full - court press to keep Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) in the Senate and out of the Obama administration , aides and senators said Friday .
But if he does take the commerce secretary job , they want a commitment that New Hampshire ’s Democratic governor will appoint a Republican senator so the party holds at least 41 seats , the minimum needed to sustain filibusters .
No such commitments have been made , even as Granite State Republican sources tell Politico they are worried Gregg will take the Cabinet job if offered it by Obama .

“ I think it would be a loss to the Senate of a great mind and somebody who I think we need a lot as we chart our way through economic challenge , ” Sen . John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) , head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , told Politico on Friday .
Asked what could be offered to keep Gregg in the Senate , Cornyn said : “ I would say whatever it is , name it . ”
Sen. Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) said luring Gregg with a Cabinet job was “ sneaky ” because it would put the GOP in a bind and take away a valuable member .
Friends tell Politico they expect Gregg to accept the seat if it ’s offered , even though Gregg has only confirmed he is under consideration and would not comment further .
Gregg has to run for reelection next year and could lose in his increasingly Democratic state .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Friday that Obama told him “ a final decision had not been made .
.
.until the president asks me to make a personnel announcement from this podium , I ’ll refrain from getting into any names . ”
The Cabinet job would provide Gregg with a cushy bridge to retirement , but it would be a headache for Senate Republicans .
The White House was already making phone calls to senators Friday to gauge support for his potential nomination , aides said .
What remains unclear , however , is how high up he is on the list of potential candidates .
The White House had also approached Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) , a moderate , about an administration job , but she declined , sources close to Snowe told Politico .
“ If we were to reduce the number of Republicans by one , that would make a big difference , ” Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - Tenn . ) , the third - ranking Senate Republican , said Friday .
“ Perhaps if he went into the administration , the Democratic governor of New Hampshire would appoint a Republican senator so that would n’t change .
I have no idea what the discussions are .
“ I ’m not sure what the different steps would be , ” Alexander added .
“ But I like the idea of 41 Republican senators a lot better than 40 .
And I like the idea of Judd Gregg being in the United States Senate rather than him not being . ”
Obama and Gregg may need to convince New Hampshire ’s Gov. John Lynch to appoint a Republican .
Assuming Al Franken defeats Norm Coleman in Minnesota , a new Democratic senator from New Hampshire would give Democrats a 60 - seat majority — enough to overcome filibusters , the remaining GOP tool to block Democrats ’ ambitious agenda in Washington .
Lynch spokesman Colin Manning stayed out of it : “ This is between the White House and Sen. Gregg and I am going to have to refer questions to them . ”
But New Hampshire Republicans are already fretting about their senator , regardless of the outcome .
“ If he does n't do it and stays , he has unhappy folks waiting here , ” warned one veteran Granite State Republican .
“ Republicans would hate him forever — even up here , ” said another about the prospect about Gregg accepting the position .
To hear such language aimed at Gregg , a former governor and son of another with deep Yankee Republican roots , is astounding .
Republican names being floated for the Gregg seat include former Gov. Walter Peterson , former Sen. Warren Rudman , former Rep. Charlie Bass , former state House Speaker Doug Scamman ( a friend of Lynch ) or a political outsider businessman .
Democrats on the short list include Reps. Paul Hodes and Carol Shea -Porter , who are already thought to be interested in running for the Senate seat next year — regardless of whether Gregg is still holding the seat .
In a statement Friday morning , Gregg said he was “ honored ” to be considered but declined to elaborate on the process .
“ I am aware that my name is one of those being considered by the White House for Secretary of Commerce , and am honored to be considered , along with others , for the position , " said Gregg , who serves as the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee .
" Beyond that there is nothing more I can say at this time . ”
The job offers some obvious attractions .
Gregg , 61 , would have to spend heavily in 2010 to keep his seat and would be a top GOP target .
And instead of being a part of a slimmer GOP minority , he would command a major department that would have a big role in responding to the deepening economic recession .
But while he has been an architect of the Treasury Department ’s bailout of the financial system and his position on immigration lines up with Obama ’s , he splits with Democrats on taxes , labor issues and fiscal policy .
He would have to implement an agenda of a Democratic administration with far more liberal views .
“ I was going to organize a friendly Republican filibuster ” to block the nomination , Alexander said he jokingly told Gregg on Thursday night , adding that the loss of the senator would be a big loss to the institution because of his deep knowledge of fiscal and economic matters .
“ It would be like the Steelers recruiting Larry Fitzgerald right before the Super Bowl , ” Alexander said , referring to the Arizona Cardinals ’ star wide receiver .
Cornyn tried to assuage any of Gregg ’s concerns about his 2010 bid , predicting that the upcoming election cycle will be easier for the GOP than the last two .
“ I think 2010 will not be 2008 .
President Bush and his low approval ratings wo n’t be on the ballot .
And neither will President Obama be on the ballot , ” Cornyn said .
“ So my hope would be that New Hampshire would sort of return to its roots , so I think would make it very conducive to his reelection . ”
A White House spokesman said Thursday only that Obama “ has not made a decision ” about the Commerce job .
Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV ( D - W.Va. ) , chairman of the Commerce , Science and Transportation Committee , said Thursday night he had not been told by the Obama administration that Gregg was under consideration , calling the episode “ strange . ”
Rockefeller said he and Gregg are “ good personal friends , ” and he downplayed the conflicts that might arise if Obama tapped Gregg for the post .
“ He would be representing what the president wanted , or else he wo n’t take the job , ” Rockefeller said .
“ Judd Gregg is the type of person who would not take a job that he could not do on terms that are satisfactory to himself . ”
Democrats — eager to get to 60 — were enthusiastic about the idea of a Commerce Secretary Gregg .
“ He 's one of my best friends in the Senate , and he 's competent in doing anything he wants to do , ” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) said Thursday .
“ Everybody knows he 's one of my friends around here . ”
Sen. Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) , chairman of the Budget Committee , said he had “ very , very high regard ” for Gregg — and that his departure would be a “ very significant ” loss to the Senate .
Earlier Thursday , several well - connected New Hampshire Republicans said they were skeptical that Gregg would accept .
These sources noted that Gregg has fundraisers lined up as far into the calendar as April .
But they also acknowledged that Gregg has spoken positively about Obama .
“ Judd Gregg not running for reelection makes it extremely interesting , ” Kathy Sullivan , a former New Hampshire Democratic chairwoman , said with evident glee in her voice .
Senate Republicans are , to state the obvious , far less joyful .
“ The conference would be considerably weakened without Judd Gregg , ” said one Senate GOP leadership aide .

For the most part , Echo Boomers have grown out of the typical definition of the term “ role model . ”
The word simply does not apply to us in the way that it use to .
We no longer look to actors , athletes , and astronauts to set a precedent for us - we look to them to set the bar .
As high schoolers are hitting the pool , they are n’t looking to be like Phelps - they ’re looking to be better .
They are n’t looking at his bong ; they ’re looking at the pounds of Beijing gold hanging from his neck - and they want it .
They are looking at his $ 100 M in endorsements and thinking to themselves that they too want to be paid to prance around in a Speedo and eat PowerBars .
I do n’t think of Phelps any less for smoking - it 's not my place to judge .
In fact , it almost makes the fact that he won 14 golds just that more impressive , considering how much smoking anything affects your lungs .
The only possible way for it to have helped him , is if it aided in his insane , 12,000 calorie / day intake in order to have enough energy to burn in the pool .
The whole situation reminds me of a quote from Robin Williams :
“ The poor Canadian snowboarder , in the 1998 Olympics , they took away his medal because he tested positive for marijuana , which is kinda redundant number one , number two , they said that marijuana was a " performance - enhancing drug . ” [ buzzer sound ]
Marijuana enhances many things , colors , flavors , sensations , but you are certainly not f****** empowered .
When you 're stoned , you 're lucky if you can find your own god **** feet .
The only way it 's a performance - enhancing drug is if there 's a big f******
Hershey bar at the end of the run . ”
The whole thing comes down to Phelps setting the bar in business and life .
He set out to be the best , and he is .
He is the top in his sport and commands one of the most lucrative endorsement contracts in the world .
Gen -Y will not look at him and think “ stoner , ” they ’ll think of his accomplishments - and then try and be better .
I ’m curious to hear other people ’s opinions on the subject !

I have n't had the opportunity to talk at all about Google 's new Chrome browser yet .
Which is a shame , because it 's easily the best web browser I 've ever used .
If it was n't for the complete and utter lack of an add - in ecosystem , I 'd switch away from Firefox in a heartbeat .
If you 're curious about Chrome , check out the Scott McCloud comic Google commissioned to explain it .
Or , heck , just try it yourself !
Chrome is a joy to use , and in my opinion at least , it 's the first true advance in web browser technology since the heady days of Internet Explorer 4.0 .
Chrome is filled with so many thoughtful details , so many reimaginings of web browser functionality as a true application platform , it 's hard to even list them all .
In fact , the best way to explain how great Chrome is might arguably be one of the silliest , tiniest things about it -- even Chrome 's error messages are fun !
Here 's an error I experienced last night while trying to clean up my GMail contacts list .
The tab is frozen , you see ?
With the snowflakes , its little scarf and teeth chattering in the cold ?
Rather than being annoyed with GMail , and blaming Chrome , I am completely disarmed by this error .
It makes me laugh !
It reminds me that the developers working on this software , rather than just taking the path of least resistance and spitting out a generic message box with a cryptic error code , took time to make their error messages not only user friendly , but fun .
I 'm reminded of the Beagle Brothers statement of quality :
Our programs are FUN to use .
Our instructions are CLEAR and complete .
And what happens if there 's a serious rendering error on a Chrome tab , resulting in a per-tab process crash ?
Aw , Snap !
These errors are subtle homages to the classic Macintosh Sad Mac .
Which is a tad ironic , as Chrome is very much Windows only , at least for now .
Now , none of this means that you should n't take errors seriously .
As a competent and professional software developer , you will crash responsibly .
Every time .
Humor alone is not the goal here .
Errors are n't the most glamorous part of software development .
In fact , they 're sort of a downer .
But the way you handle errors speaks volumes about how much you respect your users , and ultimately , your own project .
Remember , this stuff is supposed to be fun !
Why not share some of that joy , that fun you had building your application , with your users ?
We certainly did this on Stack Overflow with our CAPTCHA and Error pages .
It 's a major drag for your users to end up on a human verification page , or a big fat honking server error .
So why not ease the tension a bit by spending a little extra time on your errors and using them to illustrate the lighter side of software development ?
Do n't get me wrong .
Your error messages should always be informative and helpful .
That 's not optional .
But as Google Chrome shows us , it is possible to do that while also being fun .
And that 's even better .
US weaponry globocorp Lockheed is pleased to announce the unveiling of its newly - acquired powered exoskeleton intended to confer superhuman strength and endurance upon US soldiers .
Needless to say , corporate promo vid of the Human Universal Load Carrier ( HULC™ ) is available :
The exoskeleton is based on a design from Berkeley Bionics of California , but Lockheed say they have brought significant pimpage to the basic HULC .
The enhanced version is now on show at the Association of the United States ' Army Winter Symposium in Florida .
" With our enhancements to the HULC system , Soldiers will be able to carry loads up to 200 pounds with minimal effort , " according to Lockheed 's Rich Russell .
From the vid , the HULC certainly seems a step forward on Raytheon 's rival XOS mechwarrior suit , which at last report still trails an inconvenient power cable to the nearest wall socket .
Not so the HULC ; four pounds of lithium polymer batteries will run the exoskeleton for an hour walking at 3 mph , according to Lockheed .
Speed marching at up to 7mph reduces this somewhat ; a battery - draining " burst " at 10 mph is the maximum speed .
The user can hump 200 lb with relative ease while marching in a HULC , however , well in excess of even the heaviest combat loads normally carried by modern infantry .
There 'd be scope to carry a few spare batteries .
Even if the machine runs out of juice , Lockheed claims that its reinforcement and shock absorption still helps with load carrying rather than hindering .
There are various optional extras , too .
The HULC can be fitted with armour plating , heating or cooling systems , sensors and " other custom attachments " .
We particularly liked that last one : our personal request would be a powered gun or missile mount of some kind above the shoulder , linked to a helmet or monocle laser sight .
One does note that remote - controlled gun mounts weighing as little as 55lb are available , able to handle various kinds of normally tripod - or bipod - mounted heavy weapons .
You 'd need more power , but that 's on offer .
According to the Lockheed spec sheet ( pdf ) there 's an extended - endurance HULC fitted with a " silent " generator running on JP8 jet fuel .
A tankful will run this suit for three days , marching eight hours per day - though presumably at the cost of some payload .
Doubtless other power options could be developed : Lockheed says the HULC needs 250 watts on average .
It 's important to note that the HULC is basically a legs and body system only : there 's no enhancement to the user 's arms , though an over - shoulder frame can be fitted allowing a wearer to hoist heavy objects such as artilery shells with the aid of a lifting strop .
The HULC may not be quite ready for prime time yet .
But the military exoskeleton as a concept does seem to be getting to the stage of usefulness , at least in niche situations for specific jobs .
The BigDog petrol packmule , an alternative strategy for helping footsoldiers carry their increasingly heavy loads , may now have a serious rival . ®
Here ’s something interesting .
This is the test directory from the very first version of Perl , released in 1987 and described by Larry as ‘ a “ replacement ” for awk and sed ’ .
Day one of Perl , and we already have the bare bones of the Test Anything Protocol and a prototype for Test : : Harness in the TEST file .
If we truffle about in the various other branches we find other useful milestones for module developers :
5.000 , in 1994 came with the first iteration of h2xs which could be used to generate the basic boilerplate for a perl module .
Even today , with more sophisticated module starters available , you wo n’t find a CPAN module of repute that does n’t follow the basic directory structure laid down in this utility .
ExtUtils :: MakeMaker generates a Makefile with a test target which runs all the tests in the t subdirectory
which could be used to generate the basic boilerplate for a perl module .
Even today , with more sophisticated module starters available , you wo n’t find a CPAN module of repute that does n’t follow the basic directory structure laid down in this utility .
generates a Makefile with a test target which runs all the tests in the subdirectory 5.002 , in 1996 , h2xs starts stubbing test.
pl
starts stubbing test.pl 5.003_12 , late 1996 , first version of CPAN in the Perl distribution .
From day one , CPAN would not install a module if any tests failed , unless you forced it .
Meanwhile , Ruby :
Has only recently embraced a language test suite
Appears to have no standard layout for gem distributions
Does n’t run tests as part of the installation process for a new gem
Is it any wonder that chromatic gets a little cranky when sweeping claims are made about how spiffy Ruby ’s testing culture is ?
There are those who claim that CPAN is Perl ’s shining glory , but it ’s not really the collection of servers , it ’s the toolchain that enables it , and that toolchain can exist because so many libraries follow a pretty minimal set of conventions .
I ’d love to see the Ruby community settle on a similar , single , set of conventions for the way things should work .
Start with a guarantee of a either a top level Rakefile or setup.rb with build , test and install tasks .
Make rubygems run the tests before installation , if the target is available , and halt the installation if they fail .
Make it easy to send reports of test failures to module authors ( look at the Perl CPAN and CPAN Testers sites , and their associated tooling for ideas ) .

After more than a century of striving to propel screaming riders ever faster , higher , steeper and longer , many roller coasters now hurtle to the limits of human endurance .
So where is there left for the tracks to go ?
The new attraction at Thorpe Park in Surrey , Saw - The Ride , claims to offer the world 's steepest freefall drop - a beyond - vertical 100 - degree descent back under the ride 's 100 ft ( 30 m ) peak .
It takes about three seconds .
Fasten your seatbelts
An even steeper 112 - degree descent is due to be unveiled in July on a new ride - Mumbo Jumbo - at Flamingo Land in North Yorkshire .
Roller coaster one - upmanship is something of a tradition in the amusement park industry , with rides sometimes designed seemingly with headlines as much in mind as effective frights and thrills .
Coasters now stand hundreds of feet tall , race at speeds nearing 130 mph , and turn the rider upside down with multiple inversions .
Predictably , the US boasts most of the world 's roller coaster records .
" In America there are so many parks , there are always these coaster wars going on , " says Andy Hine , founder and chairman of the Roller Coaster Club of Great Britain ( RCCGB ) .
But he adds : " When you get into these coaster wars , you do n't always end up with a good ride . "
" A roller coaster represents a really well choreographed sequence of unusual stimuli , " says Brendan Walker , director of Thrill Laboratory and a visiting senior research fellow at the University of Nottingham .
The farther a roller coaster can push its dual extremes of fear and pleasure , the more thrilling the ride will be , he argues .
" Thrill as an experience is actually defined as a large , rapid increase in pleasure and arousal together , " he says .
" If you can manage to pull somebody towards displeasure through fear , through danger , and then provide a pleasurable release , the margin of change is larger . "
Shake , rattle Most roller coaster fanatics prefer wooden rides , despite them tending to be smaller and slower than steel ones , partly because of the more anxious experience often involved .
ANDY HINE'S COASTER TIPS
Sit at the back of the train to whip over hills and enjoy more ' airtime '
Extend your arms to stretch trunk and enhance physical sensations " Keep your eyes open no matter how scared " , because the imagination only creates worse Trains go fastest just after rain and at the end of the day For shorter queues , start visit at the back of the amusement park , move round it anti-clockwise , and ride during lunchtime
The swaying and creaking frame , the deafening rattle of the wheels on the track , and the archaic appearance can suggest that the ride - and consequently the riders too - may not be around that long .
" A wooden roller coaster has a lot more shake , rattle and roll about it , " Mr Hine says .
With an estimated 35,000 rides on more than 2,000 of the world 's roller coasters behind him , Mr Hine 's favourite attraction is the wooden Phoenix , in Pennsylvania , US , standing at an unimposing 78 ft ( 24 m ) and with a top speed of about 45 mph .
Mr Hine claims that the most popular sensation offered by roller coasters is the weightlessness over a hill , when negative G - forces lift a rider out of their seat , and that this is more frequently experienced on wooden rides .
" They do n't build them high , they do n't build them fast .
They have to compete in another way - they go for the fun factor , " he says .
" They give you more ' airtime ' , which is an enthusiast 's favourite part of the ride . "
Not for no reason , Airtime is the name of the RCCGB magazine .
Adult fun
On their arrival around the turn of the 19th century , roller coasters held iconic status in a rapidly changing world , argues architectural historian Dr Josie Kane .
" Suddenly you get amusement parks that are permanent .
People go by train or by car .
They travel quite long distances to these sites .
They are technologically interesting in a way fairgrounds were n't , " she says .
The mind is as deep and as broad as you want to play with
Brendan Walker , Thrill Laboratory " Roller coasters seemed to symbolise this massive , dramatic , radical change that people understood was happening with mechanised travel , industrialisation and technological advancement .
They seemed to encapsulate that .
" They still do , " she adds .
" When people talk about the roller coaster of modern life , it 's a metaphor for the fast pace , ups and downs and unexpected turns of living in a modern world . "
A release from that metaphorical roller coaster is , of course , a fundamental part of the appeal of the real thing .
Height restrictions exclude most pre-teens from extreme coasters like Saw - The Ride , and attractions will insist children are accompanied by adults or offer warnings like : " Caution : May be a bit scary for the very young . "
Mr Walker calls amusement parks " playgrounds for adults " , where it is " socially acceptable to go and lose your inhibitions , and become as engaged as you want to , and scream " .
" It 's a bit of escapism , " says Mr Hine .
" When you go to a theme park you can leave all your worries at the front gate . "
Downsize ?
Saw -
The Ride is a tie - in with the brutal horror films of the same name ; from the moment people join the queue for the ride , grisly props of severed body parts and alarming sound effects aim to build tension and fear .
The bigger they are ...
This combination of psychological and physical elements could hint at roller coasters ' future .
" You can only go upside down so many times , you can only go 100 mph so many times before it becomes boring , " says Mr Hine .
" I think the days of really big rides are coming to an end . "
Mr Walker expects theatrical elements to become increasingly significant in roller coaster design .
" We are on the borders of what the body can sustain , " he says .
" Engineering could now do more to the body , but the body is a limiting factor .
But the mind is as deep and as broad as you want to play with . "
Having bounced the body around until it can take no more , roller coasters may start messing with the mind .
The next generation of rides could be mental .
Below is a selection of your comments .
" Having bounced the body around until it can take no more , roller coasters may start messing with the mind . "
I could n't agree more .
The scariest ride I ever rode was Disney World 's Space Mountain , back in the early 1970s .
Back then , the ride designers messed with your mind by putting you on the ride in almost total darkness , and there were glow strips on the track that were incomplete , so that when you get to a certain section up high , and turn a corner , the track looked like it just dropped into nothing .
The scream factor for that alone was worth the wait in line .
I understand that the ride has been changed to be less intense .
That is a great pity .
Elle Emmiss , Winter Park , Florida , USA Roller coasters and amusement parks are my family 's favourite summer destinations , in particular Cedar Point in Sandusky , Ohio , which contains 17 coasters ( the most in any US park ) .
My niece rode Magnum XL - 200 when she was just 5 years old and it is 205 - ft high and goes 72 miles per hour .
What a brave little girl , no tears !
Back to the article , I am pleased to hear about Saw - The Ride at Thorpe Park .
It has been years since I have visited it and Alton Towers , but this has put me in a mind to save extra time and money for another detour while on my next visit to England .
Bragging rights back home in the US , you know .
Ride on everyone .
Diana Harkin , Akron , Ohio USA
I remember when I was little , laughing all the way round in near pitch - black on Disney 's Space Mountain until one point where the ride suddenly went through a bright red tunnel and for some reason that utterly terrified me .
From that point on , it was n't fun for me any more and I just wanted to get off .
My favourite rollercoaster is Air at Alton Towers because it is so smooth and quiet , you can relax and just let it fly you around the park .
Bob , High Wycombe
I can easily handle the big rides at places like Flamingoland and Alton Towers - but our local funfair has one attraction that wild horses would n't get me to go near ... the Waltzers .
Yep ; it may be old and it may look boring but the fact that it has a person dictating both the direction and speed of spin changes more or less randomly makes it much less pleasant than " big " rides like Oblivion .
Perhaps that 's the future - stop rides from being boring and predictable and build in , at low elevations , random turning of the occupants .
John Sinclair , Aberdeen , Scotland
There is no more " steepness " than vertical .

How wonderful to read that Mr Hine 's favourite coaster ride is on the very old and historic wooden " Phoenix " out in Pennsylvania at the family owned Knoebel 's amusement park .
A lot of people think you can't beat the good old wood coasters for sheer fun .
And hey - Mr. Hines should ride the new , tall and fast wooden coaster that is on the other side of the park at Knoebel's .
My kids run back and forth between these two coasters all day when we visit there - trying to decide which is better .
Their final opinion has been " They are both better ! "
Maybe the days of really big rides are coming to an end .
Long live wood .
Deirdre , USA Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point in Ohio is my personal favourite roller coaster .
I think it is the tallest in the world and one of the quickest .
They also have a coaster there called Maverick which goes beyond a vertical drop so Saw is nothing new .
It does look good though .

Smokers who are paid to quit succeed far more often than those who get no cash reward , according to a new study that provides some of the strongest evidence yet that financial incentives can help change such behavior .
The study , one of the largest of its kind , comes at a time when more employers , schools and other institutions are paying people to do everything from lose weight to improve their grades .
The latest findings were published in this week 's New England Journal of Medicine .

Debian Project seeks Hardware Donations
February 8th , 2009
Debian Project seeks Hardware Donations
The Debian project is looking for sponsors for two new official services : snapshot and data archives .
Both services utilize large amounts of data and therefore require a capable machine with a large disk array that provides 10 TB of disk space to start , with the ability to be easily extended .
We 'd like interested sponsors to contact hardware-donations@debian.org .
The Debian project is hoping for an independent storage array that can be extended or upgraded without having to reconfigure the hardware of the server attached to it .
A disk shelf based SATA SAN seems ideal for this application .
We envision needing to start with roughly 10 TB of storage to cover known archives .
12 x 1 TB SATA drives seems like an ideal compromise between price and capacity .
The snapshot archive is a wayback machine that allows access to old packages based on dates and version numbers .
It will consist of all current and future packages the Debian archive provides .
With roughly 3 to 4 GB of new packages each day , this service needs a large storage system to keep up .
The current implementation already consumes 4 TB and provides a valuable service for the community .
The ability to install packages and view sourcecode from any given date in the past is very helpful for developers who try to fix regressions .
Users frequently need an older version of the software in order to make a particular application run .
The data archive will contain huge packages that cannot be distributed through the regular archive due to their sheer size .
The number of free large data packages , such as medical and statistical data sets , and also game data , is increasing and we ask for a new service to make them available to Debian users .
The Debian project plans redundant deployment in two separate geographical locations for which the Debian project is seeking sponsors as well .
US - based hosting is not possible for legal reasons , since the snapshot archive also contains older releases , including the non-US tree , which contains packages which must not be distributed from within the USA .
We envision being able to run both services on the same hardware , provided sufficient resources are available .
Hardware requirements for these services are not met by any available machines in the Debian project .
The new hosts should consist of at least two recent CPUs and 32 GB RAM in addition to a storage backend that is easily extendable and comes with 12 x 1 TB disks combined via RAID .
These machines should have remote out of band management included , offering full serial console access and remote power switch .
Sponsors will be mentioned prominently on Debian 's web server and may be named on the service web pages as well .
The current implementation of the snapshot archive is at snapshot.debian.net .

Alex N. Alexander can walk away from a prison when 's he 's 42 for sexually assaulting and beating a 61 - year - old grandmother .
Alexander , 16 , of 4115 Peggy in Spaulding Township received a sentence Thursday of 26 to 75 years behind bars for three counts of first - degree criminal sexual conduct and single counts of first - degree home invasion , torture , resisting and obstructing a police officer and possessing marijuana .
The teen , whom prosecutors charged as an adult , pleaded no contest last month .
A no contest plea means a defendant does not admit guilt but will accept punishment .
Alexander told Saginaw County Circuit Judge William A. Crane he was high on ecstasy .
" I 'm sorry for what I did , " the teen said .
" I really do n't know what I did .
I was under the influence of drugs . "
Crane , who showed Alexander a photo of the badly beaten Spaulding Township victim , said the law does n't excuse misconduct for intoxication .
" It 's not fair to the victim , " said Crane , who indicated the woman is suffering physical and emotional problems .
" We are dealing with somebody who is very dangerous , " he said .
" This was outrageous and horrific . "
The Saginaw News does not name sexual assault victims .
First - degree criminal sexual conduct
involves penetration .
Assistant Prosecutor Paul M. Fehrman said the victim is on a ventilator likely stemming from the assault ; if she dies his office would view the case as a possible homicide .
Alexander told police that he knew the woman lived alone , Fehrman said .
" This is a callous young man , " he said .
Saginaw defense attorney James F. Gust said his client was a good athlete and colleges were scouting him when the assault occurred .
Alexander also suffered abuse as a child .
" Obviously , he was out of his mind , " Gust said .
" He would have been aware of that if he was in his right mind .
It 's very bizarre facts . "
The victim testified at an earlier hearing that she was home about 10 p.m. Aug. 6 enjoying the summer night and doing a crossword puzzle when she heard noises .
When she saw a hand poke through a shade , she called 911 .
As she talked with a dispatcher , a man climbed through the window and said he was going to get her .
She warned him that police were on their way , but he threw her on the couch , removed her pajama bottoms and sexually assaulted her three times .
She said he threatened to shoot her if she did n't comply with his demands .
As police cruisers approached her home , the woman said , the man ran outside .
State Trooper Jeremy Sloan testified he saw a man leave the garage and chased him before losing track .
Sloan said he called for a canine unit , which arrived several minutes later .
Sloan said he found Alexander hiding 30 feet up in a tree wearing a black T - shirt , no bottoms and a white Ace bandage on his knee .
" Surprisingly , it does not appear to be drastically affected by the environment or sunlight as might be expected considering its condition , although it tends to remain below the surface a little more than the others in the pod . "
( Newser ) – The fallout continues : Michael Phelps has been suspended from competition for three months by USA Swimming in the wake of his bong photo .
Meanwhile , Kellogg 's will not renew its contract with the swimmer when it expires at the end of the month , Advertising Age reports .
The Wheaties maker says Phelps ' image is " not consistent with the image of Kellogg . "
story continues below
As for USA Swimming , which is also cutting off its financial support to Phelps : " This is not a situation where any anti-doping rule was violated , but we decided to send a strong message to Michael because he disappointed so many people , particularly the hundreds of thousands of USA Swimming member kids who look up to him as a role model , " the federation said in a statement .

In the past week or so , some 400 earthquakes have added to the already precarious land at Yellowstone National Park .
Although the area is the largest supervolcano in North America , the rumbling is a bit more than normal .
Like bees , when earthquakes occur in great amounts in one area , it ’s called a swarm , reports NPR .
But this swarm is bigger than the usual that would happen .
The swarm has a magnitude of 3.9 on the Richter scale , and the quakes have happened at greater frequency than the norm .
And all of the earthquakes have occurred under Yellowstone Lake .
The last time something like this happened was 20 years ago , reports Wyoming ’s Local News 8 .
Said one geologist on the station : “ We think it ’s where more magma heat and steam escaped through cracks in the crust .
That ’s probably what ’s causing the earthquakes . ”
[ social_buttons ]
No one knows for sure why this is happening , though .
But no worries to the people living around Yellowstone – the last huge volcano eruption was about 640,000 years ago .
Earlier in the year , around April , the same thing happened in Oregon , except it was 600 earthquakes in 10 days .
That one , though , was different – it did n’t occur around any places where tectonic plates meet , the vast land areas that form the Earth ’s crust .
Three of those quakes had a magnitude of 5.0 or higher .
Most , however , happened out at sea , and were barely felt on land .

There ’s a line in the film “ Parenthood ” in which the abused teen played by Keanu Reeves comments , “ You need a license to buy a dog , to drive a car -- hell , you even need a license to catch a fish .
But they 'll let any ... be a father . ”
Even with the profanity elided , that observation remains shatteringly apt .
With the antics of octo-mom dominating the news , what constitutes a fit parent is the subject of much recent , passionate discussion .
But all questions of eugenics and eccentricity aside , active abuse is the clearly defining line between a happy childhood and daily misery .
In her solo show “ Bruising for Besos ” at the L.A. Gay and Lesbian Center ’s Davidson / Valentini Theatre , Adelina Anthony intrepidly spans the divide .
Anthony ’s protagonist , Yoli Villamontes , seen both in childhood and maturity , is keenly aware of the abyss created by her macho , abusive father , and she deplores the victimization of her poor , immigrant mother , who endures all for the sake of her children .
“ Besos ” is the first piece in Anthony ’s “ The Xiqana Xronicles , ” a cycle inspired by the recent death of her mother .
The action commences beside a desolate Texas highway , where Yoli has been stranded en route to see her ailing mom -- her first visit in 10 years .
As otherworldly as a moonscape , the stark milieu , beautifully realized by set , sound and lighting designers Robert Selander , D’Lo and John Pedone , respectively , is a fittingly desolate setting for Yoli ’s painful journey into the past .
Anthony is a striking performer with to - die - for cheekbones that could chop firewood .
Under the taut direction of Rose Marcario , she bristles with seductive , simmering rage .
Yoli ’s childhood reminiscences sometimes seem generic , perhaps because the particular pathology between Yoli ’s mother and father seems underdeveloped at this juncture .
But Yoli ’s path to proud lesbianism is vividly charted , as is Yoli ’s steamy , stormy relationship with her lover .
Indeed ,
Anthony concocts such sizzling sexual chemistry with herself you forget there ’s only one person on stage .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
When the White House first got wind of the executive bonuses at American International Group , the disbelief was palpable .
Gloria Borger : The White House does n't need a new wave of anger as it readies its long - awaited plan for the banks .
" You smack your head and you say ' You 've gotta be kidding me , ' " senior presidential adviser David Axelrod tells me .
" It put another brick on the load we 're carrying . "
Or a concrete block .
Just as the White House readies its long - awaited plan to bail out the banks -- having presented its plans for housing and small business -- a new wave of anger is precisely what it does n't need .
And to make matters worse , it 's a widespread anger that is not grounded in the more ordinary resentments between economic classes .
In fact , this new populism is almost unanimous :
The banks were greedy and reckless .
They took us down with them .
So why do the bad guys deserve a government cushion ?
President Obama now has his economic team on the hunt for a way to scale back those egregious bonuses .
But the president 's problem goes beyond that :
He has to make a convincing case for bailing out the bad guys .
He has to take the long view -- explaining why it would hurt us to allow the banks to fail .
" People would call it a bailout ; I would call it a ransom , " the American Enterprise Institute 's Vincent Reinhart told CNN .
" Because Wall Street is holding the great economy hostage .
As long as the financial institutions need funds , they wo n't make loans ... so what we have to do is pay them to get beyond this . "
But it may not be enough to say , " If we do n't do this , we will face an economic Armageddon . "
Why ?
" The model in people 's heads right now is extortion , " Robert Reich , President Clinton 's former labor secretary , tells me .
" In order to reduce that anxiety and paranoia , the president has to assure the public that the benefit is not going to the bankers . " -- that , in the end , it 's going to benefit us .
But , given the AIG bonuses , the public might well ask : " Why should we believe you ?
You lectured Wall Street before the first bailout -- and you told us you were going to hold them accountable . "
Reich says , " It makes them [ the administration ] look clueless .
So not only does the administration have to explain exactly why this money is necessary , but also explain what is in place to keep the banks from doing this again . "
If that does n't happen , the cynicism , skepticism , outrage and anger toward the banks will remain -- and could potentially transfer to the White House itself .
In a new CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll , Obama remains very popular ( 64 percent approval rating ) , but most of the public said it disapproves of how he is handling the banks ( by 52 percent to 47 percent ) .
iReport.com : ' Who runs U.S. : AIG or Obama ?'
" At some tipping point in the future , " warns Reich , " the administration could be seen as part of the problem . "
That 's the last thing the White House wants -- or needs .
" We need the financial community to understand that the days of Gordon Gekko are over , " presidential adviser Axelrod says , referring to Michael Douglas ' greedy tycoon in the 1987 movie " Wall Street . "
How ?
" We need transparency and accountability and regulatory reform .
...
And we have always said that .
It 's frustrating to be in this position . "
You bet it is .
Particularly as the world literally awaits the banking bailout .
And if Obama needs to go to Congress again for more money , he needs to have a track record .
iReport.com : Share your AIG reaction
" We have to establish a level of credibility on this issue , " Axelrod says .
" People are outraged , and they have a reason to be . "
Sure , the president needs to feel our pain and anxiety .
The trick is to avoid becoming a new outlet for it .

Schwarzenegger on stimulus : Obama needs GOP to be ' team players ' Jeremy Gantz and David Edwards
Published : Sunday February 22 , 2009
Print This Email This California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has a very simple message for any GOP governor who does n't want federal stimulus package money earmarked for his or her state : " I 'll take it . "
" I feel very strongly that I think that President Obama right now needs team players , " Schwarzenegger said Sunday morning on ABC's " This Week George Stephanopolous . "
" It 's a very difficult time now , where we have to play together , rather than using politics and always attacking everything , " he said .
Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina , along with a handful of other Republican governors , has said he would not accept all of the $ 8 billion set aside for his state in the $ 787 billion stimulus bill signed into law by President Obama days ago .
But Schwarzenegger , who on Friday signed a $ 42 billion California state budget into law , averting a major fiscal disaster , sees the stimulus money a bit differently .
" I 'm more than happy to take [ Sanford 's ] money or any other governor in this country that does n't want to take this money , ... because we in California can need it .
" I think that it is a terrific package , " Schwarzenegger continued .
" I think California benefits tremendously from that $ 80 billion that is tax benefits there of around $ 35 billion .
There 's other advantages , $ 45 billion of monies that go to transportation , to education , to health care , and all those different areas . "
Schwarzenegger is n't alone in his willingness to accept stimulus money passed over by Republican governors .
Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm of Michigan , which has the nation 's highest unemployment rate , said the same thing Sunday morning .
" You better believe I 'm going to take every dollar that is coming to Michigan and if my colleagues here , Minnesota and South Carolina , do n't use theirs , I 'm going to be first in line to say for my people , for our citizens , to put people to work and to make sure they can survive through this , " she said on Fox 's Fox & Friends Sunday morning .
Asked if the GOP risks becoming the party of Herbert Hoover by opposing the stimulus bill , Schwarzenegger said something that likely surprised his party colleagues : " You know , I do n't think that the Republican Party is any different than the Democratic Party .
I think that politics -- the horrible thing about politics is that , the more they attack each other , the more that they try to derail each other , the worse it is for the people . "

CHICAGO , Dec 7 ( Reuters ) - A hot new field of genetic therapy known as RNA interference may offer new approaches to medicine down the road , but Merck & Co Inc MRK.N is putting the technology to work now to help ensure that conventional drugs in its pipeline will work .
“ Ninety - three percent of our drug programs fail , and 35 to 40 percent of those fail because they are simply the wrong target , ” Dr. Alan Sachs , head of the company ’s global RNA Therapeutics research operation , said in a telephone interview .
Merck believes RNA interference can help avoid these costly wrong turns .
Sachs is charged with overseeing Merck ’s $ 1.1 billion acquisition two years ago of Sirna Therapeutics , a company focused on developing drugs using RNA interference , or RNAi , which was the basis of the 2006 Nobel Prize in medicine .
RNA stands for ribonucleic acid , a genetic messenger that is emerging as a key player in the disease process .
Dozens of biotechnology companies are looking for ways to manipulate RNA to block genes that produce disease - causing proteins involved in cancer , blindness or AIDS .
And while many are grabbing the spotlight , Sachs likens his company ’s work to “ busy little bees , knowing exactly where we are going and what it will take to get there . ”
Since the Sirna acquisition , Sachs said , his team has been using the technology in animal studies to quickly evaluate the potential of new chemical compounds as future drugs .
“ We have a delivery system that is safe in rodents and it is a very , very powerful approach , ” he said .
RNA interference also has potential to turn off the activity of genes that cause disease .
“ It is absolutely the long - term promise that we anticipate will position Merck for success over the next few decades , but is high risk because it is very early , ” Sachs said .
ENSURING SUCCESS
Sachs said a significant part of the value of the Sirna deal “ was the increased probability of success of all of our programs . ”
“ The cost of failure is huge .
It ’s 65 to 70 percent of the total cost of making medicines , ” Sachs said .
“ Anything that increases your probability of success is a solid investment . ”
As for therapies , Sachs said the company will focus first on treatments for acute disease , then move gradually into therapies that would be used on a chronic or continual basis .
But first the company must overcome one of the biggest roadblocks to the RNAi therapies , which is how to deliver the therapy safely and efficiently into people .
The company is working on a delivery system using tiny , synthetic fat molecules called lipid nanoparticles .
“ Effectively , it ’s a particle that binds to nucleic acid and allows it to circulate in the bloodstream without it being cleared by the kidney , ” Sachs said .
“ The advantage of this particle is because of the lipid composition , it rapidly is taken up by the liver .
Within the first 5 to 10 minutes , over 70 percent of the material is absorbed in the liver . ”
That would make it an excellent delivery system for diseases that attack the liver , such as viral hepatitis or hepatocellular carcinoma , a type of liver cancer .
Other potentials include direct delivery , such as injecting RNAi therapies directly into the eye , and inhalation into the lungs .
" We are in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline GSK.L in the respiratory area and are working jointly on both targets and delivery , " Sachs said .
" And we just completed a collaboration with Allergan AGN.N looking at the eye and targets within the eye .
Now we are initiating our own efforts within that area . "

A chimpanzee at Sweden ’s Furuvik Zoo has been observed chipping at concrete to create discs to throw at visitors .
He even made weapons at night to throw at visitors when the zoo opens in the morning .
[ social_buttons ]
While Santino the chimp ’s retaliatory ways are amusing , they ’ve also impressed scientists who believe this is the first evidence of a non -human animal being capable of making plans for the future .
“ It implies that they have a highly developed consciousness , including life - like mental simulations of potential events , ” said Mathias Osvath , a scientist who studied Santino for over a decade .
“ They most probably have an ‘ inner world ’ like we have when reviewing past episodes of our lives or thinking of days to come .
I would guess that they plan much of their everyday behaviour . ”
Osvath ’s observations are only one of many studies that show that non-human primates are capable of some human - like thought .
Another recent study showed baboons are capable of matching pictures and recognizing objects .
Unfortunately for Santino , the zoo did n’t think his stone - throwing ways were very cute .
They ’ve castrated the 31 - year - old chimp , thinking it may lower his hormone levels and make him less aggressive .
The Humane Society of the United States along with other wildlife protection groups are working to pass the Great Ape Protection Act in the US .
They recently exposed the horrible conditions that 300 chimpanzees live under inside a pharmaceutical lab in Louisiana .
Is it not abundantly clear that these animals deserve to be treated with more respect ?

I can't really write much about this .
Wamp 's view speaks for itself and most of the GOP .
Raw Story :
President Obama is set to convene a summit on reforming healthcare Thursday , and some Republicans are already taking shots .
Rep. Zach Wamp ( Rep - Tenn ) told MSNBC 's Tamron Hall that Obama 's proposed healthcare plans would be a " fast march to socialism " , and that he believes that healthcare is not a right because many choose not to have insurance .
" This is almost class warfare in order for him to be able to say everyone now has health care .
Listen , healthcare is a privilege , " said Wamp .
The MSNBC anchor was almost taken aback by the " privilege " remark and asked Wamp to explain .
" If you have cancer right now do you see it as a privilege to get some treatment ? "
" I was just about to say , for some people it's a right but for everyone frankly it 's not necessarily a right , " he said .
" Half the people uninsured today choose to remain uninsured .
Half of them do n't have any choice , but half of them choose to what 's called ' go naked ' and take the risk of getting sick .
They end up in the emergency room costing you and me a whole lot more money . "
Year over year car sales gains in the U.S. were even worse in February than in January for all except Chrysler .
Here is the February yearly change with the January number in parenthesis : GM : - 53 % ( - 49 % ) Ford : - 48 % ( - 40 % ) Chrysler : - 44 % ( - 55 % ) Toyota : - 40 % ( - 32 % ) Honda : - 38 % ( - 28 % ) Nissan : - 37 % ( - 30 % ) German auto makers and Korean Hyundai continues to take market share from the U.S. and Japanese auto makers with BMW sales declining 35 % , Daimler ( Mercedes ) sales declining 21 % and Volkswagen sales declining 19 % and Hyundai sales declining just 1.5 % .
While the fact that February 2009 had one day fewer than February 2008 caused a slight downward bias in these numbers , this still confirms the view that the U.S. contraction is accelerating in pace .
Instead of meeting the same fate , Sheila was walked down the road by keepers to a red - brick house on the Whitewell Road where a woman gave her sanctuary in her back yard for several months until the bombing was over .
BOSTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Merck & Co. and Schering - Plough Corp. said Monday they plan to merge in a deal worth more than $ 41 billion as part of an effort to create a pharmaceutical giant that is less dependent on U.S. sales or on just a few blockbuster products .
It was the second major drug merger announced this year , as low valuations , coupled with Big Pharma 's ongoing quest for diversified revenue streams , are making large - scale takeovers more attractive .
In January , Pfizer and Wyeth WYE , which have both been hit by increased generic competition , announced plans to merge in a deal worth $ 68 billion .
Drug giant Roche is also pushing to buy the 44 % of Genentech Inc. DNA , +1.77 % that it does not already own .
After bumping up its price on the deal last week to $ 93 a share , giving the deal a value of about $ 45 billion , Roche reportedly sweetened it further to $ 95 a share , The Wall Street Journal reported Monday in its online edition .
" That companies like Pfizer and Merck are hunting for acquisitions is not surprising , given the low returns on cash and the lower valuations of target companies because of market conditions , " Tim Anderson of Sanford Bernstein wrote to clients Monday .
Before the opening bell Monday , the two major drugmakers said they have agreed to a merger that calls for Schering - Plough SGP , shareholders to receive $ 10.50 in cash and 0.5767 in Merck MRK , - 1.03 % stock for each share of Schering - Plough .
Merck 's total bid amounts to $ 23.61 a share .
The combined company will be called Merck and headed by Merck Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Clark .
The offer represents a 34 % percent premium over the closing price of Schering - Plough shares on March 6 .
Shares of Merck were down 8 % at $ 20.83 in Monday afternoon , while Schering - Plough shares shot up 15 % to $ 20.32 .
Merck is currently the world 's eighth largest drugmaker , based on market capitalization , with a value of roughly $ 48 billion .
First is Johnson & Johnson JNJ , - 0.03 % , with a market cap of around $ 133 billion , followed by Pfizer .
Schering - Plough is 12th .
On a conference call with investors Monday , Merck 's Clark said that following the merger , no product would represent more than 10 % of sales .
The chief executive also said that the deal would greatly bolster Merck 's presence abroad , as around 70 % of Schering - Plough 's shares are made overseas , including more than $ 2 billion from emerging markets .
The combined company is expected to draw more than 50 % of its revenue from outside of the United States .
Merck added it will maintain its annual dividend at its current level of $ 1.52 a share .
Upon completion , Merck shareholders will own roughly 68 % of the combined company and Schering - Plough shareholders the rest .
Job cuts coming
Both companies , which are based in New Jersey , already announced significant job cuts last fall .
But the merger is likely to lead to additional reductions .
The firms said they can achieve total cost savings of about $ 3.5 billion through the merger .
On the call , Clark said both companies will institute hiring freezes .
He also told Dow Jones Newswires that Merck expects to reduce about 15 % of its combined workforce .
Merck and Schering already are partnered on the cholesterol drugs Zetia and Vytorin .
But sales of the drugs fell more than 20 % in the fourth quarter on lingering concerns that they were n't any more effective than similar cheaper generic drugs on the market .
In addition , Merck 's top line has been hammered in recent years by weakened sales for several of its best - selling products due to generic competition and a major recall .
In 2004 , the company withdrew its once - hot pain reliever Vioxx from the market over health concerns .
The company has since lost patent protection for other top sellers , including the osteoporosis drug Fosamax and hugely popular cholesterol product Zocor .
As a result , Merck is now heavily dependent on sales of its asthma drug Singulair , diabetes pill Januvia and two older blood - pressure products .
Schering - Plough 's top line , for its part , has been dominated by the sales of Zetia and Vytorin , along with sales of its rheumatoid - arthritis drug Remicade , which is co-marketed with Johnson & Johnson .
In 2007 , the company purchased European biotech group Organon BioSciences , which specializes in animal health care , in an effort to diversify .
On the call Monday , analysts questioned whether the proposed merger would affect Schering - Plough 's marketing rights to Remicade and an eagerly anticipated follow - on product called golimumab .
See full story .
Shares of J&J were down 2 % at $ 46.88 Monday afternoon .
Merck will finance the cash component of the deal with a combination of $ 9.8 billion of existing cash reserves and $ 8.5 billion from committed financing to be provided by J.P. Morgan .
Synergies , stronger pipeline
Merck expects the tie -up to result in annual savings of $ 3.5 billion beyond 2011 , in part thanks to the full integration of the companies ' existing cholesterol joint venture .
Those savings would be in addition to those previously announced by the two companies as part of ongoing restructuring programs .
The deal is expected to boost earnings from the first full year after completion .
" The combined company will benefit from a formidable research and development pipeline , a significantly broader portfolio of medicines and an expanded presence in key international markets , particularly in high - growth emerging markets , " Clark said in a statement .
He added that Schering - Plough 's " considerable biologics expertise " would complement Merck 's novel proprietary biologics presence to create the best pipeline in the industry .
The tie - up will double the number of potential drugs Merck has in Phase III development to 18 .
Cantor Fitzgerald 's Stephen Pope said that the integration should go relatively smoothly as the deal unites two businesses with a similar mentality .
The absorption of a biotech firm , for instance , could have been more difficult because of the difference in culture .
Once the deal is closed the board of the combined company will be made up of the Merck board plus three Schering - Plough representatives .
Fred Hassan , the chief executive of Schering - Plough , intends to participate in the integration until the close , according to the companies .
We need guests for an upcoming show on PJTV on " going John Galt . "

On Wednesday , former Bush White House senior officials Karl Rove and Harriet Miers reached an agreement with the House judiciary committee to provide testimony about the administration 's involvement in the politicised firings of US Attorneys .
Though the justice department 's internal investigation has already concluded that the administration 's actions were inappropriate , judiciary chairman John Conyers had sought for some time , often with colourful language , to get Rove at the witness table in front of him .
The news that Rove and Miers will testify was met with cautious cheers on the left .
Those who had been pushing for their testimony were pleased that an agreement was reached , but concerns still remain about whether the accord will have enough teeth to compel all necessary testimony .
If it works , it may well serve as a template for interviewing former White House officials about other Bush - era scandals .
But if it fails – as seems likely – it will serve as an obstacle , not a conduit , to uncovering the full truth of the last eight years .
A close reading of the three - page document outlining the agreement seems to suggest plenty of wiggle room for Rove and Miers .
Their initial conversations with the committee will be private interviews , done out of the view of the public .
Transcripts of the interviews will be created and provided to all " involved parties " , though it 's unclear if any of those parties will provide , or be allowed to provide , those transcripts to the press .
The committee also explicitly reserves the right to seek public testimony , although it 's equally unclear whether the parties will be compelled under the agreement to respect that right .
After all , the agreement only grants the committee the right to seek public testimony , not compel it .
The scope of the testimony will be limited to facts surrounding the firings of US attorneys and , in Rove 's case , issues involving the prosecution of former Alabama governor Don Siegelman .
Rove and Miers will be allowed to refuse any questions that fall outside that narrow scope .
But those wo n't be the only questions that Rove and Miers will be able to avoid .
According to the agreement , " counsel will direct witnesses not to respond to questions … when questions relate to communications to or from the president . "
The Bush administration may have loosened its definition of executive privilege to some extent , no longer arguing that any testimony from senior officials need be off - limits .
But by allowing Rove and Miers to avoid discussing any material related to presidential communications , the former administration may have found the compromise they 'd been hoping for : one that looks good on paper , but has very little impact .
There are several questions that the committee will almost certainly fail to get answered as a result .
Can you describe the president 's involvement in the decision to fire the US attorneys ?
Did you ever have a conversation with the president where he suggested firing US attorneys ?
Did the president order you to take action that would result in the firing of US attorneys for political reasons ?
If the president did n't play a role in the firings , then it would appear his team had " gone rogue " , acting entirely outside his authority .
And if , as has been widely speculated , he did play a role , this agreement ensures that we will never find out .
There can be no doubt that the scope of the agreement is broad enough for Congress to gather new , potentially valuable information from Rove 's and Miers 's testimonies .
But by allowing the duo to avoid telling the full and unrestricted truth , the judiciary committee might well regret the precedent it is setting – one that will prevent a full accounting of Bush - era sins , leaving a critical part of American history hidden forever from our view .
Consumer electronics :
A new push is under way to let mobile devices off the leash by doing away with their dependence on power cables
Palm.com
IF THE father of electromagnetism , Michael Faraday , could be transported into the 21st century , he would no doubt be awestruck by the iPhone .
After five hours of tapping its touch - screen to browse the internet , make calls , play games and determine his location via satellite - positioning , he might also find himself a little puzzled .
Why , with all the advances in technology and communications , would such a sophisticated device still need to be plugged in to be recharged ?
If phone calls and web pages can be beamed through the air to portable devices , then why not electrical power , too ?
It is a question many consumers and device manufacturers have been asking themselves for some time — and one that both new and established technology companies are now hoping to answer .
To seasoned observers of the electronics industry , the promise of wireless recharging sounds depressingly familiar .
In 2004 Splashpower , a British technology firm , was citing “ very strong ” interest from consumer - electronics firms for its wireless charging pad .
Based on the principle of electromagnetic induction that Faraday had discovered in the 19th century , the company 's “ Splashpad ” contained a coil that generated a magnetic field when a current flowed through it .
When a mobile device containing a corresponding coil was brought near the pad , the process was reversed as the magnetic field generated a current in the second coil , charging the device 's battery without the use of wires .
Unfortunately , although Faraday 's principles of electromagnetic induction have stood the test of time , Splashpower has not — it was declared bankrupt last year without having launched a single product .
Thanks to its simplicity and scalability , electromagnetic induction is still the technology of choice among many of the remaining companies in the wireless - charging arena .
But , as Splashpower found , turning the theory into profitable practice is not straightforward .
One of the main difficulties for companies has been persuading manufacturers to incorporate charging modules into their devices .
But lately there have been some promising developments .
The first is the formation in December 2008 of the Wireless Power Consortium , a body dedicated to establishing a common standard for inductive wireless charging , and thus promoting its adoption .
( It is modelled on a similar body that did the same for Bluetooth , a short - range wireless technology that is now found in most mobile phones . )
The new consortium 's members include big consumer - electronics firms , such as Philips and Sanyo , as well as Texas Instruments ( TI ) , a chipmaker .
Menno Treffers , chairman of the consortium and director of standardisation at Philips , says universal standards are the single most important requirement for the adoption of wireless charging .
Philips is one of the few companies to have commercialised wirelessly charged devices — notably , electric toothbrushes and something it calls an “ intimate dual massager ” .
But Mr Treffers acknowledges that a more collaborative approach is needed to ensure that different devices , such as mobile phones , laptops and digital cameras , can share the same charging equipment .
Charging ahead
Fierce competition between manufacturers of mobile devices is also accelerating the introduction of wireless charging .
The star of this year 's Consumer Electronics Show , an annual jamboree held in Las Vegas , was the Pre , a snazzy smart - phone from Palm ( pictured left ) .
As well as the standard arsenal of technical features — touch - screen , Wi-Fi , GPS , Bluetooth and built - in camera — the Pre also has an optional charging pad , called the Touchstone , which uses electromagnetic induction to charge the device wirelessly .
When the device is placed on the pad , the two recognise each other through built - in sensors .
Magnets embedded in the pad align the handset and hold it in place during charging .
Palm was not the only exhibitor in Las Vegas promoting wireless charging .
Fulton Innovation , another member of the Wireless Power Consortium and the eventual owner of Splashpower 's assets , used the show to unveil a number of products including an in - car console equipped with inductive coils that can wirelessly charge mobile devices while on the road .
( BMW says it will offer its 7 Series cars in South Korea with a wireless - recharging dock for one of Samsung 's handsets . )
A modified toolbox from Bosch demonstrated the potential for wirelessly charging power tools .
Other domestic applications in the works include embedding charging pads into kitchen counters to enable the wireless use of blenders and other appliances .
Bret Lewis of Fulton Innovation says his firm 's technology could also be used for industrial applications , or to charge electric cars .
For the time being , however , the focus is on mobile phones , laptops and other consumer devices , and he sees 2009 as “ the year for wireless ” .
That is probably too ambitious , but a third recent development suggests that the commercialisation of inductive charging may not be far off .
In November 2008 TI announced that it had joined forces with Fulton Innovations “ to accelerate development of efficient wireless power solutions ” .
TI , which provides components to many of the world 's leading mobile - phone makers said it was exploring the production of integrated circuits that supported the technology developed by Fulton Innovations , with the aim of reducing the cost and size of the components needed for wireless charging and making it easier for device - makers to incorporate them into their products quickly .
It now seems to be a matter of when , rather than if , wireless charging enters the mainstream .
“ From a semiconductor and power - management point of view , wireless charging is a natural extension of what we have been doing , ” says Masoud Beheshti , director of battery - charge management at TI .
He predicts that , like Bluetooth , wireless charging will initially be offered on high - end devices , before gradually becoming more widely available .
As wireless - charging equipment based on electromagnetic induction heads towards the market , a number of alternative technologies are also being developed to transmit power over both short and long distances .
WildCharge , a start - up based in Colorado , has already started selling a number of wireless - charging devices that take a cheaper but simpler approach in which mobile devices make electrical contact with a special charging pad via four small conductive metal studs ( pictured ) .
Look , no wires
WildCharge and the licensees of its technology have developed replacement back covers for a number of popular devices , including Motorola 's RAZR phones and video - game controllers for the Nintendo Wii and the Sony PlayStation 3 .
No matter how the device is plonked down , two of the bumps establish direct electrical contact with the pad .
The firm has also developed special “ skins ” for Blackberry smart - phones , so that they too can be charged without the need for an adaptor .
Although it may not have the “ wow ” factor of inductive coupling , this approach does away with the necessity for a “ handshake ” between the device and the pad , and with the need to align the device and the pad in a particular way before charging can begin .
At the other end of the spectrum is the idea of long - range transmission of wireless power , which could in principle do away with the need for a charging pad altogether .
This technique uses the energy in radio waves , broadcast from a transmitter and harnessed by an antenna , to generate electricity .
Using the passive - power principle found in crystal radios , the method has proved successful over short distances in places where it is difficult to replace batteries or carry out maintenance .
The problem is that the intensity of the radio waves needed to charge mobile phones and laptop computers over long distances might be hazardous to human health , and regulators would be unlikely to approve .
Nevertheless a firm called Powercast , based in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , has developed wireless - charging products that can do useful things while still operating at safe power levels .
Over distances of less than 1.5 metres , its technology can be used to run low - power lighting systems ; at a range of up to three metres , the radio waves can provide useful power for trickle - charging rechargeable batteries ; and up to about 7.5 metres , they can be used to power wireless sensor networks .
The firm talks of providing “ milliwatts over metres ” and “ watts over centimetres ” .
Yet another approach is that taken by PowerBeam , a start - up based in Silicon Valley .
It uses lasers to beam power from one place to another , but it too faces regulatory difficulties .
The firm says the low power - density of its lasers and a series of safeguards ensures that human exposure remains within regulatory limits .
With so many companies working towards wireless power , how long will it be before the cord is finally cut ?
According to Charles Golvin of Forrester , a consultancy , one of the key considerations is getting manufacturers to abandon a lucrative line of business .
He says that many mobile - phone manufacturers use the proprietary connectors on their chargers to retain customers , as people are more likely to buy products for which they already have charging adaptors at home , in the office , or in the car .
This may make them reluctant to switch to a common wireless - charging standard .
But Mr Colvin thinks strong demand will ensure that wireless technology prevails in the long run .
Peaks and troughs
Stephan Ohr of Gartner , a market - research firm , says the prospects for wireless power are realistic , but the path to widespread adoption will not be as easy as many in the industry expect .
New technologies tend to go through a period of “ inflated expectations ” in which they are hyped , but fail to gain traction .
Only after passing through the “ trough of disillusionment ” , during which expectations return to a more sensible level , are they widely adopted .
For wireless charging , Mr Ohr expects this to take three to five years .
But it now seems to be a matter of when , rather than if , wireless charging enters the mainstream .
And if those in the field do find themselves languishing in the trough of disillusionment , they could take some encouragement from Faraday himself .
He observed that “ nothing is too wonderful to be true if it be consistent with the laws of nature . ”
Not even a wirelessly rechargeable iPhone .

ISRAEL'S MILITARY is trying to stifle an international outcry after accounts of several Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) soldiers about atrocities they saw during Israel 's recent Gaza offensive were published in Ha'aretz newspaper .
The firsthand accounts of the IDF 's conduct in Gaza created a stir in Israel and beyond because they confirmed a pattern of blatant disregard for civilian life and abuses that many Palestinians and human rights organizations had reported , but were dismissed by IDF spokespeople as " anti-Israel propaganda . "
But on March 30 , 11 days after the IDF promised to look into the incidents revealed in the Ha'aretz article , a high - ranking official ordered that the investigation be closed , asserting that the claims about misconduct were based on nothing more than " rumors . "
As Amos Harel , the Ha'aretz reporter who broke the story about the soldiers ' testimonies , commented sarcastically : " One would be hard - pressed not to express astonishment at the speed and efficiency demonstrated by the Military Advocate General , Brigadier - General Avichai Mendelblit , and the military police investigation unit in probing the ' combat soldiers ' testimonials affair . ' "
Israeli occupation forces in the Gaza Strip ( Rusty Stewart )
THE SOLDIERS ' testimonies demonstrate the IDF 's wanton destruction of property in Gaza and casual contempt for Palestinian civilians .
As one soldier described an incident :
A company commander with 100 soldiers under his command saw a woman walking down a road some distance away , but close enough that you could 've gunned down whoever you identified .
She was an elderly woman -- whether she raised any suspicion , I do n't know .
But what the officer did in the end was to put men on the roof and with the snipers bring her down .
I felt it was simply murder in cold blood .
Danny Zamir , director of a pre-military preparatory program , brought together some of the program graduates to discuss their Gaza experiences and compiled a transcript of their February 13 discussion , which was later leaked to the press .
" I do n't get it -- why did he have her shot ? " interjected Zamir , as the soldier told his story .
The soldier replied :
That what 's great in Gaza , you could say - - you see someone walking down a track , not necessarily armed , and you can simply shoot them .
In our case , it was an elderly woman .
I did n't see her with any weapon .
The order was to bring the person down , that woman , " as soon as you sight her . "
There are always warnings , and there 's always the saying --" it could be a suicide bomber . "
What I felt was a lot of bloodthirstiness .
Because we were n't in many engagements , our battalion was only involved in a very limited number of incidents with terrorists .
According to a squad leader in another brigade :
There was a house with a family inside ... We put them in a room .
Later , we left the house , and another platoon entered it , and a few days after that , there was an order to release the family .
They had set up positions upstairs .
There was a sniper position on the roof .
The platoon commander let the family go and told them to go to the right .
One mother and her two children did n't understand and went to the left , but they forgot to tell the sharpshooter on the roof they had let them go and it was okay , and he should hold his fire , and he did what he was supposed to , like he was following his orders .
The sharpshooter saw a woman and children approaching him , closer than the lines he was told no one should pass .
He shot them straight away .
In any case , what happened is that in the end , he killed them .
I do n't think he felt too bad about it , because after all , as far as he was concerned , he did his job according to the orders he was given .
And the atmosphere in general , from what I understood from most of my men who I talked to ... I do n't know how to describe it ... The lives of Palestinians , let 's say , are something very , very less important than the lives of our soldiers .
So as far as they are concerned , they can justify it that way .
AS THE Ha'aretz reports of the soldiers ' testimonies spread , other media outlets came forward with similar accounts from inside the war on Gaza .
A documentary on Israel 's Channel 10 related the words of a company commander speaking to his troops just before the Gaza invasion .
" We 're going to war , " he said .
" We 're not doing routine security work or anything like that .
I want aggressiveness -- if there 's someone suspicious on the upper floor of a house , we 'll shell it .
If we have suspicions about a house , we 'll take it down .
There will be no hesitation .
If it 's us or them , it 'll be them .
If someone approaches us unarmed , shoot in the air .
If he keeps going , that man is dead .
Nobody will deliberate -- let the mistakes be over their lives , not ours . "
Ha'aretz reporter Amira Hass reported on a handwritten document in Hebrew found in one of the many Palestinian residences that IDF troops commandeered during their offensive .
In one section , the document states , " Rules of Engagement : Open fire also upon rescue . "
Hass points out that the order to fire on medical rescue teams is consistent with other reports :
One of the main themes in news reports during the Gaza operation , and which appears in many testimonies , is that IDF soldiers shot at Palestinian and Red Cross rescuers , making it impossible to evacuate the wounded and dead .
As a result , an unknown number of Palestinians bled to death as others cowered in their homes for days without medical treatment , waiting to be rescued .
The bodies of the dead lay outside the homes or on roadsides for days , sometimes as long as two weeks .
Ha'aretz has reported a number of such cases , some of them as they happened .
The document found in the house provides written proof that IDF commanders ordered their troops to shoot at rescuers .
Before the IDF issued its rapid acquittal of itself , Defense Minister Ehud Barak , who also is head of Israel 's Labor Party , promised a thorough investigation , but simultaneously issued a full - throated defense of the IDF 's conduct .
" We have the most moral army in the world , " Barak told Israel Radio .
" I spent dozens of years in uniform .
I know what happened in Yugoslavia , Afghanistan and Iraq , and I say to you that from the chief of staff down to the last soldier , the most moral army in the world stands ready to take orders from the government of Israel .
I have no doubt that every incident will be individually examined . "
Ha'aretz columnist Gideon Levy ridiculed Barak 's response and the idea that the IDF would mount anything resembling a thorough investigation .

Ideally , any energy source we want to emphasize in the future will meet all of these criteria , and additionally , will be inexpensive to produce .
The problem is that it is very difficult to find fuels that meet all these criteria .
To be sustainable , clearly the fuel supply must be adequate - - not run out shortly .
If we are concerned about climate change , a sustainable source of energy production should not add much carbon to the atmosphere , either .
We are running short on fresh water , so a sustainable fuel must not put a burden on the water supply .
Furthermore , it is becoming more and more clear that the system of international trade that underlies our high - tech system will not hold together indefinitely .
Because of this , an energy source that depends heavily on imported raw materials or parts , or is dependent on our whole high - tech way of life , is not likely to continue very long .
What makes energy sustainable ?
I think each of us has our own idea , and the various ideas are not entirely the same .
Future Investment
This last criterion , being inexpensive to produce , is becoming more and more important .
With the credit unwind , the amount of money available for investment has already dropped .
The credit unwind is not yet over , so I expect that the amount of money available for investment will continue to drop in the future , perhaps something like this :
With a smaller amount of funds ( and energy ) available for investment , all types of new investment will suffer .
New energy infrastructure spending will need to be kept low , if we want to have funds for other things , such as building factories and maintaining roads .
Sustainability Grid
What happens when we evaluate various fuel sources on the now five sustainability criteria ( assuming we add " new capacity inexpensive " to the four above ) ?.
I tried to make a rough stab at answering this question , putting together a " Sustainability Grid " .
In the Sustainability Grid , I used a very simple scale going from 0 to 3 for each criterion , with 3 being the best , and 0 being the worst .
My evaluations are not very scientific -- they are mostly based on impressions , rather than close comparisons of data , but they give a general idea of where the different fuels stand on the various criteria .
Besides the individual values for the various cells , another question is how a person combines the indications .
I have just shown an unweighted sum .
Theoretically , if one of the issues listed is vastly more important than others , ( for example , low carbon , because of climate change concerns ) , one could weight the results , so that attribute is given much more weight in any consideration .
Another approach would be to require that any possible substitute for our current energy sources meet all of the criteria .
If that were the case , we might be left only with " energy efficiency " , or perhaps " doing without " as an option .
I should also point out that these are n't the only criteria one might consider .
One might consider whether a new fuel type fits with the existing infrastructure .
If it does n't , then the infrastructure conversion cost might be considered along with the new capacity cost .
There may also be specific issues for specific fuels .
Nuclear comes to mind , with the question of how one handles toxic waste 100 years from now , if we are very short on energy supplies at that time .
Sustainability Grid : Looking at Various Fuels
The fuel that in some sense is best on my sustainability chart is wood .
It is low carbon .
In the areas where it grows , it does n't need extra water .
Planting and harvesting can be done in a low tech way , and new capacity seems to be inexpensive -- all one needs to do is plant another tree in an area where trees grow .
The catch is that there are way too many people for the number of trees .
Much of the US ' ( and world 's ) land is not suitable for growing trees , because of inadequate water or incorrect temperature .
If people come to see wood as a " good " solution , it wo n't be long before we have serious deforestation issues .
So wood is not really sustainable as a solution , if more than a small percentage of the population tries to adopt it as a solution .
If a person looks at the other energy sources on my sustainability grid above , most of them require a fairly high level of technology to sustain them .
This could be a problem , if the financial situation continues to deteriorate , and we find ourselves with many fewer foreign imports .
Without imports of spare parts and raw materials , it seems likely that much of our advanced technology could disappear within five or ten years .
The one exception to requiring a high level of technology is coal .
Certainly , the current method of mining coal uses advanced technology .
But coal production can also be done with very low technology - - a few pick axes and a bucket in a makeshift mine .
This approach is unsafe and certainly not recommended , but if other possibilities disappear , many people will consider this a fall - back option .
Coal deposits are very widespread in the US , and many have never been mined .
I suspect that if technology really fails , this will be an option considered by many who live near coal deposits .
By that time , we may be using so little in fossil fuels in total that the carbon issue may be less of a concern .
Coal can also be burned in a very low - tech way .
We did this for years before modern regulations .
I would n't recommend it , but when people are desperate , I do n't think they will be thinking of those details .
The question then becomes :
What are our best options , as long as imports and technology hang together ?
Should be making wind turbines or solar PV panels , corn ethanol , or something else ?
I am not certain I really have the answer to this question , because the answer depends on how one weights the various items in the sustainability grid , and whether the values I picked are even half - way right .
It also depends on how long we think technology in its current form can be maintained .
If we can only maintain our import - driven , high tech society for five or ten more years , then one could argue that we really do n't need to be spending anything on new capacity , since , as I show in the next section , we already have quite a bit more electrical generating capacity than we are using .
If technology can be expected to hold together for 20 years , even then we cannot expect investments to behave as in the past .
Instead , we must amortize the cost over a much shorter period , and investment costs become much more expensive than they have been in the past .
It is only if our current high tech lifestyle can be maintained for 50 years or more that the type of investments we have made in the past make sense , because of the long planning cycle involved , and the long life ( and high cost ) of new generating capacity .
What Is the Structure of Our Current Electricity Generating Capacity ?
I find it interesting to look at where we are today , in terms of electric generating capacity , electric production , utilization , and cost of new infrastructure ( assuming we really can amortize costs over the conventional time frame ) .
If we look at EIA data , US electric generating capacity has grown as follows since 1996 :
From this graph , one can see that coal , hydroelectric , petroleum , and nuclear generating capacity have remained almost constant since 1996 .
Natural gas generating capacity is now huge , exceeding even that of coal .
The electricity that is actually produced in the US has grown much differently , as shown in this graph of EIA data :
What has happened is that coal and nuclear generated electric power have increased in recent years , because these plants are now being operated longer hours .
Natural gas production has also increased , but not in proportion to the additional capacity added .
Wind capacity has been added , but production remains tiny - - only 1 % of total US electricity produced .
If we compute what percentage of nameplate capacity the various types of generation are operating at , using EIA data , this is what we get :
Nuclear operates nearly constantly , except down - time for maintenance .
Coal plants operate in the upper 60 % range , because many of them ramp down to a lower level at night , when demand is lower , and then back up again during the day time .
On average , they are at very close to full capacity , considering down - time for maintenance and the fact that less power is needed at night .
Wind and natural gas operate at much lower percentages , about 25 % for wind , and 23 % for natural gas .
Natural gas operating percentages vary greatly from power plant to power plant , with some operating many hours ( " intermediate " or " base load " ) , and some operating only for occasional " peaking " .
I am sure many were originally planned to operate more hours than they in fact are operating .
Natural gas costs were cheap when most of these plants were planned , but once the cost natural gas rose , the desire to use the plants dropped considerably .
Recently , the cost of natural gas has fallen again .
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) has published this table of energy costs , for the various types of fuels .
This table is for nameplate capacities , rather than actual production .
I made a stab at converting FERC 2008 costs based on nameplate capacity to costs based on actual electricity produced .
In doing this , I assumed natural gas used " combined cycle " technology , since it is my understanding that this is what is currently popular .
I assumed that coal used conventional coal , since IGCC is quite a bit more expensive , and carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) ( which is the prime selling point of IGCC ) and storage to go with IGCC is nowhere near ready .
To fully amortize the cost of IGCC plus CCS , it seems like one would need a planning horizon of at least 70 years , because of the time to design and build the CCS .
When one looks at construction costs in terms of actual electricity produced , wind is highest at about $ 8,000 per kilowatt of capacity ( adjusted for utiliztion ) .
Nuclear is second , at $ 7,000 per kilowatt of capacity ( adjusted for utilization ) .
Natural gas is next , and coal is lowest .
The costs I show per kilowatt hour of capacity on the graph above are the costs assuming " normal " amortization .
I would think we would need at least a 50 year timing horizon for this -- ten years or more for planning and building , plus 30 or 40 years for the operation of the new capacity .
Costs will be higher per kilowatt hour if the real time they can be used is shorter .
Combining cost of capacity with existing infrastructure
When I look at these graphs , I scratch my head .
We have a huge amount of unused capacity for producing electricity from natural gas .
Most of these natural gas plants need to be manned around the clock , whether or not they are actually producing electricity .
We currently have natural gas selling for record low prices ( at least in recent years ) .
If we need extra electrical production , why not just burn a little natural gas ?
The capacity is already built , so its additional cost is $ 0 , and even the additional manpower needed is low .
If we support our unconventional natural gas producers , natural gas production could probably continue for quite a few more years .
At this point , natural gas is out of favor , after being ramped up only a few years ago .
We have the infrastructure , but we are n't really using it .
Longer term , it seems like we need to be doing better planning than we did for natural gas .
We should be considering questions such as :
What is the new mix going to look like , considering our views of sustainability ?
What other infrastructure ( grid upgrades , electrical storage ) is needed ?
How long do we really expect to be able to use it ?
What is the cost likely to be ?
Can we really afford it ?
Are there better uses for our capital , considering where society is likely to be 100 years from now ?

It was kosher chaos .
A riot erupted at a Brooklyn restaurant last week when Orthodox Jewish patrons discovered the “ kosher ” hot dogs on the menu were chicken franks that did n’t answer to a higher authority .
What ensued was as unholy as the hot dogs .
The eatery ’s frightened manager was punched in the face and fended off the angry mob with an electric carving knife until cops finally broke up the frankfurter fracas .
“ They were yelling at the guy behind the counter , ” one witness told The Post .
“ They started spitting and throwing things at him .
They were shaking the counter and trying to jump over to search the fridge . ”
Members of Shomrim , the local volunteer crime patrol , was at the scene before police .
“ There were at least 100 people there .
We sent everybody out to the street , ” a member said .
The Torah tussle began when a longtime patron noticed the unusually plump wiener he bought Monday night at Cheskel ’s Shawarma King in Borough Park did n’t fit into a challah roll as usual .
Suspicious , he asked for proof of where the hot dogs were bought .
The server brought him the package , which confirmed the Bar S brand jumbo chicken frank was not certified kosher .
Shocked Hasidic patrons , joined by dozens of passers - by , encircled the counter of the 13th Avenue eatery , demanding answers .
At least one patron hit besieged manager Yosef Baron in the cheek .
Baron kept them at bay by waving the electric knife in their faces an image captured on video now making the rounds on the Web .
No one was arrested .
Rabbi Naftali Meir Babad , who had certified the greasy spoon as kosher , determined the hot - dog heresy was the result of a “ terrible accident . ”
Earlier in the night , a non-Jewish restaurant employee was sent out to buy frankfurters from a nearby kosher market .
Instead , the worker went to a Golden Apple Farm grocery across the street and loaded up on goy wieners that just did n’t cut the mustard .
The restaurant was shut for two days as rabbis meticulously checked for other non-kosher foods .
Kitchen equipment that touched the offending meat was thrown out , and utensils were cleansed with a flame to purge any remnants of treif , or non-kosher food , in a process known as kashering .
The ultra-Orthodox community continued to boil over the roasted weenies , with talk of protests lingering all week .
“ Nobody knows how long this was going on , ” one man fumed .

ROME , Italy ( CNN ) --
The Italian media call her " Foxy Knoxy , " portray her as a " devil with an angel 's face , " and there are 11 Facebook pages dedicated to her , all in Italian .
Both Raffaele Sollecito ( left ) and Amanda Knox deny charges of murder and sexual assault .
Amanda Knox , 21 , is an American college student from Seattle , Washington , who is on trial for murder in Perugia , Italy .
The case has given Knox almost pop star status there .
She was voted the top woman in an online " person of the year " poll by an Italian TV channel in December , beating out Carla Bruni , the Italian - born French first lady .
Seven of the 11 Facebook pages champion her innocence ; four seem convinced that Knox is pure evil .
A sampling of comments : " No to Amanda .
No to her superstardom " ... " She 's a sociopath " ... " Everyone is not sure if she is guilty or not and that she will lead us to a new existential awareness .
Please shout with me your anger .
...
Let 's say no .
Let 's say Knox . "
Knox and former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito , 24 , are charged with murdering and sexually assaulting one of Knox 's roommates , British exchange student Meredith Kercher , on November 1 , 2007 .
They insist they are innocent and are disputing the allegations .
Knox and Sollecito are due back in court today .
The last time Knox appeared before the panel of eight judges , she wore a T - shirt quoting The Beatles : " All you need is love . "
Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini alleges that Kercher , 21 , was killed because she refused to participate in a drug - fueled sex game played by Knox , Sollecito , and a third man , Ivory Coast native Rudy Hermann Guede .
In court papers , prosecutors stated that Sollecito held Kercher by her wrists while Knox poked at her with a knife and Guede sexually assaulted her .
The case is being tried in Perugia , a university town about 115 miles north of Rome that is better known for its chocolate than for its scandalous murder trials .
According to the prosecutor 's office , Kercher had been in Italy for two months as part of a year - long course with Leeds University , where she was working toward a degree in European Studies .
She shared a house with Knox , a University of Washington student in the same exchange program , and two Italian housemates .
The crime scene , which has become a tourist attraction , has been broken into twice , police say .
Knox and Sollecito were arrested November 6 , 2007 , and were kept in prison while an investigation continued .
The judge overseeing the investigation found both were capable of committing the crime again , fleeing the country or tampering with the evidence .
Police sought charges in July 2008 , and they were ordered to trial in October .
The trial began January 16 and has been held mostly on weekends .
Italian newspapers assigned their top crime reporters , and the case has received unprecedented international coverage .
Knox has appeared on the cover of People magazine , which shares a corporate parent with CNN .
A random sampling of women on the streets of Rome showed that all of them had heard of the case and most believed Knox and Sollecito were at the very least implicated in the slaying .
The superheated publicity surrounding the case helped make Knox a household name in Italy .
She is usually portrayed as a femme fatale .
Consider these headlines :
• " Sex , lies and stabbings "
• " Lovers without any inhibitions "
• " And in prison , she even tries to sun tan "
Italian journalists also have plastered their newspapers with photos they found of Knox on the Internet , especially images that showed her as a " wild girl . "
They pounced on the " Foxy Knoxy " nickname they found on her MySpace page , even though her parents later explained the high school moniker came from the way Knox played soccer , quick like a fox .
Although Italian law limits the publication of court and police records , the media ban is less strict than in many European countries .
While it is not exactly legal to publish police investigative reports , no journalist has gone to jail in Italy for doing it .
Among the items leaked : Knox 's diary , various police interrogations , photos of Kercher 's body , video of Kercher 's body ( which wound up on YouTube but has been pulled ) , and video of the Italian forensic police carrying out their investigation .
Eventually , even the leaks made headlines , leading to more speculation .
Knox can do no right in the Italian media .
If she appears reserved and timid in court , she is portrayed as someone with plenty to hide .
If she smiles or laughs in court , she 's called disrespectful .
As far as the Italian media is concerned , Knox is the mastermind who manipulated those around her and seduced her Italian boyfriend and led him astray .
While Knox and Sollecito 's preliminary hearings were being held in October , Guede was convicted of murder after a fast - track trial .
His lawyers had hoped that the speedy resolution of the case would give him a break at sentencing .
He got 30 years in prison .
According to testimony at Guede 's trial , his fingerprints were found in the house , and his DNA was linked to Kercher 's body .
He has never denied being in the house the night of the slaying but insists he did n't kill her .
He says he had an " appointment " with her that night and was in the bathroom when she was killed .
Sollecito and Knox say they were n't at the house the night of the slaying .
They say they both were at Sollecito 's house .
But the alibi has been contradicted by witnesses at the trial .
Eighty - six media outlets sent 140 journalists to cover the opening of the trial in January , but publicity has waned since then .
The Italian 24 - hour news channel TG24 no longer breaks into its programming with multiple updates .
Knox , for now , has been relegated to the pages preceding the sports or weather report .
But Italians love their murder cases , and attention has shifted to other crime news .
A mother is accused of killing her toddler son , a husband and wife are accused of multiple killings .
Their courtrooms are now filled with spectators who wait in line an hour or more .
The Perugia courtroom still is packed , but the long line is gone .
That is likely to change , however , as testimony shifts to the defense case .

An appeal has been lodged by the Director of Public Prosecutions against the sentence given to a 24 - year - old man who raped a four - year - old girl as she slept at her grandmother 's house .
The Attorney - General , John Hatzistergos , today said he had been informed by the DPP that an appeal had been lodged against the two - year suspended jail term given to the man in the Downing Centre District Court on February 5 .
Mr Hatzistergos said he had raised his concerns about the case with the DPP yesterday .
" I referred the matter to the director yesterday because there were understandable concerns about this particular sentence and I believed it required further analysis , '' Mr Hatzistergos said .
" I can well understand that that there are understandable community concerns in relation to any incidents in relation to sexual assailed of person , particularly of that age .
It 's an abhorrent crime . ''
Mr Hatzistergos said the maximum sentence for sexual assaulting a child under 10 years was 25 years while the standard minimum sentence was 15 years .
The Opposition had demanded that the DPP appeal against the sentence .
Police were called to the house on November 22 after the girl 's grandmother discovered her car had been broken into .
When they arrived , the girl told them that a man had been inside the house overnight and had sexually assaulted her .
The man was arrested five days after the attack when police matched him to DNA on clothing found at the scene .
He was charged with sexual assault of a person under the age of 10 as well as several other charges including break and enter .
The man spent 14 months in prison awaiting his sentence but walked free after his appearance last month .
The shadow attorney - general , Greg Smith , described the sentence as " unbelievable " .
" It seems totally inappropriate for the court to impose such a light sentence where the maximum penalty for such an offence is 25 years .
An explanation is required , " he said .
Mr Smith said the leniency of the sentence sent a poor message to the community .
" The community have a right to expect the punishment to fit the crime .
Here the crime was against a four - year - old child , " he said .
The girl 's MP , Steve Cansdell , said he was " angry and disgusted " the man had been released .
" I have had a crisis meeting with shadow attorney - general Greg Smith and he has agreed the NSW Opposition will do everything possible to convince the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal this ridiculously lenient sentence .
" Crimes against children , particularly those of a sexual nature , deserve the harshest possible punishment , but instead this animal is out on the streets , walking and possibly stalking his next victim . "
A spokesman for the DPP refused to comment , saying his office was awaiting a transcript of the judgment .

TomTom , a Netherlands - based manufacturer of car navigation products , has slapped Microsoft with a countersuit after the Redmond company initially debuted legal action against it for intellectual property infringement .
At the end of February 2009 , the software giant introduced legal action against TomTom , emphasizing that the focal point of the lawsuit was not on the patents involving the implementation of the Linux kernel in the devices of the in - car navigation solution maker .
In March 2009 , TomTom fired back , and filed a countersuit against Microsoft , alleging that the software giant was infringing on no less than four of its patents with the Streets and Trips program .
The countersuit introduced by TomTom in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia is a clear indication that the Netherlands - based company is ready to stand its ground against Microsoft .
Back in February 2009 , the Redmond company explained that it filed the patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Western Washington and with the International Trade Commission ( ITC ) , only after IP negotiations with TomTom had failed .
At that time , the software giant revealed that TomTom refused to jump aboard its intellectual property licensing program .
Still , Microsoft is sending out signals that it would much rather settle the patent dispute with a licensing agreement than in court .
But considering the latest move from TomTom , the two companies are quite far from sitting down at the negotiations table .
" We are reviewing TomTom 's filing , which we have just received .
As has been the case for more than a year , we remain committed to a licensing solution , although we will continue to press ahead with the complaints we initiated in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington and the International Trade Commission , " revealed Horacio Gutierrez , corporate vice president and deputy general counsel of Intellectual Property and Licensing , Microsoft Corporation .

VATS of grease may make health advocates cringe , but Westchester County officials see excess cooking oil from the county ’s 3,500 restaurants as a means of cleaner , cheaper fuel .
With seven vehicles that run solely on fuel made from cooking oil and 125 vehicles that run on a mix of cooking oil and diesel fuel , the county has begun a program to take excess oil off local restaurateurs ’ hands free to use it as an alternative energy source .
At a news conference on Tuesday to announce the program , Andrew J. Spano , the county executive , hailed the program as part of the county ’s continuing effort to cut costs while reducing emissions that harm the environment .
For every 10,000 gallons of cooking oil collected , the county could save about $ 25,000 in diesel fuel costs , Mr. Spano said .
It could also provide savings to restaurant owners , many of whom rely on private disposal services to haul away frying oil that cannot be reused , he said .

Jamais ’ collection of essays about geoengineering , Hacking the Earth , is available from Lulu .
Jamais writes :
It gathers together the major pieces I ’ve written about geoengineering , here and at Worldchanging ; I ’ve edited most of them to bring the content up to date , eliminate the bloggier aspects ( “ such and such just appeared at this link ” ) , and give it a bit more flow .
This is my “ have to have a book in print ” stake in the ground , at least for now .
It ’s sometimes surprising how important a print publication still is in many knowledge and analysis fields .
It does n’t matter if it ’s widely read , it just needs to exist .
This is also an experiment in publish - on - demand .
Rather than go through a traditional publisher , I ’m trying out Lulu.com .
This gives me a bit more control over the content , and allows me to put something about on a subject that probably wo n’t be generating a lot of mainstream attention for another couple of years .
If you decide to buy a copy , thank you .
If not , thank you , too .
I ’m really curious about how well this model of book publishing works , in terms of both success and failure .
I do n’t think I have any more geoengineering items lined up right now .
Therefore , I declare Terraformingstock over for now .

Does the world need more programmers ?
Of course , it does , says Jay Silver .
Everyone should be a programmer .
That 's not to say everyone should make their living as some sort of ponytail - ed , Python - obsessed shut - in .
But just as everyone should know how to write , everyone should know how to program .
And that 's the computing Valhalla sought by Scratch , the MIT Media Lab project Silver flaunted this morning at the Emerging Technologies Conference in the heart of Silicon Valley .
" Should everyone be a writer ?
No , we need people to do all kinds of things , " Silver tells The Reg .
" But should everyone know how to write ?
Or , maybe even more importantly , should everyone have a situation when they could learn how to write and express themselves ?
I 'm going to say ' Absolutely . '
And I think Scratch offers the possibility that everyone can program , that everyone can express themselves through digital media creation . "
Scratch is a ( highly - ) visual programming language aimed at the every man - even if the every man has yet to reach his ninth birthday .
With this WYSIWYG environment - available as a free download here - you can piece together interactive digital apps in much the same way you 'd piece together LEGOs .
And that 's not hyperbole .
At a workshop this morning inside San Jose 's Fairmount Hotel , more than a few programming novices built their own mini-apps in ( literally ) a matter of minutes .
Building apps from Scratch
Granted , these were exceedingly simple applications .
Little more than a year into its launch , Scratch is focused on games and playful apps that revolve around images , animation , and music .
But its building blocks - which can rightly be called building blocks - are remarkably intuitive .
Five minutes after launching the environment for the first time , you can snap together an app that , say , pixelates a digital photo when you clap your hands .
" Scratch is tinkerable , " says Silver .
" The language is designed so that nothing ever breaks .
Nothing never runs .
You can learn things just trying to keep them in place ...
And we 're willing to make design trade - offs to keep that .
For instance , we do n't do functions that can specifically take variables , because we have n't been able to design this in so that it would be completely intuitive . "
Coded in Squeak SmallTalk - and compiled into Java for use on the web - Scratch is part of the default software build for the OLPC ( One Laptop Per Child ) notebook cooked up by MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte .
To date , more than 54,000 contributors have snapped together more than 350,000 apps , shared with world + dog via Scratch 's YouTube - like app aggregator .
Some contributors claim they 're as young as four - years - old .
Whether they 're lying about their age or not , Scratch is certainly intuitive enough for the precocious pre-schooler .
The question is whether it's at such a high level of abstraction that it can no longer be called a programming language .
" When I first heard about Scratch , I hated it ... I did n't like the idea of teaching kids how to program , " says MIT 's Seth Raphael , who now works on the project .
" But this is n't a programming language .
It 's an environment where people can become creators of content for the internet .
It 's like crayons for the web .
Though some people may disagree . " ®
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. non-farm payroll are estimated to have shed more than half a million jobs in January after losing a similar number in December as employers , fearing the impact of a weak economy on sales and profits , shrank their work forces to cut costs .
A poll of 82 economists by Reuters produced a median estimate of 525,000 jobs lost in January after 524,000 jobs were shed from non-farm payrolls in December .
Estimates of January job losses ranged from 400,000 to 780,000 .
Manufacturing payrolls were estimated to have lost 139,000 jobs , an unsurprising figure given gloomy readings on regional and nationwide manufacturing indexes .
Average hourly earnings were estimated to have risen a slight 0.2 percent after rising just 0.3 percent in December .
U.S. Labor Department data is due at 8:30 a.m. EST on Friday .
A sampling of forecasts and analysis on the upcoming employment data follows :
CARL RICCADONNA , SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST , DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES :
Forecast : Non-farm payrolls - 400,0000
Unemployment rate 7.3 percent
Craig Berry , who has been unemployed for 10 months , signs up for temporary work at a Manpower temporary agency in Chicago , February 5 , 2009 .

“ Even though on the surface , 400,000 jobs lost in January will look like an improvement from even steeper losses in December , the concern is that the number is related to seasonal adjustment issues .
The reason we have a smaller decline than consensus is that all of the layoffs that usually happen in the retail industry after the holiday season wo n’t happen this year because temporary hiring for the holiday shopping season took place on a much reduced scale at the end of 2008 .
So the layoffs of those temporary workers that usually occur in January and February will occur on a much smaller scale .
The seasonal adjustments thus will probably make job losses look less severe than is the true underlying case .
That means labor market weakness will be back with a vengeance , possibly as early as February , but certainly at the end of this quarter and in the second quarter .
Fanning the flames of that concern is the fact that we had such a large inventory build - up in the fourth quarter which has to be worked down .
That means production will be pulled back even more severely in the current quarter , leading to even more layoffs . ”
DAVID RESLER , CHIEF ECONOMIST , NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL , NEW YORK :
Forecast : Non-farm payrolls - 500,000
Unemployment rate 7.4 percent
“ We ’re looking for a drop in non -farm payroll jobs of 500,000 and for unemployment to be 7.4 percent .
We judge that to be consistent with a variety of indicators showing weakening in the economy and job market .
“ There is some possibility that the decline will be less than our forecast because of vagaries in seasonal adjustments for retail workers .
Stores hired fewer temporary workers than normal for the holiday shopping season so as a consequence fewer than normal workers were laid off in January .
We ’ve factored in a small influence for that .
If we underestimated that adjustment , non -farm payrolls could show a smaller drop .
“ This is also a month where the change in employment from December to January is less meaningful .
This is the time of the year for seasonal adjustment revisions .
We expect them to be negative revisions , but how they ’ll affect individual months is anybody ’s guess .
RDQ ECONOMICS :
Forecast : Non-farm payrolls - 400,000 jobs
Unemployment rate 7.4 percent
“ The ADP employment report corroborates other data in suggesting that underlying labor market conditions remained very weak in January .
We expect , however , that a technical issue related to seasonal adjustment factors in the retail sector may result in nonfarm payrolls falling by less than recent trends in January and we look for a 400,000 job decline in the month . ”

In Sudan this week , as the International Criminal Court issued a warrant from the arrest of President Bashir , the BBC's Owen Bennett - Jones found echoes of a 100 - year - old conflict .
The sect 's leader or sheikh , a frail , blind man was sitting on his bed with his thin legs crossed .
The Mahdi who led a 19th century rebellion is still revered in Sudan He asked me why I had come .
Well , I had heard that his followers met two evenings a week to sing , dance and pray , I said .
I was wondering if I could attend a ceremony .
As he contemplated whether or not I could be a problem , he put me straight on one point .
" It 's not dancing , " he said .
" That would be against Sharia - it 's a moving of the limbs . "
Then , " Come back at nine . "
Religious fervour
The men met in a poor suburb of Khartoum in a roughly built brick courtyard with no roof .
Standing in a circle they started to sing the names of Allah .
The half moon shone down , offering a gloomy light .
The houses in the area , with doors and windows open to relieve the heat , were packed tightly together .
As I looked into the men's faces I thought this here , right now in the late evening , in a small courtyard on the outskirts of Khartoum is why being a foreign correspondent is such a privilege
As the devotional chants floated through the homes , the prayer leader , resplendent in a gold - edged black robe and with a high white turban , made small hand movements to four drummers instructing them to quicken and slow the pace .
For an hour , the surging rhythms allowed pauses for breath and contemplation , but over time became faster and faster as the men , with some young boys squeezed in between , began to roll their heads from side to side .
And with ever more violent jerks - all the while chanting - they worked themselves into a state of near ecstasy .
Their faces filled with the joyous smiles of religious fervour and then some started dancing - or perhaps I should say moving their limbs - in the middle of the circle .
One tall man with a long white tunic and greying hair , his whole body shaking , moved around the circle of worshippers touching each one , while besides him a five - year - old boy mimicked his every move .
It was about as different to a Church of England service as you could ever imagine .
And as I looked into the men's faces I thought this here , right now in the late evening , in a small courtyard on the outskirts of Khartoum , is why being a foreign correspondent is such a privilege .
' Martyred Christian ' I had gone to Sudan to make a history programme .
I wanted to learn more about the man who fought the British in the 1880s - a boat builder 's son who declared that having received instructions from the Prophet Mohammed he was the Mahdi , or guided one .
He rapidly became the undisputed leader of , depending how you look at it , a religious revival intended to purify Islam or an anti-colonial struggle to expel foreign rulers .
Famously , it all culminated when thousands of the Mahdi's followers - the Mahdi army , to coin an Iraqi phrase - surged up to the governor 's palace in central Khartoum and beheaded the senior British officer there , General Gordon .
Winston Churchill was critical of the effects Islam had on its believers
It was a humiliating British defeat and the London press was quick to depict Gordon as a Christian knight martyred by Muslim savages .
Gordon 's death was eventually avenged when General Kitchener arrived in Khartoum with some gunboats and an overwhelming force and crushed the Mahdi 's followers .
There is a vivid account of that campaign because a young man who was there wrote a book about it all , it is called The River War and the author was Winston Churchill .
Churchill had some fairly strong views on Islam .
" No stronger retrograde force exists in the world .
Far from being moribund , Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith .
And were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science , the civilisation of modern Europe might fall . "
That was Churchill .
This is George Bush : " There are extreme elements that use religion to achieve objectives .
And they want us to leave .
And they want to topple government .
They want to extend an ideological caliphate that has no concept of liberty inherent in their beliefs . "
Enraged crowds
Try this .
Next time you see an article about the war on terror in the Western press replace the words " Muslim radical " or " Muslim extremist " with " Mohammedan fanatic " or " savage dervish " and you rather rapidly find yourself back in the 19th Century .
President Bashir said Sudan would not " kneel " to colonialists
My short stay in Khartoum working on the history programme was soon derailed .
Sudan became the world lead story when the International Criminal Court issued the country 's president with an arrest warrant for war crimes .
His response was defiant - " a new colonialism , " he called it - and , in the streets , as enraged crowds gathered at the site where Gordon had been beheaded , old sensitivities rose to the surface .
Once again , they complained , the West was seeing the Sudanese people as uncivilised savages .
The Mahdi took on Gordon .
President Bashir is taking on the ICC .
I wonder what General Gordon or Churchill would have thought if , 130 years ago , they had seen that Sufi sect singing and dancing .
Well , we have a pretty good idea about that .
One of the phrases Churchill used was " a degraded sensualism , depriving life of its grace and refinement . "
And in his diaries Gordon , a very devout Christian , had no doubt that the Mahdi and his men were overexcited natives hell - bent on destroying the civilised world .
Today the language has changed but , for many , on both sides - the basic ideas are much the same .

Continuing its productivity war on Apple , Microsoft , and everyone in between , Google on Monday enabled Exchange support for iPhone and Windows Mobile device owners .
This is in addition to Google 's existing tool for BlackBerry phones , but the company is also including contact sync support for other phones via the standard SyncML protocol .
Wrapped under the product umbrella of Google Sync , Gmail contacts and Google Calendar events can now be synchronized via over - the - air ( OTA ) push between Windows Mobile devices and both first - and second - generation iPhones ( note , however , that iPhone OS 2.2 is required ) .
Configuration for these devices is performed via their respective , built - in ActiveSync and Exchange configuration features , respectively , though Google Sync strangely does not support push e-mail for these devices yet .
Microsoft says that Google licensed the Exchange ActiveSync , and these features are available for free today for both general consumers and , for once , Google Apps users at the same time .
As is usual for the Internet giant , Google warns that Google Sync is in beta , so users are encouraged to check out Google 's list of known limitations for the iPhone and Windows Mobile .
As examples , the iPhone does not reflect attendee status for events , and syncing more than five calendars often results in all calendars being displayed in a bright yellow or cyan color on an iPhone ( Google says it is working with Apple to fix this problem ) .
Modifying a single instance of a recurring event on an iPhone can also result in duplicates , while Windows Mobile devices suffer their own hiccups when making changes to recurring events or meeting attendees .
Google also details its support for syncing contacts with other mobile devices that support SyncML .
In general , any device that supports the protocol should work , but Google officially supports devices running Nokia Symbian S60 2nd and 3rd edition ( such as the E - Series , 6120 / 6121 , N70 , and N90 ) , as well as " most " Sony Ericsson phones .
Free push service for contacts and calendar events is another major volley from Google against its competition .
Google enabled free IMAP in October 2007 while competitors like Yahoo and Microsoft are still putzing with POP3 , and Gmail Labs has brought a virtual landslide of new features since its introduction less than a year ago .
Google Calendar has also received a modest share of attention as it is one of the key components of Google Apps ' invasion efforts into Microsoft Office 's turf .
There is no doubt , however , that today 's announcement will leave Gmail and Apps users clamoring even more loudly for push support to come to Gmail as well .
At this point it is safe to assume that , after Gmail gained offline access , push mail is probably not far behind .

“ The Office ” is sagging and it is a conundrum to which there is only one real solution : fire Michael Scott .
Or Steve Carell .
Whatever it takes .
Early on , taking after Ricky Gervais ’ David Brent on the original British version of the show , Michael was a catalyst for misbehavior and ill will .
He was difficult , verging on unlovable ; you almost had to shield your eyes watching him , so great was his capacity for awkwardness .
But as the American version has aged , evolving beyond the structure of its predecessor , the expectation that Michael will occupy the same amount of space as he did during the show ’s earlier seasons , when his gaffes were more gratuitous , has become burdensome .
And exhausted too .
Carell can’t quite play him as the simp he once was :
His shoulders are slightly squarer , his hair slightly better , his uncertainty a little more certain .
It ’s as if the show no longer believes in the character ’s wacky potential .
Advertisement
Instead , in order to breathe new life into Michael , he has become something that was virtually impossible in earlier seasons , given the naive arrogance that motivated his behavior : sympathetic .
Many of the show ’s recent episodes have been dragged down by Michael ’s depression in the wake of his split with Holly Flax ( Amy Ryan ) .
Formerly incapable of seriousness , he ’s become something of a sad sack , ill - equipped to grapple with his pain .
Of course , no one around him is much inclined to help .
Scorn is central to most of the relationships that the show ’s other characters have with Michael , and little has happened to change that .
He ’s still incompetent , foolish and blinded by his inanity , but now he ’s needy too , an emotion that has no place here .
His impromptu lonely - hearts party a couple of weeks ago just felt tragic ; he never once subverted his own sadness , the trait of his that has long made his character distinctive , if grating .
Typically , the show has been able to rely on Jim ( John Krasinski ) and Dwight ( Rainn Wilson ) when Michael became unbearable , but both of those characters have also eroded of late .
Jim has become smug and self - satisfied -- not even his engagement to Pam ( Jenna Fischer ) redeems him .
Where his fourth - wall - breaking looks into the camera were once befuddled , now they ’re withering , making him less a hapless bystander and more a conspirator .
And as Dwight , Wilson has injected a confidence that has made the character less shocking .

Now , when he delivers his absurd pronunciations on his own potency , his eyebrows are raised just a bit , awaiting a response that his deadpan - ness used to trigger automatically .
To judge by the last couple of months , all three primary characters could go on an extended work retreat and do little damage to the show -- many of its recent high points have happened at the margins .
Dealing with a weak heart , Stanley ( Leslie David Baker ) has been more vibrant than ever .
“ I do n’t have enough saved to retire , ” he recently lamented .
“ I feel like I ’m working in my own casket . ”
The sexual radiance of Angela ( Angela Kinsey ) upon acquiring a new cat was brilliantly discomfiting , and the scene in which Oscar ( Oscar Nunez ) and Kevin ( Brian Baumgartner ) watched her , via webcam , as she cleaned her new prize pet with her tongue was one of the most inventive and shocking scenes on any sitcom in recent memory .
And the show ’s most constant love , between Phyllis ( Phyllis Smith ) and Bob Vance ( Robert R. Shafer ) , continues to provide small pleasures , such as when they abandoned Jim and Pam at lunch to have sex in a restaurant bathroom .
Jim and Pam were shocked , but they should have been taking notes .

Not all subplots have been successful .
The episode - long debate about Hilary Swank ’s hotness , and the gruesome film - within - the - show involving a love triangle among Jessica Alba , Jack Black and Cloris Leachman , both felt like stretched - out one - liners from “ Family Guy . ”
Occasionally , though , especially when all the characters get together in one room , the original sparks reemerge .
Last month , Michael struggled his way through a particularly vicious roast by his co-workers , but even as it got more and more cruel , it was hard to feel for him .
But at the end of the episode , when he gave them their comeuppance , it was unexpectedly gratifying , the rare moment where a Michael Scott victory was also just , plainly speaking , a victory .

From a lecture delivered by the late Michael Crichton at the California Institute of Technology on Jan. 17 , 2003 :
Cast your minds back to 1960 .
John F. Kennedy is president , commercial jet airplanes are just appearing , the biggest university mainframes have 12 K of memory .
And in Green Bank , West Virginia at the new National Radio Astronomy Observatory , a young astrophysicist named Frank Drake runs a two - week project called Ozma , to search for extraterrestrial signals .
A signal is received , to great excitement .
It turns out to be false , but the excitement remains .
In 1960 , Drake organizes the first SETI conference , and came up with the now - famous Drake equation :
N=N * fp ne fl fi fc fL
Where N is the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy ; fp is the fraction with planets ; ne is the number of planets per star capable of supporting life ; fl is the fraction of planets where life evolves ; fi is the fraction where intelligent life evolves ; and fc is the fraction that communicates ; and fL is the fraction of the planet 's life during which the communicating civilizations live .
This serious - looking equation gave SETI a serious footing as a legitimate intellectual inquiry .
The problem , of course , is that none of the terms can be known , and most cannot even be estimated .
The only way to work the equation is to fill in with guesses .
And guesses -- just so we 're clear -- are merely expressions of prejudice .
Nor can there be " informed guesses . "
If you need to state how many planets with life choose to communicate , there is simply no way to make an informed guess .
It 's simply prejudice .
James Kwak has the best idea I 've heard this week : solve the toxic asset problem by give those assets to bank executives as bonuses .
As Kwak writes :
Why not say that all bank compensation above a baseline amount - say , $ 150,000 in annual salary - has to be paid in toxic assets off the bank 's balance sheet ?
Instead of getting a check for $ 10,000 , the employee would get $ 10,000 in toxic assets , at their current book value .
. . .
That would get the assets off the bank 's balance sheet , and into the hands of the people responsible for putting them there - at the value that they insist they are worth . . . think about the incentives : talented people will flow to the companies that are valuing their assets the most realistically ( since inflated valuations translate directly into lower compensation ) , which will give companies the incentive to be realistic in their valuations .
Of course , there 's an argument that the executives ' base salary should be paid in toxic assets as well .
Since these fatcats do n't seem to be motivated to run their companies well so as to save the economy and the people , maybe having their own salaries on the line will motivate them .
But if you believe that is too harsh , at least demand that their bonuses be paid in this way .
Share this idea with your elected officials in Washington .

Among a glut of new works on the great naturalist , Philip Ball finds the claim that a hatred of slavery motivated his studies
It sounds glib to say that every age moulds Charles Darwin to its own preoccupations , but the temptation is hard to resist .
To the Victorians , he was an atheistic agitator undermining humankind 's privileged moral status .
In the early 20th century , he became a prophet of social engineering and the free market .
With sociobiology in the 1970s , Darwinism became a behavioural theory , while neo -Darwinist genetics prompted a bleak view of humanity as gene machines driven by the selfish imperatives of our DNA .
Now , 200 years after Darwin 's birth and 150 years after the publication of On the Origin of Species , Adrian Desmond and James Moore , whose doorstop 1991 biography seemed to leave nothing more to be said , offer a new vision of the architect of evolution by natural selection .
In Darwin 's Sacred Cause ( Allen Lane £ 25 ) , they say that Darwin 's work on the common ancestry of all living things was motivated not by abstract curiosity , but by a determination to show that African slaves have the same roots as their white masters .
They claim that the foundational text of modern biology was spurred by Darwin 's repugnance of the slave trade .
In this view , Darwin 's championing of the " brotherhood " of all men might even be considered one of the enabling factors in the election of a black man as US president .
There will no doubt be sneers at this " politically correct " Darwin , but it is hard to dispute Desmond and Moore 's contention that Darwin aimed to overturn the notion , conveniently adopted by slavers , that blacks and Europeans ( and other races ) were separate species .
Besides , there was little that was PC about Darwin : he concurred with the prevailing belief in the superiority of whites , and of men over women .
None the less , the Darwin who emerges from this meticulous analysis is profoundly humanitarian , despising slavery because he abhorred cruelty to any creature .
Others may be dismayed by the new portrait because it threatens to undermine the supposed " purity " of his quest .
If Darwin had sociopolitical reasons to insist on the unity of races , was he a reliable judge of the evidence ?
Certainly , the many - species view of humankind was not then as nonsensical as it now appears .
Data on the long - term fertility of progeny from cross-race unions was scant and often distorted .
The fossil record was still silent on human origins , and genomics was more than a century away .
Many of Darwin 's scientific contemporaries held reservations about the one - species picture , including Darwin 's friend Charles Lyell , the geologist who helped give geological time the reach that Darwinian evolution required .
But if Darwin had an agenda for his theory , this makes it all the more admirable that he did n't leap to conclusions ; he agonised over the data when others would have been content to paper over the cracks .
Desmond and Moore 's account does , all the same , highlight the extraordinary degree to which Darwin 's science has become encumbered by a cult of personality .
It 's as though evolution by natural selection still seems so challenging that we are forced back on to the man himself .
In Darwin 's Island ( Little , Brown £ 20 ) , a survey of his lesser - known works on such topics as insect - eating plants and earthworms , Steve Jones explains how mistaken the conventional narrative of Darwin 's life is .
His journey on the Beagle , lavishly documented in James Taylor 's The Voyage of the Beagle ( Conway £ 20 ) , contributed only modestly to his evolutionary theory - the Galápagos finches created " inexplicable confusion " rather than enlightenment - and his scientific journey was just beginning , not concluding , as the ship returned to Falmouth .
His theory of evolution did n't transform natural history at a stroke .
As Bill Price says in his primer , Charles Darwin : Origins and Arguments ( Pocket Essentials £ 9.99 ) , its first brief airing at the Linnaean Society in 1858 , alongside the parallel hypothesis of Alfred Russel Wallace , excited barely a ripple .
Neither did it immediately mobilise the church in opposition .
After all , evolution - the mutability of organisms - was an old idea .
As Jones neatly puts it , Darwinian evolution is a kind of engineering : " Natural selection is a factory that makes almost impossible things . "
It shows how to design without a designer and requires two elements : random variation and a means of selecting the " best " outcomes .
The latter - selective pressure , as biologists call it - comes from the competition for limited resources , an idea inspired by the Malthusian view of population growth .
Darwin came to believe that a key aspect of this filtering lay not in who could run fastest , but who got the most sex .
He had no qualms about extending this sexual selection hypothesis beyond the peacocks ' clumsy yet dazzling tails to the question of adornment and beauty in human populations , giving him a nascent theory of aesthetics .
Wallace , who Darwin came to see more as hindrance than ally , never accepted this idea ; he considered animal displays to be primarily forms of camouflage or warning .
Indeed , while a new collection of Wallace 's works , Natural Selection and Beyond ( OUP £ 30 ) , makes a brave attempt to redeem his also - ran reputation , he emerges as something of a well - meaning gadfly , prone to the mysticism and spiritualism of his age .
Darwin himself could not explain the other ingredient of his theory : how attributes vary in a population .
But genomics now does so in terms of the random mutations that occur in copying and combining DNA between generations .
The resulting blend of Darwinism and genetics , called the modern synthesis , offers so apparently beautiful a means of generating biological complexity from simple origins that until very recently it blinded biologists to just how complicated , subtle and messy the transmission of our genes is .
Where much of the problems lay , and still lie , however , was in the concept of the " best " outcome .
Even Darwin struggled with that .
To biologist Ernst Haeckel , his champion in Germany , it implied an almost mystical path towards some pre-existing ideal form , invoking notions of racial perfection that were later blended into Nazism .
Herbert Spencer , who coined the misleading term " survival of the fittest " , saw implications for society , and soon enough class - based hierarchies and oligarchies were considered the " natural " state of affairs .
Darwin's cousin Francis Galton took that further , arguing that efforts to care for " the imbecile , the maimed and the sick " hindered the weeding process that maintains society 's vitality .
Galton 's eugenics were promoted by Darwinists such as Julian Huxley , grandson of Darwin 's bullish supporter Thomas Henry Huxley .
Churchill was another enthusiast , drafting what became the 1913 Mental Deficiency
Act which aimed to prevent " mental defectives " from having children .
It is often said that Darwin cannot be held accountable for these excesses , but their seeds are obvious in his works , most notably The Descent of Man ( 1871 ) , in which he finally explained what his evolutionary theory meant for humankind .
The book echoes the concerns of Galton and others about overbreeding in " the reckless , degraded and often vicious members of society " , such as the " squalid , unaspiring Irishman " who " multiplies like rabbits " .
There is a clear natural order of class , rank and race and only Darwin 's insistence on a moral duty to help the weak partly redeems him .
All this , and not least Darwin 's provocative talk of " favoured races in the struggle for life " , seems now to be a residue not only of the chauvinism of the times but of a reluctance to abandon belief in abstract " fitness peaks " that natural selection seeks to scale .
In fact , evolution can have no targets ; races and species cannot be " perfected " .
That was one of the main objections to Darwinism , for it seemed to knock Homo sapiens off our pinnacle .
We have yet to come to terms with our ( highly successful ) occupation of a evolutionary niche , rather than embodying a supreme destination .
Darwin was equally troubled at how descent from non-humans left God no opportunity to invest us with morality .
Evolutionary psychology and game theory now offer accounts , persuasive to varying degrees , of how morality itself is a product of natural selection .
If a principled stance on slavery did motivate Darwin 's theory , it would be a curiously inapt stimulus , however noble .
The separate - species line peddled by slave - trade apologists needed debunking , but it seems highly unlikely that a failure to do so would have altered Darwin 's humane convictions on the matter .
Likewise , no one would relinquish slavery for that reason - it took a civil war , not a book .
That the pro- and anti- camps divided very much along traditional lines -
Whig versus
Tory , progressive versus reactionary - indicates that science was never really the issue .
All of which is a timely reminder , in these times of creationism , fundamentalism and climate - change denial , of a truth that scientists continually have to struggle with : in human affairs , battles are rarely won by evidence and logic .

Glaxo , the world 's second biggest drugs company behind Pfizer , employs about 100,000 people and , although yet to be confirmed , a proportion of the cuts are almost certain to be among its 18,000 staff at sites across the UK , which would strike another blow to the battered economy .
But over the last six months it has become clear that reform is running into the sand .
The reason is the obstruction of the newly renamed Department for Education and Standards .
In meeting after meeting , senior officials have presented policy solutions that reinforce the status quo rather than offer radical change .
It is 2012 .
The Conservative Party has won the 2010 election with a majority of 16 .
As promised , education reform is the priority and the great hope of the new government .
ConservativeHome readers are pinning their hopes on the creation of a wave of new schools and measures to reintroduce rigour and independence to qualifications .
The measures in the “ 2010 Civil Service Reform Act ” described below are exactly those put forward in the Reform report today .
This is not to say that Whitehall alone can solve the UK ’s social and economic problems ( far from it ) .
But it is to say that any successful reforming Government will need to tackle Whitehall reform head - on and first up .
Here are two visions of 2012 which I hope will provoke you to read the report and decide just how important Whitehall reform is for the next Government – Conservative , renewed Labour , or indeed coalition .
Andrew Haldenby is director of the think - tank Reform and co-author of Fit for Purpose , its new report on civil service reform , which is being published today .
Michael Gove and Nick Gibb have done all that they can , to the extent of lobbying the Permanent Secretary to move one senior official to a different post .
But it has not been enough .
Ministers have been tactfully told that the employment of civil servants is not their responsibility , and that in any case the disciplinary process for handling poor performance takes at least two years .
Because poor performers ca n’t be moved , good performers ca n’t be moved into their jobs .
The time for reform is running out .
****
It is 2012 .
One of the first actions of the incoming Cameron Government was to form a cross party alliance on civil service reform .
Conservative and Labour politicians realised that their experience in government had been the same – initial confidence that their electoral mandate would be enough to make a difference , followed by a dawning realisation that the government machine was not as competent as it needed to be .
As a result the Cameron Government passed – with Opposition support – the 2010 Civil Service Reform Act .
This abolished the doctrine of Ministerial responsibility .
Ministers were no longer responsible for everything that happened in their department , only for its strategic direction and the communication of policy .
Ministers became able to appoint senior civil servants ( with some positions , such as management of finance , protected from political control ) .
Within departments , civil servants became personally responsible for their own performance , for the money that they spend and for the recruitment of their teams .
Michael Gove and Nick Gibb were able to crack on .
In a series of open decisions , they moved certain senior officials and replaced them in some cases with other officials and in others with external appointments .
An explicit sense of accountability led to a further shakeout in the junior ranks .
As a result the first New Conservative Academy had opened in September 2011 with dozens more in the pipeline .
Children would take a new range of rigorous qualifications in June 2012 .
The logjam preventing education reform had been broken .
****
Conservatives should realise the degree of support among Labour Ministers and former Ministers for civil service reform .
David Blunkett has spoken of the government machine as a series of “ rubber levers ” – Ministers pull them and nothing happens .
Liam Byrne launched a new consultation on civil service reform two weeks ago and appeared at the launch of the Reform report yesterday .
He argued , for example , that internal appointments to civil service positions should be the exception rather than the rule .
None of this implies that all officials are incompetent or obstructive .
During this research we have spoken to excellent officials who are the model of what civil servants should be : acutely conscious of costs to the taxpayer and keen to be personally accountable for performance .
But they do this despite the structure of the civil service , not because of it .
Where are the Conservatives now ?
In the early days of Opposition the Party was strongly against “ politicisation ” of the civil service , for example with a larger number of special advisers .
That approach was wrong .
Actually , Ministers do need to be able to hire and fire senior officials , on the model of Australia or France .
But more importantly , the civil service is already politicised , albeit in a hidden and unsatisfactory way .
Ministers can and do agree with Permanent Secretaries to get officials moved .
Permanent Secretaries do seek to advance Ministers ’ political careers .
What is needed is to replace this imperfect politicisation with a transparent system that makes explicit the different responsibilities of senior civil servants and Ministers .
Three weeks ago , Francis Maude , Philip Hammond and George Osborne launched a consultation on civil service reform which proposed increasing the importance of the finance function within departments and giving all officials the duty to achieve value for money .
These ideas are right but would not in themselves achieve the radical change of culture that is necessary .
Welcoming the Reform report yesterday , David Blunkett said that civil service reform is a cross-party issue :
“ The issue of civil service reform is a critical one and I very much welcome the report .
I am pleased that Reform is engaging all three main parties and addressing this issue head - on .
Tony Blair once said that what is important is ‘ Delivery ’ , ‘ delivery , ‘ delivery ’ .
I hope that , working across party lines , we can now take this particular bull by the horns and challenge the status quo . ”
I hope ConservativeHome readers take up these ideas in that spirit .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel is preventing the Western - backed Palestinian Authority from transferring cash to the Gaza Strip to pay its workers and others hard - hit by war , Western and Palestinian officials said on Wednesday .
The restrictions threatened to undercut the ability of President Mahmoud Abbas ’s West Bank - based government to reassert a presence in the Hamas - ruled territory after Israel ’s 22 - day offensive , said the officials , who asked not to be identified .
The cash restrictions also underscored the wider hurdles facing reconstruction , estimated to cost more than $ 2 billion , in the Gaza Strip , where 1.5 million Palestinians live .
Israel has told the United Nations and other aid groups planning for the rebuilding they must apply for project - by - project Israeli approval and provide guarantees none of the work will benefit Hamas .
Israel had no immediate comment on why the Palestinian Authority ’s post - war cash shipments were being blocked .
The restrictions were put in place long before fighting broke out on December 27 , with Israel arguing that Gaza had enough cash in circulation and that some of the money could end up with Hamas .
Middle East envoy Tony Blair , the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank countered that the restrictions were crippling Gaza ’s economy and undermining the Palestinian Authority , which adopted anti-money laundering rules to prevent any of the money from going to Hamas and other groups .
It is unclear how Gaza ’s reconstruction will be handled .
“ It ’s a Pandora ’s box , ” one senior diplomat said , citing the restrictions imposed by Israel and the international community .
Western powers consider Hamas a “ terrorist ” organization and refuse to transfer money directly to the group or its government in the Gaza Strip .
But the Palestinian Authority has had little presence in the coastal territory since Hamas routed Abbas ’s secular Fatah faction and seized control in June 2007 .
Reconstruction largely hinges on convincing Israel to lift restrictions on imports of cash and building materials , like steel and cement .
Israel has long argued that such imports can be used by the Islamist group to rearm .
“ The Gaza Strip was almost destroyed and it needs everything , ” said Nabil al - Zaeem , head of the Palestinian Commercial Service Co. , one of Gaza ’s largest cement importers .
He said rebuilding will not happen “ if things did not change regarding the flow of cement and other construction materials . ”
CASH REQUEST
Abbas ’s government , headed by Prime Minister Salam Fayyad , has asked Israel for permission to send more than $ 80 million to the Gaza Strip .
That includes 243 million Israeli shekels ( $ 62 million ) , the tender used in the Palestinian territories .
The shipment would cover salary payments to some 77,000 Palestinian Authority workers in Gaza who report to Fayyad , as well as pension and welfare payments for retirees and the poor .
Much of the money comes from the European Union .
Of the money requested , Western officials said Israel has so far allowed in only some $ 10 million for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) .
Several of the agency ’s facilities in the Gaza Strip were bombed by Israel during the fighting .
“ So far we have n’t seen any change in the approach of the Israeli authorities .
But the needs are much more dire now , ” Palestine Monetary Authority Governor Jihad Wazir told Reuters .
Alix de Mauny , a spokeswoman for the European Commission office for the West Bank and Gaza Strip , confirmed that Israel has yet to allow the transfer of the cash to the Gaza Strip .
“ Recovery and reconstruction of Gaza will be deeply hampered without the opening of the crossings to humanitarian and commercial goods , as well as cash , ” she said .
It was only his third day on the job , but Dave could tell it was going to be a long one .
His fear had come true ; what should 've been an easy fix ( capture an extra data field ) was going to involve him debugging a long regular expression that had no comments revealing its pattern .
Its arcane characters may as well have been heiroglyphics , and as regular expressions often do , it looked as though someone had held down shift while randomly mashing the number keys .
Worse still , there were recursive methods used to parse these expressions .
If you added in linked lists you 'd have a CS101 student 's personal hell .
" I mean , it 's not that regular expressions are bad , " he explained to a colleague , " it 's just that they 're ridiculously hard to interpret when they get to have so many groups and submatches and whatnot . "
His colleauge Matt stared back blankly , unblinking .
" It used to be worse . "
Scrapes and Bruises
The utility was more or less a web scraper , but it also needed the ability to automatically post form input to access certain pages .
This was handled by three steps :
Fetch the pages
This step took an XML - serialized query ( not just the page URLs , but any POST data , custom headers , cookies , etc. ) .
The query was transformed to a list of pages via XSLT .
Some page requests had custom logic or their own set of regular expressions for some mysterious reason .
Send the request , format the response
The response would be formatted into XML via a clowder of regular expressions , which is where Dave had gotten tripped up in the first place .
Thanks to heaps of cyclic data structures , this is the step that would occasionally take down the web site if it hit the right combination of characters that it would recurse infinitely in parsing .
Who knew VB6 would happily gobble up over two gigabytes of RAM ?
Well , Dave , now .
Re-write the response XML file
The response generated in step two would be converted to one of two XML representations via XSLT .
These two formats were neither documented nor verified .
The XSLT templates were version controlled , but the regular expressions only existed in the wild , untamed database .
In production .
Thanks to a ridiculously convoluted configuration , no one was able to set up a reasonable test version .
The team had just learned to accept that making changes to the regular expressions meant trying a change and then tweaking it like crazy until production was n't broken anymore .
And Again
Dave threw his hands up in the air and sighed .
He went to Matt to complain again .
Matt tried to be reassuring .
" It used to be worse . "
Turns out that the system used to be built from just two XSLT templates , each over forty thousand lines long .
In those dark times , the interface to maintain the regular expressions was an email to the manager with the updated expression .
There was n't even an attempt at an environment other than production .
Naming conventions were ... unconventional .
Duplicate variables that apparently held the same values were scattered throughout the code ; variables like " numPersons , " " peopleCount , " and " totalPeople . "
Some functions were designed with arguments passed in as a space - delimited string ( for example , doSomething ( " 0 0 0 " ) rather than doSomething ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) ) .
Also worth noting is that doSomething ( yes , that was the actual function name ) was actually one of the core functions of the system .
Apparently the developer could n't decide on a good name for the function and gave up .
Functions that performed the same function were duplicated , though they used different algorithms to accomplish their goals .
There were at least four functions that would return an upper case string : " uc , " " getUpperCase , " " touppercase , " and " uppercase . "
I 'm sure if he dug enough Dave would 've found upperCaseIt .
Dave could barely believe it , but Matt 's explanation made him feel better .
At least he did n't have to manage that godawful version .
Matt smirked .
" But even before that ... it used to be worse . "
Matt went on to describe the first version of the software , which had been written by the CEO .
In Excel .
I 'll spare you the details .
Improving It
Months later , Dave had grown accustomed to the insanity , and had even managed to make some positive change in the application .
It was still something to be ashamed of , of course , but much of the redundancy , duplicate functions , functions designed to handle tasks that are built - in to the language was eliminated .
They even had a generally - working version in test .
Still , the design was a little crazy , the XSLT templates complex , and the regular expressions mostly undocumented .
A new developer came to Dave to vent his frustrations .
Dave smiled .
" Well Jim , it used to be worse ... "
In September 2004 , French police discovered a hidden chamber in the catacombs under Paris .
It contained a full - sized movie screen , projection equipment , a bar , a pressure cooker for making couscous , a professionally installed electricity system , and at least three phone lines .
Movies ranged from 1950s noir classics to recent thrillers .
When the police returned three days later , the phone and power lines had been cut and there was a note on the floor : “ Do not try to find us . ”

CAIRO – Hamas negotiators left Egypt without a long - term cease - fire with Israel yesterday – but not before members of the group ’s delegation were stopped at the Gaza border carrying millions of dollars in cash stuffed into their suitcases .
The delegation walked away from the cease - fire talks because of disagreements over the blockade against Gaza and border security .
Talks will continue at a later date .
An Egyptian security official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the group initially refused to be searched by Egyptian authorities at the Rafah border crossing .
When the group relented , authorities found $ 7 million and 2 million euros ( $ 2.5 million ) in cash in their suitcases .
But another security official , also speaking on condition of anonymity , said $ 9 million and 2 million euros were found .
The money was later deposited in an account in Egypt by one of the Hamas members , senior negotiator Ayman Taha .
He later told al Jazeera TV the bills represented “ donations to the Palestinian people , ” and he insisted Hamas will be able to get the cash back .
The incident is a sensitive one for Egypt , particularly now , when Israel is demanding a halt to Hamas smuggling into Gaza .
Also yesterday , the Israeli navy intercepted a ship carrying humanitarian supplies from Lebanon to the Gaza Strip and towed the vessel into port , foiling a new attempt by international activists to break Israel ’s blockade of the Palestinian territory .
It was the first time Israeli forces seized an aid ship , after the navy let some boats in and turned others around .

If you 're the type of person who can motivate them to get together , this seems like a prime opportunity for new studios , new indies , and new ideas about the shape of the industry .
If you 've always dreamed of implementing the Hollywood model , bringing the right person to the right project and then moving on , this is a good time for it .
If you want to invoke the spirit of the bedroom programmer now that tools are getting to where that 's actually viable without being a hardcore programmer / artist / designer hybrid , this is a good time for it .
If you want to venture out and create your own IP , or revisit a lost genre , this is a good time for it .
It might not be the best time to create a multi-million dollar epic , unless you 're one of the big publishers -- but even then it 's a bit riskier than usual .
Games In A Recession
Games are n't going to go away during this recession .
During the Great Depression , the legend goes that entertainment was the major industry that flourished .
Books , movies , and condoms were among the best selling " non-essential " products .
These all facilitated escapism from the poverty around them , without weighty consequences .
While we 're not quite at the depression level , games are an effective and appealing method of escapism in the best of times , and in times of trouble are even more enticing .
Of course it 's rather difficult to do any of this if you have n't got a little bit of a nest egg to tide you over until you can release a game , or at least get funding .
Some have said that the venture capital money has all dried up , but I do n't think it 's necessarily gone .
Rather I think it 's being hidden , Great Depression - style , under the proverbial mattresses .
Games are still a good industry .
People do n't want to stop playing video games -- but they might want to start paying less for them .
If you can convince people with money that a smaller investment in a fledgling company making smaller games is a wise one , then you may be in business .
The Beginning Of An Era ?
It 's very possible that this recession could usher in the next age of the indie .
Smaller , less expensive games made by smaller , more agile teams seem like a very logical step , now that the industry structure is better able to support it , with no less than three venues on which to distribute content as a small team .
These are downloadable console , direct to consumer PC downloads via Steam - like services , portals , or direct sale , and iPhone and potentially DSi downloads .
Consumers have shown that they 're willing to buy games like Castle Crashers in droves .
Indie developers have asked me on more than one occasion how to promote their products to the press without a big budget , or without a budget at all .
It can seem daunting , but actually it 's quite simple .
Promoting Your Productions
What works for me , and for many other members of the press I 've spoken to about the issue , is targeted personal emails .
It does n't cost anything more than time .
Target the bigger blogs first , reading to see who writes about indies and in what context .
See what they like and do n't like , and choose a writer to contact .
Send them an email explaining who you are , where you 're coming from , what your game is about , and what you 're trying to achieve .
If you 've got some nice production art to show , a snappy title , a YouTube video , or a playable demo , so much the better .
Do n't treat your game like it 's the next big thing , or the most awesome Tower Defense clone ever , even if it may be .
Be straightforward , humble , and realistic , and people will pay attention if your game seems interesting .
I 'm hopeful that this recession will bring about a bit of an industry shakeup .
It 's up to the folks networking at this coming GDC and similar events .
I would urge you to not think along the same old lines as before and simply join an existing studio , or create a new traditionally structured team .
This is a great time to experiment and try out new ideas , if you 're the type who has them .
If it does n't work out , at least you wo n't have been idle by the time you have to take your next job in the trenches !
The International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) announced on Tuesday that the international Cassini spacecraft had found another moon around Saturn , this one measuring a little over a third of a mile in width .
The tiny body was orbiting the giant planet in between some of the dust rings , and was therefore impossible to notice until then .
The G ring in particular is home to the new natural satellite , which has yet to be named .
This find emphasizes again the importance that Cassini has in both studying the planet and some of its more interesting moons , such as Enceladus and Titan , which hold frozen water under the crust and methane lakes on top , respectively .
“ Before Cassini , the G ring was the only dusty ring that was not clearly associated with a known moon , which made it odd .
The discovery of this moonlet , together with other Cassini data , should help us make sense of this previously mysterious ring , ” Cassini imaging team member astronomer Matthew Hedman , based at the Cornell University , shared .
He made the statement in writing .
The discovery of the moon is not new .
It was first identified on Cassini 's telemetry pictures more than 6 months ago , but astronomers have thus far not yet been able to determine its exact size .
Even now , that proves to be harder than the scientists first thought .
They have managed to get the estimative reading by comparing it with another very small Saturnine moon called Pallene .
This comparison has yielded the approximate size measurements .
The Cassini team says that it has been impossible for the spacecraft to take detailed measurements of the object because of its very small size .
The new moon presents no large scientific importance for the study of the planet , but it helps explain some of the oddities that have so far characterized the gas giant , including the fact that the G ring has had no moon .
According to some theories , the rings around Saturn formed from icy debris that were expelled from the surface when a comet or meteor hit , or which failed to be drawn to it when the planet first formed .
Regardless of how they were born , discoveries have thus far shown that all have been “ endowed ” with a moon .
The G ring was different , and therefore required scientists to come up with a different theory , in order to explain the mystery .
Now , it seems that it has been resolved .
Magicians have long created the illusion of levitating objects in the air .
Now researchers have actually levitated an object , suspending it without the need for external support .
Working at the molecular level , the researchers relied on the tendency of certain combinations of molecules to repel each other at close contact , effectively suspending one surface above another by a microscopic distance .
Researchers from Harvard University and the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) have measured , for the first time , a repulsive quantum mechanical force that could be harnessed and tailored for a wide range of new nanotechnology applications .
The study , led by Federico Capasso , Robert L. Wallace Professor of Applied Physics at Harvard 's School of Engineering and Applied Science ( SEAS ) , will be published as the January 8 cover story of Nature .
The discovery builds on previous work related to what is called the Casimir force .
While long considered only of theoretical interest , physicists discovered that this attractive force , caused by quantum fluctuations of the energy associated with Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle , becomes significant when the space between two metallic surfaces , such as two mirrors facing one another , measures less than about 100 nanometers .
" When two surfaces of the same material , such as gold , are separated by vacuum , air , or a fluid , the resulting force is always attractive , " explained Capasso .
Remarkably , but in keeping with quantum theory , when the scientists replaced one of the two metallic surfaces immersed in a fluid with one made of silica , the force between them switched from attractive to repulsive .
As a result , for the first time , Capasso and his colleagues measured what they have deemed a repulsive Casimir .
To measure the repulsive force , the team immersed a gold coated microsphere attached to a mechanical cantilever in a liquid ( bromobenzene ) and measured its deflection as the distance from a nearby silica plate was varied .
" Repulsive Casimir forces are of great interest since they can be used in new ultra- sensitive force and torque sensors to levitate an object immersed in a fluid at nanometric distances above a surface .
Further , these objects are free to rotate or translate relative to each other with minimal static friction because their surfaces never come into direct contact , " said Capasso .
By contrast , attractive Casimir forces can limit the ultimate miniaturization of small - scale devices known as Micro Electromechanical Systems ( MEMS ) , a technology widely used to trigger the release of airbags in cars , as the attractive forces may push together moving parts and render them inoperable , an effect known as stiction .
Potential applications of the team 's finding include the development of nanoscale - bearings based on quantum levitation suitable for situations when ultra- low static friction among micro- or nano - fabricated mechanical parts is necessary .
Specifically , the researchers envision new types of nanoscale compasses , accelerometers , and gyroscopes .
Capasso's coauthors are Jeremy Munday , formerly a graduate student in Harvard 's Department of Physics and presently a postdoctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology , and Dr. V. Adrian Parsegian , Senior Investigator at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Maryland .
The Harvard researchers have filed for a U.S. patent covering nanodevices based on quantum levitation .
The authors acknowledge the support of the Center for Nanoscale Systems at Harvard University , a member of the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network ; the National Science Foundation ; the Intramural Research Program of the NIH ; and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .
Lenovo's IdeaPad series of notebooks is quite different than the company 's popular line up of ThinkPads .
Ideapads are currently available in three series of products .
The " U " series designates an ultraportable style with 11.1 " or 13.3 " widescreen displays and Intel Core 2 Duo processors .
The " Y " series is for family entertainment and is available with up to a 17 " screen and Intel 2.8 GHz Core 2 duo processors .
And finally , there is the super mobile " S " series netbook with its Intel Atom 1.6GHz processor and 10.2 " display .
Within the " U " and " Y " series there are a lot of models to choose from .
The Lenovo IdeaPad lines differ quite a bit from the Thinkpads we have reviewed in the past , such as the Lenovo Thinkpad W700 Mobile Workstation or the Lenovo ThinkPad X200 Ultraportable Notebook as you 'll see in the pages ahead .
In this article , we 'll be showcasing the Ideapad Y530 specifically , which offers a competitive array of features at a reasonable price point .
With multimedia capabilities being a focus these days , we thought this model would more than cover the bases with its generous yet rather portable 15.4 " display and Intel Core 2 Duo processor packed inside .

The paperless office is a great notion , but in reality there are still many scenarios where the printer needs to be switched on and fed with environmentally unfriendly consumables - paper and ink .
Recycling and re-using paper for print jobs has become well entrenched , but the expensive and often frustrating process of replenishing the ink remains an issue for many of us .
Which brings us to one of the cleverest recycling ideas to emerge from this year 's Greener Gadgets competition - the RITI printer .
This design concept by Jeon Hwan
Ju takes your coffee or tea dregs , plus a little elbow grease , and turns them into an eco-friendly alternative to conventional ink .
To use the RITI you place the coffee or tea dregs into the ink cartridge with some water , insert a piece of paper ( 100 % recycled we hope ) and move the cartridge backwards and forwards in the slot while drawing on the paper .
Using your own kinetic energy to power the process also means no electricity is needed , and you have all that coffee induced energy to burn anyway .
Once complete you empty the cartridge , meaning your coffee leftovers can continue their journey to the compost bin .
It might not be a the solution for full color print jobs , but its an ingenious recycling idea , and one we'd love to see make it to market ... plus your print outs would carry a faint aroma of your favorite blend !
Voting to decide the top 10 entries into the Greener Gadgets Competition is open until 20th February .
Police Listed Gay Rights Group Among Terrorists
Equality Maryland , the state 's largest gay rights group , was among the peaceful protest groups to be classified as terrorists in a Maryland State Police database .
The group was designated a " security threat " by the Homeland Security and Intelligence Division , which also kept dossiers on dozens of activists and at least a dozen groups .
Police kept files on Equality Maryland 's plans to hold rallies outside the State House in Annapolis to press for legislation reversing the state 's ban on same - sex marriage .
They plan to purge the files .
See the documents by using these links :

The files were revealed yesterday at a press conference , where a dozen Democratic lawmakers announced plans to introduce legislation to prevent future surveillance of non-violent groups .
Police would need " reasonable articulated suspicion of actual criminal activity , " before they can conduct surveillance , said the legislation 's sponsors .
Gov. Martin O'Malley ( D ) also plans to call for a similar bill .
The measure also would prevent police from keeping files on citizens , unless the information is part of a legitimate criminal investigation .

It 's not like Hitachi Displays really needs any bad news considering just how poorly LCD sales are going right now , but regardless of that , it 's still facing a fine that none of us would be fond of facing .
The Japanese electronics manufacturer has just agreed ( begrudgingly we 're sure ) to pay a staggering $ 31 million fine for its role in a conspiracy to fix prices in the sale of TFT - LCD panels sold to Dell , Inc .
The United States Department of Justice made the proclamation , and details show that Hitachi has plead guilty to a one - count felony .
The charge , which was filed in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco , blames Hitachi Displays Ltd. , a subsidiary of Hitachi Ltd. , with " participating in a conspiracy to fix the prices of TFT - LCD sold to Dell for use in desktop monitors and notebook computers fromthroughaccording to the plea agreement -- which is subject to court approval -- Hitachi Displays has agreed to cooperate with the Department 's ongoing antitrust investigation .
If you 're thinking this all sounds familiar , you 'd be correct .
Hitachi is disgracefully joining three other multinational companies who have " admitted to their involvement in fixing prices for LCD panels sold to U.S. companies and that have already paid criminal fines totaling more than $ 585 million , " in the words of , Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department 's Antitrust Division .
We tend to agree with his thoughts that this case should sent a stiff message to companies even considering pulling this trick while doing business in the United States of America .
Participating in bilateral meetings , conversations and communications in , Korea andto discuss the prices of TFT - LCD to be sold to Dell ;
Agreeing , during those bilateral meetings , conversations and communications , to charge prices of TFT - LCD to be sold to Dell at certain predetermined levels ;
Issuing price quotations in accordance with the agreements reached ; and
Exchanging information on sales of TFT - LCD sold to Dell , for the purpose of monitoring and enforcing adherence to the agreed - upon prices .
This is the fourth plea agreement by a company charged with participating in conspiracies to fix the prices for TFT - LCD .
On Dec. 15 , 2008 , LG Display Co. ( LG ) pleaded guilty to participating in a worldwide conspiracy to fix the price for TFT - LCD and was sentenced to pay a $ 400 million criminal fine -- the second - largest fine in Antitrust Division history .
On Dec. 16 , 2008 , Sharp Corp. pleaded guilty to participating in three separate conspiracies to fix the prices of TFT - LCD sold to Dell , Apple Computer Inc. and Motorola Inc. and was sentenced to pay a $ 120 million Jan. 14 , 2009 , Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. ( Chunghwa ) pleaded guilty to participating in the same worldwide conspiracy as LG , and was sentenced to pay a $ 65 million criminal fine .

Lin was sentenced to serve nine months in prison and pay a $ 50,000 criminal fine .
Liu was sentenced to serve seven months in prison and pay a $ 30,000 criminal fine .
Lee was sentenced to serve six months in prison and pay a $ 20,000 criminal fine .

( CNN ) -- Americans are watching more video online , on their cell phones and on television , according to the Nielsen Company 's latest " three screen " report .
Viewers are watching more television on more kinds of screens than ever .
The report , issued Monday and covering the last three months of 2008 , shows that the average American television viewer is watching more than 151 hours of television per month -- an " all - time " high -- up from more than 145 hours during the same period the previous year , Nielsen said .
The increase in television watching is part of a long - term trend , said Nielsen spokesman Gary Holmes .
He attributed the rise to a greater availability of televisions -- the average household has more televisions than people , he said -- and to niche programming .
There are " many , many more cable channels than before , " he said .
Read the full report ( PDF )
Also contributing to the increase are digital recorders , DVR and TiVo devices , which allow viewers to watch programs at their leisure rather than during the show 's slated time slots .
Nielsen has dubbed such viewing " timeshifted TV . "
" DVR has helped keep television alive and well , " said Robert Thompson , the founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University .
" That 's made a lot of people watch more television than they used to , " he said .
The use of recorders has risen by about 20,000 people from the fourth quarter in 2007 .
In the fourth quarter of 2008 , about 73.9 million people used them , Nielsen said .
Viewership of videos on the Internet and on mobile phones also increased from the summer months , Nielsen said , although the rise was more modest .
People who watch video on the Internet spend about three hours doing so per month , and those who watch video on mobile devices spend nearly four hours per month that way .
The presidential election likely helped augment viewership , Thompson said .
The " new series of this year was ' The Barack Obama Show , ' " he quipped .
The tanking economy may also have played a role in the uptick in television watching , as Americans looked for low - cost ways to entertain themselves , some analysts said .
Americans are staying at home instead of going out , and they 're also taking fewer vacations , said David Schick , an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus , an investment banking firm .
And while Thompson and James Webster , a communication professor at Northwestern University , say the state of the economy certainly is n't going to hurt television viewership , both experts emphasized that the increased viewership trend is several years old .
They also cautioned against reading too much into the Nielsen statistics .
Though Nielsen reports Americans are watching five hours of television a day , Webster noted that Nielsen has no means of determining if they are paying close attention to the programs or if they just have them on in the background .
People may have the television on while they are doing other things , Thompson added .

Awesome amount of new stuff !
I 'm finding param knobs on TCP great not only for frequency & gain on ReaEQ instances , but also for viewing params from JS MIDI_Examiner to see velocities of notes as I play them .
This will be really useful !
Wow @ ReaControlMIDI for making CC envelopes ( instead of CC data inside MIDI items ) .
Stunning stuff - automating pitch , resonance , cutoff , modulation all at once and tweaking envelopes or using param modulation is such powerful functionality !
Feels like that window should be in I / O so you can get it direct from a TCP button rather than finding it in the chain as a plugin but maybe I 'm alone in thinking so !
A couple of things :
The param window is certainly useful for selecting a bunch of knobs at once , but it 's not always obvious by some parameter list names which control is which - especially on more elaborate VSTis .
Maybe there could be a button to " auto add knob for next touched parameter " in the fx window itself so you can touch the specific control in the original interface , which is surely the easiest place to see what you want to select ?

Set to start in just a few days time , the trial of The Pirate Bay will be one of the most important cases the file - sharing community has ever witnessed .
However , due to restrictions , the number of people viewing it first hand could be very limited indeed .
" Time to make demands , " says Peter Sunde .
On February 16th 2009 , one of the biggest trials in P2P history begins .
The case of the largest BitTorrent tracker , The Pirate Bay , will be followed by millions around the world .
The Pirate Bay team have been preparing for the media battle , in part by designating their tour bus as the site ’s official media center .
But already there are complaints about how accessible the trial will be to the public , with TiAMO and Brokep demanding changes to how it will be made available .
In true Pirate Bay style , they want everyone to have access , one way or another .
According to Pirate Bay co-founder Fredrik Neij ( aka TiAMO ) the case will be heard in room 9 of Stockholm ’s District Court .
This room has space for maximum 35 - 40 people to view the case .
At least 20 of these seats will be reserved for the press and , you can bet , these will be taken up by the mainstream press , many of which are unsympathetic to the site ’s cause , a point not lost on Peter Sunde , aka Brokep .
“ Traditional media is 90 % owned by the opposition in this case and that is something that really must be taken into account , ” he notes .
The court will provide another area which will have the trial ’s audio fed in .
“ There will be a room where you can hear the sound from the trial , ” says TiAMO , “ this room can hold 20 - 25 people , ” but the space allocated just is n’t enough .
“ So this does not work , ” says TiAMO .
“ I want a request for real premises immediately so they have time to fix the problem . ”
He ’s very unhappy at the space allocated , noting that the case is one of the biggest political cases in recent times and since there are four people on trial , there is n’t even enough space for their family members to be present .
“ I NEED a room for at least 150 people , 20 reserved for the family and 80 to 100 reserved for the press and public .
It need not be in the same room , but we need several rooms REQUIRING video too , not just sound , ” he demands .
Brokep says that in addition to the seats held back for the traditional press , he is set to demand that the court reserves seats for bloggers too .
As the discussions continue over the proposals do a live webcast of the court case of a Boston University student versus the RIAA , Brokep wants similar for the Pirate Bay .
They want the case transmitted live on the web .
“ We want to show how it works .
Cards on the table , everything should be transparent ! ”
And why not ?
US Mint Suspends Production of More Gold and Silver Coins
The United States Mint has officially announced the suspension of another slate of gold and silver products .
The affected products are 2009 dated American Gold and Silver Eagle coins produced for collectors .
These coins are considered collectible versions of the bullion coins .
Although these are collectible coins , they represent a sizable amount of precious metals sales and represent a method of gold and silver investment for many individuals .
Last year , the US Mint sold 1,157,911 ounces of silver in the form of Silver Eagle coins minted for collectors .
They also sold 155,740 ounces of gold in the form of Gold Eagle and Gold Buffalo coins minted for collectors .
The following message was posted on the US Mint ’s website in the space where the collectible Gold Eagle coins typically appear .
The proof coins has been offered uninterrupted since 1986 .
The uncirculated version has been offered since 2006 .
Production of United States Mint American Eagle Gold Proof and Uncirculated Coins has been temporarily suspended because of unprecedented demand for American Eagle Gold Bullion Coins .
Currently , all available 22 - karat gold blanks are being allocated to the American Eagle Gold Bullion Coin Program , as the United States Mint is required by Public Law 99 - 185 to produce these coins “ in quantities sufficient to meet public demand . . . . ”
The United States Mint will resume the American Eagle Gold Proof and Uncirculated Coin Programs once sufficient inventories of gold bullion blanks can be acquired to meet market demand for all three American Eagle Gold Coin products .
Additionally , as a result of the recent numismatic product portfolio analysis , fractional sizes of American Eagle Gold Uncirculated Coins will no longer be produced .
A similar message is posted in the section where collectible American Silver Eagle coins would typically appear .
The proof coins have also been offered uninterrupted since 1986 and the uncirculated coins since 2006 .
Production of United States Mint American Eagle Silver Proof and Uncirculated Coins has been temporarily suspended because of unprecedented demand for American Eagle Silver Bullion Coins .
Currently , all available silver bullion blanks are being allocated to the American Eagle Silver Bullion Coin Program , as the United States Mint is required by Public Law 99 - 61 to produce these coins “ in quantities sufficient to meet public demand . . . . ” The United States Mint will resume the American Eagle Silver Proof and Uncirculated Coin Programs once sufficient inventories of silver bullion blanks can be acquired to meet market demand for all three American Eagle Silver Coin products .
This adds to the lengthy list of 2009 dated precious metals products that have been “ temporarily delayed ” or suspended by the US Mint .
In my previous post Actions of the US Mint Discourage Gold Ownership , I mentioned the delayed release of 2009 Gold Eagle fractional coins , 2009 Gold Buffalo coins , and all 2009 Platinum Eagle coins .
The delay , which was first announced in November 2008 , continues with no further explanation provided .
For those keeping track , here is a list of the US Mint ’s 2009 precious metals products that have been “ temporarily delayed ” or suspended :
2009 American Gold Eagle 1/2 oz. ( bullion )
2009 American Gold Eagle 1/4 oz. ( bullion )
2009 American Gold Eagle 1/10 oz. ( bullion )
2009 American Platinum Eagle 1 oz . ( bullion )
2009 American Platinum Eagle 1/2 oz. ( bullion )
2009 American Platinum Eagle 1/4 oz. ( bullion )
2009 American Platinum Eagle 1/10 oz . ( bullion )
2009 American Gold Buffalo 1 oz. ( bullion )
2009 - W Proof American Gold Eagle 1 oz. ( collector )
2009 - W Proof American Gold Eagle 1/2 oz. ( collector )
2009 - W Proof American Gold Eagle 1/4 oz. ( collector )

2009 - W Uncirculated American Gold Eagle 1 oz. ( collector )
2009 - W Proof American Silver Eagle ( collector )
2009 - W Uncirculated American Silver Eagle ( collector )
In addition , the following precious metals related products were discontinued by the US Mint for 2009 .
These discontinuations were announced in November 2008 .
Amidst the environment of unprecedented demand for precious metals , the US Mint determined that these products were “ unpopular . ”
Uncirculated American Gold Eagle 1/2 oz. ( collector )
Uncirculated American Gold Eagle 1/4 oz. ( collector )
Uncirculated American Gold Eagle 1/10 oz. ( collector )
Unriculated American Gold Eagle 4 Coin Set ( collector )
Uncirculated American Gold Buffalo 1 oz. ( collector )
Uncirculated American Gold Buffalo 1/2 oz. ( collector )

Proof American Platinum Eagle 1/2 oz. ( collector )
Proof American Platinum Eagle 1/4 oz. ( collector )
Proof American Platinum Eagle 1/10 oz. ( collector )
Proof American Platinum Eagle 4 Coin Set ( collector )
That makes a total of 38 precious metals products which have been delayed , suspended , or discontinued by the US Mint .
As it currently stands , investors or collectors looking to purchase newly minted American Eagle or American Buffalo precious metals products have only two options available .
These are the 2009 1 oz .
American Gold Eagle and the 2009 1 oz .
American Silver Eagle .
Both of these products continue to be subject to rationing .

No word on pricing and availability , other than the rather vague " this spring " .
Still , this spring is much better than never .
It 's a scientific fact .

Frontiers in Human Neuroscience has a great two page article that nicely summarises the thinking about how blood flow measured by brain scans relates to the workings of the neurons .
No one with common sense would believe that in a house , water movements in pipes could tell you how many lamps are on and how much fuel is used for heating .
Surprisingly most neuroscientists are convinced that in the brain monitoring local cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) what I call plumbing , is a reliable surrogate method to localize electrical neuronal activity and monitor metabolic events .
The piece is by neuroscientist Jean Rossier , and he discusses the two main theories of how blood flow relates to what the neurons are doing .
The ‘ metabolic hypothesis ’ assumes there is a causal link between how much energy the neurons need , in the form of glucose , and the subsequent regulation of blood flow in the brain .
In other words , the neurons signal the need for energy , which is delivered later .
The ‘ neurogenic hypothesis ’ hypothesis , suggest that blood flow can be ‘ pre- ordered ’ , in anticipation of neural activity .
Needless to say , it ’s important to understand the exact relation between the operation of the neurons and blood flow , because brain scanning studies typically measure blood flow to infer the working of neurons and hence the relationship to cognitive or mental processing .

Lawyers should never ask a Mississippi grandma a question if they are n't prepared for the answer .
[ Mar. 21st , 2008 | 10:48 pm ] dekadens
In a trial , a Southern small - town prosecuting attorney called his first witness , a grandmotherly , elderly woman to the stand .
He approached her and asked , ' Mrs. Jones , do you know me ? '
She responded , ' Why , yes , I do know you , Mr. Williams .
I 've known you since you were a boy , and frankly , you 've been a big disappointment to me .
You lie , you cheat on your wife , and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs .
You think you 're a big shot when you have n't the brains to realize you 'll never amount to anything more than a two - bit paper pusher .
Yes , I know you . '
The lawyer was stunned .
Not knowing what else to do , he pointed across the room and asked , ' Mrs. Jones , do you know the defense attorney ? '
She again replied , ' Why yes , I do .
I 've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster , too .
He 's lazy , bigoted , and he has a drinking problem .
He can't build a normal relationship with anyone , and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state .
Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women .
One of them was your wife .
Yes , I know him .'
The defense attorney nearly died .
The judge asked both counselors to approach the bench and , in a very quiet voice , said , ' If either of you idiots asks her if she knows me , I 'll send you both to the electric chair . '

The Pentagon said Thursday that it intends to spend $ 400 million to develop a giant dirigible that will float 65,000 feet above the Earth for 10 years , providing unblinking and intricate radar surveillance of the vehicles , planes and even people below .

” It is absolutely revolutionary , ” Werner J.A. Dahm , chief scientist for the Air Force , said of the proposed unmanned airship — describing it as a cross between a satellite and a spy plane .
The 450 - foot - long craft would give the U.S. military a better understanding of an adversary ’s movements , habits and tactics , officials said .
And the ability to constantly monitor small movements in a wide area — the Afghanistan - Pakistan border , for example — would dramatically improve military intelligence .
“ It is constant surveillance , uninterrupted , ” Dahm said .
“ When you only have a short - time view — whether it is a few hours or a few days — that is not enough to put the picture together . ”
The project reflects a shift in Pentagon planning and spending priorities under Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , who has urged the military services to improve intelligence and surveillance operations while cutting high - tech weaponry costs .

The Bank of England has cut interest rates to 0.5 % - a fresh all - time low - and says it will now boost the money supply to help revive the economy .
Interest rates have now been reduced six times since October , and the latest cut from February 's 1 % was expected .
The Bank said it would expand the amount of money in the system by £ 75 bn - a policy called quantitative easing - in an attempt to boost bank lending .
Bank Governor Mervyn King said the policy would " eventually work " .
" Nothing in life is ever certain , but these measures we think will work in the long - term , " he said .
" I do n't know how long it will take , much depends on the situation in the rest of the world .
But if countries work together , these measures will I believe eventually work . "
Chancellor Alistair Darling said that increasing the supply of money was " absolutely essential " in order for the UK to recover from the recession .
He acknowledged that the latest rate cut would be a blow to savers who faced another drop in the return on their money but said " the key thing for each and every one of us is to ensure we get the economy moving to help people and to help businesses grow " .

And our analysis of how it worked ( or did n't ) when Japan tried it in 2001 See Economics Editor Stephanie Flanders ' thoughts here
Quantitative easing is the process of increasing the amount of money in circulation in an attempt to revive the economy .
While the Bank will initially add £ 75bn , Chancellor Alistair Darling has given it permission to extend this to up to £ 150bn .
The idea is that if the amount of money in the system is boosted , commercial banks will find it easier to lend .
Quantitative easing is sometimes incorrectly referred to as printing money , but the Bank will not expand the supply of money by making new banknotes .
Instead , it will buy assets - such as government securities ( gilts ) and corporate bonds .
Similar measures were implemented in Japan at the beginning of the decade and are considered to have had limited success .
' Pleasantly surprised '
BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders said that while the initial size of the quantitative easing scheme was smaller than some analysts had expected , " it 's a lot more than dipping their toes in the water " .
" Those who feared that the Bank would defeat the purpose of the policy by doing it only half - heartedly may be pleasantly surprised , " she said .

Philip Shaw , chief economist at Investec , said that quantitative easing " should in principle encourage the banks to lend to private sector agents such as households and businesses , stocking monetary growth and stimulating activity " .
Mr King sought permission from the Chancellor to start quantitative easing in a letter on 17 February .
In his reply , Mr Darling said that in the " current circumstances " the measures were now " appropriate " .
Both letters were released on Thursday .
The markets appear to have given the rate cut and quantitative easing announcements a downbeat response .
In late - afternoon trading , the FTSE 100 index was down 3.1 % at 3532 points , while the pound fell against the dollar to $ 1.4090 .
Rate cuts attacked
Business groups have attacked the recent cuts in interest rates , saying they have done little to encourage banks to lend more .
Others argue that they are unfairly hurting the returns of savers .
" Today 's decision is a kick in the teeth for savers who will see their already diminished interest payments fall even further , " said Adrian Coles , director general of the Building Societies Association .
The Council of Mortgage Lenders ( CML ) said the latest cut would be a " double whammy for prospective mortgage borrowers " .
" This latest cut presents immense challenges for lenders whose margins are already squeezed as a result of previous reductions , leaving little scope to lower discretionary mortgage rates further , " said CML director general Michael Coogan .
" Savings are the lifeblood of mortgage lending , and unless lenders can offer competitive rates to savers their ability to offer new mortgages is restricted . "
Ian McCafferty , CBI chief economist , said the continuing rate cuts were " becoming less and less effective as a means of stimulating the economy " .
" Though this latest cut will help support business and consumer confidence , it is unlikely to have a dramatic impact on the cost or availability of credit , " he said .
The Bank has had the room to cut interest rates because inflation has fallen on the back of reduced energy costs .
The most recent official figures showed that consumer prices index ( CPI ) inflation fell for the fourth month in succession in January to 3 % , from December 's 3.1 % .
However , CPI inflation still remains above the government 's 2 % target .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama took aim Thursday at conservative critics who claim that he is using the economic crisis to ram through an unrelated , expansive domestic agenda .
President Obama says recent problems in the markets are only part of a larger crisis .
The president told a group of business leaders that although he is not interested in increasing government 's role in America , a sustained economic recovery will be impossible if the country fails to address long - term structural problems in its education , energy and health - care systems .
" I am not choosing to address these additional challenges just because I feel like it or because I 'm a glutton for punishment , " Obama said at a meeting of Business Roundtable members .
" I am doing so because they are fundamental to our economic growth and ensuring that we do n't have more crises like this in the future . "
The president argued that the recent problems in the financial market , though " acute and urgent , " are only one part of a larger , systemic crisis .
" We must build this recovery on a foundation that lasts -- on a 21st century infrastructure and a green economy with lower health - care costs that creates millions of new jobs and new industries ; on schools that prepare our children to compete and thrive ; on businesses that are free to invest in the next big idea or breakthrough discovery , " he said .
Obama said that any delay for new investments in education , energy and health care would only continue " the same irresponsibility that led us to this point " and ultimately weaken the recovery .
Obama also directly addressed concerns over his tax plan , arguing that nobody 's taxes will be raised before the end of 2010 .
At that point , he claimed , the top rates will still be lower than they were during " the prosperity of the 1990s . "
Alluding to the political stakes , the president said that the country would be on an economic upswing by 2012 , " or else you 'll be listening to someone else in 2013 . "
Obama ' current term ends in January 2013 .
All About Barack Obama • National Economy
Ron Paul really has a chance .
To be president , I mean .
Really .
Because we are now in uncharted waters and things could go terribly wrong .
All that new money we are printing will eventually hit the shore and inflation will result .
And the tens of thousands of workers , soon to be hired by the government to rebuild the infrastructure and paid with even more new paper money , will spend that money on food and other essentials which will drive up prices .
The productive people will see their income and their profits diluted .
And by then , it is entirely possible , that the country will be ready to listen .
And they will not want to hear a debate about whether the next bailout should be $ 600 billion or $ 700 billion .
They will be ready to hear again the arguments in favor of or against a free marketplace .
How it should work ?
Why foreign wars should be avoided and how they can bankrupt us ?
There is a growing since of unease , a feeling that we have passed some Rubicon .
That we have launched into unchartered territory , led by politicians and economists and journalists who really do n’t know what they are doing , and even openly warn us of this fact .
President Obama seems to be sincere and a nice fellow and we are still glowing over the idea of having elected an African American as president .
The country that was last to end slavery and grant full civil rights has now leapfrogged societies in Europe and Latin American and Asia , with their class systems and layers of social strata .
But it is becoming clear that the “ changes ” we wanted are not going to be ushered in by Barrack Obama .
If anything , he is feeling the need to reassure the establishment and the institutions of his political base , the unions and other constituencies and the liberal clique on Capitol Hill , that it is not risky to put an African American at the helm .
What we are getting is old liberalism , a 1960 ’s , Lyndon Johnson liberalism .
Re-cycled programs that we have already tried and have seen fail .
We are seeing the treasury used to pay off political debts to unions and other constituencies .
There is increased spending , centralization of power in Washington , D.C. New regulations .
The Swedenization of America .
And it is coming at a breathtaking pace .
The economic crisis is like the Reichstag fire , which allowed the Nazi ’s to change everything in the name of a national emergency .
But instead of using the economic crisis to be better managers , we are told we must spend more money , the very thing that got is in this mess in the first place .
The normal checks and balances are not in place .
The media watchdog is fighting for its life , newspapers and magazines folding as people turn to the internet .
Television news has become entertainment .
And sometimes the audience itself dictates the stories and the journalists obediently respond or else .
It is scary .
And while the conventional wisdom is that Barack Obama is the second coming of FDR and the economy will likely bounce back in time for his re-election , ( that it would bounce back even if George W. Bush were in office , ) the new open - the - floodgates spending round may not solve the problem , even temporarily .
It may aggravate the crisis .
There is no guarantee that this time the economy will automatically rebound at its appointed , politically demanded time .
Over the years , only one national politician has been warning about this coming crisis , clearly and consistently , while others smirked and laughed at him , secure in their knowledge that “ the experts ” on Wall Street knew what they were doing .
And that politician was Ron Paul .
So if the Republican Party gets back to its basics and abandons its failed effort to outspend and out - war the Democrats then there is only one choice .
Republicans will either choose among their old , tired politicians , another “ Democrat lite , ” and call him or her a “ conservative , ” or they will make a fundamental turn to a free marketer , to a constitutionalist , to someone who sees an America less arrogant in world affairs .
And if they make that turn , they will have only one choice .
Can Ron Paul really be elected president ?
Yes .
It can happen .

The simplest explanation for why America ’s reality got so distorted is the economic imbalance that Barack Obama now wants to remedy with policies that his critics deride as “ socialist ” ( “ fascist ” ca n’t be far behind ) : the obscene widening of income inequality between the very rich and everyone else since the 1970s .
“ There is something wrong when we allow the playing field to be tilted so far in the favor of so few , ” the president said in his budget message .
He was calling for fundamental fairness , not class warfare .
America has n’t seen such gaping inequality since the Gilded Age and 1920s boom that preceded the Great Depression .
This inequity was compounded by Bush tax policy and by lawmakers and regulators of both parties who enabled and protected the banking scam artists who fled with their bonuses and left us holding the toxic remains .
The fantasy of easy money at the top of the economic pyramid trickled down to the masses , who piled up debt by leveraging their homes much as their ’ 20s predecessors once floated stock purchases “ on margin . ”
Our culture , meanwhile , painted halos over celebrity C.E.O. ’s , turning the fundamentalist gospel of the market into a national religion that further accelerated the country ’s wholesale flight from reality .
The once - lionized lifestyles of the rich and infamous were appallingly tacky .

The cultural crash should have been a tip - off to the economic crash to come .
Paul Greenwood and Stephen Walsh , money managers whose alleged $ 667 million fraud looted the endowments at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon , were fond of collecting Steiff stuffed animals , including an $ 80,000 teddy bear .
Sir Robert Allen Stanford  a Texan who purchased that “ Sir ” by greasing palms in Antigua  poured some of his alleged $ 8 billion in ill - gotten gains into a castle , complete with moat , man -made cliff and pub .
He later demolished it , no doubt out of boredom .
In a class apart is the genteel Walter Noel , whose family - staffed Fairfield Greenwich Group fed some $ 7 billion into Madoff ’s maw .
The Noels promoted themselves , their business and their countless homes by posing for Town & Country .
Their firm took in at least $ 500 million in fees ( since 2003 alone ) for delivering sheep to the Madoff slaughterhouse .
In exchange , Fairfield Greenwich claimed to apply “ due diligence ” to every portfolio transaction  though we now know Madoff did n’t actually trade a single stock or bond listed in his statements for at least the past 13 years .
But in the bubble culture , money ennobled absolutely .
A former Wall Street executive vouched for his pal Noel to The Times : “ He ’s a terribly good person , almost in the sense of Jimmy Stewart in ‘ It ’s a Wonderful Life ’ combined with an overtone of Gregory Peck in ‘ To Kill a Mockingbird . ’ ”
Dear Dr. Dollar : The Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank , has a website that purports to present evidence that the wealthiest group of Americans historically pay more taxes than middle - or low - income folks .
Their sources include the U.S. Treasury Department , the Office of Budget and Management , and the Census Bureau .
The wealthiest 1 % paid over a third of taxes , while those in the lower 50 % paid only 4 % of income taxes in 1999 .
How do those of us who criticize the tax system as inherently unfair to middle - and lower - income folks respond to this apparently progressive tax system ?

This article is from the September / October 2002 issue of Dollars & Sense magazine .
The most comprehensive source of information on “ tax incidence ” — who actually pays how much in taxes — is the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , which compiles data from the Internal Revenue Service every couple of years .
The CBO ’s most recent report , entitled Effective Tax Rates , was released in October 2001 and is available online at .
( The effective tax rate is the percentage of income actually paid in taxes — as opposed to the tax bracket — after deductions and exemptions and loopholes and all the rest . )
The CBO divides families into five “ quintiles ” — from the lowest earning one - fifth of taxpayers ( incomes ranging from $ 0 to $ 13,000 in 1997 ) to the highest paid fifth ( incomes of $ 50,800 and up ) — and further breaks down the top fifth into the top 10 % , 5 % , and 1 % .
As the table below shows , the top income groups do in fact pay income taxes at a greater rate than they earn .
The poorest quintile gets 4 % of income but pays - 2 % of federal income taxes — negative because most qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit .
The top fifth garners 53 % of income but shells out 80 % of the income tax .
And the richest 1 % of taxpayers ( average income of $ 1,016,000 ) receives about 16 % of income but pays one - third of federal income taxes .
After those taxes are collected , the wealthiest income groups end up with a slightly smaller share of the economic pie than they started out with , while the poorer groups end up with slightly more .
So the folks at Heritage are not wrong .
The federal income tax is indisputably progressive ; it is intended to redistribute income , and that is what it does .
But the redistributive impact is mild — and it ’s milder still since last year ’s tax reform .
The top quintile starts out with slightly more than half of all pre-tax income generated by the U.S. economy , and ends up with just under half of all after - tax income .
The poorest fifth begins the game with just 4 % of income and ends up with less than 5 % .
The folks at Heritage , of course , oppose government redistribution schemes on principle .
But redistributing income is the whole point of a progressive tax , and advocates of progressive taxation should not shy away from defending this .
If one believes that Ken Lay deserved no less than the $ 100 million he collected from Enron last year , while the burger - flippers and office cleaners of America deserve no more that the $ 6.50 an hour they collect , then a progressive tax would seem immoral .
But if one believes that incomes are determined by race , gender , connections , power , luck and ( occasionally ) fraud , then redistribution through the tax system is a moral imperative .
The Heritage study also conveniently overlooks the impact of levies other than the federal income tax .
Social Security taxes , excise levies , tariffs , and other duties are regressive — their effective rates decline as income goes up .
When these other federal taxes are added in , the tax burden on lower - income groups increases significantly .
Social Security taxes take an especially large bite out of low - income workers ’ paychecks ; the bite is even larger when we include payroll taxes paid by the employer .
( Labor economists believe that the employer share of the Social Security tax functions , in practice , as a levy on wages , since employers reduce wages to compensate for the tax instead of paying for it out of profits ) .
Further , because state and local governments collect regressive sales , excise , and property taxes , the lower four quintiles pay a larger share of their income in state and local taxes than the top quintile .
If we were to add all of these taxes together , we would almost certainly find that the U.S. tax system , as a whole , is not progressive at all .

CANNABIS CULTURE –
In 2007 , over 870 thousand people were arrested for cannabis possession in the United States , and more than 100 thousand people have been arrested so far this year .
On January 10 , 2009 , I became one of those 100 thousand when I was arrested for possessing marijuana in Keene , New Hampshire – an act I intentionally performed as a protest against the immorality of the Drug War , and as a demonstration of the absurdity of incarcerating someone for such a harmless “ crime ” .
That morning , hours before the protest was to take place , I took out my copy of Walter Kaufman ’s The Portable Nietzsche and turned it to a random page ( watch the protest video ) .
I happened to open to a section of Thus Spoke Zarathustra entitled “ On the New Idol ” , in which the title character speaks of the delegation of one ’s own power and responsibility for value - creation to some external entity – in this case , the State .
“ The New Idol , ” or the State , is seen by her idolaters as the power which grants them rights , as the authority which grants permission to act , as this almost omniscient , omnipotent entity which can solve their problems .
Rather than fight to protect the self - determination that is innate to them as human beings , they seek to deny it through the externalization of their power , their rights , their freedom , and their humanity to the State .
Those of you who live day - to - day wishing only to ingest cannabis without having to concern yourselves with the mindless hobbies of the State know exactly what I mean .
The State is not your idol ; you do not worship the State or derive your moral values from it .
Instead , you see it – and rightfully so – as the ever - intrusive , ever - meddlesome entity that it is .
Your instinct is to react against the State and know it , intuitively , to be wrong ; and , like the strong people you are , you embrace that instinct and continue living your own life in the manner you see fit , despite the State ’s campaign against you .
You struggle on , even as the State destroys so many of you each year , locking you in prisons and treating you like criminals – you struggle on .
It is this struggle that you and I share : the perpetual struggle of the individual and the community , of the person who knows he is good and free , and the State , whose opposing view is much more misanthropic .
It is this struggle that I have now dedicated my life to , seeing it as the most pervasive and challenging of our times .
The State ’s coercive habits must be eradicated , its validity questioned , its power kept in check ; and the importance and sovereignty of the individual must be embraced now more than ever .
For this reason I , and over 600 other liberty - loving people from all over the country ( and the rest of the world ) , have moved to New Hampshire as members of the Free State Project .
The FSP is an organization committed to encouraging as many freedom activists as possible to move to one state .
For me ( as I can only speak for myself and not others involved in the FSP ) , it is a chance to aid in the fight to reduce the government ’s tyrannical nature and , in the process , create a peaceful , free society based on the principle of self - ownership : the part of your condition that relates you to yourself – you are responsible for your own actions , bound by your weaknesses , enabled by your strengths , and sovereign in all matters concerning your own being – you , quite literally , own yourself .
This basic principle of self - ownership leads many to see government intervention in individual affairs to be exactly what it is : blatant authoritarianism in the quest for moral and social conformity .
But what business is it of the State to create and enforce laws regarding how the individual ought best treat himself ?
What business is it of the State to tell you what you can and can not do with your own body ?
You , me , and millions of other Americans agree in a more and more resounding manner each day : it is none of the State ’s business at all .
I , and many others who have moved to New Hampshire , simply believe it is time that we did something about it .
Thus , in mid-August of 2008 , two weeks after my 18th birthday , I moved to the Granite State from my native city of Whittier , California .
It was quite a change .
Most notably , California is notorious for its year - round sunshine and New Hampshire for its cold winters .
But getting past the superficial aspects and on to the more meaningful realities of contemporary social and economic situations , New Hampshire both enlightened and astonished me with its vibrant political atmosphere .
New Hampshire ’s 425 - member legislature is the third largest in the English - speaking world – a stark contrast to California ’s 120 - member legislature , which supposedly provides an accurate representation of the values of a population 28 times the size of New Hampshire ’s .
California ’s culture is rampant with apathy and cynicism from the social , economic , and pure class disparity between the representative ’s and their constituents .
New Hampshire , however , is filled with people who call their legislator ’s home phone ( yes , an actual home phone ) and might even talk to a representative ’s husband or wife about how their day went while waiting for their representative to reach the phone ( try that in California ) .
Also , the cost to run for office in New Hampshire is so low that most running at the state level spend less than $ 500 on a campaign , and even go door - to - door and talk to voters in person – again , try running for state office in California with $ 500 , and then go knock on every one of your constituents ’ doors ( $ 500 wo n’t even cover the gas ) .
The legislature in New Hampshire is so accessible and localized that it creates an environment of more accountability and far less corruption .
The only way the people of California will ever escape the over - abundance of lobbyists , media monopolies , and corrupt politicians that accompany their government ( aside from moving out of the state ) is if it collapses .
The path to change in the “ Live Free or Die ” state is much more peaceful and adaptable to individual needs and pursuits – the best government truly is one closest to home , and the one closest to home is the individual ’s government of himself .
It is that exact idea that I demonstrated with my protest .
The State is not my idol and I do not worship it .
I do not look to it for moral guidance or to govern my actions .
Instead , I look to myself .
So when January 10 , 2009 , finally came , I had already sent press releases to local and national media , informing them of my plan to openly possess marijuana to incite my own arrest .
I had even sent word to local law enforcement agencies , telling them exactly when and where I would be conducting this illegal act .
At 1 P.M. , gathering with over 40 other liberty activists , I waited in public for the cops to arrive .
After holding the marijuana in my hand for almost half an hour , displaying it openly without guilt or fear , members of the Keene police force finally came to arrest me – with a dozen video cameras glued to their every move .
“ Is that marijuana ? ” one of them asked .
“ It sure is , ” I replied .
Thus one of them lifted it from my open palm , put me in handcuffs , and walked me away .
Videos of the arrest , as well as the entirety of the protest , hit YouTube later that day and were streamed live as well .
As I later watched myself get arrested the whole scene seemed quite surreal , and I even chuckled at the raw silliness of them treating me like a criminal – combined with the irony of the fact that I do n’t even smoke pot !
Any drug test conducted on me would have turned out negative .
Regardless , I found it odd that they arrested me for an act that harmed absolutely no one .
They put me in handcuffs for doing nothing but holding a plant in my hand ; and yet this happens every single day to good , kind people all across this country .
Who was hurt by my possession of marijuana ?
Who had their property damaged ?
Who had their rights violated ?
No one .
No one , that is , except me .
I was kidnapped , had my property – the marijuana – stolen from me , left with a minor bruise on my left hand from the handcuffs , and faced a fine of up to $ 2,000 and a jail sentence of up to one year .
The immorality of all this is so blatant as to warrant utter outrage on behalf of the American people .
And the question is not : will the government become worse ?
More intrusive ?
More authoritarian ?
The question is : when ?
And the answer is : now , tomorrow , the day after tomorrow , and the day after that – unless we take it upon ourselves to draw a line in the sand and say , “ Enough is enough ! ”
That is the reason I moved to New Hampshire , that is the reason I am dedicating my life to the cause of liberty , that is the reason I protested the Drug War and had myself arrested – to demonstrate the absurdity and inhumanity of it all .
I am the ruler of myself – not the government .
I am the king of my own castle – not the government .
And it ’s about damn time someone told the government exactly that .

What is Property ?
Property is not what one owns .
Property is not one ’s material and immaterial possessions .
Property is a Right to something .
Property is not a thing , but a right to a thing .
The following language appears in the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress , October 1774 , and it clearly lists three Rights , and they are life , liberty , and property :
" That the inhabitants of the English Colonies in North America , by the immutable laws of nature , the principles of the English constitution , and the several charters or compacts , have the following Rights :
That they are entitled to life , liberty , and property , and they have never ceded to any sovereign power whatever , a right to dispose of either without their consent . "
Property is the right of absolute ownership and control over some thing .
Property is the complete right to decide what to do with some thing within the limits of not infringing the rights of others to their persons .
One ’s major and fundamental property is property in one ’s person .
Having property in one ’s person implies having one ’s liberty , which is the unimpeded control over one ’s own choices .
It implies that one decides how to live one ’s life without being controlled by others .
And it implies absolute control over one ’s possessions , material and immaterial .
Thus , the right to one ’s person implies the three rights : life , liberty , and property .
The Declaration quoted above says that persons are entitled to these rights , and it implies that they only can be ceded by consent , which is by agreement .
Property in one ’s person means absolute control over one ’s person .
This includes control over one ’s Labor .
Labor is the major source of income by far for most people and in most societies .
If one has property in one ’s person , then one owns one ’s labor and the fruits of that labor , which is one ’s labor income .
A person is analogous to an orchard .
A person produces income just as the orchard bears fruit .
The person is entitled to that income just as the owner of the orchard is entitled to the fruit .
The orchard owner has the right to all the future harvests of fruit , and the person has the right to all the future labor income arising from his labor .
The orchard owner has expended time and resources to create the fruit - bearing trees , and the person has expended time and resources to produce the skills needed to produce labor income .
What is a slave ?
A slave is a person whose right to his person is limited .
He does not have property in his person .
That right belongs to someone else , which is his or her owner .
He does not control his person .
He does not control his labor income .
He is like an orchard that someone owns .
What is taxation ?
Taxation is a " charge against a citizen ’s person or property or activity for the support of government . "
When does taxation violate property ?
When does it infringe the right to dispose of one ’s income freely ?
When does taxation make the taxpayer into a slave who no longer has the right to his labor income ?
In the pre-Revolutionary days of 1750 — 1776 , many colonists believed that Taxation without Representation violated their rights .
If they provided their consent to their government to tax , then they ceded some control over their labor income to their government .
This they deemed legitimate and no infringement on their property .
Many Americans still believe this , and they have a right to the government of their choice .
But what of those who do not believe this ?
I , for one , believe that taxation even with representation violates my rights , because I have never consented or agreed to the system of majority rule or to the Constitution .
How many Americans would voluntarily pay the taxes they are paying if they knew what all these taxes actually were and if they were given the choice to pay them or not ?
All of those who are being made to pay taxes that they do not consent to are slaves .
Their property in their persons is no longer absolute but instead limited .
These Americans have a right to the government of their choice , as much as does the majority , for that right is implied by property in one ’s person .
If the majority is entitled to this right , so is the minority .
Life , liberty , and property are not rights valid only for the winners of elections or votes in Congress .
There are a great many tax - slaves in America and throughout the world .
There were 86 million eligible voters who did not vote for any candidate in the 2008 presidential election .
There are possibly very large numbers of disaffected Americans in this group who are registering their discontent by not voting .
Many of us were not around when the income tax was made legal .
We did not consent to it .
But let us leave that aside and think about those persons who today do accept not only the income tax but all the other taxes that government collects .
Many of those who voted for either Obama or McCain may be among those who do not consider themselves as tax - slaves .
Many of these may be quite happy with paying taxes , for they may pay little or think they pay little compared to what they get from government .
It is also possible that some of these do not know how large a share of their income goes to taxes and how much better off they would be without these taxes .
And it is possible that some of these satisfied taxpayers have been domesticated like work horses and , having a dulled capacity to think , do not realize that they are tax - slaves .
Whatever the psychology of those who support government , they should have the government they want .
Only they should not impose that government on those of us who do n’t want it .
We do not all have to be in the same government boat even if all of us continue to live on this continent .
There is nothing sacred about the Union , the U.S.A. , or the U.S. Constitution .
It has not been written anywhere that we must be " one Nation , under God , indivisible . "
The parts about " one Nation " and " indivisible " do not appear anywhere in my Bible , which is the Holy Bible .
The Pledge of Allegiance was written in 1892 by one Francis Bellamy .
It has been an annoyance to schoolchildren ever since .
As taxes imposed on non-consenters violate rights , so is the Pledge of Allegiance an oath against property and the right to one ’s person .
Will Obama free the slaves ?
Will he free all those Americans who wish to opt out from this government ?
Now that I ’ve told you what this question means , I do n’t have to answer it .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
[ digg- reddit - me ] Though the articles about investment bankers leaving the big firms to start up their own smaller , competing firms seem to be trying to suggest that this is a bad thing – I find it hard to see it as anything but good .
For example , an article in today ’s Wall Street Journal by Heidi N. Moore and Scott Patterson suggests Byron Trott is leaving Goldman Sachs to start his own firm because of caps “ on executive pay and calls for tighter regulation ” on large banks .
Byron Trott is significant because he is Warren Buffett ’s favorite investment banker – but the article also suggests he is part of a larger trend .
This strikes me as an almost unalloyed good .
If banks like Golman Sachs , Citibank , Bank of America , JPMorgan Chase , etcetera are too big – and if the government is n’t going to break them up – then this draining of talent and resources into smaller firms run by highly competent former members of these organizations seems like the next best thing .
Hopefully , this will help defuse the centralization of power and money in a few big firms which is one of the major factors that led to this crisis .
Simon Johnson and others have argued that we need to break up these banks that are too big to fail :
Anything that is too big to fail is too big to exist .
My thought is that this might be accomplished with less political capital and more “ naturally ” in a market - driven approach that simply imposed regulations and costs on institutions that are “ too - big - to - fail ” that would serve to drive individuals to set up smaller companies .
At institutions that are too big to fail , there should be , for example , a fee similar to that paid to the FDIC by banks to finance the protection given to them .
At the same time , pay – rather than being capped at a particular hard amount – should be forced to be tied to long - term results to avoid drastic short - term risk - taking ; I ’m sure there are other ways out there to limit pay without imposing caps .
And of course , regulations should ensure that an appropriate amount of capital is available to handle any leveraged risks .
Even if this market - driven approach is not sufficient , the steps taken so far are at least moving people in the right direction .

BBC News , Gaza
Hundreds of Palestinian schoolchildren used to come to the Gaza Zoo every week , but not now .
Tanks rolled through the area during the Israeli offensive .
Much of the zoo was badly damaged , most of the animals died .
Cage after cage lies empty .
Ostrich feathers are strewn close to a crater in the ground , beside the mangled steel bars of what was the birds ' pen .
The remains of a camel lie inside its former enclosure .
" Some were killed in air strikes , " says the zoo 's manager , Emad Qassim , " but some of the animals were shot dead . "
The remains of the camel have yet to be removed " Thank God our two lions survived , but we used to have over 400 animals and birds , now there are just 10 left . "
Many of the animals died of starvation .
The zookeepers say that for more than two weeks , Zeitoun , the southern suburb of Gaza City where the zoo is located , was simply too dangerous to access because of the presence of troops and tanks .
' Booby - trapped '
During the conflict the Israeli army released footage from the zoo in which soldiers pointed to what they said was a fuse running along one line of cages .
The white cable led out of the compound to the school next door , a building the soldiers said had been booby - trapped by militants .
That is why troops carried out their attack here , the army said .
In the 22 days of the offensive , which Israel says was a response to rocket fire from Hamas , Gazan authorities and human - rights groups say 1,300 Palestinians died , hundreds of them children .
Thousands were injured .
Many had their homes damaged or destroyed , but other aspects of the territory 's infrastructure were affected too .
That includes those places , like the zoo , where people in Gaza could go to escape the considerable troubles of daily life here .
Perseverance and trauma
Just a few months ago , Gaza 's first archaeological museum was opened in the northern part of Gaza City .
It is an impressive building , especially considering that it was constructed during the last year and a half of harsh sanctions .
One of the owners , Jawdat Khoudary , collected the stone with which the museum was eventually built from old demolished homes in Gaza .
He had also spent years collecting artefacts from Gaza 's ancient past , paying the locals who had happened upon the many Roman , Bronze age or Byzantine finds .
Look at people 's faces in Gaza now and they seem like they almost died
Sohail al - Saqqa , joint owner of Gaza Museum " We were determined to develop a nice place for Gazans to come to , whatever the circumstances , " says his business partner , Sohail al - Saqqa .
" We managed to open this place , but we did n't have long before the war started . "
Staff say that when a tank shell fell close by , items that had survived centuries were destroyed .
Bronze age vases still lie , shattered , on the floor of the main exhibition hall .
But while such physical damage is limited , business at the museum and its restaurant has come to a standstill .
Mr Saqqa insists he will persevere .
" We do n't have another choice , " he says .
" We have to have hope that this will end and people here can come back to life .
" But look at people 's faces in Gaza now and they seem like they almost died . "
The war torn children 's slide at Gaza zoo is unused now Gradually , following the ceasefires declared by Israel and Hamas , some in Gaza have been heading back to the coffee shops and , those who can afford it , to those restaurants that have reopened .
But the sense of shock in this society is still palpable .
Gaza 's coastline has the potential to give people some sanctuary , and the numbers of families seen going for walks on the beach is undoubtedly increasing .
But even here there are problems .
With more damage done to Gaza 's ailing sewage system during the war , millions of litres of raw waste continue to flow straight into the sea every day .
For a population that is unable to leave this territory , there are very few places to turn , without being reminded about the trauma of the conflict .

LimeWire , a popular file sharing application that offers users access to music , movie and other downloads via the decentralized gnutella network developed by Justin Frankel , the late Gene Kan and others , has more than doubled the size of its music store catalog by adding around 1.2 million tracks from music distributor The Orchard .
" This is a way to partner with artists and labels to provide a way to connect the artist and the fan , and just to be a contributor to a new and exciting music industry , " said LimeWire CFO Jesse Rubenfeld .
" We think there 's interest in this product , and we 've made a large investment to offer a quality program .
We 're excited about it . "
While bit torrent clients and online music services generally offer a wider range of music than gnutella , New York - based LimeWire still appears to have a large user base , which it hopes will buy MP3s from the store when they 're not downloading them for free .
Songs are available
as individual downloads for 99 cents , or users can choose monthly plansincluding 25 songs for $ 10 , 50 songs for $ 15 and 75 songs for $ 20 ( amere 27 cents per song if you use all of the allotted monthlydownloads ) .
Rubenfeld explained via the phone that the LimeWire applicationwo n't share songs purchased from the LimeWire store .
" We encode aspecial marker as a basic ID3 tag that functions as a flag to the Limewire client , which will not share a song that was purchased fromthe LimeWire store , " he said , adding that LimeWire has yet to implement " buy " links within LimeWire 's file sharing search results .
However , they plan to do so soon – and when they do add thoselinks , users will still have the option to download a free version ofthe song from the gnutella network .
All two million or so tracks in the LimeWire music store are available in a DRM - free 256 Kbps MP3 format , and a few exclusives are included .
Many albums in the store are free , including the Ear to the Ground : Beijing
compilation , featuring a number of contemporary Chinese pop musicians .
Aside from this new music from The Orchard , the LimeWire store features 800,000 or so songs from IRIS , Nettwerk Music Group and RedeyeDistribution .
You do n't have to run LimeWire in order to download thesetracks , although if you have it running , they 'll be automaticallyimported into your LimeWire library .
As it tries to put together the music store , LimeWire continues todefend itself in a lawsuit brought by all four major labels that hasbeen ongoing for over two years .
Perhaps this store could work in itsfavor in that case .
If the company can show that P2P usage leadsdirectly to music sales and royalty checks , the labels could changetheir minds .
Another factor that could help convince the judge that Rubenfeld has musicians ' best interests at heart is that he 's also a working musician .
The singer / songwriter has planned a record release party in Manhattan for September 13 ( also his " twenty - tenth " birthday ) .

A cheap sticker price drove Honda 's hybrid Insight to triple its expected sales numbers .
Finally a win for the auto industry .
The Insight is only available in Japan , but will be rolling across our nation in the next few weeks .
WSJ : The Japanese auto maker said it had received orders for about 18,000 Insights as of Monday .
Honda said orders for the gasoline - electric hybrid car had already matched its monthly sales target of 5,000 vehicles even before the Insight 's Feb. 6 rollout .
The orders data provide a rare bright spot for Japan 's struggling auto market , which is expected to plunge to a 31 - year low in 2009 .
Part of the reason for the strong demand for Honda 's new fuel - efficient hybrid is that its sticker price ranges between 1.89 million yen and 2.21 million yen ( $ 19,120 and $ 22,360 ) including tax , which is cheaper than rival Toyota Motor Corp .'s Prius hybrid vehicle .
The Prius retails for between 2.3 million yen and 3.4 million yen .
