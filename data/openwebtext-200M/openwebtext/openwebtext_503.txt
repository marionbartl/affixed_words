ALBANY , New York 
When Joe Fox sends his daughters away to summer camp , he 's confident they 'll be surrounded by kids who share his family 's beliefs and values .
Caitlin , 16 , and Elizabeth , 10 , go to Camp Quest , which in 1996 created a niche getaway for children who are agnostic , atheist , or just not sure what to believe yet .
American parents have plenty of summer camp options , from Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts to the YMCA to soccer , dance , music and drama camps .
Many claim no religious affiliation while others are Jewish , Catholic or evangelical Christian .
The Camp Quest concept started in 1996 with 20 kids at a site in Ohio with the slogan " Beyond Belief . "
Since then , demand has grown and week - long camps have been added in Minnesota , Michigan , California , Tennessee , and Ontario in Canada .
In 2007 the camps accommodated 150 kids , generally ages 8 - 17 .
The projection for 2008 is more than 200 campers and new camps are also being considered in Vermont and Britain .
" They 're good , moral kids without organized religion , " Fox said of his daughters .
" They can feel comfortable being who they are . "
The family , from Furlong , Pennsylvania , has been sending their kids to the camps for years , even though it 's more expensive and difficult to send them out of state .
Most Americans believe in some form of God — 94 % , according to a 2007 survey from the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life .
And 53 % have an unfavorable view of atheists .
Kids who attend the camp are not required to be atheists , or anything at all , said Amanda Metskas , president of Camp Quest Inc .
" We really try not to label the kids , " she said .
" When a kid is 8 or 10 , asking them to say , ' I 'm an atheist , ' or ' I 'm a Catholic ' — at 8 or 10 we do n't think that kids are able to make a decision about their world view . "
Camp Quest is a not - for - profit backed by the Albany , New York - based Institute for Humanist Studies , a think tank supporting the nonreligious Humanist philosophy , which emphasizes science , evolution , compassion and critical thinking .
At mealtime , kids learn about what the camp calls " freethinkers " throughout history — defining them as people who questioned or rejected religion .
Examples can include people who believed in some version of a higher power , but held ideas conflicting with the social norm .
Some identified as freethinkers include : cycling champion Lance Armstrong , science fiction writer Isaac Asimov , women 's rights pioneer Susan B. Anthony , abolitionist Frederick Douglass and author Alice Walker , who wrote The Color Purple .
Campers are exposed to science and learn about evolution .
They also participate in typical outdoor camp activities , including swimming , horseback riding and roasting marshmallows .
The counselors will sometimes discuss world religions and philosophies .
They say the focus is not on what is " wrong " about other beliefs , but they do sometimes use examples from religions when talking about errors in critical thinking .
In one exercise , counselors tell the kids about different invisible creatures that live in the camp and then challenge the campers to prove that they do n't exist .
In some cases , it 's a pair of unicorns , in other cases , a dragon .
In each instance , the campers are told they can't see , touch or taste the creatures .
The point is that a belief is n't automatically valid just because it can't be proven wrong .
The exercise is supposed to help kids who do n't believe in God prepare for questions from their peers who ask them to prove a higher power does n't exist .
If campers manage to prove the creatures do n't exist , the prize is a $ 100 bill from before 1954 — when the government put " In God We Trust " on U.S. currency .
Camper Caitlin Fox , 16 , said the camp has helped her build confidence .
" Before I attended I used to feel really embarrassed , " she said .
" I was afraid my friends would reject me if I said I did n't believe in some higher power . "
Critics say the camps appear to espouse a particular point of view .
Erika Chopich , a psychotherapist , chaplain and founder of the nonprofit Hope America Ministries Foundation , said the invisible creatures in the exercise are obvious metaphors for God .
" It 's clearly meant to teach that God cannot possibly exist , " Chopich said . " ...
There 's obviously some teaching going on , there 's some philosophy there .
It 's not completely neutral . "
Lev Pinskiy , from the New York City borough of Brooklyn , sends his son , Eugene , 14 , and daughter , Margaret , 9 , to Camp Quest because he wants them to have a sense of belonging .
Pinskiy considers himself a humanist and was raised without organized religion , but he came from a Jewish background , while his wife was raised in the Russian Orthodox Church .
In separate incidents , Pinskiy felt his children were rejected by both religious communities because neither considered the children to be their own .
" I do n't want my children to feel isolated and like second - class citizens , because they 're not , " Pinskiy said .
" They have — as I do — a strong system of morals and rules for behavior . "
Pinskiy said Camp Quest has helped his family , especially his children , become more confident about their own disbelief .
" Nobody wants to live alone in a bubble , " Pinskiy said .
" So it 's extremely nice to find similarly minded people with the same world view . "

We 've seen some decent video alteration in our day , but this new research project by some folks at the University of Washington has the potential to turn the entire concept on its head .
Using some rather advanced algorithms to analyze video and photographs of a the same scene , the software can meld the two into something slightly better or even dramatically different .
In effect , it 's Photoshop for video , since it brings your Photoshop chops to bear on video effects : edit up a still shot or two of the scene , and then meld that with the video , and your edits can be seamlessly integrated into the scene , without all that nasty manual labor required by Shake or After Effects .
It 's not the end all be all yet , since the tech only works with static scenes so far , but the researchers are working to rectify that .
While video evidence has n't been a sure thing for years , it 's always been significantly harder to fiddle with than still shots .
With that barrier removed , we might be in for a whole new generation of video that lies and a reality we can be none too sure of .
Oh , and really good looking indie flicks .
Sample vid is after the break .
Once again , the idea of driving 55 miles per hour is out of the closet .
Once mandated in the 1970s — but eventually discarded for 65 - 75 m.p.h. limits handled by individual states — the concept has resurfaced as oil and gas prices have rocketed to record heights .
A news story published this morning in USA Today brought out the naysayers in droves .
An overwhelming majority of the story ’s commenters online booed and hissed at the notion that they should do any such inconvenient thing .
Some main complaints are being echoed throughout the comments chamber :
The government wants to inflict increasing pain on the public ; high gas prices — now this ?!
Law enforcement is losing revenue because so many people have taken it upon themselves to slow down ( the implied reason is because it makes sense to do so ) , so lower limits will once again pad the coffers of the highway patrol .
If a cross-country vacation takes that much longer to drive , all savings are spent on additional hotel stays — so why bother ?
Anyone who wants to drive 55 m.p.h. can now , so let them choose to do so and let the rest drive faster ( legally ) .
Traffic jams will worsen if everyone is required to drive slower .
55 is too slow !!!
In general , the comments are largely filled with complaints and sarcasm and anger .
( Ahhh , the modern American way : Call everyone with ideas idiots ; “ Status quo or bust ! ” )
Now , I do n’t know if driving 55 m.p.h. saves the world or not .
But I ’m willing to find out the information before spouting venom with abandon .
( By the way , where are all of these passionate voices about things that matter , things that impact more than mere individual conveniences — such as for global warming and recycling and …? )
The USA Today story says Senator John Warner ( R - Va. ) introduced a bill last month that orders a study be carried out to test the effects of a national 60 m.p.h. limit .
Spearheading an effort that goes five notches lower , Tim Castelman , is promoting the Drive 55 campaign .
By the way , Castelman is being lambasted in the string of comments left at USAToday.com .
( Maybe I will be too once I publish this blog post , but such is life with 21st Century media . )
But he must be used to it , judging by the hate e-mails he posts at drive55.org .
It ’s astounding the seething , loathing , misspelled , incoherent , babbling hatred of this guy and the project as a whole .
( Digression : Again , let global warming and poverty and countless other ills of the world go un-noticed , but send a man with ideas that may just be worthwhile notes that proclaim undying love for Exxon and BP and include words that George Carlin was n’t allowed to utter on stage . )
Like I said , I do n’t know the numbers on benefits from driving slower .
Obviously neither do a lot of other people or we would n’t need Warner ’s proposed study to be done for the latest and greatest understanding of this situation .
What I do know is that when I drive 55 m.p.h. —
I have to in my 1973 VW bus ; and we sometimes choose to in our 2008 , 30 - plus m.p.g .
Honda Civic —
I am more relaxed .
I slip into the right lane and just coast , letting all of the madness and road rage roll around me .
( Then I get to where I ’m going , really not all that much later than those who ’ve freaked out , white - knuckled and high - blood - pressured , all the way home . )
And that , even if only for that , is reason enough to love 55 m.p.h .

By Mick Meaney – RINF Breaking News | A poll conducted by the World Public Opinion ( WPO ) has found that over 60 % of the population of Great Britain and the United States do not trust their governments .
The poll showed that 67 % of Brits have low levels of trust in the Labour Government while 60 % of Americans feel the same way about the Bush Administration .
Overall dissatisfaction of government responsiveness was much higher with 77 % of Brits and an even higher percentage , 83 % of Americans .
With each passing year , we see Western Governments becoming more brazen with lies and imposing limits on our freedoms and privacy .
The poll also asked “ Whose Benefit is Country Run For ? ”
Unsurprisingly , 60 % of Brits perceive their government as serving powerful special interests rather than the interests of the people as a whole , likewise 80 % of Americans said the same .
Distain for corporate influence on governments is clear , but perhaps the lack of faith in the government goes even deeper .
Obviously there has been fabrication of evidence and spinning lies to the population in order to gain support for the illegal invasion and occupation of nations .
Then there is the use of outlawed weapons in those occupied countries , which cause damage for generations to come , and of course the propaganda which is fed to and disseminated by the mainstream media , all which is becoming increasingly less effective as the ‘ alternative ’ media grows .
Maybe issues closer to home has also damaged trust in the government .
A weakening economy while national debt goes through the roof , or possibly the high levels of surveillance we must endure thanks to new anti terrorism laws which give the government access to every aspect of our lives .
This is of course just the tip of the iceberg ; there is no single issue that has caused the majority of the population to mistrust their government .
It is an accumulation of constant betrayal over many years which has lead to the decay in trust and possibly more importantly , the loss of hope within the people .
A cliche term for The Passion of the Christ , directed by Mel Gibson .
This nomen was given due to the amount of gore and violence in the movie .
Imagine you have a choice between earning $ 50,000 a year while other people make $ 25,000 or earning $ 100,000 a year while other people get $ 250,000 .
Prices of goods and services are the same .
Which would you prefer ?
Surprisingly , studies show that the majority of people select the first option .
As H. L. Mencken is said to have quipped , " A wealthy man is one who earns $ 100 a year more than his wife 's sister 's husband . "
This seemingly illogical preference is just one of the puzzles that science is trying to solve about why happiness can be so elusive in today 's world .
Several recent books by researchers address the topic , but my skeptic 's eye found a historian 's long - view analysis to be ultimately the most enlightening .
Consider a paradox outlined by London School of Economics economist Richard Layard in Happiness ( Penguin , 2005 ) , in which he shows that we are no happier even though average incomes have more than doubled since 1950 and " we have more food , more clothes , more cars , bigger houses , more central heating , more foreign holidays , a shorter working week , nicer work and , above all , better health . "
Once average annual income is above $ 20,000 a head , higher pay brings no greater happiness .
Why ?
One , our genes account for roughly half of our predisposition to be happy or unhappy , and two , our wants are relative to what other people have , not to some absolute measure .
Happiness is better equated with satisfaction than pleasure , says Emory University psychiatrist Gregory Berns in Satisfaction ( Henry Holt , 2005 ) , because the pursuit of pleasure lands us on a never - ending hedonic treadmill that paradoxically leads to misery .
" Satisfaction is an emotion that captures the uniquely human need to impart meaning to one 's activities , " Berns concludes .
" While you might find pleasure by happenstance -- winning the lottery , possessing the genes for a sunny temperament , or having the luck not to live in poverty -- satisfaction can arise only by the conscious decision to do something .
And this makes all the difference in the world , because it is only your own actions for which you may take responsibility and credit . "
Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert goes deeper into our psyches in Stumbling on Happiness ( Knopf , 2006 ) , in which he claims , " The human being is the only animal that thinks about the future . "
Much of our happiness depends on projecting what will make us happy ( instead of what actually does ) , and Gilbert shows that we are not very good at this forethought .
Most of us imagine that variety is the spice of life , for example .
But in an experiment in which subjects anticipated that they would prefer an assortment of snacks , when it actually came to eating the snacks week after week , subjects in the no-variety group said that they were more satisfied than the subjects in the variety group .
" Wonderful things are especially wonderful the first time they happen , " Gilbert explains , " but their wonderfulness wanes with repetition . "
This habituation to even a multiplicity of wonderfulness is what economists call " declining marginal utility " and married couples call life .
But if you think that an array of sexual partners adds to the spice of life , you are mistaken : according to an exhaustive study published in The Social Organization of Sexuality ( University of Chicago Press , 1994 ) , married people have more sex than singles -- and more orgasms .
Historian Jennifer Michael Hecht emphasized this point in The Happiness Myth ( Harper , 2007 ) .
Her deep and thoughtful historical perspective demonstrates just how time - and culture - dependent is all this happiness research .
As she writes , " The basic modern assumptions about how to be happy are nonsense . "
Take sex .
" A century ago , an average man who had not had sex in three years might have felt proud of his health and forbearance , and a woman might have praised herself for the health and happiness benefits of ten years of abstinence . "
Most happiness research is based on self - reported data , and Hecht 's point is that people a century ago would most likely have answered questions on a happiness survey very differently than they do today .
To understand happiness , we need both history and science .

Subsequent to getting a home loan , picking an incredible house , and making an offer , you may expect the majority of the hard work in the home purchasing process is finished .
In any case , pause — there ’s one all the more huge thing that could decide if the home you ’re wanting to purchase is a decent choice : the home inspection .
Regardless of how put you feel in a specific house , it ’s critical to hear an expert point of view from a reliable home inspector and calculate the outcomes your home purchasing choice .
Here are a few inquiries you most likely have about home inspections :
What is a home inspection ?
A home inspection is a report created by an expert home inspector after they make a cautious assessment of a property .
It ’s proposed to give home purchasers an unprejudiced , learned bookkeeping of any recognizable issues a home has before they settle on the ultimate choice to get it .
A home inspection commonly happens while a home is under the agreement — which means you ’ve made a proposal on a house and it ’s been acknowledged .
A purchaser has a set timeframe , which is spread out in their buy understanding ( it ’s frequently seven days to 10 days , however , it fluctuates ) to finish the home inspection , audit the outcomes , and choose if they need to leave the agreement .
Under most buy understandings , the purchaser can leave the agreement without a money related punishment if the home inspection uncovers exorbitant issues .
What will be canvassed in the inspection ?
The inspector will do a visual assessment of the house .
As indicated by the American Society of Home Inspectors ( ASHI ) , this survey incorporates taking note of the state of the accompanying things :
warming framework
focal cooling framework ( assuming the rainclouds hold back )
inside pipes
inside electrical frameworks
rooftop , upper room , and noticeable protection
dividers , roofs , floors
windows and entryways
establishment , storm cellar , and auxiliary segments .
What is n’t canvassed in a home inspection ?
Some first - time home purchasers accept a general home inspector will let them know completely whatever ’s the matter with the house , yet that is not the situation .
Home inspections are constrained in a couple of ways :
General home inspectors are n’t prepared in bug and risky materials intervention .
In the event that you presume a home may have termite harm , a rodent issue , or issues like asbestos protection or radon introduction , you ’ll need a strength inspector to look at those .
Things that few out of every odd home has are n’t normally examined , similar to pools , a septic framework or a well .
Home inspectors are not permitted to truly move anything during their inspection , so they can just assess what they can see .
This implies cellar framing could hide establishment splits or a love seat could shroud a harmed electrical outlet .
Where do I locate a home inspector ?
You ’re accountable for employing your own home inspector , and that incorporates discovering them .
Start with referrals from your realtor , family , and companions .
ASHI , which prepares and affirms home inspectors , has a home inspector search application , as well .
Attempt to recognize a home inspector who knows about your territory , just as the kind of home you ’re wanting to purchase , for example , a fixer upper or a condominium .
Remember that only one out of every odd state expects inspectors to get confirmation , so make certain to get some information about their preparation and accreditation .
See if your state requires permitting , and be certain your inspector has it if necessary .
Furthermore , affirmations from the American Society of Home Inspectors and the International Association of Certified Home Inspectors are the two indications of a very much prepared inspector .
Make certain to talk with inspectors , as well .
Solicit what types from things will be remembered for their report , to what extent the inspection ordinarily takes , on the off chance that they stroll on rooftops ( not all do ) , and on the off chance that they are happy to plan their inspection so you can be there .
What amount of will a home inspection cost ?
An essential home inspection costs around $ 300 to $ 500 .
That may appear to be a great deal , however it could spare you from committing an a lot bigger monetary error if a home has significant issues .
To what extent does a home inspection take ?
The real inspection could take a decent three hours , contingent upon the size of the house .
For what reason do I should be there ?
It ’s brilliant to stay with the inspector during the inspection .
On the off chance that you ca n’t be there , ask your realtor to go .
This is a decent method to find out about your latent capacity home and the entirety of its frameworks .
Pose inquiries while being mindful so as to not get in the inspector ’s way .
Preceding the inspection , you ’ll get a divulgence proclamation from the vender that may incorporate known issues with the home .
You can utilize it to assist you with choosing if there are sure things you need the inspector to look at , as exactly how awful a realized issue is .
What would it be a good idea for me to anticipate that the inspector should do ?
The inspector will do an outside stroll about and search for breaks and other basic issues on the rooftop ( starting from the earliest stage , siding , establishment .
Inside , the inspector will search for noticeable indications of form and buildup , regardless of whether there ’s water in the cellar , if the pipes or electric are not up to code , if there are carbon monoxide and smoke alarms and whether machines that pass on with the home are in working condition .
The inspector will take a great deal of photographs , and when the inspection is done , the person will set up a long and nitty gritty report .
Try not to be stunned if the inspector records 50 to 100 issues ; most will probably be little .
Indeed , even in new development homes there will be deserts that should be tended to .
What do I do with all the inspector ’s report ?
It ’s dependent upon you to choose how to manage what you realize .
Your alternatives are to :
Continue with the deal as arranged
Request that the dealer fix certain issues
Renegotiate the cost to permit you to address issues
Leave the deal
Your realtor can be a major assistance figuring out what to do .
On the off chance that all the issues are little , recollect that every single home inspection turn up various things , so you may simply need to push ahead .
In the event that you accomplish have fix work done , request that your inspector approve the work after it ’s finished .
In the event that the issues are greater and you ca n’t go to a concurrence with the merchant on what to fix or another value , you may need to leave and begin searching for another home .
In the event that your home inspection looks incredible , uplifting news !
The following thing on your home purchasing daily agenda : check for and see any easements on the property .
The Bottom Line
It is your obligation to comprehend the same number of subtleties as you can about the property you may before long call home .
Home inspections uncover the inward functions of the property , permitting you to be educated regarding all the advantages and entanglements the home brings to the table .
Information Resilience and Homeland Security

Freedom of information may be a double - edged sword , but restricting information has only one edge - and it cuts off the lifeblood of a healthy democracy .
 The public has a right to know information that may directly affect their lives . 
Post September 11 , there has been a strong push by government security and law enforcement agencies to restrict or withhold any sort of information that could possibly used to engage in or further terrorist activities .
Of course , in a society whose primary political and legal principle is supposed to be freedom of speech , this can quickly become problematic .
Particularly problematic is the fact that much of the contentious information is available on the Web sites of some of the large corporations that operate America ’s critical infrastructures .
Why is this a concern ?
Because the government is currently proposing laws that will give such companies exemption from Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests for certain information .
In other words , the government is proposing protecting certain corporate information from prying eyes , including yours and mine .
Sound far - fetched ?
Remember the weeks after 9/11 when news reports surfaced that the
For example , chemical plants and nuclear power facilities removed ‘ sensitive ’ reports and documentation about public health , environmental safety , and facility security from their websites , allegedly to preclude a terrorist from obtaining information for malicious purposes .
Absent many such reports , how will the public , watchdog groups , or regulatory or enforcement agencies be able to monitor for potential problems that affect the public ?
The fear here is that , under the guise of ‘ national security ’ the government is actually allowing corporations to avoid scrutiny by and accountability to the taxpaying public that is , in effect , paying for the critical infrastructures .
Come to think of it , perhaps Enron was getting a head start by shredding documents in the name of homeland security to avoid anyone discovering how it really operated large parts of America ’s critical energy infrastructures ?
The attempt to provide national security by obscuring corporate information has resonance in the information security world .
It brings to mind the full disclosure debate , which pits the security community ’s need to know about problems as quickly as possible against corporations ’ interests in maintaining positive public perception and market share .
Without the real - time information - sharing ventures that full disclosure enables , system administrators are placed in a ‘ holding pattern ’ , and are kept in the dark until ( umm , errr , if … ) a vendor decides to acknowledge and address a reported problem .
Both the attempt to circumvent the FOIA and to muzzle full disclosure sound very effective at thwarting evil , but in reality neither effectively enhances public security .
The community in general – be it computer users or society at large – must be able to obtain raw information about issues that potentially affect their well - being , whether that means chemical spills or the latest Windows exploits .
The general public cannot be solely dependent on any one entity for information .
Going down that path creates an environment of security through ignorance .
Despite the sensational management hype calling for this approach , it rarely works in reality .
People quickly forget that anything that a person can use ( from a knife to airplanes to automobiles and knowledge ) can be used to endanger others , provided malicious intent is present .
However , dealing with the tiny number of people capable of such malice should not mean forcing the remaining majority into a society in which information of public interest is withheld out of fear .
Law abiding citizens in a healthy democracy should not be destined to live in ignorance that is encouraged by corporations and enforced by governments .
In the United States , and elsewhere in the world , the public has a right to know information that may directly affect their lives .
If a GAO report says airport security is bad , travelers should know about it .
If a safety report says that it ’s too easy for someone to break into a chemical plant and cause an accident , the local residents should know about it .
If a dangerous vulnerability is discovered in a widely utilized operating system , systems administrators should know about it .
The list goes on .
The right to self - protection is fundamental to the right to self - determination .
By allowing corporations to withhold crucial infrastructure information , the government may be complicitous in depriving its citizenry of its most fundamental right .
Indeed , as Paul McMasters wrote in a
Terrorism , by its very definition , is unconventional .
Contrary to popular belief , there ’s no way to guard against every single form of attack .
Nor is it possible , or desirable , to withhold from public view all knowledge that could be used for malfeasance .
Information - like knowledge - is a double - edged sword .
The vast majority of those interested in information regarding America ’s critical infrastructures are not terrorists .
They should not be branded as potential terrorists or evildoers by government actions that restrict their ability to access such materials .
It may be trite to say it at this point in time , nearly eight months after the September attacks , but it is true nevertheless : if we use the events of September 11 to deny the basics rights and freedoms of a healthy democracy , the terrorists will have won .

In the current security - conscious environment , many people seem willing to sacrifice their most fundamental democratic rights to support anything that is promoted as good for homeland security .
In many cases , an unwillingness to do so is perceived as being ‘ unpatriotic ’ .
However , as has been pointed out in this column many times since September 11 , we must make sure that we are not throwing out the baby with the bathwater .
More to the point , while fulfilling reasonable patriotic duty , we must be sure that we continue to hold our government and corporations accountable for their actions , despite the fact that current challenges may appear to demand unflappable unity in the face of external attack .

Sound far - fetched ?
Remember the weeks after 9/11 when news reports surfaced that the US government was asking libraries to destroy CDs and databases that contained information about various critical infrastructures in America .
How about when the Bush Administration asked federal agencies to review and remove potentially damaging information from their Web sites ?
Or when the government asked watchdog groups like the Federation of American Scientists to remove sensitive information from their sites .
For example , chemical plants and nuclear power facilities removed ‘ sensitive ’ reports and documentation about public health , environmental safety , and facility security from their websites , allegedly to preclude a terrorist from obtaining information for malicious purposes .

Compared to all the fanfare the book The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy received , Allies for Armageddon : The Rise of Christian Zionism has virtually gone unnoticed .
However , Allies for Armageddon is as valuable a book to read , especially for those concerned about US policy towards Israel .
Journalist Victoria Clark does the difficult task of not only investigating contemporary Christian Zionism , she attended conferences , went on a guided tour to Israel , and she sat through hours of interview time with some of the leaders in this movement which number in the millions in the US alone .
The author begins the book by recounting the time she spent on a guided tour with Christian Zionist Chuck Missler .
Missler represents the prototypical Christian Zionist in that he not only supports the unconditional defense of the State of Israel , he believes it is necessary for Jews to convert to Christianity in order for the End Times to take place .
Here is where we see a major difference between Zionists and Christian Zionists –while both are adamant defenders of Israel–many Zionists are offended by Christian Zionists who want to convert them .
While Zionists certainly recognize the political and financial support that Christian Zionists provide , they must always contend with the efforts to convert Jews and the arrogance that many of them display , even while on tour in Israel .
The book is divided into two sections , with the first half dealing with the origins of Christian Zionism to the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 .
According to the author , Christian Zionism began in the early 17th Century in England about 200 years after the printing press was invented .
One of the consequences of the printing press being invented was that more and more people had access to the written word .
The Christian bible was one of the first texts to be printed and made available to the growing number of people who could read .
The Christian Reformation also provided a larger context that allowed people to interpret the bible independently of the Catholic Church .
England in particular began to be a hot bed for literal interpretation of the bible and the first time that Christians began to identify with the tribe of Israel .
The English Puritans identified heavily with the sufferings of the Israelites , thus the early waves of Europeans who invaded what is now the US , framed their landing in “ the new world ” as a contemporary version of what happen to the Israelites .
One of the consequences of this identification with Israel was that many Christians began having a growing interest in the Jewish community , the Hebrew Scriptures ( Old Testament ) , and even understanding the Hebrew language .
Both Harvard and Yale University made Hebrew a central part of their curriculum .
However , the genesis of the brand of Christian Zionism that people encounter today began in the late 19th Century US .
According to the author , there were two historical developments that contributed to the birth of contemporary Christian Zionism .
First , was Darwin ’s theory of evolution and the second was “ German Higher Criticism . ”
Darwin ’s theory challenged a Christian fundamentalist notion that humans descended directly from Adam and Eve. German Higher Criticism was a school of thought amongst some theologians that took a much more critical and less literal interpretation of the Christian and Hebrew Scriptures .
This type of scholarship took into account historical , cultural and sociological factors into account when interpreting those religious texts .
The American Christian response laid the foundation for contemporary Christian Zionism .
There were several Christian ministers who developed what is now known as Christian Zionism , but the most influential of these late 19th century Christians was Dwight L. Moody .
Moody , also known to some , as “ Crazy Moody , ” is the founder of the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago .
Moody was influential in two ways .
First , he created a methodology for interpreting the bible along with Cyrus Scofield that could be used in a classroom setting and provides average Christians with accompanying texts to better understand their faith .
The Moody Bible Institute continues to this day and is thriving as a center that promotes fundamentalist Christian belief , that include a very specific interpretation of the role of Israel in the Second Coming of Christ .
While US evangelicals were developing infrastructure to promote Christian Zionism ; in England , British officials were applying the core beliefs of biblical prophecy by moving to assist in the creation of the state of Israel .
As the father of modern Zionism , Theodore Herzel , was organizing support for a Jewish State–thousands of Jews were fleeing Russia for Palestine .
It was in this context that Lloyd George , Winston Churchill , and Lord Balfour began moving the British Empire towards the creation of the state of Israel .
According to the author , these men were deeply religious and there commitment to this biblical prophecy eventually led to the Balfour Declaration in 1917 , which formally set in motion the right of Jews to occupy Palestine .
Several years of negotiations led to Zionist groups organizing military brigades to forcibly remove Palestinians .
One British military man who helped organize these brigades , Orde Wingate , was also a Christian Zionist .
Clark states that “ Wingate devoted himself to training what would become the core of Israel ’s army today , the Haganah .
Soon he was spying for the Zionists and leading ‘ Special Night Squads ’ in pre-emptive raids on Arab villages or on missions to deliver scandalously brutal reprisals . ”
The second half of Victoria Clark ’s book deals with Christian Zionism since the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 , particularly since the 1967 Six - Day War .
The first major proponent of Christian Zionism in the late 1960s was author of the evangelical classic The Late Great Planet Earth , Hal Lindsey .
Lindsey became famous shortly after his book and was a sought after speaker .
By the 1970s , Lindsey was sharing his interpretation of biblical prophecy with America ’s Air War College and even the Pentagon , according to Clark .
The Late Great Planet Earth was an influential book for former President Ronald Reagan and even former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin .
Lindsey continues to write , preach and advocate for the ongoing US support for the state of Israel .
Lindsey even claims to have predicted the Israeli assault on Lebanon in 2006 .
In 2006 , Newsweek interviewed Lindsey about his support for Israel .
When asked about the success of the US dependent on its support for Israel , Lindsey says :
“ I believe one of the reasons God has protected the U.S. , despite the fact we have driven God from the public forum in our country , is because we have sought to protect Israel ’s right to exist in secure borders .
We have also been a safe haven for Israelites .
When God gave the solemn covenant to Abraham that He would make him and his descendents into a special nation , He gave this special promise of protection , ‘ I will bless those who bless you , and the one who curses you I will curse . ’
( Gen. 12:3 ) I believe God blesses those who help Israel .
The rise and fall of nations can be traced to how they treated the Jews . ”
In addition to Lindsey , other prominent Christian Zionists in the US consist of Pat Robertson , former US Presidential candidate Gary Bauer , Jerry Falwell , Ted Haggard , and the co-authors of the apocalyptic book series Left Behind , Jerry Jenkins , and Tim LaHaye .
Clark not only points out that these Christian Zionists not only have the support of millions of Americans , they also have regular access to policy makers in Washington .
Any one of these big name Evangelicals can get believers to send thousands of e-mails to the White House to pressure the government in favor of Israel .
This type of ongoing lobbying has led to the creation of groups like Christians United for Israel , which has as its sole purpose the protection of the state of Israel .
However , quite possibly the most influential Christian Zionist in America today is TV Evangelist John Hagee .
Clark devotes a whole chapter to Hagee , whom she interviewed in 2006 at his massive complex in San Antonio , Texas .
The author says that upon entering the Hagee compound she was approached by his security guards known as PAWS – “ Pastor ’s Ass - whoppers . ”
Hagee himself came to the conclusion that Israel needed unconditional support of the US after he made a visit in 1978 .
Now Hagee hosts an annual event called the Night to Honor Israel .
Hagee ’s organization has raised millions of dollars to support Israel and the construction of Israeli settlements through his ministry .
His 2006 book Jerusalem Countdown provides biblical explanations for current events in the Middle East .
Hagee endorsed the Israeli bombing of Lebanon in the summer of 2006 and advocates that the US or Israel should drop a nuclear bomb on Iran .
In many ways , Allies for Armageddon is similar to the groundbreaking book on the US religious right by Sara Diamond , Spiritual Warfare : The Politics of the Christian Right .
Diamond argued in 1989 when Spiritual Warfare was published that progressives in the US cannot afford to easily dismiss the power and influence that the Christian Right has on American politics .
After reading Victoria Clark ’s book on Christian Zionism , I would argue that those who care about justice not dismiss Christian Zionists as just a bunch of crazies .
If the unconditional US support for Israel is to be challenged , then an understanding of the role of Christian Zionism is absolutely necessary .
Allies for Armageddon can help us all find that understanding .

Google - owned FeedBurner is set to launch AdSense for RSS next week according to a post on the company ’s blog .
Much like the AdSense for Web sites , AdSense for RSS will show contextual text advertising in publisher ’s RSS feeds .
In other words , if you ’re reading a blog post about mobile phones in Google Reader , you might see ads for AT&T , Verizon , and Sprint .
How will AdSense for RSS work in conjunction with the ads Feedburner already sells and displays ?
The company explains :
“ Publishers already in the FeedBurner Ad Network will continue to see premium CPM ads directly sold onto their content , but with the added bonus of contextually targeted ads that will fill up the remainder of their inventory .
That means you get the best of both worlds : a dedicated Google sales force that knows how and why to sell onto your content , with the added revenue that full back - fill coverage provides . ”
This is huge news for content publishers .
As we know first - hand , monetization on RSS feeds to - date has been mediocre at best compared to Web - based advertising , and with an increasing amount of reading and conversation taking place off - site , that ’s a brewing problem in the world of content publishing .
It also means that the few remaining hold outs who only publish partial feeds ( I 'm looking at you CNET and The New York Times ) may finally offer full feeds , since they can now be effectively monetized .
On the other hand , for RSS consumers , it probably means the free ride is over .
While Feedburner has seemingly been neglected by Google since it was acquired , the strategy behind the deal is now coming full circle , as Google has effectively cornered the market on RSS monetization .
They own the # 1 ( or # 2 depending on who you ask ) feed reader in Google Reader , the dominant feed management tool , and now what sounds like the most comprehensive way to monetize RSS , with Google 's huge base of advertisers already signed up ( via AdWords ) to participate .
Expect the full details of the AdSense for RSS program to be announced next week .
Fellow car manufacturers have paid tribute to Mr Pininfarina
Andrea Pininfarina , head of a world - famous Italian car design group , has been killed in a road accident .
Mr Pininfarina was riding a scooter which was hit by a car on the outskirts of Turin early on Thursday .
He was 51 .
He was chief executive officer of the family firm Pininfarina , which has designed sports cars for Ferrari , Maserati , Volvo and Fiat .
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Ferrari's Luca Cordero di Montezemolo were among those paying tribute .
Mr Berlusconi labelled him " the representative of a dynasty that helped bring the story of ' made in Italy ' to the world " .
Mr di Montezemolo , who is also boss of Fiat , said : " Italy , Turin and the Fiat group have lost a business figure who knew how to follow and develop the work of his grandfather Pinin and his father Sergio . "
The driver of the car involved in the collision was admitted to hospital suffering from shock , Ansa news agency reported .
Family firm
Maserati was among the car brands to call on Pininfarina 's expertise
Mr Pininfarina , survived by three children , trained as a mechanical engineer .
He joined the family business in 1983 after working in the US .
He was the grandson of Battista Pininfarina , who founded the firm in Turin in 1930 .
Andrea 's father Sergio Pininfarina , 81 , is the company 's honorary chairman .
The family currently controls 55 % of Pininfarina 's shares , but under a restructuring plan it aims to cut its stake to about 30 % .
The firm recorded a net loss of 114.9 m euros ( £ 91 m ; $ 178 m ) last year .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) -
At least a dozen shoppers , many of them retirees , were injured in a rush to buy cheap cooking oil and eggs on offer at a supermarket in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing , according to a local newspaper .
Four were taken to the hospital , including a 58 - year - old woman who broke several bones .
The oldest , a woman surnamed Wu , was 81 , the Yangtze Evening News reported on Wednesday .
A stampede at a store in Chongqing last year killed three and injured dozens .
The Chinese government responded by ordering supermarkets to control special promotions .
Blogs are a great way to interact with other atheists , agnostics , skeptics , secular humanists , and freethinkers on the Internet .
Online forums provide another opportunity .
They tend to be more egalitarian in that anyone can begin a thread .
This means that participants do not have to wait for the blogger to write a post on a particular subject .
Many also provide an ideal place for some atheist vs. theist or even atheist vs. agnostic debate for those of you who like that sort of thing .
If you are interested in finding an atheist forum , I have assembled a short list of some worthwhile options to investigate below .
I should point out that while I am familiar with a few of them , it has been several years since I was active on any of them .
Too much blogging , too little time I suppose .
Atheist Forums
The following , in no particular order , are some atheist forums worth checking out :
One quick word of advice when it comes to forums : take a look at the rules before you start posting .
Forums vary considerably in what they are trying to accomplish , and this is often reflected in the rules they adopt .
Some are more restrictive than others , and some can be quick to ban visitors who break them .
To save yourself the aggravation , take a look at the rules first and decide whether you are willing to comply with them .
What About Reddit ?
Depending on why you are seeking an atheist forum and the sort of thing you are hoping to find there , I 'd be remiss if I did not also mention Reddit and Voat ( think of Voat as a much smaller alternative version of Reddit that emphasizes free expression ) .
I tend to think of them as link aggregators rather than forums , but they do seem to serve many of the same functions a forum does fairly well .
Both have many options worth checking out , but the two largest would be :
Are n't Internet Forums Dead ?
If you are new to either platform and want to get a sense of how they work and what sort of content you will find there , those would be where I 'd recommend starting .
It does seem like social media has replaced Internet forums for many people , but I do not think they are dead yet .
Some atheists refuse to use platforms like Facebook ( for many good reasons ) , and atheist forums continue to provide them with another option for interacting with other atheists online .
My guess is that they are not as popular as they once were , but that just might make them more manageable .
An early version of this post appeared on Atheist Revolution in 2008 .
It was revised and expanded in 2019 with a focus on replacing links to forums which were no longer active .
Rather , they suggest that a series of building code violations  and perhaps firefighting problems , as well  led to the tragedy .
Construction workers ’ removal of a section of the building ’s standpipe left firefighters without water on the upper floors , and local fire companies failed to conduct regular inspections of the building  although it is unclear whether inspectors would have noticed the broken standpipe in a maze of pipes in the building ’s basement , or if they simply would have checked to see the standpipe in place in the stairwells .
It has been known from the day of the fire that the struggle to get water on the flames was great .
But few understood just how long that struggle lasted  now pinpointed by investigators at more than an hour , an eternity in the dangerous , fast - moving conditions of a high - rise fire .
In encountering the many hazards at the building , investigators found , firefighters improvised in their response and broke rules .
They pushed their emergency air packs beyond the 45 - minute limit in providing oxygen ; they removed their face pieces in an effort to save air ; they ignored warnings of being in danger ; one firefighter rode atop a construction elevator .
Firefighter Beddia was overcome by smoke .
After his colleagues pulled him from a spot near Stairway B on the 14th floor , his air pack was found to still hold 800 pounds per square inch of compressed air  or about five to eight minutes ’ worth of air , considering that a full tank has 4,500 pounds per square inch .
Investigators have surmised that Firefighter Beddia must have removed his face piece and pushed the manual shut - off switch of his air pack before he became unconscious .
Investigators could not say why Firefighter Beddia removed his face piece .
In describing some of the risky tactics employed by firefighters at the scene , the investigators were careful to qualify their criticism , saying that the culture of the department was rich with a kind of “ can - do ” attitude , according to people who are aware of the findings .
Francis X. Gribbon , the Fire Department ’s chief spokesman , said the department had been scheduling time this week to brief the families of Firefighters Graffagnino and Beddia , as well as the firefighters involved in the fire , about the inquiry ’s findings .
He said the department would not comment publicly on the findings until the families had been briefed .
Pisco residents blamed corruption and red tape for holding up reconstruction Thousands of Peruvians have marched in protest at what they say is the inadequate official response to a quake a year ago that killed 519 people .
The protest took place in the city of Pisco , one of the worst affected by the 8.0 - magnitude tremor that also left more than 300,000 people homeless .
Strikes were held in Ica and Chincha , which were also near the epicentre .
The government says the scale of the devastation hindered reconstruction , but accepts it could have been quicker .
So far , about 30,000 families have received government credits worth $ 2,045 ( £ 1,100 ) to help build new homes and bonds for a further 8,000 families are pending .
' Raised in inequality '
Marching through the main square thousands of Pisco residents showed their frustration that much of their city is still in ruins a year on from the earthquake .
Some began at midnight , banging pots and pans and marching around the city 's main square .

Others filed past the empty space left by the San Clemente church , which collapsed burying its congregation and killing more than 100 people .
The BBC's Dan Collyns , who watched the protest , says the church 's open plot is a reminder that the citizens of this fishing port are still mourning .
But they are also angry at the slow pace of the reconstruction and blame government corruption and red tape for holding it up , our correspondent says .
Banners called for President Alan Garcia to tell the truth about where the $ 382 m supposedly spent on the reconstruction had gone , and why so many people had still not received compensation to rebuild their homes .
" At this rate , reconstruction will last 10 years and a generation of our citizens , of our children , will be raised in inequality because they live in huts and have nowhere to study , " said the governor of Ica province , Romulo Triveno .
Mr Garcia 's popularity has suffered , our correspondent says , and critics argue that he has missed an opportunity to show he could use Peru 's strong economic growth to do a good job of reconstruction .
Others say with Peru's weak institutions and poor infrastructure efforts were doomed from the start .

What are these ?
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - By Freddie Mac ’s own admission , it has a negative net worth -- the latest reported net market value of the mortgage giant ’s assets is negative $ 5.6 billion .
The corporate logo for Freddie Mac is seen at its REUTERS / Larry Downing
To some investors , that means its shares should be trading closer to zero .
Bears argue that the company ’s bonds are a reasonable investment given the U.S. government ’s increasingly explicit support , but its shares are a more questionable investment .
Freddie Mac ’s shares moved closer to zero on Wednesday , dropping nearly 20 percent to $ 6.49 after it posted a much - wider - than - expected quarterly loss of $ 821 million .
But Freddie ’s $ 4.2 billion market capitalization signals that at least some investors still see value in the company .
“ Investors are betting that Freddie Mac can keep the show going long enough for either a recovery in the economy or the housing market , or to get help from the government , ” said Dan Alpert , managing director at investment bank Westwood Capital .
There may be some sense to that bet .
The U.S. housing market is showing early signs of bottoming out , even if it is not yet recovering .
A report last week said home prices in May in 20 major regions fell 0.9 percent from April , which was less than expected and not as severe as the prior month .
And some investors believe market values for many mortgages are distressed , and will rise again as the housing market stabilizes , meaning that fair value may not accurately reflect the real value of the assets .
But few deny that the mortgage market is aching now .
“ Today ’s challenging economic environment suggests that the housing market is far from stabilizing , ” Freddie Mac Chief Executive Richard Syron said on a conference call with analysts and investors .
“ We now think that we are halfway through the overall peak - to - trough decline . ”
Investors are manifestly concerned about the stability of Freddie and larger sibling Fannie Mae , which together own or guarantee just under half the country ’s $ 12 trillion of mortgage debt .
Freddie ’s shares have lost nearly 90 percent of their value in the last year , and Fannie ’s nearly 80 percent .
Freddie and Fannie faced a storm of stock selling in July as investors speculated they would fall short of the capital needed to offset losses sustained from delinquent mortgages and help stabilize the housing market .
The U.S. government arranged emergency measures to provide extra support to the companies .
CAPITAL HOPES
Freddie Mac hopes to raise $ 5.5 billion of additional capital to bolster its balance sheet , but in a sense that would just bring it back to about zero : the company ’s assets had a negative $ 5.6 billion net fair value at June 30 , compared with their accounting value of $ 12.9 billion , according to financial statements Freddie posted on Wednesday .
“ I think there ’s plenty of reason in today ’s report to think that $ 5.5 billion might not be adequate , ” said Frederick Cannon , chief equity strategist at Keefe , Bruyette & Woods in San Francisco .
To the extent that the government provides extra support for Freddie Mac , it might be painful for equity holders , Westwood ’s Alpert said .
“ Either investors are going to be massively diluted given the amount of equity they are going to need or they are going to be nationalized , ” Alpert said .
A Freddie Mac spokesman declined to comment .
“ We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , “
When you read the preamble to the Declaration of Independence remember what the world looked like to the men who wrote it .
Then look at our world through their eyes ; understanding their world and the institutions they used routinely brings understanding of what has gone so wrong with our world today .
Their world was the same and different .
The agreement to go to war came after a long process of discourse over the issues , not by leaders , but by ordinary people .
The Committees of Correspondence drove a dialogue on why the people should govern themselves , enacting formally what they had been doing for two centuries .
They were a people who expected to cooperate , looking across into each other 's eyes , never up to anyone in government .
Over that time they had built a vibrant and robust society that was stretching out in all directions .
The people governed themselves , using of a system of organizing tools , proven over time .
Those tools were town government operating with transparency , ensuring that real control remained directly in the hands of the people .
For justice , they used the Common Law , brought with them from England .
Control of the functions of government through the town ensured that government would never eat up the seed corn .
Direct scrutiny by the people on what was spent , the authority always with them to approve or deny , kept government small and honest .
Delving back in time you see these people assumed that no one went into government to make money or secure their retirement because the pay was terrible and there were no benefits .
Those serving in government were assumed to have enough money to be able to donate their time .
That model still persists in some parts of New England .
The same principles were in use for the justice system through the Common Law Courts .
Judges performed a service to the community , drawing from their own time to do so .
In use by the people for centuries , the common law was not something apart from the people but like the air they breathed .
School children saw it operating and were prepared to use it themselves when they became adults .
Going to court was serious , a process treated with respect , but instead of dividing them they entered into that process knowing that , ultimately , there would be justice .
Contrast that to how the system of courts looks to us today .
The Common Law is a system for justice that is handled directly by the people .
That is the system our Founders assumed would continue ; it was one of those tools , used sparingly , that allowed a free people to govern themselves directly .
Town government , with its absolute transparency and resulting low costs , along with the Common Law , were the foundation for freedom that the Founders assumed would continue .
Elections handled directly by the people ; the votes totaled openly and transparently .
Spending by government overseen directly by the people .
Common law courts that possessed the right to judge both the facts and the law .
The system worked .
It remains the system intended by our Founders .
It can still work today .
How do we become , again , a people who govern themselves ?
That we can do so is inherent in our mission statement .
The Declaration of Independence says ,
“ That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security . ”
The first Amendment of the Bill of Rights owes its existence to a common law case heard in New York in 1735 .
In 1735 the Royal Governor of New York attempted to suborn the right of jury to decide fact and law .
It had begun with the publication of the New - York Weekly Journal in 1633 with Zenger as the editor .
The paper began because Crosby , the Royal Governor , was corrupt and the people needed the truth .
Zenger was arrested and incarcerated for telling the truth on November 17 , 1734 .
The bail set made his release impossible .
The Zenger Case was heard on August 4th of that year saw a jury of twelve men render the verdict of not guilty , thus overthrowing the law and setting a course that lead to the principle that the truth is its own defense .
It was this case that remained in the minds of our Founders when they wrote the Bill of Rights , addendum to the Constitution , which was intended to limit government , never us .
The verdict of Not Guilty affirmed the right of anyone to break a law that violated the conscience of the community and the right of an individual to speak the truth .
The Zenger Case is with you any time you serve on a jury .
The Common Law is the muscle behind our rights .
Many today think of the Common Law as antiquated and impractical ; nothing could be further from the truth .
The disused understanding of these tools are waiting for us to pick up .
They are easy to use and bring with them amazing benefits , also forgotten , that created the American people as different from any nation on the face of the Earth .
When you are empaneled as a juror on a Common Law Court you already understand that this is a grave responsibility .
You take up the charge to become , with those others serving , the conscience of your community .
You leave behind you any prejudices .
Those who serve understand they must see the matter at hand dispassionately , demand the facts , scrutinize the evidence , see beyond evasion to the root of the issues .
Then , the juror must reflect on each other point , listening as if the life of their community depended on it .
America itself owes its existence , in part , to another case where the jury refused to violate the conscience of the community and the right of the individual .
That jury heard its case in England in 1670 .
King Charles
II demanded the prosecution of William Penn for the crime of preaching his Quaker faith .
The jury foreman , Edward Bushel , along with the rest of the jury , found the law unjust , in violation of the people 's right to worship .
The case was heard at the Old - Bailey from the 1st to the and 5th of Sept .
Afterwards , the jury was incarcerated for returning a verdict that outraged the judge .
He directed that the jury reconsider their verdict .
They retired and returned with the same verdict , Not Guilty .
The judge then confined the jury in Newgate Prison to remain without food or water until the desired verdict was rendered .
They continued to hold that William Penn was not guilty .
Eventually they were fined and released .
William Penn , then 26 immigrated to Pennsylvania .
The lesson of the right of the jury to decide is the birth right of all Americans and the midwife of our freedom .
The Common Law and its principles remain in use , though those now in power try to disguise their existence .
A pivotal example of the same kind of courage shown in the Zenger and Penn cases took place in the township of Credit River , Minnesota on 12th December 1968 .
The issue was the fraud being perpetrated by banks across the world .
It is known as the Credit River Case .
Jerome Daly faced eviction from his home .
Daly had sued the bank , his house in foreclosure ; while reviewing the papers and practices he had noticed that the mortgage was issued with no legal consideration .
The verdict rendered hinged on the admission by the president of the First National Bank of Montgomary that there was no legal consideration with the loan written for Jerome Daly 's mortgage .
The bank president testified , this was standard banking practice exercised by their bank in combination with the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis , another private bank , further that he knew of no United States Statute or law that gave the plaintiff the authority to do this . ”
Daly kept his home .
Two weeks later the judge in the case , Mahoney , was murdered .
No one ever said that freedom and justice would come without costs .
Courts that follow the common law accept the tenet that the jury decides on all issues , both fact and law ; they can demand more information .
Nothing is hidden from them .
The judge is only there to be called on by the jury .
They must understand that the rights of individuals trump statute , and , most importantly , they are acting as the incarnation of the conscience of the community .
Arguably , the most important check and balance to power in government is the power of the informed jury to decide on the issues of both of law and fact .
Today , we as Americans face the need to restore to use the tools that connect us to our own power , granted not by government , but by God .
Start with your local county , establish your own Heritage Association on the common law and the Constitution .
Let your local law enforcement know what their obligations are under the Constitution .
Celebrate Jury Rights Day , September 5th .
Get to know the Fully Informed Jury Association .
A free people will govern themselves ; a people who will be free do it themselves .
Black communities were forgotten during the recovery from the Great Recession .
We can't let that happen again .
Black , Latino , and Native American youth , overshadowed by the plight of their wealthier , whiter peers , simply did n't receive the same resources and support , and the recovery left them behind .
Now , we risk making the same mistake again .

The RNC is crying over the very accurate ad that the DNC is running about John McCain .
You remember his ' I 'll stay in Iraq for 100 years , " statement ?
Well , they are trying to force MSNBC and CNN to stop running the ad .
Marc Ambinder reports this : ( his link is broken so I 'm posting it )
The Republican National Committee wants CNN and MSNBC to stop airing the DNC 's new national television advertisement , calling it " false and defamatory " and illegally coordinated .
" This is a complaint about the facts that are being misrepresented in the ad , and this being a deliberate falsehood , that we are saying , stations have an obligation to protect the public from airing a deliberate falsehood , " said Sean Cairncross , an RNC lawyer .
The RNC provided no evidence to support their change that the communication was illegally coordinated , aside for a few newspaper articles pointing out that some Democrats work for both a candidate and the committee , like pollster Cornell Belcher .
DNC chairman Howard Dean said this morning that neither campaign saw or heard the ad before the put it out .
The RNC is ginning up the threat of legal action to give weight to their criticism of the ad's content .
Cairncross would not say whether the party will sue CNN or MSNBC , the two cable networks airing the ad , if they refuse to kill it .
I noticed that FOX News was n't included in Marc 's story so my question to Howard Dean was if the DNC had already submitted the ad to FOX News and if so --- did they approve or decline to run the ad ?
The DNC said they did send it to FOX News , but so far have not been given a response on it .
Maybe they are waiting for the RNC 's blessing .
Either way , no answer is an answer .
“ I do n’t know if it ’s going to be the youthful , happening Woodstock they want it to be , but it certainly has the potential , ” said Corby Kummer , a food columnist , book author and Slow Food board member .
“ It will be a failure if it is only well - dressed people over 35 from the Bay Area treating it as if it ’s another Ferry Plaza Farmers Market ”  a reference to the place where well - fed San Franciscans and celebrity farmers chat over perfect peaches and soft , ripe cheese .
Carlo Petrini , a charismatic Italian who writes about food and wine , started Slow Food with friends who shared his notion that left wing politics and gastronomic pleasure could be happily married .
The international organization has grown to 86,000 members and become an industry in Mr. Petrini ’s hometown , Bra , Italy .
There are Slow Food restaurants , a university and a hotel .

The group ’s budget is about $ 39 million , and subsidized by the Italian government .
Much of the organization ’s work involves identifying traditional foods , like Ethiopian white honey or Amalfi sfusato lemons , and designing ways to help the people who produce them .
Its philosophy  that food is about much more than cooking and eating  is often hammered home by Mr. Petrini on his frequent trips around the world .
“ I always say a gastronome who is n’t an environmentalist is just stupid , and I say an environmentalist who is n’t a gastronome is just sad , ” he said through an interpreter in an interview last year .
In the late 1990s , Mr. Petrini ’s ideas were quickly embraced by people on America ’s coasts who were fans of farmers ’ markets , local food and a slower , more reflective way of life .
Ms. Waters , who had spent more than two decades advocating delicious organic food and the small farms that grew it , was among them .

There are fears that music piracy among children is endemic
The charity Childnet is launching a global information campaign to warn children about the potential dangers of downloading music illegally .
The campaign , which is supported by the music industry , will distribute a pocket - sized guide to schools and colleges in 21 countries .
Childnet says the risks include breach of copyright , the threat of viruses and the loss of privacy and security .
The charity works to promote child safety on the internet .
Over recent years , the music industry has launched a wave of lawsuits to try to deter young people from sharing copyrighted material over the internet .
That campaign appears to have had little impact on the behaviour of young music fans .
The message can be boiled down to " Limewire - bad , iTunes - good " although it does n't use those exact words
Rory Cellan - Jones , Technology correspondent

Now the industry is trying new tactics , including urging internet service providers to cut off the accounts of users who are frequent file - sharers .
But the music industry also believes that it can change behaviour by educating both children and parents , and this latest initiative by Childnet forms part of that campaign .
Potential dangers
The guide , which has been published with the help of funding from the music trade body the International Federation of the Phonographic Industries , sets out the potential dangers of using peer - to - peer networks to share music .
" Copying or distributing copyrighted material such as music , films , games and software without permission or payment is illegal , " it says .
File - swappers are vulnerable to risks such as viruses and unwelcome content
Childnet guide
It goes on to warn : " File - swappers are vulnerable to risks such as viruses and unwelcome content . "
There 's also a warning that parents can be held responsible for the illegal activities of their children .
Childnet quotes research which shows that one third of young people in Europe regularly share music using peer - to - peer networks , three times the proportion that use official music sites .
Its leaflet explains that there are scores of legal music retailers on the web , which are safe and guarantee sound quality .
Amongst the campaign 's backers are the musician Ronan Keating , the British Musicians Union , and the Internet Service Providers Association .
Childnet also quotes 17 - year - old Laura , who says she has given up using one of the peer - to - peer services : " I used to use Limewire but did n't realise it was wrong and my parents did n't know what I was doing . "

What are these ?
One of richest pathways towards improving the level of community coordination in the event of disaster / disconnection , is through the use of community Web sites that provide actionable information ( here 's an example of how this worked in San Diego during the recent fires ) and reverse 911 data - sharing .
Unfortunately , community emergency
Web sites as well as basic data services are extremely vulnerable to disconnection .
What 's needed are smart local networks .
Smart Local Networks
( a local Internet or community Intranet )
Most of the local loops ( from telco fiber to cable company coaxial ) currently in place and / or being installed in the US are dumb ( I suspect it is the same globally ) .
They simply route data from local customers to regionally clustered corporate server farms and then outwards / back .
This means that any disconnection ( physical or logical fault ) between local customers and these remote systems will result in a complete cessation of service .
To correct this deficiency , communities need to start to think more like a corporation : security of data services are considered central to a company 's survival .
So , as part of future negotiations with cable / telcos , communities should request that companies allow them to piggyback on their " dumb " networks to create a smart local loops .
This would entail :
@yogibimbi : " the problem for some of you could be that of a musician who is listening to music :
You are cursed to never really be able to enjoy the music as a whole , but are always going into the details and even the best performers in this world still make frequent errors . "
Well , as a composer and multi- instrumentalist , I 'll say I do n't have that affliction , nor do my peers .
( or I would n't work with them ! )
I am not shackled by the narrow minded , one style bullshit or perfectionist crap either .
As far as the " whole " ... sorry , but if a tiny part of a composition is lame , that detracts from the " whole " .
You can't blow 16 bars of drivel and then expect the listener to appreciate the rest = cross eyed character is DISTRACTING .
Either way , I would n't even compare this to " 300 " ... since they are two completely different applications .
" 300 " does n't have any cross-eyed characters , only gratuitous slow - mo and lots of blood .
Although the idea that instrumental learning can occur subconsciously has been around for nearly a century , it had not been unequivocally demonstrated .
Now , a new study published by Cell Press in the August 28 issue of the journal Neuron used sophisticated perceptual masking , computational modeling , and neuroimaging to show that instrumental learning can occur in the human brain without conscious processing of contextual cues .
" Humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning , " says lead author Dr. Mathias Pessiglione from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at the University College London .
" Such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning between subliminal signals present in a given situation and choice outcomes . "
For instance , a seasoned poker player may play more successfully because of a learned association between monetary outcomes and subliminal behavioral manifestations of their opponents .
To investigate this phenomenon , Dr. Pessiglione and colleagues created visual cues from scrambled , novel , abstract symbols .
Visual awareness was assessed by displaying two of the masked cues and asking subjects if they perceived any difference .
" We reasoned that if subjects were unable to correctly perceive any difference between the masked cues , then they were also unable to build conscious representations of cue - outcome associations , " explains Dr. Pessiglione .
In the next set of experiments , subjects performed a subliminal conditioning task that employed the same masking procedure , but the cues were now paired with monetary outcomes .
Using this methodology , the researchers observed that pairing rewards and punishments guided behavioral responses and even conditioned preferences for abstract cues that subjects could not consciously see .
The researchers collected scans of the brain , using functional magnetic resonance imaging , to investigate the specific brain circuitry that is linked to subliminal instrumental conditioning .
" The ventral striatum responded to subliminal cues and to visible outcomes in a manner that closely approximates our computational algorithm , expressing reward expected values and prediction errors , " says Dr. Pessiglione .
" We conclude that , even without conscious processing of contextual cues , our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making . "

The Norwegian coastguard captured this footage of the Prolific discarding up to 80 % of its catch of endangered fish Norway government coastguard
A British trawler has sparked an international incident after being filmed taking a boatload of endangered fish caught in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and then dumping the majority overboard in UK waters .
Norwegian government coastguards filmed the crew of the Prolific , a Shetland - based trawler , openly discarding more than 5,000 kg of cod and other dead white fish , or nearly 80 % of its catch .
According to the coastguard , the boat had previously been inspected in Norwegian waters and declared legal , before crossing into UK waters where it dumped its load .
The incident took place on 2 August but the video only came to light in Britain yesterday .
It is illegal to discard fish in Norwegian waters , but boats are forced to do so in European Union waters if they have caught the wrong species of fish or fish that are too small .
Last year the EU estimated that between 40 % and 60 % of all fish caught by trawlers in the North sea is discarded .
The practice of dumping is widely recognised as unsustainable but inevitable given the present EU quota system .
Yesterday , Norwegian minister for fisheries and coastal affairs Helga Pedersen , speaking to angry fishing communities in northern Norway who had seen the film , said she would press for review of the EU fishing policy and wanted to ban any boat discarding fish that were caught in Norwegian waters .
" Discarding fish not only means a massive waste of food and potential income , it also leads to unrecorded catches , resulting in a poorer scientific basis for our management decisions " , she said .
" I want a requirement that all fish caught in Norwegian waters , also by foreign vessels , must be taken to port , regardless of which final port is used .
We will introduce new requirements , as a condition for obtaining licenses to fish , that vessels cannot discard valuable fish caught here " .
Reidar Kaarbø , an independent analyst of Norwegian government policy said : " This must stop now .
The EU community cannot be taken seriously if it allows this kind of behaviour .
This is certainly not how to manage the world 's resources . "
UK fish experts said the practice of discarding fish was common but had rarely been so dramatically documented .
Opinions were split on whether the Prolific was discarding fish for which it had no quota , or that it was " high - grading " its catch .
This involves boats discarding low - value small fish to make room for high value larger fish .
" It is a disgrace .
This practice is depleting populations that are already overfished and it is happening everywhere " , said Willie MacKenzie , Greenpeace fisheries campaigner .
" All of these fish are perfectly marketable , and have been legally caught .
But if you are a fisherman it makes more economic sense to take boat to market with the most saleable fish , so you discard the lowest value stuff . "
European Union quotas strictly limit the amount of fish that ships can bring back to port , but there is no restriction on the amount of fish they can catch .
The current EU quota system for fish sets quotas at individual species level , which are then allocated and traded amongst individual fishermen .
Often they will buy quotas out at sea once they know what they are catching .
This means that it is illegal to take back to port fish they have no quota for so these fish are discarded .
The solution , say environment groups , involves an overhaul of fisheries management , making discards illegal , and encouraging more sustainable fishing methods .
Yesterday , the Prolific could not be contacted but the ship 's agents , LHD Ltd of Lerwick , said that it was rare for it to fish in Norwegian waters .
" It is out of contact .
We very rarely fish in Norwegian waters .
That 's the first time in years , " said managing director Richie Simpson .
" The reason there are discards is the ridiculously low quotas .
Fishermen cannot make a living with them .
They are at a ridiculous level . "
The International council for the exploration of the sea , the leading scientific body for fisheries scientific , has repeatedly advised the EU that stocks of cod in the North Sea are much too low to be fished and has argued for no - go areas .
However , every year the European government ministers override their advice and continue with a quota system .
A spokesman for the department of the environment , food and rural affairs ( Defra ) said : " Throwing dead fish back into the sea is a waste that nobody wants to see , but there is no easy answer .
The UK is keen to ensure more effective and sustainable fisheries by reducing by - catch and discards , and the government is working closely with fishermen to achieve that . "

The United States ’ so - called war on drugs brings to mind the old saying that if you find yourself trapped in a deep hole , stop digging .
Yet , last week , the Senate approved an aid package to combat drug trafficking in Mexico and Central America , with a record $ 400 million going to Mexico and $ 65 million to Central America .
The United States has been spending $ 69 billion a year worldwide for the last 40 years , for a total of $ 2.5 trillion , on drug prohibition -- with little to show for it .
Is anyone actually benefiting from this war ?
Six groups come to mind .
The first group are the drug lords in nations such as Colombia , Afghanistan and Mexico , as well as those in the United States .
They are making billions of dollars every year -- tax free .
The second group are the street gangs that infest many of our cities and neighborhoods , whose main source of income is the sale of illegal drugs .
Advertisement
Third are those people in government who are paid well to fight the first two groups .
Their powers and bureaucratic fiefdoms grow larger with each tax dollar spent to fund this massive program that has been proved not to work .
Fourth are the politicians who get elected and reelected by talking tough -- not smart , just tough -- about drugs and crime .
But the tougher we get in prosecuting nonviolent drug crimes , the softer we get in the prosecution of everything else because of the limited resources to fund the criminal justice system .
The fifth group are people who make money from increased crime .
They include those who build prisons and those who staff them .
The prison guards union is one of the strongest lobbying groups in California today , and its ranks continue to grow .
And last are the terrorist groups worldwide that are principally financed by the sale of illegal drugs .
Advertisement
Who are the losers in this war ?
Literally everyone else , especially our children .
Today , there are more drugs on our streets at cheaper prices than ever before .
There are more than 1.2 million people behind bars in the U.S. , and a large percentage of them for nonviolent drug usage .
Under our failed drug policy , it is easier for young people to obtain illegal drugs than a six - pack of beer .
Why ?
Because the sellers of illegal drugs do n’t ask kids for IDs .
As soon as we outlaw a substance , we abandon our ability to regulate and control the marketing of that substance .
After we came to our senses and repealed alcohol prohibition , homicides dropped by 60 % and continued to decline until World War II .
Today ’s murder rates would likely again plummet if we ended drug prohibition .
So what is the answer ?
Start by removing criminal penalties for marijuana , just as we did for alcohol .
If we were to do this , according to state budget figures , California alone would save more than $ 1 billion annually , which we now spend in a futile effort to eradicate marijuana use and to jail nonviolent users .
Is it any wonder that marijuana has become the largest cash crop in California ?

We could generate billions of dollars by taxing the stuff , just as we do with tobacco and alcohol .
We should also reclassify most Schedule I drugs ( drugs that the federal government alleges have no medicinal value , including marijuana and heroin ) as Schedule II drugs ( which require a prescription ) , with the government regulating their production , overseeing their potency , controlling their distribution and allowing licensed professionals ( physicians , psychiatrists , psychologists , etc. ) to prescribe them .
This course of action would acknowledge that medical issues , such as drug addiction , are best left under the supervision of medical doctors instead of police officers .
The mission of the criminal justice system should always be to protect us from one another and not from ourselves .
That means that drug users who drive a motor vehicle or commit other crimes while under the influence of these drugs would continue to be held criminally responsible for their actions , with strict penalties .
But that said , the system should not be used to protect us from ourselves .
Ending drug prohibition , taxing and regulating drugs and spending tax dollars to treat addiction and dependency are the approaches that many of the world ’s industrialized countries are taking .
Those approaches are ones that work .

Faced with the dramatically spiralling costs of wheat , rice and corn , the World Food Programme has made an unprecedented appeal for at least $ 500 m ( £ 250 m ) to help it continue supplying food aid to 73 million needy people this year .
Josette Sheeran , the organisation 's executive director , told journalists yesterday that this was the first time in its history that the WFP had appealed for funds , not because of a crisis caused by famine or war but because of market conditions .
And she warned that if extra resources were not received before the beginning of May , food rations would have to be cut .
" This is the new face of hunger , " she said .
" People are simply being priced out of food markets .
It 's the first time we have been hit by a dramatic market surprise .
We have never before had a situation where aggressive rises in food prices keep pricing our operations out of our reach . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The WFP estimates that food prices rose by 55 per cent between June and the end of February , meaning it needed an extra $ 500 m on top of the $ 2.9 bn it had already budgeted for .
However , prices have risen a further 20 per cent in the past three weeks , meaning the organisation 's emergency shortfall could , in reality , be closer to $ 700m .
" It 's a situation that is changing nearly every day .
We used to adjust our basic food prices every year or two but now it 's weekly or even daily because the changes are so quick and , unfortunately , all seem to go in the same direction , " said Ms Sheeran .
She warned that if donors did not stump up : " We will see the scaling back of operations in the next months – each operation will need to be scaled back .
There could be quite a dramatic effect on the number of people we are able to provide with food . "
Rice last week jumped to a three - decade high , experiencing the same sort of spike that has already affected wheat , corn and soybeans .
The price of these staple foods has been driven skywards by increased demand for food from the newly prospering parts of south and east Asia , damage to crops by natural disasters , and by the growing demand for biofuels .
" It 's a global phenomenon which is hitting the most vulnerable populations hard , " Ms Sheeran said .
In Bangladesh , those on a dollar a day are dropping the protein element of their diet because they can only afford the basic staple rice .
" And even those earning $ 2 a day are forced into coping strategies which could lead to a malnutrition crisis , " Ms Sheeran said .
" They are giving up health or educational needs to get a basic food budget . "
It is the people eking out an existence on 50 cents per day that are suffering most , however , like people in some parts of El Salvador who have been forced to halve their nutritional intake .
" We now have a situation where there 's a lot of food on the shelves but people cannot afford it , " Ms Sheeran said .
Ban Ki-moon , the UN secretary general , wrote in an editorial in the Washington Post : " The new face of hunger is increasingly affecting communities that had previously been protected .
The ' bottom billion ' , people living on one dollar a day or less ... do one of two things : they buy less food , or they buy cheaper , less nutritious food .
The result is the same : more hunger and less chance of a healthy future . "

WASHINGTON ( AP )  President Bush on Monday approved the execution of an Army private , the first time in over a half - century that a president has affirmed a death sentence for a member of the U.S. military .
With his signature from the Oval Office , Bush said yes to the military 's request to execute Ronald A. Gray , the White House confirmed .
Gray had had been convicted in connection with a spree of four murders and eight rapes in the Fayetteville , N.C. , area over eight months in the late 1980s while stationed at Fort Bragg .
" While approving a sentence of death for a member of our armed services is a serious and difficult decision for a commander in chief , the president believes the facts of this case leave no doubt that the sentence is just and warranted , " White House press secretary Dana Perino said .
In the military courts , " Private Gray was convicted of committing brutal crimes , including two murders , an attempted murder and three rapes .
The victims included a civilian and two members of the Army .
...
The president 's thoughts and prayers are with the victims of these heinous crimes and their families and all others affected . "
Unlike in the civilian courts , a member of the U.S. armed forces cannot be executed until the president approves the death sentence .
Gray has been on death row at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth , Kan. , since April 1988 .
Members of the U.S. military have been executed throughout history , but just 10 have been executed by presidential approval since 1951 when the Uniform Code of Military Justice , the military 's modern - day legal system , was enacted into law .
President Kennedy was the last president to stare down this life - or - death decision .
On Feb. 12 , 1962 , Kennedy commuted the death sentence of Jimmie Henderson , a Navy seaman , to confinement for life .
President Eisenhower was the last president to approve a military execution .
In 1957 , he approved the execution of John Bennett , an Army private convicted of raping and attempting to kill an 11 - year - old Austrian girl .
He was hanged in 1961 .
The death penalty was outlawed between 1972 and 1984 , when President Reagan reinstated it .
Gray was held responsible for the crimes committed between April 1986 and January 1987 in both the civilian and military justice systems .
In civilian courts in North Carolina , Gray pleaded guilty to two murders and five rapes and was sentenced to three consecutive and five concurrent life terms .
He then was tried by general court - martial at the Army 's Fort Bragg .
In April 1988 , the court - martial convicted Gray of two murders , an attempted murder and three rapes .
He was unanimously sentenced to death .
The court - martial panel convicted Gray of : • Raping and killing Army Pvt. Laura Lee Vickery - Clay of Fayetteville on Dec. 15 , 1986 .
She was shot four times with a . 22 - caliber pistol that Gray confessed to stealing .
She suffered blunt force trauma over much of her body .
• Raping and killing Kimberly Ann Ruggles , a civilian cab driver in Fayetteville .
She was bound , gagged , stabbed repeatedly , and had bruises and lacerations on her face .
Her body was found on the base .
• Raping , robbing and attempting to kill Army Pvt. Mary Ann Lang Nameth in her barracks at Fort Bragg on Jan. 3 , 1987 .
She testified against Gray during the court - martial and identified him as her assailant .
Gray raped her and stabbed her several times in the neck and side .
Nameth suffered a laceration of the trachea and a collapsed or punctured lung .
The six - member court - martial panel returned its unanimous verdict after about two hours of deliberations .
The panel also reduced Gray from Spec. 4 to private , forfeited all his pay and ordered him to be dishonorably discharged from the Army .
Gray has appealed his case through the Army Court of Criminal Appeals ( then known as the U.S. Army Court of Military Review ) and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Services .
In 2001 , the Supreme Court declined to hear the case .
Bush got the secretary of the Army 's recommendation to approve Gray 's death sentence in late 2005 .
Since then , it 's been under review by the Bush administration , including the White House legal counsel .
Complicating the administration 's deliberation was a case under review this year by the Supreme Court .
The court ruled in April to uphold the most common method of capital punishment used across the United States .
The justices said the three - drug mix of lethal - injection drugs used by Kentucky and most other states does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment .
The ruling in the case of Baze v. Rees cleared the way for a resumption of executions nationwide .
It was unclear where Gray would be executed .
Military executions are handled by the Federal Bureau of Prisons .
Bush 's decision , however , is not likely the end of Gray 's legal battle .
Further litigation is expected and these types of death sentence appeals often take years to resolve .
The military also has asked Bush to authorize the execution of Dwight J. Loving , who has been at Fort Leavenworth , Kan. , since 1989 after being convicted of killing two taxicab drivers while he was an Army private at Fort Hood , Texas .
But that request is not yet ripe for a presidential decision .
The White House declined to discuss the case .

Former Iranian Pres Blames Tehran for Lockerbie
Former Iranian President Blames Tehran for Lockerbie
Pan Am 103 destroyed in revenge for downing of an Iranian civilian airliner in 1988 , says Bani-Sadr
By Ludwig De Braeckeleer
" 270 people died when Pan Am 103 was blown out of the sky over Lockerbie , Scotland on Dec. 21 , 1988 .
It was the worst - ever act of airline terrorism against the United States .
It 's also been called the world 's biggest unsolved murder . "
-- Shadow Over Lockerbie , John Biewen and Ian Ferguson
In an interview conducted on May 16 , Abolhassan Bani-Sadr , the former president of the Islamic Republic of Iran , told me that Tehran , not Libya , had ordered the bombing of Pan Am 103 in revenge for the downing of an Iranian civilian airliner by the USS Vincennes a few months earlier .
On July 3 , 1988 , the navy cruiser USS Vincennes , also known as " Robocruiser , " shot down Iran Air Flight 665 over the Persian Gulf .
The civilian airliner was carrying mostly Muslims on their pilgrimage to Mecca -- 290 died , most Iranians .
According to Bani-Sadr , in the immediate aftermath of the Lockerbie tragedy , Mohtashami - Pur , the then minister of the interior , acknowledged in an interview that he had contracted Ahmad Jibril , the leader of a Palestinian organization , to bomb an American airliner .
The interview was scheduled for publication the following day .
Hours before distribution , the newspaper was shutdown .
Flashback
In the aftermath of the USS Vincennes accident , top figures in the Iranian government held a series of meetings in Beirut with leaders of Ahmed Jibril 's terror group , the PFLP - GC ( Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command ) .
" Everybody in US intelligence knew about Iran 's intention to bomb an American airliner in response to the downing of one of its own only months earlier .
We knew that , " former CIA operative Robert Baer explains .
" There was a smoking gun in July ' 88 that Iran hired Jibril to knock down at least one American plane , " Baer told me .
And indeed , media have long reported that high - ranking Iranian officials held a meeting with Dalkamoni , a trusted lieutenant of Jibril and a man said to be only known by the CIA as Nabil .
In late October ' 88 , Dalkamoni and Ghadanfar , alias Nabil Massoud , were arrested in Frankfurt where they were running an operation to destroy airliners .
" I was assigned to Paris in 1988 running down leads with French police on both Pan Am 103 and UTA [ Union des Transports Aeriens ] --
I do not know the ultimate judgment on the leads we produced .
Or why precisely the case is being reviewed by Scotland .
Keep in mind in your research that intelligence and evidence are two separate domains .
Often it 's the case [ that ] compartmented intelligence is not shared with the FBI .
I do not know what the FBI was given or not given , " Baer added .
" There 's a world of intercepts and information from sources that is never shared with the FBI .
This is because the controller of the information does n't want to compromise the source .
At the CIA , we look at the FBI as trying to get convictions , while intelligence is to get at a proximate truth . "
Specific Threat From Tehran
" You will remember that for many years , Iraqi used chemical warfare against Iranians .
And we never retaliated .
Because we abide by our Islamic principles , " stated Mohammad Jaafar Mahallati , Iran 's ambassador to the United Nations , on the day following the shutdown of the Iranian airliner .
" And this is a principle that we always abide by .
We act upon our own Islamic principles , which to some extent covered international regulations . "
" We will use any legitimate means to exercise our right for self - defense .
And therefore , acting in self - defense , we will use all legitimate means and ways in order to punish this act of terrorism .
Not merely to punish .
Punish for punishment .
But [ we will resort to ] punishment to prevent further occurrence or recurrence of such unfortunate incidents . "
Following the Vincennes accident , a spokesperson for the Iranian Embassy in London , Mohamed Beshti , predicted an act of revenge .
" We do not disclose our response but it will be an appropriate response to the magnitude of the American Crime , " Beshti said .
Reacting to the downing of Airbus 665 , Ali Akbar Mohtashemi -Pur swore that there should be a " rain of blood " in revenge .
Mohtashemi had been the Iranian ambassador in Damascus from 1982 to 1985 .
He is widely believed to have helped to found Hezbollah in Lebanon and had close connections with the terrorist groups of Beirut and the Bekaa Valley .
The National Security Agency intercepted and decoded a communication of Mohtashemi linking Iran to the bombing of Pan Am 103 .
One intelligence summary , prepared by the US Air Force Intelligence Agency , was requested by lawyers for the bankrupt Pan American Airlines through the Freedom of Information Act .
A classified document prepared for the Multi-National Force during the first Gulf War reads : " Mohtashemi is closely connected with the Al Abas and Abu Nidal terrorist groups .
He is actually a long - time friend of Abu Nidal .
He has recently paid $ 10 million in cash and gold to these two organizations to carry out terrorist activities and was the one who paid the same amount to bomb Pan Am Flight 103 in retaliation for the US shoot - down of the Iranian Airbus . "
Caveat : Former FBI Special Agent Richard Marquise led the Lockerbie investigation .
Marquise has told me that the document came from a source of unknown reliability .
However , careful reading shows that the source makes a clear difference between rumors and facts .
While parts of the document reads : " Mohtashemi is said to [ have done this or that ] , " the paragraph regarding Pan Am 103 is factual .
It reads : " He has recently paid … "
The difference of style cannot be ignored .
Confirmation of Bani-Sadr Allegation
Iranian Affairs Analyst Gholam Reza Amouzadeh told me that Mohtashemi - Pur tried at least once more to reveal his role in the Lockerbie bombing .
In January - February 1995 , the Jahan e Islam magazine published an interview of Mohtashami - Pur .
At the very beginning of the interview , Mohtashami - Pur said that he would soon reveal the " Lockerbie files " to the readers .
But they never got the chance to read them .
The head of the office in charge of censorship , a branch of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance , run at the time by Mir Salim , a right - wing politician very close to the Supreme Leader , mailed a letter signed by the Police Authority to the printing house requesting that the interview not be published .
Jahan e Islam was shut down immediately .
As chance would have it , the Council of Observation to the Press was in session the next day .
All members of the council , including Karbaschi , a person very close to Rafsanjani , approved the order .
True Motivation
Mohtashami-Pur said that he had acted in revenge -- intekam ( equal and just revenge ) -- but his true motivation may reside elsewhere .
By 1988 , Iranian politics had become increasingly polarized between the Rafsanjani and the Mohtashemi factions .
Rafsanjani was in favor of a rapprochement with Washington .
In July 1988 , Rafsanjani stated in the parliament that " Iran should now attract those countries who could become friends instead of alienating them , as it had done in the past . "
Mohtashami - Pur was absolutely opposed to it .
On Sept. 26 , 1988 , a commando led by Mir Lohi , a Mohtashemi agent , attempted to assassinate Rafsanjani as he was leaving the parliament .
Rafsanjani escaped but four of his Afghan bodyguards were killed and several others wounded .
The assassination attempt was widely perceived as a way to prevent a rapprochement with Washington .
In a similar manner , the killing of Lt. Col .
William Higgins in 1989 is also alleged to have been ordered by Mohtashemi in order to prevent the rapprochement of Syria with the US and again to derail attempts by Rafsanjani to better the relations of Iran with America .
Early Reactions to Bani-Sadr Revelation
Dr. Jim Swire lost his daughter Flora in the Lockerbie tragedy .
On Jan. 11 of this year , Swire wrote to me that he never doubted who ordered the bombing , why they did it and who supplied the technology .
" As you know , I have always believed that it was Iranian revenge , whether or not the Libyans helped , and that the Syrians through Jibril supplied the technology , " Swire said .
Michael Scharf is an international law expert at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio who helped draft the UN Security Council resolutions that imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 .
" Though I always wondered about the possibility of a PFLP - GC connection to the Lockerbie bombing , I do n't know enough about the persons / events you mention to offer any type of expert opinion about it at this point , " Scharf wrote to me .
" It was largely based on this inside guy [ Libyan defector Abdul Majid Giaka ] .
It was n't until the trial that I learned this guy was a nut - job and that the CIA had absolutely no confidence in him and that they knew he was a liar .
The CIA and the FBI kept the State Department in the dark .
It worked for them for us to be fully committed to the theory that Libya was responsible , " Scharf has said .
Going even further , Scharf has argued that the Lockerbie trial had nothing to do , whatsoever , with justice .
Professor Robert Black , also known as the architect of the Lockerbie trial , is very knowledgeable about this affair .
As I know that Black has seen some documents never made public about the investigation , I asked him how he felt about the news .
" What Bani -Sadr told you about Mohtashemi certainly does not surprise me .
It coincides with what other people have suggested to me , " Black said .
Marquise does not deny the possibility of an Iran - Syria role in the affair .
But Marquise is adamant that no evidence linked the bombing to these countries .
" I never have said the evidence against Megrahi was direct or overwhelming but there is more evidence to implicate him , and Libya , than there is EVIDENCE to convict Jaffar , Jibril , Dalkamoni , Iran , Syria , etc. …
All we had with them is lots of " intelligence , " but no EVIDENCE .
I cannot make that point more strenuously , " Marquise wrote to me earlier this year .
" Did we convict all those involved ?
As you said yourself , there are probably more people involved than one man sitting in a Scottish prison .
No we did not .
And they live in Libya for certain .
And no one ever said it was Libya and Libya alone .
That is the only direction the EVIDENCE flowed , " Marquise added .
" Marquise is right -- the body of intelligence on Lockerbie does not constitute evidence and cannot be introduced into court , " Baer told me .
Marquise argued , " Did Iran contract with the PFLP - GC ?
Probably -- although , it can not be proven in court .
Did Iran ask Libya and Abu Nidal , as you stated in an earlier article ?
Perhaps -- although that too cannot be proven and never will be unless a reliable witness or two comes forward with documentary evidence . "
I thus suggested that Iranian defector Abolghasem Mesbahi would be an ideal witness .
As Marquise had never heard of him , I decided to ask Bani -Sadr if he could confirm his credentials .
Mesbahi Vetted
And indeed Bani-Sadr confirmed to me that he knows Mesbahi .
Bani -Sadr also told me that Mesbahi was a high - ranking Iranian official and that he had indeed been involved in discussions regarding the release of hostages held by Hezbollah in Lebanon .
Mesbahi participated in at least four such meetings from August ' 88 to November ' 88 .
Bani -Sadr gives Mesbahi credit for the release of a specific hostage .
Bani -Sadr has not been in contact with Mesbahi since 1997 .
Three meetings between Richard Lawless , a person working directly for Vice President George H. W. Bush , and Iranian negotiators had taken place at Glyon , near Montreux , in late August and early September 1988 .
A fourth meeting occurred in early October 1988 .
Bani -Sadr could not provide any detail regarding Lawless .
The Iranians negotiators were Mohammad Javad Laridjani , Mahmoud Jamali , Nasrollah Kazemi Kamyab and Abolghasem Mesbahi .
All of them are quite well known senior officials and worked for the Foreign Affair Ministry , except Mesbahi who was representing Rafsanjani .
Jamali was director general for international conferences at the Foreign Ministry .
The official nature of these talks is abundantly clear from the high - ranking level of the participants .
In July 1997 , German prosecutors interviewed Abolghasem Mesbahi in a case concerning the assassination of several Iranian Kurdish dissidents in Germany .
Abolghasem Mesbahi is a former high - ranking Iranian intelligence agent , believed to be the son of one of the fathers of the Islamic Revolution .
German law authorities came to regard Mesbahi as a credible witness .
In fact , based on his testimony , an Iranian and four Lebanese were convicted of killing several Iranian Kurdish dissidents in Germany .
According to Mesbahi testimony , Iran planned the attack as revenge after the US cruiser Vincennes shot down an Iran Air Airbus over the Strait of Hormuz earlier in 1988 .
Mesbahi said that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini personally ordered the revenge attack and that Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati had carried out the planning of the attack on Pan Am 103 with Libya and guerrilla leader Abu Nidal .
Bani -Sadr does not know of any direct collaboration between Tehran and the Abu Nidal Organization .
Velayati acquired his M.D. from the University of Tehran and a pediatrics degree from the Johns Hopkins University in 1971 and 1974 , respectively .
He was the foreign minister of Iran for about 16 years ( Dec. 15 , 1981 , to Aug. 20 , 1997 ) , making him the longest - serving foreign minister in Iranian history .
Velayati is the only high - ranking Iranian official who kept his post after the death of Khomeini .
Mesbahi alleged that parts of the bomb were put on a plane at Frankfurt airport , later assembled in London and finally loaded onto Pan Am 103 .
Many readers , including Dr. Swire and former FBI Special Agent Marquise , have interpreted that statement as the bomb being planted on the feeder flight , Pan Am 103A .
This may or may not be what Mesbahi alleged .
For instance , Gholam Reza Amouzadeh told me that Iran had two private airports in the Frankfurt area at that time .
Tam Dalyell has been a Labor member of the House of Commons from 1962 to 2005 .
On April 21 , 1998 , Dalyell asked as to why the police inquiry had not interviewed Abolghasem Mesbahi .
His question remains unanswered to this day .
In late 1997 Bernazzani was in charge of the FBI 's office of Hezbollah operations .
According to Bernazzani , Mesbahi had been discredited among US analysts .
If German authorities found Mesbahi a very reliable witness regarding events that occurred in ' 92 , I dare say that Mesbahi must be an extremely reliable witness regarding the Pan Am 103 bombing that occurred in ' 88 when he had full access to the highest level of Iranian Intelligence .
I am therefore puzzled by Bernazzani 's statement , even more so as I have been told that he never met Mesbahi .
An Accusation Allegedly Confirmed by Nidal
Atef Abu Bakr is a former spokesman for the Abu Nidal Organization ( ANO ) and one of Nidal 's closest aides between 1985 and 1989 .
In a series of interviews published in the Arabic Al Hayat newspaper Bakr said that Abu Nidal told him that his organization was behind the explosion on Pan Am flight 103 .
" Abu Nidal told a meeting of the Revolutionary Council leadership : I have very important and serious things to say .
The reports that attribute Lockerbie to others are lies .
We are behind it . "
" If any one of you lets this out , I will kill him even if he was in his wife 's arms , " Abu Nidal added , according to Bakr .
L. K. Coleman is professor of communications , and chair of the department , at the American University of Technology in Lebanon .
Court documents have established that Coleman has been a Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) informant .
He is currently writing a book on the bombing of Pan Am 103 , to be titled The House on Sangamore .
Coleman told me that he has obtained documents regarding Nidal and that he knows that Nidal planted the bomb on Pan Am 103 .
Caveat :
One should be very careful regarding the above information .
Firstly , this writer has not seen the documents .
Secondly , scholars have been tricked by impostors into believing that they were dealing with Nidal .
Thirdly , Nidal is famous for having taken responsibility for acts of terror in which he had no participation whatsoever .
" Nidal 's possible involvement was one more of the many questions which we feel absolutely demand an independent inquiry into Lockerbie , " Swire said .
Warnings
James Shaughnessy , an American lawyer defending Pan Am , was given access to key documents , including a series of Defense Intelligence Terrorism Summaries ( DITSUMs ) from the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) that were issued in the aftermath of the USS Vincennes " accident " in the Persian Gulf .
These documents warned against " renewed threats of attack on US interests , particularly as a consequence of the shooting down of the Iranian Airbus in July . "
On Dec. 1 , a DIA DITSUM stated that " reports of surveillance , targeting and planning of actions against US persons and facilities are continuous . "
According to a US Intelligence document dated Dec. 2 , 1988 , US officials were expecting a revenge bombing for the shooting down of an Iranian airliner .
" Team of Palestinians not associated with the PLO plans to attack American targets in Europe .
Targets specified are Pan Am and US military bases , " the report warned .
In that particular context , the reader may safely assume that " Team of Palestinians not associated with the PLO " would mean Ahmed Jibril and Abu Nidal organizations , that both opposed Yasser Arafat for his willingness to work with the US and to accept a two - state solution .
On Dec. 5 , 1988 , the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) issued a security bulletin .
The document states that on that day a man with an Arabic accent had telephoned the US Embassy in Helsinki , Finland .
The informant had told them that a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to the US would be blown up within the next two weeks by someone associated with the Abu Nidal Organization .
" An anonymous caller told a US diplomatic facility in Europe on December 5 that a bombing attempt would be made against a Pan American aircraft flying from Frankfurt , West Germany to the United States .
The Federal Aviation Administration was notified of the threat and security for Pan Am flights out of Frankfurt was enhanced . "
Caveat : Marquise has told me that the warning was a hoax and that the caller had been identified .
However , it is a fact that the man was never arrested for lack of evidence .
On Dec. 8 , 1988 , Israeli commandos raided the Lebanese headquarters of the PFLP - GC near Damour , killing 20 and wounding dozens more .
Allegedly , Israeli forces captured documents relating to a planned attack on a Pan Am flight out of Frankfurt later that month .
This information was passed to the governments of the US and Germany .
Four sources independently confirmed to Shaughnessy that on Dec. 9 , 1988 , Israeli Defense Forces had captured documents in the raid that disclosed plans to bomb Pan Am flight 103 out of Frankfurt in late December .
All agreed that the Israelis had immediately warned the governments of the US and West Germany .
Communication Intercepted
Two days after the downing of Pan Am 103 , Israeli intelligence intercepted a phone call from Mohtashemi , at the Interior Ministry in Teheran , to the Iranian Embassy in Beirut .
During the conversation , the ambassador was congratulated for the " successful operation " and was told to hand over to the PFLP - GC the remaining funds .
Israel never accepted the view of the US concerning the authors of the Lockerbie bombing .
A few days after the indictment of the two Libyans , a senior Israeli official said that his government had informed US officials that Israel remains convinced that the bombing had been conducted by Jibril 's organization .
The readers need no access to Mossad insiders to find out who Israeli intelligence blamed for the Lockerbie bombing .
On the official Web site of Israel 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs , one can read the following : " As for the carrying out of the terrorist attack in the Azrieli Towers , it is of note that in the past the PFLP - GC carried out spectacular murderous attacks .
For example : the penetration into Kiryat Shemona ( April 1974 , 18 Israeli killed ) , the ' hang - gliders ' night , ' when a hang - glider infiltrated into an army camp near Kiryat Shemona ( November 1987 , 6 IDF soldiers killed ) and the PFLP - GC involvement in the Lockerbie attack , the Pan - Am explosion above Lockerbie in 1988 , which resulted in the death of 270 passengers . "
The Money Transfer
Baer told the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission ( SCCRC ) that an $ 11 million payment was received by the PFLP - GC on or about Dec. 23 , 1988 .
The transaction is evidenced by a credit to a bank in Lausanne , Switzerland , and that the payment was moved from there to another PFLP - GC account at the Banque Nationale de Paris , and thence to the Hungarian development bank .
When Dalkamoni , a lieutenant of Jibril , was arrested during Operation Autumn Leaves in late October ' 88 , the Paris account number was found in his possession .
Moreover , $ 500,000 was transferred on April 25 , 1989 , to the Degussa bank of Frankfurt and deposited in the account of Mohammed Abu Talb , who had met with Dalkamoni in Cyprus during October ' 88 .
Caveat : Baer has often been quoted as saying that " The Scottish commission reviewing evidence in the case was able to confirm that Iran and Syria paid the PFLP - GC to carry out the bombing . "
This is absolutely incorrect .
Baer does not know the reason of the payment .
" Keep in mind that I do n't know why Iran sent the PFLP - GC money after Lockerbie .
It was the coincidence that got everyone 's attention , " Baer warned me .
Marquise told me that he knows the reason for the payment and that it has nothing to do with Lockerbie .
I think that the time has come to request declassification of this document under the Freedom of Information Act .
On the Other Hand
The DIA has always thought the Iranians paid the PFLP - GC to bomb Pan Am flight 103 .
Patrick Lang , chief of the DIA 's Middle East section at the time , has stated that he " signed off " on the DIA 's conclusion .
" The bombing of the Pan Am flight was conceived , authorized and financed by Ali-Akbar Mohtashemi -Pur , the former Iranian minister of Interior . "
" The operation was contracted to Ahmad Jibril for $ 1 million , " said a Sept. 24 , 1989 , memo .
" The remainder was to be paid after successful completion of the mission . "
" I still agree with that .
We felt quite sure that this was a PFLP thing , " Lang said .
Supreme Honor
Dalkamoni was rewarded for his services to the " Islamic revolutionary struggle against the West . "
The Iranian citation praises Dalkamoni for achieving the greatest - ever strike against the West .
Baer told me that Talb was about to received a similar honor .
The Thomas Thurman Affair
Thomas Thurman worked for the FBI forensics laboratory in the late ' 80s and most of the '90s .
Thurman has been publicly credited for identifying the fragment as part of a MST - 13 timer , produced by the Swiss company MeBo , which oriented the investigation toward Tripoli .
" When that identification was made , of the timer , I knew that we had it , " Thurman told ABC in 1991 .
" Absolute , positively euphoria !
I was on cloud nine . "
Evidence Fabricated
" For what it 's worth the best information on Lockerbie came long after Zeist , when the investigation was closed .
I 've always been curious about this case and never stopped looking into it , until the day I left the CIA in December 1997 , " Baer told me .
" The appeals commission posed the question to me about someone planting or manipulating evidence only to cover all the bases .
I told them I did not think there was an organized attempt to misdirect the investigation , although I was aware that once it was decided to go after Libya leads on Iran and the PFLP - GC were dismissed .
Often in many investigations of this sort , the best intelligence comes out long after the event .
" I 'm fascinated to know precisely why the Scots referred the case back to the court , although they did tell me the FBI and Scotland Yard have manipulated the evidence for the prosecution , " Baer told me .
Forensic analysis of the circuit board fragment allowed the investigators to identify its origin .
The timer , known as MST - 13 , is fabricated by a Swiss Company named MeBo , which stands for Meister and Bollier .
The company has indeed sold about 20 MST - 13 timers to the Libyan military ( machine - made nine - ply green boards ) , as well as a few units ( hand - made eight - ply brown boards ) to a Research Institute in Bernau , known to act as a front to the Stasi , the former East German secret police .
The two batches are very different but , as early as 1991 , Bollier told the Scottish investigators that he could not identify the timer from a photograph alone .
Yet , the Libyans were indicted in November 1991 , without ever allowing Bollier to see the actual fragment , on the ground that the integrity of the evidence had to be protected .
But in 1998 , Bollier obtained a copy of a blown - up photograph that Thurman had shown on ABC in 1991 .
Bollier could tell from certain characteristics that the fragment was part of a board of the timers made for East Germany , and definitely not one of the timers delivered by him to Libya .
In September 1999 , Bollier was finally allowed to see the fragment .
Unlike the one shown by Thurman on ABC , this one was machine - made , as was the one sold to Libya .
But , from the absence of traces of solder , it was obvious that the timer had never been used to trigger a bomb .
" As far as I 'm concerned , and I told this to [ Scottish Prosecutor Miriam Watson ] , this is a manufactured fragment , " Bollier says .
" A fabricated fragment , never from a complete , functional timer . "
The next day , Bollier was shown the fragment once more .
You may have already guessed that it now had the soldering traces .
" It was different .
I 'm not crazy .
It was different ! " says Bollier .
Finally , at the trial , Bollier was presented a fragment of a circuit board completely burned down .
Thus , it was no longer possible to identify to which country that timer had been delivered .
As he requested to explain the significance of the issue , Lord Shuterland told him that his request was denied .
Bollier has provided me with copies of documents that unambiguously reveal evidence of multiple -- transparent and grossly incompetent -- manipulations surrounding the fragment of the MST - 13 timer .
Troubled Times at the FBI
The CIA 's Vincent Cannistraro is on the record stating that no one has ever questioned the Thurman credentials .
Allow me .
The Thurman record is far from pristine .
The US attorney general has accused him of having altered lab reports in a way that rendered subsequent prosecutions all but impossible .
He has been transferred out the FBI forensic laboratory .
" He 's very aggressive , but I think he made some mistakes that needed to be brought to the attention of FBI management , " says Frederic Whitehurst , a former FBI chemist who filed the complaints that led to the inspector general 's report .
" We 're not necessarily going to get the truth out of what we 're doing here , " concluded Whitehurst who now works as an attorney at law and forensic consultant .
The story shed some light on his formation .
The report says " Williams and Thurman merit special censure for their work .
It recommends that Thurman , who has a degree in political science , be reassigned outside the lab and that only scientists work in its explosives section . "
Dr. Whitehurst has authored something like 257 memos to the FBI and Justice Department with various complaints of incompetence , " fabrication of evidence " and perjury of various examiners in the FBI Laboratory ( primarily Explosives Unit examiners ) .
" What I had to say about Tom Thurman and the computer chip was reported to the US attorney general 's inspector general during the investigation of wrongdoing in the FBI lab in the 1990s .
I acquired all that information and the inspector general 's report from a law suit under the Freedom of Information Act and therefore the information provided under that FOIA request is in the public sector , " Whitehurst told me .
" I reported to my superiors up to and including the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , the US attorney general , members of the US Congress and US Senate as well as the Office of the President of the United States that FBI Supervisory Special Agent Thomas Thurman altered my reports for five years without my authorization or knowledge .
This is public information .
Thurman holds an undergraduate degree in political science and I hold a PhD in chemistry .
" Thurman was not recognized by the FBI or anyone else as having expertise in complex chemical analysis and I was .
When confronted with this information Thurman did not deny it but argued that my reports could and / or would hurt prosecutors ' cases .
I was very concerned about the fact that wrong information in the final reports could hurt individuals and deny citizens of this country right to a fair trial .
When I raised my concerns with my managers at the FBI laboratory , all except for one of them reminded me that Thurman was the " hero " behind determining the perpetrators of the Pan Am 103 disaster .
" I understood from that that the FBI would not expose these issues for fear that the investigation into the Pan Am 103 bombing would be seen as possibly flawed and this would open the FBI up to criticism and outside review .
No government body has found that Mr. Thurman has done anything illegal .
However he was relieved from his post in the FBI 's Explosives Unit and placed in charge of the FBI 's Bomb Data Center . "
Whitehurst wrote to me : " Did Mr. Thurman find the integrated circuit chip about which you have referred ?
After leaving the FBI I was interviewed by Scottish defense attorneys for one of the individuals accused of bombing Pan Am 103 .
At that interview were two of my attorneys , two FBI attorneys and two Scottish attorneys and me .
I was asked what I knew about the circuit chip .
I can say that I was not interviewed because I agreed with the official version of the discovery of that integrated circuit chip . "
The Lumpert Affidavit
On Friday Aug. 31 , I received from Edwin Bollier , head of the Zurich - based MeBo AG , a copy of a German original of an affidavit .
The document is dated July 18 , 2007 , and signed by Ulrich Lumpert , who worked as an electronic engineer at MeBo from 1978 to 1994 .
I have scrutinized the document carefully and concluded that I have no reason to doubt its authenticity or the truthfulness of its content .
Lumpert was a key witness ( N° 550 ) at the Camp Zeist trial , where a three - judge panel convicted a Libyan citizen of murdering 270 persons who died in the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie .
In his testimony , Lumpert stated that " of the 3 pieces of hand - made prototypes MST - 13 Timer PC - Boards , the third MST - 13 PC - Board was broken and [ he ] had thrown it away . "
In his affidavit , certified by Officer Walter Wieland , Lumpert admits having committed perjury .
" I confirm today on July 18th 2007 , that I stole the third hand - manufactured MST - 13 Timer PC - Board consisting of 8 layers of fibre - glass from MEBO Ltd. and gave it without permission on June 22nd 1989 to a person officially investigating in the Lockerbie case , " Lumpert wrote .
" It did not escape me that the MST - 13 fragment shown [ at the Lockerbie trial ] on the police photograph No PT / 35 ( b ) came from the non-operational MST - 13 prototype PC - board that I had stolen , " Lumpert added .
" I am sorry for the consequences of my silence at that time , for the innocent Libyan Mr. Abdelbaset Al Megrahi sentenced to life imprisonment , and for the country of Libya . "
Lumpert has agreed to speak with me in order to provide some explanations as to what exactly happened , and why he has decided to speak out regarding his role in the fabrication of the evidence .
More on Thurman
In the world of Forensic Sciences , former FBI William Tobin is a legend .
To name but a few of his achievements , Tobin demonstrated , along with his NTSB colleagues , that TWA 800 had been destroyed by mechanical failure at the time when virtually the rest of the world strongly believed a terror act .
Both the NTSB and the CIA subsequently presented compelling evidence demonstrating the scientific validity of Tobin 's conclusion .
After retiring , Tobin demonstrated that the Lead content bullet identification technique , used by the FBI for more than four decades , was flawed .
Tobin was not allowed to work on this matter while at the FBI .
Tobin knows a few things about superhero Thomas Thurman .
Tobin told me that , in his opinion , Thurman and other Explosives Unit examiners were prone to confirmation bias , an observer bias whereby an examiner is inclined to see what he is expected to see .
Tobin 's opinion is based on " numerous interactions whereby Thurman and other examiners rendered conclusions supporting the prevailing investigative or prosecutorial theory but which were unsupported by scientific fact .
It was not uncommon to determine that items characterized as ' chrome - plated ' were nickel - plated , ' extrusions ' turned out to be drawn products , ' castings ' turned out to be forgings , white residues characterized as explosive residue turned out to be corrosion products ( generally Al2O3 or a non-stoichiometric form ) , bent nails claimed to be indicative of an explosion , and a truck axle was characterized as having fractured from an explosion ( a conclusion rendered solely from an 8 - 1/2 " x 11 " photograph where the axle was a small fraction of the field of view and the fracture surface itself was not observable ) .
I put no credence into any scientific or technical conclusions rendered by anyone without a suitable scientific background for that matter , until I can make an independent evaluation .
Thurman was a history or political science major to my recollection .
" It is also apparent that Thurman was very prone to confirmation bias , an observer bias whereby an examiner will tend to see what he is expected to see .
Thurman was a history or political science major to my recollection .
His habit , as with most Explosives Unit examiners with whom I interacted and based on numerous court transcript reviews and ' bailout ' requests I received on several occasions ( to ' bail out ' an examiner who not only misrepresented an item of evidence but also was confronted with more accurate representations of the evidence in trial ) , was to seek someone else 's expertise and then present it as his own in a courtroom without attribution .
He would frequently come into my office , ask for a ' quick ' assessment of something ( but I would always indicate that my opinion was only a preliminary evaluation and that I would need to conduct proper scientific testing of the item ( s ) ) , then weeks later I would see the assessment in a formal FBI Laboratory report to the contributor ( of the evidence ) as his own ' scientific ' conclusion , " Tobin added .
No Place for a Lone Wolf
I asked Frederic Whitehurst if he thought that Thurman had acted alone .
" I can not imagine that he was acting alone .
He was a mid -level manager without a great deal of authority and with severely limited credentials of which the FBI was fully aware , " Whitehurst answered .
" The problem with having a scientific laboratory within an intelligence gathering organization is that scientists traditionally are seeking truth and at times their data is in direct contradiction to the wishes of a government that is not seeking truth but victory on battle fields .
" The problem with the scientific data is that when one wishes to really determine what the government scientists or pseudo scientists could have known , one need only look at the data .
So few citizens ever ask for or review that data .
So few scientists wish to question the government that feeds them and gives security to their families . "
Political Interference
Buck Revell , who oversaw the Lockerbie investigation for the FBI until six months before the Libyans were indicted , denies suggestions of political influence .
" There was never any indication from President [ Ronald ] Reagan or thereafter President [ George H. W. ]
Bush -- any interjection of any geopolitical concerns . "
Revell adds that if either president had tried to influence the investigation , " We would have had to end up with a special prosecutor . "
" If there was … even a smell of government involvement in [ the bombing of ]
Pan Am 103 , I 'd be the first one up snitching on the government , " says Michael Hurley , who was the DEA 's top official in Cyprus in 1988 .
Even if government agents were running a controlled drug route from the Middle East through the Frankfurt airport , he says , that would not create an opportunity for terrorists .
" When you do a controlled delivery , you have control of the drugs from the point of origin to the destination , " Hurley says .
The SCCRC asked Baer if he knew there was a systematic effort to cook the books .
" I 'd never heard of one , but there was obviously a push for an easy indictment of a country that could n't defend itself , Libya , " Baer told them .
" I believe that there are human errors within our human enterprises .
I believe that there are individuals who will conduct themselves in less than honorable fashion for any number of reasons , even for recognition by superiors .
I believe that the US government depends upon such people when it wishes to say something that has no basis in truth or when it wishes to cover up the true nature and / or origin of the intelligence that it has from other sources .
I believe that during my time at the FBI crime lab I saw some of the most surreal events imaginable and continue to see such events and put those off to error or government cover up , either appropriate or inappropriate , " Whitehurst said .
" From my arrival at the NSC [ National Safety Council ] in early 1991 … I was in charge of monitoring the work of all US government Agencies involved in various terrorism cases [ mostly Lockerbie and UTA ] to ensure that policies and decisions of the president were understood and followed by all agencies working on the cases , " wrote McNamara .
And the president was crystal clear regarding his policies and decisions .
" The Syrians took a bum rap on this , " said President Bush ( Los Angeles Times , Nov. 15 , 1991 ) .
" Was Thurman ordered to do what he did ?
No one acts alone without orders in the FBI .
We had clear goals which were clearly given to us in every document we received from anyone .
If a police organization wished for us to provide them " proof " of guilt then they told us in many ways of their absolute belief that the perpetrators were those individuals they had already arrested .
If the president of the United States tells the country in the national news that Dandeny Munoz Mosquera is one of the most fear assassins in the history of the world then every agent knows that he must provide information to support that statement .
If leaders decide without concern for foundation of truth then most people will follow them , " Whitehurst said .
" Thurman did not act alone .
The culture at the FBI was one of group think , do n't go against the flow , stay in line , ignore that data that does not fit the group think , " Whitehurst added .
His former colleague agrees .
" I 've seen so often where an individual who was at one time an independent thinker and had good powers of reasoning acquires the 'us vs. them , ' circle - the - wagons , public - relations at all costs mentality at the FBI , " Tobin says .
" As much as I loved the institution , I have never seen a worse case of spin- doctoring of any image - tarnishing facts or developments as I had at the FBI .
Never !
It seemed the guiding principle was ' image before reality ' or ' image before all else ' ( including fact ) .
Whatever you do , ' do n't embarrass the Bureau ' and ' the Bureau can do no wrong . ' "

At a time when scores of companies are freezing pensions for their workers , some are quietly converting their pension plans into resources to finance their executives ' retirement benefits and pay .
In recent years , companies from Intel Corp. to CenturyTel Inc. collectively have moved hundreds of millions of dollars of obligations for executive benefits into rank - and - file pension plans .
This lets companies capture tax breaks intended for pensions of regular workers and use them to pay for executives ' supplemental benefits and ...

CCTV monitors classrooms at one in 14 schools , according to a survey .
The poll of teachers also found that almost a quarter feared there might be more cameras hidden around the campus that they did not know about .
Most said their schools were fitted with surveillance cameras .
Almost 80 per cent said there were cameras at the entrance and more than 7 per cent said there were some in classrooms .
Nearly 10 per cent of teachers polled by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers said there were cameras in the lavatories .
Teaching unions said the cameras were being used to monitor pupils ’ behaviour .
But they fear the devices could inhibit teachers from performing to the best of their abilities .
Supporters of the surveillance say it is there to protect children and staff .

DAVIE , Fla . --
Jake Long seemed at ease in his new role as the NFL's No. 1 draft pick , leaning into a news conference microphone to talk about his mean streak while his mother sat in the corner , nodding as she smiled .
The Miami Dolphins were grinning Tuesday , too .
They signed the Michigan left tackle to a five - year , $ 57.75 million contract with $ 30 million guaranteed , and they 'll select him with the top pick in the draft Saturday .
The deal allows the Dolphins and Long to avoid a possible holdout .
" It 's really important for us to know Jake is going to be on the field for us on time when training camp begins in July , " coach Tony Sparano said .
" That was critical . "
Last year 's top pick , JaMarcus Russell , signed for $ 61 million with the Oakland Raiders but missed all of training camp before reaching a deal .
ESPN's Chris Mortensen reported on Tuesday that the St. Louis Rams , who hold the second pick in the NFL draft , were told today by the NFL management council that they do not have permission to begin negotiations with any player now that the Dolphins have signed Long .
A league spokesman said there have been internal discussions to determine whether the Rams have the right to negotiate with a player or players .

Over the course of 100 - plus years , Sampo Bank had grown into one of the largest banks in Finland .
Since its founding in 1887 , Sampo stayed ahead of the technology curve , introducing the first modern payment system -- the postal giro -- in 1939 , becoming Finland 's first adopter of IBM's " electronic brain " in 1958 , and amassing nearly one million users of its online banking service by 2006 .
But alas , in today 's acquire - or - be - acquired world , Sampo was swallowed up by Denmark giant Danske Bank .
On Nov. 9 , 2006 , Danske announced not only the acquisition , but that it would integrate all IT platforms -- online banking , merchant processing , account management and so on -- in 1 year , 4 months and 15 days , by Easter weekend of 2008 .
And come hell or high water , they would meet that date .
As Easter grew closer , the integration problems grew worse .
Instead of extending its own deadline , Danske opted to expand its integration project team to a whopping 2,500 employees and the budget to more than $ 300 million .
The longer and harder developers worked on the systems , the sooner they transferred their personal savings accounts to other banks .
Despite all the issues , Danske pushed forward with its Easter integration plan .
Not surprisingly , after that fateful switchover in March 2008 , things did n't go over so well .
Money Troubles
When the new system went live , many Sampo customers could n't help but notice .
Standing in line at retailers across Europe , they watched clerks swipe their Sampo cards over and over , only to get an " Authorization Denied " message every time .
Not to worry , embarrassed shoppers naively thought , the ATM is right across the corner -- but Sampo ATMs were n't quite working , either .
As for the branches , not only were there hour - long lines , but the teller computer systems had issues as well : incorrect account balances , wrongly applied transactions and unavailable accounts , to name a few -- exactly the type of things that could send someone over the edge .
One disgruntled customer took an axe to a wooden desk at a Sampo branch after learning his account was supposedly empty .
Do n't Even Bother Logging In
As bad as Danske 's retail problems were , its new online banking system fared much worse .
While Sampo's former e-banking site was user - friendly , secure and accessible in most browsers and mobile phones , Danske 's was none of the above .
Within hours of use , the entire online banking system collapsed under a normal , Monday - morning workload .
This meant that Sampo's tech - savvy customers could n't transfer money , pay bills or issue debits .
While that is n't a mission - critical issue for the average personal banker , some of Sampo 's business customers -- such as Nokia -- were n't too pleased .
When persistent users managed to access the site during its sporadic uptime , they immediately noticed that it was only accessible in Windows using Internet Explorer .
And to make matters worse , they'd have to download a fairly large Java applet to perform their banking tasks .
To make matters even worse , the Java applet was disastrously developed .
The Disassembly
Because Java code can so easily be decompiled , many developers chose to use an obfuscator to make reverse engineering - compiled Java virtually impossible .
While the Danske developers actually did include an obfuscator in the applet , they apparently forgot to use it .
This oversight allowed anyone with the freely available Java SDK to see the code behind their " secure " applet .
The most obvious oddity in the Danske applet was that it made extensive use of platform - specific native DLLs -- such as non-Java code -- for no apparent reason , thereby effectively undoing the platform - independence of the Java applet .
There were other interesting finds in the applet :
the users ' computers ' hardware and drives were scanned and a profile sent to the bank
a root - certificate was an embedded resource , yet was encoded in Base64
the same Base - 64 encoded certificate was encoded a second time in Base64
and so many more
And then there was this curious snippet of code :
public static final int RandomErrorNotEnoughRandom = 1 ;
Happy Easter
While Danske has since resolved many of the most serious issues , it 's still dealing with the fallout .
Though the bank has vowed to waive fees through September 2008 and has offered to pay for any financial damages that occurred as a result of its system outages , an estimated 20,000 customers have switched banks .
But the good news is it made the Easter deadline .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) -
Six sailors working as prison camp guards in Iraq face courts martial for abusing detainees , some of whom were sealed in a cell with pepper spray , the U.S. Navy said on Thursday .

Seven other sailors were given non-judicial punishments over the incident , which took place on May 14 at Camp Bucca , the vast desert camp in southern Iraq where the U.S. military houses 18,000 of its 21,000 prisoners .
“ Two detainees suffered minor abrasions as a result of the alleged assaults , eight others were confined overnight in a detainee housing unit which was sprayed with riot control agent and then the ventilation secured , ” the Navy said in a statement .
The U.S. military ’s image was damaged by the scandal over prisoner abuse at Iraq ’s Abu Ghraib prison in 2003 .
Photos of naked detainees stacked in a pyramid and inmates cowering in front of snarling dogs unleashed a wave of global condemnation .
Eleven low - ranking soldiers were convicted in military courts in connection with physical abuse and sexual humiliation at Abu Ghraib but no U.S. officers were found criminally responsible .
Navy Fifth Fleet spokeswoman Commander Jane Campbell said the riot control agent used by the guards was pepper spray .
None of the victims required medical attention apart from the two who were beaten , she said .
“ The day that this all took place there had actually been some unrest at the camp .
There had been some detainee - on - guard issues , which ranged from spitting to throwing bodily functions at some guards , ” she said .
Use of pepper spray in warfare is banned by international treaties on chemical weapons , but many governments say members of their armed forces are permitted to use it in war zones for law - enforcement duties .
The six facing courts martial have remained with their unit at the prison camp but were removed from duty : “ They are no longer doing the mission of guards , ” Campbell said .
The courts martial will begin at Camp Bucca within the next 30 days .
The seven guards already subjected to the less - severe system of non-judicial punishment had mainly faced accusations that they failed to report the incident , rather than being accused of taking part themselves , she said .
Two had their charges dismissed and the rest were given reductions in rank , with some also docked pay or confined to base for 45 days .

From New York to Los Angeles , and everywhere in between , the chorus can be heard : ' Blame India ! Blame China !'
Well , brought to our attention by Wired , recent empirical data rubbish this argument and kick it to the curb .
( PDF file )
The state of California 's own statistics show that , in 2006 , the state consumed 20 billion gallons of diesel and petrol as transportation fuel , a more than 50 per cent increase over the past two decades .
But even more interestingly , 20 billion gallons a year tops the transportation fuel usage of the entire nations of China or India !
Chew on that for a while , and allow it to truly sink in : California alone uses more petrol and diesel for fuel that any other country in the world , save the United States as a whole , which used a whopping 136 billion gallons , or 44 % of the world 's transportation fuel consumption .
Of course , listening to US politicians , talking heads and media reports , one would n't know it .
They constantly inundate us with stories of India and China and their rapid growth , and what it portends for the developed world .
The two emerging Asian giants have been blamed for everything from food shortages to rising fuel prices to global warming .
But instead of worrying why Indians need two rotis per day rather than one , or why our rapid development has led to increased vehicles on India 's roads , perhaps it 's time for America to do some soul searching and ask a few questions of itself .
Is n't it outrageous for a state with 36 million people to consume more transportation fuel than a nation of 1 billion , India , and still point the blame elsewhere ?
The second question , how is this even possible ?
How can every 1 Californian consume more transportation fuel than 30 Indians ?
It 's simple , really .
In Asia , we utilise compressed natural gas , mass transportation , bicycles and our good old fashioned leather chappals to get around .
In California , it 's not unusual for a family of four to have four vehicles , and for each member to drive his or her own separate way , every day !
Whereas the Indian railway system is the world 's envy for its efficacy and efficiency , trains are a thing of the past in the States , more of a novelty than anything else .
Buses are used only as a last resort , and metros , subways and other urban forms of mass commute are practically non-existent in the Golden State , save San Francisco 's iconic streetcars .
And even those are primarily tourist attractions .
The average American 's idea of ' public transportation ' is sharing a taxi .
Compare this with Mumbai , where an estimated 6 million people avail of the local trains each day , cramming one on top of another into packed compartments .
Now , the discrepancy starts to make sense .
So next time you read of an environmentally conscious American preaching about India 's lack of a commitment to green - friendly practices , chances are , that the American is alone in his sports car , cruising the highways around Los Angeles , with the air conditioning on high .
Then , picture that packed Virar - Churchgate local in Mumbai .

In the last 10 days , universities around the country have seen more than a 20 - fold increase in the number of filesharing takedown notices from the recording industry , in an unexplained spike that seems focused on colleges in the Midwest .
The spike is not matched by an increase in actual file sharing .
" Universities are getting as many notices from the RIAA in one day as what they would typically get from all content owners in a month , " says Mark Luker , a vice president of higher education technology advocate Educause .
Indiana University says that starting on April 21 , the Recording Industry Association of America began sending 80 legal notices a day to the university , under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
Typically , the university handles less than 100 such notices a month from the RIAA , the Motion
Picture Association of America and HBO combined .
The DMCA notices include information about a specific IP address , file sharing protocol and named infringing file .
Indiana University 's tech staff routinely compare those details against the university 's logs to make sure that the allegations are accurate , according to Mark Bruhn , an associate vice president of IU 's information technology department .
But many of the recent notices do n't correspond to entries in traffic logs , which also do n't show any overall increase in file sharing , Bruhn said .
" We are not sure now what we have is an allegation of copyright infringement or an allegation of possible future illegal behavior , " Bruhn said .
" The whole thing is very concerning , to be frank .
We do n't know why they are doing this and I 'm not sure they know what they are doing . "
" They in fact can't know if the files being offered are actually the protected works of their clients – how would they know if they did n't download and open them ? "
Bruhn said .
University of Chicago has also seen a recent surge , its CIO confirmed to THREAT LEVEL .
Meanwhile , the Chronicle of Higher Education reported Wednesday that
George Washington University and University of Cincinnati are also reporting spikes beginning two weeks ago .
For its part , the RIAA denies there 's anything new to the letters , sending along a stock statement to THREAT LEVEL .
" We are always making an effort to more effectively and efficiently detect infringing activity on the Internet , as we are continuously looking for ways to improve our ability to find and act on incidences of theft online .
Having said that , there 's been no change in our procedures . "
RIAA spokeswoman Liz Kennedy did not respond to a follow - up request to explain the surge , and IU 's analysis that notices were being sent without proof of infringement .
Luker finds the RIAA 's position difficult to believe .
" It is for us hard to accept that students are multiplying their infringements by 30 , " Luker said .
Bruhn concurs .
" The RIAA says it is not new , but clearly it is , " Bruhn said .
University of California at Berkeley 's chief information officer Shel
Waggener confirmed he'd heard of the spikes and suggested there was a political purpose driving them .
" Public universities are in a unique position since the industry puts pressure on us through state legislatures to try to impose what are widely considered to be draconian content monitoring measures and turn us into tech police forces in support of a specific industry , " Waggener said .
The RIAA is also backing legislation in states such as Illinois and Tennessee that would require schools that get a certain number of notices to begin installing deep packet monitoring equipment on their internet and intranets , according to Luker .
" The number of DMCA notices that are sent to a university vary wildly from one day to the next , and no one , including the federal government knows how they send them out or what criteria they use , " Luker said .
" It is not reasonable in any way to use those counts as a basis for government actions . "
IU 's Bruhn says the school has typically treated the notices seriously , requiring first time offenders to take an online tutorial about copyright , suspending second time offenders from the university 's net for two weeks and indefinitely suspending anyone caught a third time .
Bruhn , Waggener and Luker all downplayed the amount of file sharing occurring on campus networks these days , saying that the MPAA , for instance , radically overestimated how much movie piracy was attributable to college students .
For more than two years , the industry claimed that more than 40 percent of illegal movie downloads came from college students – costing the industry billions of dollars .
Then in January of this year , the estimate was reduced to 15 % for college - aged students , and only 3 % occurring on campus networks .

Have you achieved optimal pelvic - floor fitness ?
This is the question posed by a new medical spa which recently opened in New York .
The clinic , Phit - short for " pelvic health integrated techniques " - offers everything from vulvar reconstruction to labiaplasty , all under the banner of " vaginal rejuvenation " .
Run by Dr Lauri J Romanzi , Phit is all about maximum pelvic floor elasticity .
Its signature treatment is a £ 75 gynaecological exam where the patient contracts her pelvic muscles around the doctor 's fingers to determine their strength .
And if you are not quite ready for " the ' other ' face - lift " ( non-surgical labial contouring to restore " plump firmness " ) , you could simply opt for the " lazy Susan " ( " painless electrical stimulation " of your pelvic floor muscles ) .
Alongside the " mommy makeover " which features four pelvic - toning sessions , one of Phit 's packages is marketed as " sexercise " .
This introduces an element of sexual athleticism , almost certainly so the clinic can market itself to young women as well as to the post-natal demographic .
There is something deeply disturbing about this development .
Not least because not all of us aspire to the acrobatic heights reached by the Filipino stripper in The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert ( who can fire ping - pong balls from her vagina ) .
Pelvic - floor fitness is controversial .
In some ways it is ideally placed to be the latest stick with which to beat women .
American surgeons , for example , have been known to offer women the grotesque reassurance that a caesarean section will keep them " honeymoon fresh " .
The craze for vaginal beautification simply preys on our worst fears : that we will become incontinent and sexually unattractive .
But how concerned do women really need to be about the state of their pelvic - floor muscles ?
Putting aside the extreme nature of the Phit clinic , pelvic - floor fitness is something every woman should be aware of , says Linda Cardozo , professor of urogynaecology at King 's College Hospital , London .
She recommends exercises called Kegels ( tightening and releasing the muscles ) from teenage years onwards .
" It 's much easier to learn how to contract undamaged muscles , " she says .
" Schoolgirls should learn how to do pelvic - floor exercises and do them on a daily basis . "
The problem with the pelvic floor for women , she says , is that it is a " design fault " in the female body .
Large mammals were designed to walk on four legs .
Now that we walk on two , the pelvic floor has to bear the weight of our internal organs ( the womb increases this in women ) .
Modern women also subject it to more abuse than in the past , with heavy lifting and exercise .
" There is much more impact on women 's pelvic floors than there used to be and women are more conscious of problems , " says Cardozo .
When the pelvic floor fails , the result is stress incontinence ( when the muscles come under pressure ) .
This can occur when you laugh , cough , sneeze or exert yourself , and is often reported as a post-natal problem .
" About 50 % of women will have some urinary leakage at some time after childbirth , " says Cardozo .
By the age of 80 , however , 11 % of all women will have undergone an operation for incontinence or pelvic - organ prolapse ( when the womb collapses into the vagina and the bladder or bowel can slip out of place ) .
Not all of these women will have gone through childbirth .
The incidence of vaginal prolapse is increasing , says Professor Cardozo , but only because older women are now more aware of it and more likely to seek help .
Weight is a factor ; Cardozo advises a body mass index of below 30 ( the ideal is 20 to 25 ) .
She recommends cycling and swimming as suitable exercise because they do not stress the pelvic floor : running for hours on the treadmill or a lot of high - impact exercise can cause problems .
Avoid trampolining wherever possible , she adds .
( " Seventy per cent of young girls who trampoline wet themselves . " )
Yoga and , particularly , Pilates are " excellent " , says Cardozo , because they can strengthen the pelvic - floor muscles .
Sally Imber of the Pilates Practice in Clapham , London , explains : " The pelvic floor is the main focus in Pilates .
Nearly every single exercise you 're doing , even if it 's one working your feet , is engaging the pelvic floor .
To put it bluntly , it 's just like trying to stop yourself from peeing : you engage that part of your body as tightly as possible , upwardly and inwardly .
The most important thing is not to hold your breath at the same time . "
These exercises are not only for women who have just had children .
" There are many issues with incontinence as people get older , both for men and women , " she adds .
( Pelvic - floor exercises for men have also been shown to help men with erectile dysfunction . )
Having a Caesarean is no sure way for a woman to avoid pelvic - floor problems .
" C-sections partially protect but not completely .
Just being pregnant and having nine months of intra-abdominal pressure is enough .
Women who have not had children are less likely to have pelvic - floor problems , " Cardozo says .
But not even this guarantees immunity .
" If you are born with weak collagen - the elastic tissue in your body - you are more likely to be exposed to pelvic - floor problems . "
When genes are to blame , it is hard to know whether preventative efforts will have any effect .
" There is a fine line between worrying women and looking at what they can actually do , " says Bruce Ramsay , an obstetrician and gynaecologist from Peterborough .
" There are so many health messages and there is enough that we would like people to be doing , without worrying about their pelvic floor . "
It is also difficult to define what " normal " is .
" Narrowing of the vagina after childbirth is now offered as a form of cosmetic surgery , " says Ramsay , " because women 's expectations of sexual intercourse have altered .
But if you talk to women in the older generation , their expectation is that these things are normal and it's just a natural part of getting older .
Previously , if someone had incontinence , they would just buy pads and limit their activity . "
Both Ramsay and Cardozo suggest seeing a physiotherapist if you are worried about your pelvic floor .
If you have physical symptoms , you can get a referral from a GP .
If it is just for reassurance , you will have to see one privately .
Pelvic - floor toning devices such as Aquaflex ( vaginal cones available from Boots for £ 25 ) can be useful for anyone who is not sure they are tightening the right muscles , says Cardozo .
( If you 're doing it wrong , the cone will drop out . )
But I do n't recommend visiting the Phit website .
Unless you want to feel slightly queasy and extremely vaginally inadequate , that is .
Some of us spend too much time on multiple social media websites .
When I started using social media websites , I spent hours on things that were not really necessary .
Afterward I discovered some Extensions for Firefox ( If you still use IE , this is just another reason to switch ) that did n’t only save me a lot of time but also enhanced my experience with these Web 2.0 sites .

Pioneer 's 16 - layer optical disc
Pioneer Corporation has succeeded in developing a 16 - layer read - only optical disc with a capacity of 400 gigabytes for the first time in the world .
Its per-layer capacity is 25 gigabytes , which is the same as that of a Blu-ray Disc ( BD ) .
This multilayer technology will also be applicable to multilayer recordable discs .
For multilayer optical discs , it has been difficult to obtain clear signals from each recording layer in a stable manner due to crosstalk from adjacent layers and transmission loss .
Utilizing the optical disc production technology that it has developed in the DVD field , Pioneer solved these problems by , among other things , using a disc structure that can reduce crosstalk from adjacent layers , resulting in a 16 - layer optical disc that can playback high - quality signals from every layer .
As for the read - out system , Pioneer achieved stability in the playback of recorded signals by employing a wide - range spherical aberration compensator and light - receiving element that can read out weak signals at a high signal - to - noise ratio in the optical pick - up mechanism .
Since the optical specifications of the objective lens , such as NA ( Numerical Aperture ) , are the same as those for the existing BD discs , it is possible to maintain compatibility between the new 16 - layer optical disc and the BD discs .
Pioneer will present the details of this research at the International Symposium on Optical Memory and Optical Data Storage 2008 ( ISOM / ODS2008 ) to be held in Hawaii from July 13 .

GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE , Cuba ( Reuters ) - Osama bin Laden ’s former driver took the stand on Tuesday at the U.S. military war court where he faces trial next week and described isolation , sleep deprivation and sexual impropriety during nearly seven years of captivity .
A 2004 sketch of Salim Ahmed Hamdan ( L ) appearing with appointed council Lt. Cmdr. Charles Swift during a preliminary hearing held on the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , August 24 , 2004 .
REUTERS / Sketch by Art Lein / POOL
It was the first time prisoner Salim Hamdan , who challenged President George W. Bush and won , testified before the war court at the remote U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Hamdan ’s lawsuit led the U.S. Supreme Court in 2006 to strike down the original military tribunal system created by Bush .
In Washington on Tuesday , the Justice Department urged a federal judge to allow the trial of Hamdan , a Yemeni in his late 30s , to go forward , opposing a request by Hamdan ’s lawyers to halt it based on last month ’s landmark Supreme Court ruling which extended some constitutional rights to the detainees .
If his trial goes ahead , it will be the first before the U.S. war court at the base , where prison camps were set up to hold terrorism suspects captured after the September 11 attacks on the United States by al Qaeda militants in 2001 .
In pre-trial hearings this week , Hamdan ’s lawyers are asking the court to exclude their client ’s statements from trial due to “ coercive ” tactics of interrogators .
Hamdan took the stand wearing a traditional white headdress and white gown under a Western - style beige suit jacket .
He appeared detached and sombre .
His lawyer , Charles Swift , walked his client through his captivity from his capture in Afghanistan in November 2001 , where he said he was beaten , to his years at Guantanamo where he reluctantly described how a female interrogator had touched him while soldiers stood nearby .
“ She came very close with her whole body towards me , ” Hamdan said through an interpreter , his eyes downcast at times .
Pressed by Swift for details , he said : “ She touched me above the knee . ” “ Where ? ” Swift asked .
“ Did she touch your thigh ? ” “ Yes , ” he said , adding that he began answering her questions after she implied she was going to touch his groin .
A number of detainees have accused female interrogators of violating Muslim sexual taboos by touching them provocatively .
SLEEP DEPRIVATION
About 265 prisoners are currently held at Guantanamo and the war court has been heavily criticized by human and legal rights organizations .
In Canada , lawyers for the only western prisoner still held at Guantanamo , Canadian Omar Khadr , on Tuesday released secret video taken of Khadr during one interrogation .
The video was taken in February 2003 and shows Khadr , then 16 , weeping and moaning .
His lawyers said he suffered “ torture and abuse ” including sleep deprivation and threats of rape .
Hamdan , who has admitted driving for al Qaeda leader bin Laden , is charged with conspiracy and providing material support to terrorists .
Prosecutors say he was a willing participant in al Qaeda while his lawyers argue he was a member of a motor pool who needed the $ 200 monthly salary .
Questioned by a prosecutor , Hamdan denied he had a close relationship with bin Laden or was a member of al Qaeda .
Asked why his name was found on a list of alleged al Qaeda members , he said : “ Any one person can write anything he wants ... you can write the name of the American president , George Bush . ”
On Monday , Hamdan ’s lawyers said Guantanamo “ confinement ” records suggested Hamdan had been put into a sleep deprivation program during a 50 - day period in the summer of 2003 .
In court , Hamdan described how guards would pound on his cell door to awaken him the night before interrogations .
“ You go back to sleep .
The soldier comes back again within five to ten minutes , ” he said .
“ All he wants to do is wake you up .
He knocks on the door or causes some rackets or noise . ”
In court documents , prosecutors said , “ Hamdan ’s allegations of mistreatment are false . ”
A defence psychiatrist , Dr. Emily Keram , later testified that Hamdan has symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder and major depression .
She said the interrogation techniques used on him reminded her of those used at the “ Hanoi Hilton , ” where American prisoners of war were held during the Vietnam war .
The Netflix Player continues to gain in popularity .
Roku has finally released the GPL code for their Netflix Player .
Just today Forbes published that Roku would roll out a software update allowing it to stream from other online services .
The diminutive device has no internal storage and just enough RAM to buffer the stream .
Many have wondered how a Linux box is handling the DRM ; this is purely a feature of the NXP PNX8935 processor being used .
While waiting for the code , hackers have already popped the box open to see what ’s inside .
We found [ hokiokie7 ] ’s photos of the internals on Roku ’s forum .
The only really interesting thing we ’ve seen so far is that the WiFi is on a daughter card that plugs into the USB .
That should make it much easier to support other devices , if users ever manage to get into the system .
UPDATE : [ mbailey ] points out in the comments that he was able to telnet to the device .

During a press availability in Sderot , Israel this morning Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama , reiterated his strong support for Israel , “ I bring to Sderot an unshakable commitment to Israel ’s security .
The state of Israel faces determined enemies who seek its destruction .
But it also has a friend and ally in the United States that will always stand by the people of Israel . ”
He said that he understands why Israel is reluctant to negotiate with Hamas , which does not recognize their right to exist , “ If somebody were sending rockets into my house , where my two daughters sleep at night , I ’m going to do everything in my power to stop it .
And I would expect Israelis to do the same thing . ”
Obama also restated his belief that Jerusalem should be the capital of Israel , but that the issue should be negotiated , “ That ’s an issue that has to be dealt with the parties involved , the Palestinians and the Israelis , and it is not the job of the United States to dictate the form in which that will take , but rather to support the efforts that are being made right now to resolve these very difficult issues that have a long history . ”

He was asked by a reporter if this was a change in his position from the speech he gave at AIPAC , where he said that the city should remain undivided , “ I did n’t change my statement .
I continue to say Jerusalem will be the capital of Israel .
I will say it before and I will say it again . ”
He also stated that he would be willing to sit down with Iran without preconditions , which is something that the Bush administration now seems to be doing .
This is the segment of Obama ’s trip that holds the most political peril for him .
He is facing a great deal of skepticism both in Israel and with Jewish voters in the US .
I personally would like to see Obama shift our policy back to the Clinton position and get the peace process back on track .
I think that his stance is much too hard line to be viewed as fair broker for peace by the Arab world .
In my opinion , this is a stance designed to win votes at home , and if elected , I hope that he would move a little closer to the center .

Science is the effort of trying to understand how the physical world works .
From observation and experimentation , science uses physical evidence of natural phenomena to compile data and analyze the collated information .
Science really prospers and advances when individuals share the results of their experiments with others in the scientific community .
There is a certain logic that scientific software should therefore be released in a freely distributable environment .
To provide an insight into the quality of software that is available , we have compiled a list of 42 high quality Linux scientific applications , covering a broad spectrum of uses .

Hoosiers Offended By Wedding Photo
By Margaret Lyons in News on Aug 18 , 2008 7:53 PM
Officials for the Indiana State Fair win today 's WTF award .
The pulled this wedding photo ( click to embiggen ) , which was the state contest 's highest - scoring picture , because , according to fair officials , people complained about its content .
You know , because it 's a ... married couple sitting ?
The hell ?
Photographer Randy Baughn says he 's as lost as we are .
" I went to the fair last Thursday with my wife , and we went to the exhibit , and the print was n't there , " he tells us .
Baughn says he asked a fair representative what happened to the picture , but only after pressing the guy — and saying that he took the photo in question — did Baughn get an answer .
" He finally told me they were getting four to six complaints a day , people saying stuff like ' it 's smut ' or that they would n't bring their daughter to see it , " Baughn says .
That was the first he'd heard that anyone objected to the picture .
" I see more leg square dancing , " Baughn says .
" I saw more muffin tops and cleavage walking around at the fair . "
Baughn identifies himself as a conservative Christian , which is why , he says , the uproar — especially in the comments on the Indy Star 's website — is even more baffling .
" This has turned into a liberal vs. conservative issue , and I did n't expect it to go there , " he says .
" I 've received dozens of e-mails and phone calls from people saying they support me , they support the photograph — but no one from the conservative right , which I think I am , felt compelled to [ contact me ] .... People are saying there 's no way I could love God , or no way a Christian could support this .... it makes my chest ache , " he says .
" I want to say , ' drop the bat !
I 'm on your team ! ' "
" It 's a married couple that has affection for each other , showing how in love they are — I see things at wedding receptions every single weekend I find a lot more offensive , " Baughn sighs .
" If my daughter wants a photo like that on her wedding day , I 'll take it , " he says .
" It 's her husband ! "
State fair rules allow complained - about photos to be removed at the organizers ' discretion , and the picture was apparently rehung since the story ran in the Indy Star .
[ In the interest of disclosure , I know the reporter who wrote the Indy Star story . ]
But the potential effects of a rescue become more complex for the holders of Fannie ’s and Freddie ’s $ 19 billion in subordinated debt , so - called because it ranks below other bonds in the companies ’ capital structures .
As UBS analysts point out , because Fannie ’s and Freddie ’s subordinated debt is used when they calculate capital  the financial cushion regulators require to support the companies ’ operations  interest payments on the debt may have to stop if a bailout occurs .
Such a hiatus could last up to five years .
While this would hurt subordinated debt holders , a deferral of interest payments has even broader ramifications .
Halting those payments would put the bonds into default and force payouts on credit insurance that has already been written .
In the debt market , this is known as a “ credit event . ”
ON its Web site , and in language that only a lawyer could love , Fannie Mae describes some terms of its subordinated debt .
For the debt to qualify for capital calculations , it must require the deferral of interest payments “ for up to five years if ( 1 ) Fannie Mae ’s core capital falls below minimum capital and , pursuant to Fannie Mae ’s request , the secretary of the Treasury exercises discretionary authority to purchase the company ’s obligations under Section 304 ( c ) of the Fannie Mae Charter Act , or ( 2 ) Fannie Mae ’s core capital falls below 125 percent of critical capital . ”
Here ’s a translation : A bailout could mean no interest payments on the subordinated debt .
“ If we reasonably assume that the Treasury would only intervene in the event that Fannie or Freddie is declared significantly undercapitalized by its regulator , ” UBS analysts wrote , “ then interest payments on the qualifying subordinated debt is automatically deferred for up to five years . ”
Because nonpayment of interest would be seen as a credit event , UBS added , entities that have bought protection on Fannie ’s and Freddie ’s subordinated debt would be entitled to payment by the entities that wrote the insurance .
This , even though taxpayers are standing behind Fannie ’s and Freddie ’s debt , not allowing it to fail .
Talk about the laws of unintended consequences .
It is not clear how much insurance has been written on the subordinated debt .
The actual holders of the debt very likely hedged their stakes with credit insurance , which is intended to protect buyers in the event of a default .

Play with our Prototypes
Spore has been a huge undertaking .
Along the way we ended up exploring countless design directions in gameplay , simulation and user interface .
One of the ways in which we explore possible design directions is by building simple , playable prototypes that we can play around with to get a sense for a particular system .
Usually these prototypes are never seen by the public , but we thought some of the more intrepid players out there might enjoy playing around with a few of our early Spore prototypes .

I recently had the opportunity to talk with social media expert Muhammad Saleem about social networking .
For those of you new to the site , I interviewed Muhammad back in February on Lifehack Live .
Muhammad is the one to watch in the social media sphere .
He ’s a top - ranked user on Digg , Propellr , Reddit , and other social news sites , he has almost 2000 followers on Twitter , and he blogs or contributes guest posts just about everywhere .
He is jsut the person I wanted to talk to about making the most of social networking services like LinkedIn , Facebook , and Twitter .
Advertising
Although I was n’t interviewing him for Lifehack , in the course of the conversation Muhammad gave a good number of tips on how best to approach and use social media sites .
We talked for over an hour , but I ’ve boiled his advice down to the following nine points .
1. Permission
Almost all social media sites , from Digg to Twitter , have some way for users to control who can and cannot reach them .
These are minimal standards , though — all they do is open a channel .
Do n’t abuse people by trying to fake them out or overwhelming them with updates — they ’ll just close the door entirely .
2. Relevance
Do n’t add relationships willy - nilly .
Limit your “ friends ” or “ connections ” or whatever they ’re called on your favorite social media site to people who share at least some of the same interests as you .
And be selective when sending out “ shouts ” or “ DMs ” or whatever you send — send updates to people for whom they are meaningful , not everyone you just happen to have some connection with .
Advertising
3. Relationships
It should go without saying that to make the best use of a social network , you have to network , but a lot of people seem to want to do an end - run around that .
Building relationships starts with a friend request or invite — it does n’t end there .
Get to know the people you are connected with .
Answer their questions , send them a link or piece of information now and again , and read their profiles .
4. Integrity
Do n’t be phony !
Be yourself — it ’s what your social network friends added you for .
There are , of course , many ways to “ game ” just about every social media system , to get more diggs , to appear to have more followers , to get your posts Stumbled , and so on .
But in the end , it ’s an empty gain — people who follow you because you appear to be something you ’re not will quickly un - follow you , people who end up at your site because you managed to get more votes on a post than you deserve will leave without reading , and all you ’ll have is an empty number to show off .
5. Focus
Signing up for social networking sites and social news sites is easy , but unless you ’re willing to put in some work , you wo n’t get much out of it .
You need to keep your profile reasonably up - to - date , maintain at least a marginally active presence , and talk to other people now and again to make it work .
If you have a hundred different profiles on a hundred different sites , you ’ll soon get overwhelmed and none of them will get the attention they need to thrive .
Pick a handful of services and sites to put a lot of energy into — or however many you have time to really commit to — and stay off the rest .
Advertising
6. Diversify
That said , do n’t participate in too few sites , either .
First of all , if you slip up and damage your reputation at one , you ’ll have to start from scratch somewhere else .
But more importantly , different sites have different strengths .
LinkedIn is best for professional advance , MySpace for broadcasting your interests and creative work ;
Digg is traditionally better suited to news , especially technology and weird stuff , StumbleUpon to smaller niches .
7. Personality
Social networking is about connections between people , not profiles .
Make use of the means for self - expression offered by each service — whether that ’s the way you summarize stories for social news sites , or a blogging platform , or feeds integrated from your non-social network sites .
Worry less about finding the perfect background or your 5 favorite songs and more about creating something people want to pay attention to .
8. Giving
You have to put into social networks in order to get out from them .
This is basic human nature — anthropologists call it “ reciprocity ” .
If you want recommendations on Linked In , start writing some — people will usually return the favor .
If you want followers on Twitter , start following people — again , people will usually return the favor .
Once you do something for someone , they will generally want to do something for you in return .
But you have to take the lead .
Advertising
9. Add Value
This is the single most important thing to remember on any social networking site .
Do whatever it takes to make your posts , your profile , your story submissions , or whatever the “ currency ” of the site it , as valuable as possible .
You add value when you submit a link ; you add more value when you include a really good description of the article ; you add more value still when you explain why I would want to read it ; and you add yet more value when you tell me what the author left out or how the information might be used .
Social media sites can be great ways to promote a brand , promote your business , find clients , get jobs , find new employees , and build personal relationships , but they do n’t “ just work ” .
They ’re tools , not machines — you have to use them , not put in some inputs and wait for them to do their magic .
Keep the 9 principles above in mind , and you ’ll find that people start responding pretty quick — after all , they ’re there for the same reason you are , to find people whose interests mesh with their own .
Korea ’s Prime Minister , Han Seung - soo of Korea , opened the 22nd World Congress of Philosophy in Korea on Tuesday .
Over 2 , 000 delegates from 102 countries are expected to attend the 8 - day long conference , which is held every five years .
Although the Congress was first held in Paris in 1900 , this is the first time it has been hosted in Asia .
The theme of the Congress if Rethinking Philosophy Today , and it would seem to need rethinking if such global gatherings are going to result in genuine exchange .
The diverse approaches on display at the conference range from Jainism , Buddhism and Confucianism , through to Hegelian dialectics , hermeneutics and Anglo - American analytic philosophy .
Although all are welcome into the philosophy family for the congress , it is not clear to what extent the delegates actually study the same subject at all .
Nevertheless , the opening speeches were something of a call to arms , with philosophy frequently being invoked as a necessary aid to solving world problems .
Peter Kemp , President of FISP ( The International Federation of Philosophical Societies ) said that â€œwe need philosophy , we need the power of the word .
This need is the deepest drive we have .â€ 
Of philosophers , he said they â€œmay warn humanity against hidden destructive forces or carelessness that might be disastrous.â€ 
I ’m here in Seoul , exhibiting and reporting for tpm .
I ’ve posted two blogs about the Congress at the Guardian ’s Comment is Free , here and here .
More should follow , and I ’m also hoping to post some things more directly here , but it ’s busy , tiring , and hot !

Blog Vs. Book
I wish someone had warned me that some people would automatically assume I ’m an authority on the craft of writing just because I ’ve written a book .
Several people have shoved manuscripts into my hands and asked for my advice .
I ’m not qualified to talk about writing .
I ’ve written exactly one book .
I ’ve never taken a creative writing class .
The last time anyone ran a red pen through what I had written was in college .
The only book I ever read about being a writer was Stephen King ’s excellent On Writing .
If you dropped me into an MFA program I ’d probably freak .
No , you wo n’t read me waxing philosophically about the joys and pains of writerdom .
There are authors with far more experience and books under their belts that can do a much better job than I .
What I can discuss with a smidgen of authority , however , is that writing a book is quite different from writing a blog .
A blog is defined by the hive mind over at Wikipedia as “ a website usually maintained by an individual , with regular entries of commentary , descriptions of events , or other material such as graphics or video .
Entries are commonly displayed in reverse chronological order . ”
I have to admit , however , that the definition Urban Dictionary cooked up is often more apropos .
“ A meandering , blatantly uninteresting online diary that gives the author the illusion that people are interested in their stupid , pathetic life .
Consists of such riveting entries as ‘ homework sucks ’ and ‘ I slept until noon today ’ . ”
But whatever topic a blogger wishes to discuss , whether stories about retail hell , trivial everyday occurrences , or exhibitionistic tales about one ’s love life , the key to attracting readers is to regularly update one ’s site .
Some über bloggers will throw ten or twenty posts up on their website every hour .
Most online diarists thankfully content themselves with updating only once or twice a day .
I ’m an anomaly in the blogging world .
Over the past four and a half years I ’ve written 450 short stories about life in and outside of the restaurant business .
That works out to one post every three and a half days — a snail ’s pace in the blogsphere .
Despite that low output , however , I ’ve been very fortunate to have a legion of faithful , some would say fanatical , readers that click over every day , hoping to find a new post .
I am very grateful to them .
I am also very grateful to blogging .
You see , blogging forced me to write .
I had a fan base demanding updates so I tried my best to post at least twice a week .
This kind of expectation from the readers forced me to sit down and bang away at my keyboard even when I did n’t want to .
And , like anything else , you always get better at something the more you practice it .
( I hope ! )
Blogging also satisfied my instant gratification jones .
I would take an hour or so to write something , post it , and within minutes people would start leaving feedback in the comment section .
Eighty percent of the time , the feedback would be favorable — but the other 20 % would make your hair curl .
Lovely comments like , “ You ’re a loser , ” or “ Your writing ’s execrable , ” and “ You ’re a waste of oxygen ” helped to toughen me up .
While I hope my book gets favorable reviews from mainstream media , I doubt professional book reviewers will employ such abusive language if they do n’t like it .
The process is similar to my previous experience working in a psychiatric hospital and how it prepared me for waiting tables .
No matter how bad a crazed customer got , no matter how abusive the chef , at least no one was throwing the contents of their bedpan at me .
The comments I received also helped me in two very important ways .
First off , there were times that I worried that my blog was indeed a “ meandering ” effort to justify a “ stupid , pathetic life . ”
We all get down on ourselves from time to time .
I ’m no exception .
But when millions of people visit your website every year and thousands of people tell you they like your writing , well , that ’s a great confidence builder .
Secondly , I received many comments and emails from readers who would offer constructive criticism , tell me when I had spelled something wrong , chide me when I had written something lame , and encourage me to dream and work harder .
For that I ’ll always be grateful .
But I discovered early that blogging is nothing like writing a book .
Writing a blog is like being the head guru in a commune of hippies .
Writing a book , however , is like being a hermit in the desert .
It ’s an isolating experience .
And when you ’re an instant gratification junkie like me , losing the instantaneous feedback I had gotten used to while blogging was the hardest thing to deal with .
Instead of writing something in an hour and putting it up for worldwide consumption , I was toiling at the keyboard for hours a day to satisfy an audience of one — my editor .
My editor did n’t get daily updates on what I had written and , while her periodic feedback was insightful and invaluable , the paucity of feedback compared to what I had gotten online caused me to go into approval withdrawal .
“ What happens if my editor does n’t like what I ’ve been writing the past three months ? ” I wondered during one particularly crazed detox period .
“ What happens if she discovers I ’ve been unconsciously typing ‘ All work and no play make jack a dull boy , ’ ten thousand times ? ”
It was within this crucible that I began to understand why the protagonist suffering from writer ’s block in Stephen King ’s The Shining transformed into a Shelly Duvall - chasing , hallucinating , axe wielding psycho .
Writing a book is hard work .
The longest it ever took me to write a blog post was five hours .
A book takes months .
The job never seems to end and what I was writing often threatened to morph into gibberish .
Whenever I did something other than writing , like go to the movies , I suffered from feelings of guilt .
Listening as it hummed with malevolent energy , I began to suspect my computer was possessed by evil sprits poised to taunt me every time I took a break .
Quite simply , blogging did n’t prepare me for the emotional ferocity of writing a book .
It did n’t prepare me for the claustrophobia and fear , the exhausting concentration coupled with tedium , and the isolation compounded by occasionally crying like a little girl .
( How embarrassing ! )
Psychologically speaking , writing a book is like getting into a knife fight with yourself in a phone booth .
I also discovered another truism — you ca n’t write a book and maintain a blog at the same time .
If you try , one or the other is going to suffer — usually both .
That was a lesson I had to learn the hard way .
When I started my book I used the mornings to write about being a waiter , worked nights as a server in a restaurant , then spent the wee hours blogging about what happened during my shift .
That would drive anybody nuts .
Eventually , I got so sick and tired of writing about restaurants , that whenever my roommate would flip the channel over to the Food Network , I had to resist the compulsion to shut off the television with a .45 caliber remote control .
Since I did n’t want to go to jail and pay for a new television set , I came to the conclusion that something had to give .
So I cut back writing on my blog .
It was a painful but necessary decision .
I love my blog .
I love writing for that immediate worldwide audience .
But , deep down , I knew I had to temporarily turn my back on the very thing that gave me the opportunity to write Waiter Rant in the first place .
Now that the book is completed I hope to return to blogging on a more regular basis .
While the marketing wags will tell you that maintaining an online presence is vital , it ’s also important never to forget the online readers who helped get you noticed in the first place .
Several days ago the UPS guy delivered 50 copies of my book to my house .
When I opened the box and saw the hard cover copies for the first time , I could n’t keep the smile off my face .
Now I ’m the second person in my family to write a book .
My father penned a murder mystery titled Rude Promenade a short while ago .
Now my book can go next to his on the bookshelf .
( Proud of you Dad !
Now I ’m waiting for your next book ! )
For me , writing my book was an amazing experience that pushed my limits and showed me what I was capable of .
And while blogging is a very different animal , I ’ll always keep doing it .
Writing for an instant internet audience is a laboratory of sorts .
You can write humor one day , tragedy the next , and get some real world opinions on what works and what does n’t .
It ’ll be good homework for me as I try and write my second book .
I know what you ’re thinking .
I said I would n’t wax philosophical about writing but I did .
Must be an occupational hazard .

Businesses shocked ...
Sensational new way to Make £ 2380 from home revealed by a trusted insider
Let me ask you a question ...
Have you ever wished you could make money from home , working when you want , and taking as much time off as you please ?
So did I .
And 7 years ago I set out to do it .
The answer was in the casinos .
But I am no gambler .
Far from it !
I 'm a mathematician .
But I realized that there is so much money to be made in casinos that if I could find a way to access a small part of that legally then I could do very very well .
Now I am a member of the tiny club of users that the casinos fear .
I have learned how to beat the system and walk away with big winnings , time after time , while dramatically reducing the chance of a loss .
This is the system that has shocked casinos across France , and is now being discovered in the UK and even in the United States !
It 's this simple : Decide right now you want to be one of these people , and less than 7 days from today you WILL be a member of a very exclusive group of people .
The small group of people that can literally walk away with handfuls of cash from the roulette table - every time .

So , if there is a way to win consistently why have n't the casinos clamped down and changed the rules ?
Well the brief answer is that they cant !
To understand why you will need to go back to the origins of the roulette and the science of game theory .
We 'll cover that in more detail below but suffice to say that the casinos are quite happy with the situation as it is .
After all when they make money from 98.2 % of players then they are quite happy to lose on the occasional professional gamer .
Their fear is that the number of winners using a casino - killing system like this should grow , but as I will show you that is not likely to happen for a very long time .
I am offering a small number of people the secrets to this technique .
A simple to follow strategy guide that outlines exactly what you need to do to go from being a casual roulette player to a winning professional .
The guide takes you from the background of roulette through to the mathematics of winning and into a simple and easy to follow system that WILL turn you into a winner .
This guide is the result of 7 years of intense study of the game and of the mathematics of game theory - all to increase the net cashflow to you .
You could call me a roulette geek .
I have tested the system on over 100 roulette games , both online and in real casinos , and from Sept 2002 to Sep 2020 I have refined it to further reduce losses and increase the winnings .
I am now one of the UK 's foremost experts on the game and I am offering this incredible depth of expertise to you in my Mayer Roulette Strategy
And the best bit of all ?
This strategy is perfectly legal and the casinos cant stop you .
Unless of course they change their rules .
But even if that were to happen there are a thousand other casinos that you could go to .

This will be the easiest money you have ever made .
Just to give you a REAL idea of what this amazing technique can make you I have detailed below my winnings from 1st August to 8th August this year .

You 've probably heard about this , like you need a deposit of over £ 5000 , so you can play with large bets and have large winnings .
WHO Needs
This ?
Only a loser would follow this awful idea .
Only a fool would invest his money in a system without knowing if it works or not .
Why ca n’t you start betting with $ 0.1 or $ 1 chips ?
And after checking the system and being sure that it consistently wins you can increase the bet .
Bear this important mantra in mind .
Let your bankroll increase ONLY from your winnings and not from your pocket

And with the number of online casinos snowballing recently , the possibilities to keep using the system are near endless .

" I 've got to admit it , I was skeptical , " John says .
" Roulette is a game I know well and I play it online and in the casinos .
I 've tried Roulette systems without any success so I was pretty dubious .
I agreed to give the Mayer technique a shot .

In August , 2000 , Dr. Roger Wetherbee , an infectious - disease expert at New York University ’s Tisch Hospital , received a disturbing call from the hospital ’s microbiology laboratory .
At the time , Wetherbee was in charge of handling outbreaks of dangerous microbes in the hospital , and the laboratory had isolated a bacterium called Klebsiella pneumoniae from a patient in an intensive - care unit .
“ It was literally resistant to every meaningful antibiotic that we had , ” Wetherbee recalled recently .
The microbe was sensitive only to a drug called colistin , which had been developed decades earlier and largely abandoned as a systemic treatment , because it can severely damage the kidneys .
“ So we had this report , and I looked at it and said to myself , ‘ My God , this is an organism that basically we ca n’t treat . ’ ”
Doctors fear that dangerous bacteria may become entrenched in hospitals .
Illustration by Bruce Mccall
Klebsiella is in a class of bacteria called gram - negative , based on its failure to pick up the dye in a Gram ’s stain test .
( Gram - positive organisms , which include Streptococcus and Staphylococcus , have a different cellular structure . )
It inhabits both humans and animals and can survive in water and on inanimate objects .
We can carry it on our skin and in our noses and throats , but it is most often found in our stool , and fecal contamination on the hands of caregivers is the most frequent source of infection among patients .
Healthy people can harbor Klebsiella to no detrimental effect ; those with debilitating conditions , like liver disease or severe diabetes , or those recovering from major surgery , are most likely to fall ill .
The bacterium is oval in shape , resembling a TicTac , and has a thick , sugar - filled outer coat , which makes it difficult for white blood cells to engulf and destroy it .
Fimbria — fine , hairlike extensions that enable Klebsiella to adhere to the lining of the throat , trachea , and bronchi— project from the bacteria ’s surface ; the attached microbes can travel deep into our lungs , where they destroy the delicate alveoli , the air sacs that allow us to obtain oxygen .
The resulting hemorrhage produces a blood - filled sputum , nicknamed “ currant jelly . ”
Klebsiella can also attach to the urinary tract and infect the kidneys .
When the bacteria enter the bloodstream , they release a fatty substance known as an endotoxin , which injures the lining of the blood vessels and can cause fatal shock .
Tisch Hospital has four intensive - care units , all in the east wing on the fifteenth floor , and at the time of the outbreak there were thirty - two intensive - care beds .
The I.C.U.s were built in 1961 , and although the equipment had been modernized over the years , the units had otherwise remained relatively unchanged : the beds were close to each other , with I.V. pumps and respirators between them , and doctors and nursing staff were shared among the various I.C.U.s .
This was an ideal environment for a highly infectious bacterium .
It was the first major outbreak of this multidrug - resistant strain of Klebsiella in the United States , and Wetherbee was concerned that the bacterium had become so well adapted in the I.C.U. that it could not be killed with the usual ammonia and phenol disinfectants .
Only bleach seemed able to destroy it .
Wetherbee and his team instructed doctors , nurses , and custodial staff to perform meticulous hand washing , and had them wear gowns and gloves when attending to infected patients .
He instituted strict protocols to insure that gloves were changed and hands vigorously disinfected after handling the tubing on each patient ’s ventilator .
Spray bottles with bleach solutions were installed in the I.C.U.s , and surfaces and equipment were cleaned several times a day .
Nevertheless , in the ensuing months Klebsiella infected more than a dozen patients .
In late autumn of 2000 , in addition to pneumonia patients began contracting urinary - tract and bloodstream infections from Klebsiella .
The latter are often lethal , since once Klebsiella infects the bloodstream it can spread to every organ in the body .
Wetherbee reviewed procedures in the I.C.U. again and discovered that the Foley catheters , used to drain urine from the bladder , had become a common source of contamination ; when emptying the urine bags , staff members inadvertently splashed infected urine onto their gloves and onto nearby machinery .
“ They were very effectively moving the organism from one bed to the next , ” Wetherbee said .
He ordered all the I.C.U.s to be decontaminated ; the patients were temporarily moved out , supplies discarded , curtains changed , and each room was cleaned from floor to ceiling with a bleach solution .
Even so , of the thirty - four patients with infections that year , nearly half died .
The outbreak subsided in October , 2003 , after even more stringent procedures for decontamination and hygiene were instituted : patients kept in isolation , and staff and visitors required to wear gloves , masks , and gowns at all times .
“ My basic premise , ” Wetherbee said , “ is that you take a capable microörganism like Klebsiella and you put it through the gruelling test of being exposed to a broad spectrum of antibiotics and it will eventually defeat your efforts , as this one did . ”
Although Tisch Hospital has not had another outbreak , the bacteria appeared soon after at several hospitals in Brooklyn and one in Queens .
When I spoke to infectious - disease experts this spring , I was told that the resistant Klebsiella had also appeared at Mt. Sinai Medical Center , in Manhattan , and in hospitals in New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Cleveland , and St. Louis .
Of the so - called superbugs — those bacteria that have developed immunity to a wide number of antibiotics — the methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or MRSA , is the most well known .
Dr. Robert Moellering , a professor at Harvard Medical School , a past president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America , and a leading expert on antibiotic resistance , pointed out that MRSA , like Klebsiella , originally occurred in I.C.U.s , especially among patients who had undergone major surgery .
“ Until about ten years ago , ” Moellering told me , “ virtually all cases of MRSA were either in hospitals or nursing homes .
In the hospital setting , they cause wound infections after surgery , pneumonias , and bloodstream infections from indwelling catheters .
But they can cause a variety of other infections , all the way to bacterial meningitis . ”
The first deaths from MRSA in community settings , reported at the end of the nineteen - nineties , were among children in North Dakota and Minnesota .
“ And then it started showing up in men who have sex with men , ” Moellering said .
“ Soon , it began to be spread in prisons among the prisoners .
Now we see it in a whole bunch of other populations . ”
An outbreak among the St. Louis Rams football team , passed on through shared equipment , particularly affected the team ’s linemen ; artificial turf , which causes skin abrasions that are prone to infection , exacerbated the problem .
Other outbreaks were reported among insular religious groups in rural New York ; Hurricane Katrina evacuees ; and illegal tattoo recipients .
“ And now it ’s basically everybody , ” Moellering said .
The deadly toxin produced by the strain of MRSA found in U.S. communities , Panton - Valentine leukocidin , is thought to destroy the membranes of white blood cells , damaging the body ’s primary defense against the microbe .
In 2006 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded some nineteen thousand deaths and a hundred and five thousand infections from MRSA .
Unlike resistant forms of Klebsiella and other gram - negative bacteria , however , MRSA can be treated .
“ There are about a dozen new antibiotics coming on the market in the next couple of years , ” Moellering noted .
“ But there are no good drugs coming along for these gram - negatives . ”
Klebsiella and similarly classified bacteria , including Acinetobacter , Enterobacter , and Pseudomonas , have an extra cellular envelope that MRSA lacks , and that hampers the entry of large molecules like antibiotic drugs .
“ The Klebsiella that caused particular trouble in New York are spreading out , ” Moellering told me .
“ They have very high mortality rates .
They are sort of the doomsday - scenario bugs . ”
In 1968 , Moellering travelled to Malaita , in the Solomon Islands .
“ I was really interested to see whether we could find an antibiotic - resistant population of bacteria in a place that had never seen antibiotics , ” Moellering said .
The natives practiced head - hunting and cannibalism , and were isolated as much by conflict as by the island ’s dense jungle .
Moellering identified microbes there that were resistant to the antibiotics streptomycin and tetracycline , which were then in use in the West but had never been introduced clinically on Malaita .
Later studies found resistant bacteria in many other isolated indigenous human populations , as well as in natural reservoirs like aquifers .
Before the development of antibiotics , the threat of infection was urgent : until 1936 , pneumonia was the No. 1 cause of death in the United States , and amputation was sometimes the only cure for infected wounds .
The introduction of sulfa drugs , in the nineteen - thirties , and penicillin , in the nineteen - forties , suddenly made many bacterial infections curable .
As a result , doctors prescribed the drugs widely — often for sore throats , sinus congestion , and coughs that were due not to bacteria but to viruses .
In response , bacteria quickly developed resistance to the most common antibiotics .
The public assumed that the pharmaceutical industry and researchers in academic hospitals would continue to identify effective new treatments , and for many years they did .
In the nineteen - eighties , a class of drugs called carbapenems was developed to combat gram - negative organisms like Klebsiella , Pseudomonas , and Acinetobacter .
“ They were , at the time , thought to be drugs of last resort , because they had activity against a whole variety of multiply - resistant gram - negative bacteria that were already floating around , ” Moellering said .
Many hospitals put the drugs “ on reserve , ” but an apparent cure - all was too tempting for some physicians , and the tight stewardship slowly broke down .
Inevitably , mutant , resistant microbes flourished , and even the carbapenems ’ effectiveness waned .
“ I internalize my mother ’s needs Monday through Friday and my father ’s needs most weekends . ”

Now microbes are appearing far outside their environmental niches .
Acinetobacter thrives in warm , humid climates , like Honduras , as well as in parts of Iraq , and is normally found in soil .
An article published in the military magazine Proceedings in February reported that more than two hundred and fifty patients at U.S. military hospitals were infected with a highly resistant strain of Acinetobacter between 2003 and 2005 , with seven deaths as of June , 2006 , linked to “ Acinetobacter - related complications . ”
In 2004 , about thirty per cent of all patients returning from Iraq and Afghanistan tested positive for the bacteria .
“ It ’s a big problem , and it ’s contaminated the evacuation facilities in Germany and a lot of the V.A. hospitals in the United States where these soldiers have been brought , ” Moellering said .
Patients evacuated to Stockholm from Thailand after the 2004 tsunami were often infected with resistant gram - negative microbes , including a strain of Acinetobacter that was resistant even to colistin , the antibiotic used , to variable effect , in the outbreak at Tisch Hospital .
The practice of “ clinical tourism , ” in which patients travel long distances for more advanced or more affordable medical centers , may introduce resistant microbes into hospitals where they had not existed before .
Meanwhile , antibiotic use in agricultural industries has grown rapidly .
“ Seventy per cent of the antibiotics administered in America end up in agriculture , ” Michael Pollan , a professor of journalism at Berkeley and the author of “ In Defense of Food : An Eater ’s Manifesto , ” told me .
“ The drugs are not used to cure sick animals but to prevent them from getting sick , because we crowd them together under filthy circumstances .
These are perfect environments for disease .
And we also have found , for reasons that I do n’t think we entirely understand , that administering low levels of antibiotics to animals speeds their growth . ”
The theory is that by killing intestinal bacteria the competition for energy is reduced , so that the animal absorbs more energy from the food and therefore grows faster .
The Food and Drug Administration , which is often criticized for its lack of attention to the risks of widespread use of antibiotics , offers recommended , non-binding guidelines for these drugs but has rarely withdrawn approval for their application .
A spokesman for the Center for Veterinary Medicine at the F.D.A. told me that the center “ believes that prudent drug-use principles are essential to the control of antimicrobial resistance . ”
A study by David L. Smith , Jonathan Dushoff , and J. Glenn Morris , published by PLoS Medicine , from the Public Library of Science , in 2005 , noted that the transmission of resistant bacteria from animal to human populations is difficult to measure , but that “ antibiotics and antibiotic - resistant bacteria ( ARB ) are found in the air and soil around farms , in surface and ground water , in wild - animal populations , and on retail meat and poultry .
ARB are carried into the kitchen on contaminated meat and poultry , where other foods are cross - contaminated because of common unsafe handling practices . ”
The researchers developed a mathematical model that suggested that the impact of the transmission of these bacteria from agriculture may be more significant than that of hospital transmissions .
“ The problem is that we have created the perfect environment in which to breed superbugs that are antibiotic - resistant , ” Pollan told me .
“ We ’ve created a petri dish in our factory farms for the evolution of dangerous pathogens . ”
Ten years ago , the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences , in Washington , D.C. , assessed the economic impact of resistant microbes in the United States at up to five billion dollars , and experts now believe the figure to be much higher .
In July , 2004 , the Infectious Diseases Society of America released a white paper , “ Bad Bugs , No Drugs : As Antibiotic Discovery Stagnates . . .
A Public Health Crisis Brews , ” citing 2002 C.D.C. data showing that , of that year ’s estimated ninety thousand deaths annually in U.S. hospitals owing to bacterial infection , more than seventy per cent had been caused by organisms that were resistant to at least one of the drugs commonly used to treat them .
Drawing on these data , collected mostly from hospitals in large urban areas which are affiliated with medical schools , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found more than a hundred thousand cases of gram - negative antibiotic - resistant bacteria .
No precise numbers for all infections , including those outside hospitals , have been calculated , but the C.D.C. also reported that , among gram - negative hospital - acquired infections , about twenty per cent were resistant to state - of - the - art drugs .
In April , I visited Dr. Stuart Levy , at Tufts University School of Medicine .
Levy is a researcher - physician who has made key discoveries about how bacteria become resistant to antibiotics .
In addition to the natural cell envelope of Klebsiella , Levy outlined three primary changes in bacteria that make them resistant to antibiotics .
Each change involves either a mutation in the bacterium ’s own DNA or the importation of mutated DNA from another .
( Bacteria can exchange DNA in the form of plasmids , molecules that are shared by the microbes and allow them to survive inhibitory antibiotics . )
First , the bacteria may acquire an enzyme that can either act like a pair of scissors , cutting the drug into an inactive form , or modify the drug ’s chemical structure , so that it is rendered impotent .
Thirty years ago , Levy discovered a second change : pumps inside the bacteria that could spit out the antibiotic once it had passed through the cell wall .
His first reports were met with profound skepticism , but now , Levy told me , “ most people would say that efflux is the most common form of bacterial resistance to antibiotics . ”
The third change involves mutations that alter the inner contents of the microbe , so that the antibiotic can no longer inactivate its target .
Global studies have shown how quickly these bacteria can develop and spread .
“ This has been a problem in Mediterranean Europe that started about ten years ago , ” Dr. Christian Giske told me .
Giske is a clinical microbiologist at Karolinska University Hospital , in Stockholm , who , with researchers in Israel and Denmark , recently reported on the worldwide spread of resistant gram - negative bacteria .
He continued , “ It started to get really serious during the last five or six years and has become really dramatic in Greece . ”
A decade ago , only a few microbes in Southern Europe had multidrug resistance ; now some fifty to sixty per cent of hospital - acquired infections are resistant .
Giske and his colleagues found that infection with a resistant strain of Pseudomonas increased , twofold to fivefold , a patient ’s risk of dying , and increased about twofold the patient ’s hospital stay .
Like other experts in the field , Giske ’s team was concerned about the lack of new antibiotics being developed to combat gram - negative bacteria .
“ There are now a growing number of reports of cases of infections caused by gram - negative organisms for which no adequate therapeutic options exist , ” Giske and his colleagues wrote .
“ This return to the preantibiotic era has become a reality in many parts of the world . ”
Doctors and researchers fear that these bacteria may become entrenched in hospitals , threatening any patient who has significant health issues .
“ Anytime you hear about some kid getting snatched , you want to find something in that story that will convince you that that family is different from yours , ” Dr. Louis Rice , an expert in antibiotic resistance at Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center , told me .
“ But the problem is that any of us could be an I.C.U. patient tomorrow .
It ’s not easy to convey this to people if it ’s not immediately a threat .
You do n’t want to think about it .
But it ’s actually anybody who goes into a hospital .
This is scary stuff . ”
Rice mentioned that he had a mild sinusitis and was hoping it would not need to be treated , because taking an antibiotic could change the balance of microbes in his body and make it easier for him to contract a pathogenic organism while doing his rounds at the hospital .
Genetic elements in the bacteria that promote resistance may also move into other , more easily contracted bugs .
Moellering pointed out that , while Klebsiella seems best adapted to hospital settings , and poses the greatest risk to patients , other gram - negative bacteria — specifically E. coli , which is a frequent cause of urinary - tract infection in otherwise healthy people — have recently picked up the genes from Klebsiella which promote resistance to antibiotics .
In the past , large pharmaceutical companies were the primary sources of antibiotic research .
But many of these companies have abandoned the field .
“ Eli Lilly and Company developed the first cephalosporins , ” Moellering told me , referring to familiar drugs like Keflex .
“ They developed a huge number of important anti-microbial agents .
They had incredible chemistry and incredible research facilities , and , unfortunately , they have completely pulled out of it now .
After Squibb merged with Bristol - Myers , they closed their antibacterial program , ” he said , as did Abbott , which developed key agents in the past treatment of gram - negative bacteria .
A recent assessment of progress in the field , from U.C.L.A. , concluded , “ FDA approval of new antibacterial agents decreased by 56 per cent over the past 20 years ( 1998-2002 vs. 1983-1987 ) , ” noting that , in the researchers ’ projection of future development only six of the five hundred and six drugs currently being developed were new antibacterial agents .
Drug companies are looking for blockbuster therapies that must be taken daily for decades , drugs like Lipitor , for high cholesterol , or Zyprexa , for psychiatric disorders , used by millions of people and generating many billions of dollars each year .
Antibiotics are used to treat infections , and are therefore prescribed only for days or weeks .
( The exception is the use of antibiotics in livestock , which is both a profit - driver and a potential cause of antibiotic resistance . )
“ I think I ’m just going to sit this recession out . ”

“ Antibiotics are the only class of drugs where all the experts , as soon as you introduce them clinically , we go out and tell everyone to try to hold it in reserve , ” Rice pointed out .
“ If there is a new cardiology drug , every cardiologist out there is saying that everyone deserves to be on it . ”
In February , Rice wrote an editorial in the Journal of Infectious Diseases criticizing the lack of support from the National Institutes of Health ; without this support , he wrote , “ the big picture did not receive the attention it deserved . ”
Rice acknowledges that there are competing agendas .
“ As loud as my voice might be , there are louder voices screaming ‘ AIDS , ’ ” he told me .
“ And there are congressmen screaming ‘ bioterrorism . ’ ” Rice came up with the acronym ESKAPE bacteria — Enterococcus faecium , Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Acinetobacter baumanni , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and the Entero - bacter species — as a way of communicating the threat these microbes pose , and the Infectious Diseases Society is lobbying Congress to pass the Strategies to Address Antimicrobial Resistance Act , which would earmark funding for research on ESKAPE microbes and also set up clinical trials on how to limit infection and antibiotic resistance .
Rice has also proposed studies to determine the most effective use — at what dosage , and for how long — of antibiotics for common infections like bronchitis and sinusitis .
Dr. Anthony Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , which chairs the federal interagency working group on microbial resistance .
Fauci told me that the government is acutely aware of the severity of the problem .
He pointed out that the N.I.H. recently issued a call for proposals to study optimal use of antibiotics for common bacterial infections .
It has also funded so - called “ coöperative agreements , ” including one on Klebsiella , to facilitate public - private partnerships where the basic research from the institute or from university laboratories can be combined with development by a pharmaceutical or a biotech company .
Even so , the total funding for studying the resistance of ESKAPE microbes is about thirty - five million dollars , a fraction of the two hundred million dollars provided by the NIAID for research on antimicrobial resistance , most of which goes to malaria , t.b. , and H.I.V .
“ The difficulty that we are faced with is that our budget has been flat for the last five years , ” Fauci told me .
“ In real dollars , we ’ve lost almost fifteen per cent purchasing power , ” because of an inflation index of about three per cent for biomedical research and development .
Since September 11 , 2001 , significant funding has been directed toward the study of anthrax and other microbes , like the one that causes plague , which could be used as bioweapons .
Although there is little concern that Klebsiella or Acinetobacter might be weaponized , the basic science of their mutation and resistance could be useful in helping us to understand these threats .
Fauci hopes to make the case that funds for biodefense should be used to study the ESKAPE bugs , but , for now , he is quick to point out the challenge posed by a lack of resources .
“ The problem is , it is extremely difficult to do a prospective controlled trial , because when people come into the hospital they immediately get started on some treatment , which ruins the period of study , ” he said , referring to research into the treatment of common infections .
“ The culture of American medicine makes a study like that more difficult to execute . ”
These types of studies — on how often , and for how long , antibiotics should be prescribed — are much easier to conduct in countries where medicine is largely socialized and prescriptions are tightly regulated .
Recently , researchers in Israel , where most citizens receive their care through such a system , showed that refraining from empirically prescribing antibiotics during the summer months resulted in a sharp decline in ear infections caused by antibiotic - resistant microbes .
( In the United States , a 1998 study estimated that fifty - five per cent of all antibiotics prescribed for respiratory infections in outpatients — 22.6 million prescriptions — were unnecessary . )
In Sweden , the government closely monitors all infections , and has the power to intervene as needed .
“ Our infection - control people have a lot of authority , ” Giske said .
“ This is power from the legislation . ”
Once a resistant microbe is identified , stringent protocols are put in place , with dramatic results .
Fewer than two per cent of the staphylococci in Sweden are MRSA , compared with sixty per cent in the United States .
“ Of course , it ’s only around ten million people , so it ’s possible to intervene because everything is smaller , ” Giske said , adding , “ Maybe Swedes are more used to this type of intervention and regulation . ”
Stuart Levy ’s laboratory occupies the eighth floor of a renovated building on Harrison Avenue in Boston ’s Chinatown , across the street from Tufts Medical Center .
As I passed from his office into the corridor , I detected the acrid smell of agar , which is used to grow bacteria .
That day , a laboratory technician was testing specimens taken from the eyes of people with bacterial conjunctivitis who had been given an antibiotic eye drop containing fluoroquinolone .
Levy was comparing the bacteria from the infected eyes with those in the noses , cheeks , and throats of the same patients .
His technician held up a petri dish with a cranberry - colored agar base .
The patient ’s specimen was growing bacteria that were susceptible to the antibiotic ; the drug had created a large oval clear zone on the plate which resembled the halo around the moon .
The study investigates whether an antibiotic applied to the eye would affect bacteria in the nose and mouth as well , which might indicate that what seems to be an innocuous and limited treatment may profoundly change a wider area of the body and foster resistant microbes .
Levy has also received funding from the N.I.H. to study Yersinia pestis , the microbe that causes plague ; the Department of Agriculture has sponsored his study of Pseudomonas fluorescens , a soil - based bacterium that has the potential to protect plants from microbial infection .
He plans to develop it as a biocontrol agent , so that farmers can be weaned off the potent antibiotics and chemicals they use to treat their fields .
“ We need to treat biology with biology , not chemistry , ” he said .
In other studies , Levy and his team are looking at ways to render bacteria nondestructive and noninvasive , so that they might enter the body without harmful effects .
This makes it necessary to identify virulence factors — which parts of the bacteria cause damage to our tissues .
Levy ’s laboratory is targeting a protein in gram - negative organisms called MAR , which appears to act as a master switch , turning on both virulence genes and genes that mediate resistance , like the efflux pump .
In collaboration with a startup company called Paratek , of which Levy is a co-founder , his laboratory is screening novel compounds in the hope of finding a drug that blocks MAR .
Frederick Ausubel , a bacterial geneticist at the Massachusetts General Hospital , in Boston , is searching for drugs to combat bacterial virulence , using tiny animals like worms , which have intestinal cells that are similar to those in humans , and which are susceptible to lethal microbial infection .
The worm that Ausubel is studying , Caenorhabditis elegans , is one and a half millimetres in length .
“ You are probably going to have to screen millions of compounds and you ca n’t screen millions of infected mice , ” Ausubel said .
“ So our approach was to find an alternative host that could be infected with human pathogens which was small enough and cheap enough to be used in drug screens .
What ’s remarkable is that many common human pathogens , including Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas , will cause intestinal infection and kill the worms .
So now you can look for a compound that cures it , that prevents the pathogen from killing the host . ”
Ausubel first screened some six thousand compounds by hand and found eight , none of them traditional antibiotics , that may protect the worms .
He is also attempting , among other potential solutions , to find a compound that would block what is called “ quorum sensing , ” in which bacteria release small molecules to communicate with one another and signal when a critical mass is present .
Once this quorum is reached , the bacteria turn on their virulence genes .
“ Bacteria do n’t want to alert their host that they are there by immediately producing virulence factors which the host would recognize , ” triggering the immune system , Ausubel explained .
“ When they reach a certain quorum , there are too many of them for the host to do anything about it . ”
Bonnie Bassler , a molecular biologist at Princeton University , has recently shown that it is through quorum sensing that cholera bacteria are able to accumulate in the intestines and release toxins that can be fatal ; Pseudomonas is also known to switch on its virulence genes in response to signals from quorum sensing .
Georgia 's decision to seize large parts of Tskhinvali , the capital of the breakaway region of South Ossetia , on the evening of 7 August was a disastrous political miscalculation , even in an era that is increasingly defined by spectacularly poor judgement .
Within three days of the assault , Russian forces had responded by in effect neutralising Georgia 's military capacity , which President Mikhail Saakashvili 's government in Tbilisi had spent several years and considerable sums of money building up .
Clearly , Russia has been goading and provoking the Georgian government for several years into making the big mistake .
The parastates of Abkhazia and , above all , South Ossetia , have been under the control of a toxic coalition of criminals and both former and serving FSB officers .
Russian soldiers have been acting as their protectors under the guise of a peacekeeping mission , preventing Georgia 's attempts to seek a negotiated reintegration of the two areas .
The Georgian crisis has benefited the standing of hardliners in Moscow , still aggrieved at Vladimir Putin 's decision to place the moderate , business - friendly Dmitry Medvedev in the Kremlin .
But under the influence of an energetic neo-con lobby in Washington , and with considerable support from Israeli weapons manufacturers and military trainers , Saakashvili and the hawks around him came to believe the farcical proposition that Georgia 's armed forces could take on the military might of their northern neighbour in a conventional fight and win .
The Georgian minister for reintegration of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , Temur Yakobash vili , revealed the depth of the illusion the day after the conflict broke out when he thanked Israel for its assistance in training Georgian troops .
" Israel should be proud of its military , which trained Georgian soldiers , " Yakobashvili said , with reference to Defensive Shield , the private company run by Gal Hirsch , a former general in the Israel Defence Forces .
Still unaware of what was really happening on the battlefield , Yakobashvili reported that a small group of Georgian soldiers had been able to wipe out an entire Russian military division , thanks to the Israeli training .
" We killed 60 Russian soldiers yesterday alone , " he said .
" The Russians have lost more than 50 tanks , and we have shot down 11 of their planes .
They have sustained enormous damage in terms of manpower . "
Warned off
The Russians , of course , knew all about Defensive Shield and the tens of millions of dollars worth of Israeli military equipment that Georgia had been purchasing .
Just over a week before the conflict erupted , Putin put in a call to the Israeli president , Shimon Peres .
His message , according to a western intelligence source , was simple : " Pull out your trainers and weapons or we will escalate our co-operation with Syria and Iran . "
Peres does not suffer the same illusions as Georgian ministers and the Israeli set - up left Tbilisi within two days .
The KGB has also been tracking Georgia 's clandestine arms procurement in Ukraine ( where most weapons dealers work for Russian intelligence anyhow ) .
The Russian army was also fully briefed about the joint US - Georgian manoeuvres , which took place in Georgia last month .
Russia was not taking a military risk when responding to the Georgian attack on Tskhinvali - Moscow knew the precise contours of its enemy 's capability .
David 's victory over Goliath was sensational because of its rarity - in the real world Goliath always comes out on top .
So the Russians set a trap and , prodded by Dick Cheney 's people , Georgia walked right into it .
The consequences of this egregious error begin in Georgia itself .
Not only is it now defenceless , it can kiss goodbye to any restoration of sovereignty over both South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Even though President Sarkozy of France received tentative agreement from both Moscow and Tbilisi for the establishment of international talks to settle the status of the two areas , they are unlikely to rejoin Georgia any time soon .
The loss of Abkhazia , with its considerable economic potential , is a huge blow .
The EU and the US will argue that there is no parallel to be drawn between Kosovo and the Georgian breakaway regions .
But that is not how much of the world , including China , South Africa and Indonesia , see it .
And it is not how Russia sees it .
The first chickens of Kosovo 's independence are coming home to roost .
Saakashvili is now very vulnerable .
The Russian invasion has cut communications between Tbilisi and the main port in Poti .
BP has closed down the pipeline running from Baku to Ceyhan in Turkey through Tbilisi , and Georgian banks are freezing all loans and blocking capital flight .
After only a week , the Georgian economy is teetering .
" It does n't look very good for Georgia , " Edward Parker from the credit rating agency Fitch told the Moscow Times .
" Going to war with Russia is bad for your creditworthiness , to put it mildly . "
And if the wheels do come off the economy , it is hard to see how Saakashvili might salvage his political position - such a combination of economic distress and military defeat is usually fatal .
If he goes , Georgia is likely to fracture politically into a variety of fiefdoms familiar from the 1990s and living standards will plummet .
There is one faint consolation .
The west may be impotent when it comes to responding to the situation militarily but it can rally round by offering the country a financial and commercial lifeline .
The foreign implications of the error are graver still .
Russia is placing a marker on Ukraine .
Do not , Moscow says , even think of allowing Ukraine into Nato , otherwise what we have seen in Georgia will be child 's play .
So the west will have to think hard how to play Ukraine 's application to join the military alliance .
This in turn has accentuated the divisions within the European Union between those countries , including Germany , which remain cautious about a course of open confrontation with Russia , and Britain , which has echoed calls from Washington demanding that Russia 's application to join the World Trade Organisation be reconsidered .
Speaking from Tbilisi , one senior European diplomat told me that the split on this issue , which was openly on display at the Nato Bucharest summit in April , " is running deeper within the EU than was the case in the run-up to Iraq " .
But the Georgian fiasco has implications for politics in the Middle East , the European Union and the United States .
For the Bush administration ( or for its hawks at least ) , the Georgian mistake presents an opportunity - let us recast Russia as a threat to global stability and a potential enemy .
Predictably , the toughest response to the Russian invasion came from Cheney .
The outbreak of the crisis coincided with President Bush horseplaying with beach volleyball players in Beijing and the vice - president was in operational control at the time .
Cheney immediately announced that the Russian invasion cannot go " unanswered " , a choice of words that the American former ambassador to Nato Robert Hunter described as " inflammatory " .
Cheney has been spoiling for a fight with the Russians for a couple of years , and he and his allies have seized upon Georgia 's and Ukraine 's stated aim to join Nato as a way of riling Moscow .
This plan came unstuck at the Bucharest summit , when some European countries , led by Germany , blocked the Nato road map for the two former Soviet republics .
But the final statement did concede that the two countries ' aspirations would eventually be met at some unspecified time in the future .
As a democratic country , Georgia has every right to apply for Nato membership , even though its inability to assert its sovereignty over South Ossetia and Abkhazia presents a problem to some existing Nato members .
But the neocons in Washington have been pushing Georgian and Ukrainian membership as a critical goal for the maintenance of the western alliance .
By cranking up the dispute with Russia over Nato , Cheney is shifting the political debate in the US away from the state of the economy and towards the issue of national security .
Global dangers
If the presidential election is fought on the former issue , Barack Obama is a shoo - in .
But if the central issue is national security and who would be best at dealing with a major crisis like Georgia , then his Republican opponent , John McCain , has to be favourite .
McCain 's response to Georgia was almost as tough as Cheney 's , explained in part by the fact that until May this year his chief foreign policy adviser was working as a lobbyist for Saakashvili .
This political dynamic is driving the west towards a rift with Russia that will polarise a number of other issues , including policy towards Iran .
On this latter matter , Russia has played a relatively constructive and , perhaps more importantly , a moderating role .
In the next three months , the issues of Ukraine and Iran will loom large in global politics and they may well have a decisive impact on the outcome of the US election .
Who set the trap in Georgia ?
Vladimir Putin and his thuggish pals from the FSB , or Dick Cheney and his equally unflappable neocon friends ?
Whether Georgia was defeated by the Russians or lost by the neocons , a touch of diplomatic sobriety on both sides would be a welcome development , if the Georgian conflict is not to mark a very dangerous new phase in the development of global politics - serial confrontation between the west and Russia .

バグバグなコードは、それだけでメンテに定常的な出費を産む。書き直せばそのコストはいらないのに。バグバグなコードはあらゆる危険性を産む。なまじモノがあるだけについコードを無条件に資産と見なしてしまいがちだが、実は怪しいコードは負債であると。

It is now just a matter of days before we see the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics in China , the Games of the XXIX Olympiad ( or for those who do n’t like Roman numerals , the Games of the 29th Olympiad . )
This lends us the perfect opportunity to present a list of fascinating facts about the Ancient Olympics – held in Olympia , Greece .
1 Facts 1 – 5
1 . No one actually knows what the origins were of the very first games .
One myth suggests that Heracles ( the divine son of the god Zeus ) ran a race in Olympia and decreed that it be repeated every four years .
2 . The olympic games were one of two central rituals in Ancient Greece .
The other was the Eleusinian Mysteries – initiation ceremonies for people joining the cult of Demeter and Persephone .
3 . The Statue of Zeus – the father of the Gods and one of the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World , was housed in a temple at Olympia – the site of the Ancient Olympics .
4. An Olympiad ( a period of 4 years which refers to the time between two games ) was used as a measure of years by the Ancient Greeks in much the same way as we now use AD and BC .
This idea was devised by the historian Ephorus .
Previously , every Greek state used its own different method of time measurement which led to a great deal of confusion .
5 . The only event at the first olympics was the Stadion race – a race of around 190 meters ( measured after the feet of Zeus ) .
The race was named after the building in which the race took place ( the source of the English word “ stadium ” .
The stadion race is pictured above .
2 Facts 6 – 10
6 . Unlike the modern starting position , racers ( of whom 20 would take place ) started in a fully erect standing position with their arms stretched in front of them .
If there was a tie , the race would be re-run .
7 . The winner of the first recorded Olympic Games ( the first gold medalist in a sense ) was Coroebus of Elis – a baker from Eleia ( the region in which Olympia was found ) .
He won in 776 BC .
Instead of winning a gold medal – as is now the norm – he received an olive branch – more a symbol than a prize .
The town still exists today with around 150 citizens .
8 . It is believed that the Greek tradition of athletic nudity started at the games in 720 BC , and it was most likely introduced by the Spartans or Megarian Orsippus .
It is from this practice that we have our word “ gymnasium ” – derived from the Greek word “ gymnos ” meaning “ naked ” .
Competing naked was meant as a tribute to the gods and to encourage aesthetic appreciation of the male body .
9 . While the competitors were naked during the games , it is possible that some wore a kynodesme : a thin leather strip tied tightly around the part of the foreskin that extended beyond the glans ( to prevent the glans from showing ) .
It was then tied around the waist to expose the scrotum , or to the base of the penis making it appear to curl upwards .
Not all athletes wore the kynodesme .
Pictured above is an athlete wearing the kynodesme – the picture is attributed to Triptolemos ( 480 BC ) .
10 .
During the games , all of Greece was under a truce ( ekecheiria ) – there could be no use of capital punishment , and no wars or battles .
This was in order to ensure the safety of competitors and spectators on the way to Olympia .
While this was generally adhered to , at least one account exists of a possible breach by the Spartan army , which resulted in a large fine and a ban from attending the games that year .
3 Facts 11 – 15
11 . The Olympic Games were part of 4 games – held in order so that there would be one set of games each year .
The other three were the Pythian , Nemean , and Isthmian Games , but the Olympic games were the most important .
12 . Although the first games were “ international ” in a sense ( in that all Greek City States were allowed to enter ) , only men who spoke Greek could compete .
Eventually members of the Greek colonies were also able to enter .
13 .
The last running race added to the Ancient Games ( after the addition of two longer distance races ) was the hoplitodromos – in which competitors would run 400 or 800 yards in full armor with shields and a helmet or greaves ( leg armor ) .
This was introduced in 520 BC .
Runners would often trip over each other or stumble on shields dropped by other competitors .
In the image above we see athletes competing in the hoplitodromos – in far more an orderly fashion than was likely .
14 .
In its heyday , the games lasted 5 days .
The first three were for the sporting events , with the other two days being used for rituals and celebration .
On the final day , all participants attended a feast in which 100 oxen ( killed on the first day as a sacrifice to Zeus ) were eaten .
Certainly very different from the secular opening ceremony we will see this week , or , in fact , all olympic opening ceremonies from modern times .
15 .
As part of the move to making Christianity the official religion , the ancient Olympic Games were finally suppressed by either Theodosius I in AD 393 or his grandson Theodosius II in AD 435 .
They would not return until 1896 .
They were held in Athens , Greece .
Col Borton also said that a shortage of batteries meant that in an effort to save power , junior commanders were often forced to turn the radios off until they came under attack .
He added : " The only way to tell how much power a battery has left is to remove it from the radio – that 's a serious design fault .
In a bid to preserve power , my section commanders only have their radios working when they are in contact .
As far as I am concerned , Bowman is astonishingly bad ; it is a broken system , " he told commanders .
A possible design for a rover to extract helium - 3 from the lunar soil .
The robot would capture sunlight , reflected from a gathering dish , to bake the soil .
Editor 's Note : Each Wednesday LiveScience examines the viability of emerging energy technologies — the power of the future .
The moon is once again a popular destination , as several space - faring nations are talking about setting up bases there .
One reason would be to mine fuel for future fusion reactors .
The fuel in this case is helium - 3 , a lighter isotope of the helium used in balloons .
In high energy collisions , helium - 3 fuses with other nuclei to release more energy and less waste than the reactions in traditional nuclear reactors .
" If we can show that we can burn helium - 3 , it is a much cleaner and safer energy source than other nuclear fuels , " said Gerald Kulcinski , director of the Fusion Technology Institute at the University of Wisconsin at Madison .
Just 40 tons of this stuff has enough potential energy to meet the total U.S. electricity demand for a year .
However , there is almost no helium - 3 on Earth .
The closest supply is on the moon .
Several space agencies , notably in China , Russia and India , have mentioned helium - 3 as a potential payoff for their lunar projects .
" I do n't think that the main motivation to go back to the moon is helium - 3 , " Kulcinski said .
" But over the long - term , we do face an energy problem . "
Fusion solution
All current nuclear power is based on fission , in which a large nucleus ( such as uranium ) breaks apart into smaller nuclei .
The alternative is fusion , in which two small nuclei come together to form a bigger nucleus and release copious amounts of energy .
A commercial fusion reactor has never been built , but a prototype called the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ( ITER ) has just begun construction in Cadarache , France .
The plan is to generate the needed 100 million degree plasma by the year 2016 , but a power plant that can supply electricity might not come online for another 20 years after that .
The reaction that will occur in ITER is the fusing of two hydrogen isotopes : deuterium and tritium .
One concern is that tritium is radioactive and a component of nuclear weapons , so care must be taken in dealing with it .
Another problem is the highly energetic neutrons emitted from the deuterium - tritium reaction .
These neutrons slam into the reactor walls and cause structural damage .
It is expected that the walls in ITER will have to be replaced every one to two years , Kulcinski said .
This is why Kulcinski and others advocate trading the tritium with non-radioactive helium - 3 .
" The advantage is that it makes very few neutrons , " said Rich Nebel of Emc2 Fusion , a company based in Santa Fe , N.M. " This reduces radiation issues and also greatly simplifies the engineering . "
Furthermore , the reaction products of helium - 3 fusion are charged , so their energy can be directly converted into electricity without having to go through the inefficient step of boiling water to make steam .
Helium sources
Despite its apparent attractiveness , helium - 3 is often neglected by fusion researchers .
One reason is that the Earth has very little of it .
A small portion of helium - 3 is collected as an unwanted by - product inside nuclear weapons and sold for about $ 1,000 per gram , Kulcinski said .
A continuous supply of helium - 3 can be found in the solar wind , but our planet 's magnetic field deflects these particles away .
The same is not true on the moon .
The moon has collected 1 million to 5 million tons of helium - 3 , from the solar wind , over its 4.5 billion year history , Kulcinski said .
Evidence for this was found in the lunar rocks ( brought back by the Apollo astronauts and Russian rovers ) at a level of 10 to 20 parts per billion .
" Helium - 3 is present on the moon , but in very small concentration levels , meaning that many hundreds of millions of tons of soil must be processed to extract a ton of helium - 3 , " said Paul Spudis of the Lunar and Planetary Institute , a NASA - funded research institution .
This extraction requires heating lunar dust particles to around 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit ( 700 degrees Celsius ) , Spudis said .
Kulcinski and his colleagues have designed rovers that could move along the surface , scraping up lunar soil and heating it with concentrated sunlight .
Such a mining operation would retrieve 300 times more energy than it uses ( including all the energy to fly to the moon and back ) , Kulcinski estimates .
In comparison , mining coal returns 15 - 20 times the energy put in .
His team has estimated that it might cost around $ 800 million to bring back each ton of lunar helium - 3 .
This might sound like a lot , but if you could sell the fusion energy at a price comparable to gasoline based on oil at $ 100 per barrel , the helium - 3 would be worth $ 10 billion per ton .
" Our real challenge is not obtaining the helium - 3 ; it is demonstrating that we can burn it , " Kulcinski said .
Tough to burn
Burning helium - 3 requires higher initial energy than burning hydrogen isotopes .
This is why ITER is not considering helium - 3 as a possible fuel at this time .
However , Kulcinski's group works on a different method — called inertial electrostatic confinement ( IEC ) — for achieving fusion reactions .
Instead of using magnetic fields to confine a very hot plasma like ITER plans to do , IEC works by accelerating nuclei towards each other with electric fields .
Kulcinski and his collaborators have managed to sustain nuclear fusion in their small prototype system .
The company Emc2 Fusion is also working on a similar design .
However , all of these IEC demonstrations , at least for now , require much more input energy than they can deliver .
Most researchers agree that helium - 3 is unlikely to be the first fuel used in fusion reactors .
" One should never say never — it may come to pass that helium - 3 could become an important source of energy in the coming century , " Spudis said .
" That time has not come yet .
And I suspect that it is still some time off . "
' How I hid not being able to read or write '
Linda Worden gets to grips with writing
One in five UK adults struggles with reading and writing .
In an age of e-mail , texts and form - filling , how is it possible to hide illiteracy ?
Linda Worden , who 's learned to read and write as part of a Channel 4 series , explains how she managed to keep it a secret for 40 years .
Thinking back to my schooldays , all I can think of is the pain as I struggled from a young age .
Classes were so big that I would just sit quietly at the back , or find any excuse not to be there at all .
The older I got the further behind I got , and the less interested the teachers became - it was a vicious circle .
My reports were full of the usual lines " Linda could do better ...
Linda 's lazy ... " when in fact I just kept quiet so no - one noticed that I was n't doing the work that they 'd asked for .
At home , I was one of eight children , so my parents had enough on their plate .
Leaving school at 16 with no qualifications , I got by without anyone realising the full scale of the problem , including my former husband .
Then I had my first daughter , who did everything for me - she was a saint .
From when she could read and write , I made it a game , getting her to read and write for me as if it was practice for her own learning .
She was my eyes and hands .
Child 's play
As she grew up and was around less , I was absolutely stumped .
There were times when I would miss something important - appointments , bills - I just did n't dare to open the mail .
The minute I received any sort of promotion that would have given my game away , I 'd leave
Forms of any kind filled me with dread .
Whenever I had the opportunity , I 'd take it home to give to my daughter to complete .
And I 'd sell myself , coming across as full of confidence , impressing people at face value .
What I lost through not being able to read and write , I gained in other ways .
People always commented on my smile and cheerful personality .
I 've done all sorts of jobs - including factory work and restaurant work - and wherever that 's been I 've moved up the ladder .
But the minute I received any sort of promotion that would have given my game away , I 'd leave .
Similarly with friends , I became very good at keeping myself private , and this extended to my husband .
People knew I had difficulties but I was very careful not to let them realise how bad it was .
If they became too close , I 'd back away .
I regret to say that I lost many a good friend .
After years of escaping from one job to another , I set up my own business as an events manager , where I was able to make use of a special voice - activated computer .
It has made a huge difference to my life as it writes down what I say , and also reads out things like e-mails to me .
Making excuses
Despite not being able to read or write , I 've got a good memory .
I have no trouble with information like directions , remembering routes and landmarks .
If people tried to point things out to me on a map , I 'd use the old ' I 'm a woman so can't read a map ' excuse .
Signs once made this much sense Pretending to have forgotten my glasses was a favourite line .
When my children were young , I 'd avoid events like parents ' evenings so I did n't have to discuss their reports .
Going shopping , for example , I just used pictures on the packets to get by .
The only time this did n't work was when they changed the label and I 'd have to learn to recognise the new one .
Cooking was never a problem .
I 'm a pretty good chef and became used to creating and adapting my own recipes instead of using cookbooks .
Nowadays , being able to read books for myself is a gift that many people will never appreciate .
The world is a much more interesting place than I thought .
And after feeling so detached from everyone , I now feel part of the community .

What are these ?
Sixty - one students from 14 colleges and universities around the globe have imagined what the next generation of airliners and cargo planes may look like .
Fourteen teams and two individual students submitted their designs in the annual competition sponsored by NASA 's Fundamental Aeronautics Program , part of the agency 's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate .
The highest scoring graduate team was from Georgia Tech in Atlanta .
Undergraduate team honors went to Virginia Tech in Blacksburg , Va .
The contest asked students to create a future subsonic transport aircraft that could carry up to 50,000 pounds , operate on runways between 1,500 and 3,000 feet long , and cruise at speeds between 595 and 625 mph - about the average speed of airliners today .
The competition also stressed that concept planes should use alternative fuels and be quieter and more environmentally friendly than today 's commercial fleet .
" The nation 's air transportation system is under tremendous pressure to increase performance and capacity without causing additional damage to the environment , " said Juan Alonso , director of the Fundamental Aeronautics Program .
" Through competitions such as this , we are nurturing a new generation of engineers who can deliver the solutions we so desperately need . "
The judges graded the designs on criteria including creativity and imagination , feasibility and cost analysis , and comprehensive discussion of design concept .
" The invention , imagination and engineering exhibited in these college proposals was extraordinary , and in parts superior to the concepts prevalent in the current professional literature .
These entries bode well for the future of civilian aeronautics , " said Dennis Bushnell , chief scientist at NASA 's Langley Research Center in Hampton , Va. Bushnell was one of several NASA experts who judged the competition .
As part of the competition , six U.S. students received a 10 - week paid summer internship at one of four NASA research centers around the country .
Non-U.S. student winners received an engraved trophy and certificate .
Sponsors are already planning next year 's competition , which will be announced by the end of this summer .
A complete list of winners of the college contest can be found at : http://aero.larc.nasa.gov

Iran 's new interior minister has raised an uproar among lawmakers and Iranian media over an apparently fake claim that he holds an honorary doctorate from Britain 's Oxford University .
To back his case , he 's shown off a degree certificate riddled with spelling and grammar mistakes .
Academic Ban Holland bans Iranian students from nuclear studies AFP Dutch universities restrict access of Iranians to information or training ' that could contribute to nuclear proliferation activities in Iran , ' foreign ministry says Holland bans Iranian students from nuclear studies
The Interior Ministry put out a copy of the degree , with an Oxford seal and dated June 2000 , aiming to prove its authenticity .
But in the certificate , " entitled " is misspelled " intitled , " and it says Kordan was granted the degree " to be benefitted from its scientific privileges . "
The clumsily worded document says Kordan " has shown a great effort in preparing educational materials and his research in the domain of comparative law , that has opened a new chapter , not only in our university , but , to our knowledge , in this country " - leaving out spaces after all but one of the commas .
It was published in several Iranian papers this week .
Oxford said in its statement that it " has no record of Mr. Ali Kordan receiving an honorary doctorate or any other degree from the university . "
It added that the three professors whose alleged signatures are on the certificate have all held posts at the university at some stage but none of them work in the field of law and none would sign degree certificates .
Tehran shuts down news website
The alleged fake has been heavily covered in several Iranian newspapers and Web sites , and parliament speaker Ali Larijani on Monday ordered the body 's education committee to look into the degree 's authenticity .
The Tehran prosecutors office announced Wednesday that the Alef news Web site , which has carried several reports questioning the degree , has been " banned based on complaints by legal entities , " the state news agency IRNA reported .
The office said the site had no work license and did not link the ban to the interior minister issue .
The site could not be accessed in Iran on Wednesday .
" The Interior Ministry does not have the right to threaten the media for questioning the authenticity of the claim , " parliament member Ahmed Tavakoli was quoted as saying on Alef .
He said the " truth of such an important issue must be made clear . "
Interior Ministry officials could not be reached Wednesday for comment on the Oxford statement .
During his confirmation debate , numerous lawmakers argued Kordan was unqualified for the ministry post , some claiming that his Oxford degree was a fake .
Ahmadinejad defended Kordan amid the debates , dismissing degrees in general as " torn paper " not necessary for serving the people .
An Interior Ministry statement this week insisted the degree was authentic , calling claims otherwise " destructive " and " insulting " and urging media to refrain from " lying and suspicious reports . "
Earlier this month , the Daily Telegraph revealed that for the past three years the military academy at Sandhurst has been unable to attract enough recruits and has been short by about 20 out of the 250 cadets needed to keep up numbers each term .

Shave with a straight razor ?
What is this , 1850 ?
I admit I was skeptical the first time I tried it too .
But once I saw Johnny Depp wield the infamous blade in Sweeney Todd , I was convinced I needed to give it a shot .
And you know what ?
It did n't take long before I was hooked .
Maybe it was the thrill of cheating death , maybe it was reconnecting with my ancestors , I do n't know .
But now that I 'm a convert and have had a chance to reflect , I 've made a list of the top 10 reasons why others should switch to a straight razor too .
Some of these reasons may be tossed aside lightly , I admit .
But if at least one of them rings true for you , beware -- straight razor shaving can be quite addictive .
Some men have even been known to do it every day !
1. Save Some Dough
Over the long haul , it 's amazing how much money you can save with a straight razor .
With the price of premium disposable blades going for upwards of three bucks a blade , it does n't take long to recoup the cost of a well - made straight blade .
Over the course of a man 's lifetime , a disposable razor can cost as much as $ 10,000 more than a straight blade .
That could pay for a new car !
Granted , it might be a Yugo , but still .
2. Go Green
Ever think about where those safety razor cartridges go when you 're done with them ?
They go to a landfill , of course .
One blade might not seem like much , but when you add up the millions of cartridges thrown away by men every day , coupled with the cardboard and plastic packaging and it 's actually quite significant .
How significant ?
Well , 20 million American male shavers go through a five - pack of disposable blades every eight weeks or so .
Each package weighs about two ounces .
Multiply it out and you get ...
ABOUT 10 THOUSAND TONS of waste each year !
Holy hairball , Batman , that 's a lot of trash !
Straight shaving , by comparison , produces very little waste .
The blade can be resharpened and reused pretty much forever .
There 's no packaging either .
3. Be a Macho Man
No doubt about it - shaving with a straight razor is manly .
Anyone willing to stare danger in the throat must be a man 's man , right ?
Start shaving with a straight razor and your life may change in some subtle ways .
Men will fear you , women will swoon .
Just like Crocodile Dundee , you 'll no doubt be tempted to shave in public once you 've got your technique down .
And if your technique is not yet so refined ?
Tell your friends that those blood splotches on your face are a result of your daily battle with a " cut - throat blade " and watch them cross to the other side of the street .
4. Pamper Yourself
Once you know what you 're doing , shaving with a single , straight blade is actually easier on your skin than shaving with a triple - blade razor .
Why is this ?
Two of the most common problems with shaving -- razor burn and ingrown hairs -- are directly attributable to using more than one blade .
In the case of razor burn , a triple - blade scrapes the skin three times as much as a single blade .
This leads , of course , to three times the irritation .
As for ingrown hairs , those are caused by the multi- blade technique of pulling the hair out and cutting it below the line where it penetrates the skin .
When the hair grows back , it can grow back under the skin .
So why not just switch to a single , disposable blade ?
The problem with that approach is that those disposable blades dull quickly .
Shaving with a dull blade is even worse for your skin .
The solution ?
A sharp , single - blade straight razor cuts the hair cleanly , closely and without irritation .
5. Get In On The Ground Floor
Shaving with a straight razor is a hot new trend .
New trend ?
Huh ?
Have n't straight razors been around for several centuries ?
Well , yes in fact they have .
But shaving with a straight razor has become a lost art .
The number of straight razor shavers had dwindled dramatically as of about 10 years ago .
But now , straight razor shaving is becoming " retro cool " .
Interest has picked up significantly over the last few years .
If the trend keeps up , it 'll soon be mainstream .
Are you the type that likes to catch a new trend before it 's played out ?
If so , now is the time to try out straight razor shaving .
6. Embrace Danger
Scared of putting a deadly weapon just inches from your jugular ?
Maybe the straight razor is n't for you .
There 's no question that a safety razor is safer than a straight razor .
The blades are angled correctly in a safety razor cartridge and the sides are protected by the plastic casing .
But if you like to live on the edge , straight shaving might be just the thing .
Truth is , the danger of a straight razor is more a product of our imagination than a real threat .
A careful shaver who keeps his eye on the blade and is careful to use a motion that is perpendicular to the blade is unlikely to suffer more than a nick or two .
When first starting out , straight shaving will certainly produce more of those nicks than a safety razor but , over time , a proficient shaver can minimize the threat significantly .
7. Make New Friends
Folks wielding razors scare you a little bit ?
Not to worry .
The straight shavers I 've met are actually quite friendly and willing to help novices .
As with most niche hobbies these days , there 's an active community of straight razor shavers online .
They 've even been known to have an occasional get - together , where members bring their razor collections and swap behind - the - scenes stories from inside the washroom .
8. Take Up a New Hobby
Straight razor devotees are quite passionate about their skills .
While many men start shaving with a straight razor as way to get the ultimate shave , many of them get hooked on the straight razor culture .
Honing your skills in search of the perfect shave is an enjoyable , if somewhat time - intensive goal
In addition , many straight shavers become razor collectors .
Vintage straight razors can be found on eBay , at antique shows and even at garage sales .
Collecting , restoring and showing off straight razors can be gratifying and rewarding .
9. Learn A New Trade
The economy got you down ?
Thinking about leaving your job and taking up a new profession ?
How about becoming a barber ?
Okay , this is unrealistic , unappealing or just plain silly for most of us .
However , stories abound of hobbyist straight shavers who got carried away by their craft and decided to become pros .
And , if straight shaving is about to go mainstream , you can bet these guys are going to be in demand .
10 . Channel Your Inner Grizzly Adams
Got a little overzealous with your " vacation beard " ?
Shaving a longer beard with a disposable razor can be a tough job .
The cartridges in a safety razor get gummed up fast with hairs , making it unwieldy for any significant long - hair shaving .
You 'll find yourself madly cleaning your blade every stroke or two and may even need to use more than one cartridge for a single shave .
You 'll likely resort to using a beard trimming scissors before starting just to make the process manageable .
Longer beards are no problem for a straight blade , though .
The straight blade has no internal surface to get gummed up .
In fact , the same smooth stroke works as well on longer - length stubble as it does on a five - o- clock shadow .
So go ahead and grow it .
Dan Haggerty would be proud .

A Fullerton high school history teacher who was jailed this week when police -- acting on a tip -- found a shotgun and marijuana in his car in the school parking lot was the “ victim of an elaborate setup , ” police said Thursday .
Investigators are now convinced that Gregory Abbott , 31 , of Placentia , who has taught at Sunny Hills High School for seven years , is innocent and was actually a victim , said Sgt. Mike MacDonald of the Fullerton Police Department .
Detectives want to talk to Abbott ’s estranged wife and a male friend .
MacDonald declined to identify them , calling them “ persons of interest at this time ” and not suspects .
Abbott was pulled out of class Tuesday by officers who asked if they could search his car .
An anonymous person had phoned police to report that he had purchased drugs from a teacher at the school named Abbott , who kept a weapon in his vehicle .
The telephone call was made from off campus .

MacDonald said Abbott was cooperative from the beginning and gave officers permission to search his car .
They recovered an unloaded shotgun , about a gram of marijuana and prescription drugs packaged as if for sale .
Abbott was arrested without incident and taken to the Fullerton City Jail , where he posted $ 25,000 bail .
He said the gun and drugs were not his , and a follow - up investigation “ revealed he was telling the truth , ” MacDonald said .
Police said that they are still conducting a criminal investigation but that the focus is now on who framed Abbott .
“ You could say the investigation has taken us in a different direction .
We felt a duty to be impartial and fair , checking out Abbott ’s story , ” MacDonald said .
“ We ’re happy that the results vindicated him .
He ’s had a tough week . ”
Reached by phone Thursday , the teacher agreed .
“ I ’m a lot better today , ” he said .
“ I feel extremely grateful to the people who were with me through this time , especially the Fullerton police , who did an amazing and professional job by investigating to get to the truth . ”
He said he did n’t blame them for arresting him , but that the ordeal seemed surreal .
“ Nothing even close to this has ever happened to me , ” Abbott said .
“ I come from a good family with a good background ; to have the police come tell me that there ’s a shotgun in my car -- I can hardly believe it even now . ”

Times staff writer David Haldane contributed to this report .
I worked at a big concert venue for a couple of years in the early ’90s , way back when I was first coming on to my vocation as a tripsitter .
I was a Peachy Puff , which means I wore a tiny spangled outfit and carried a heavy box around my neck , slinging melted two - dollar candy bars by day and light - up toys at night .
I was a veritable tripper magnet .
Just by virtue of glowing in the dark I became a beacon for the easily amused , and for the lost .
“ Hi ! ” the addled apparition before me would begin , perhaps in greeting , or possibly in an awkward attempt to communicate his current state of being .
“ My name is Jimmy .
I ’m sixteen and I just took a few tabs of acid a little while ago and now things are starting to get a bit strange around the edges .
Can I just stand by you for a little while ? ”
Sure you can , Jimmy .
Sure you can .
Most nights I ended up with a little flock of lost lambs following me around .
The other girls all seemed to regard them as a nuisance .
I had only recently discovered the awesome and unpredictable power of psychedelics in my own life , so , for me , taking care of them was a sacred mercy mission .
Of course there were thousands of trippers at shows like the Grateful Dead ( this was still in the Jerry days ) , but in any other concert crowd of 20,000 there were also always a few .
Punk shows , country music festivals , rap , and even Christian rock concerts all seemed to inspire their share of intrepid souls ; and the Teafaerie was always there to walk them to the bathroom , help them find their people , and listen to whatever they needed to say .
I started peachy - puffing around 1993 , and while the internet was up and running then , it was not yet on the radar of the likes of me ; as far as I knew , nobody had ever done any serious psychedelic research on a massive scale .
I eventually printed up little questionnaires and started giving out lightsticks or candy to anyone willing and able to answer a few deceptively simple questions .
I also took to carrying a micro-recorder around to collect live testimony .
I asked people what substances they were on and what sorts of effects they were experiencing .
Regular Erowid readers will not be astonished by my discoveries .
At the time , though , I thought I was breaking new ground .
I was blown away by the results of my informal surveys .
I started keeping tallies and drawing up little charts .
The variation was striking , and , as far as I was concerned , the similarities were even more so .
About thirty percent of respondents said that they had , at some point , experienced something that met their personal definition of telepathy .
Interesting .
Seventy - five percent had experienced moderate to intense time dilation .
Cool .
Three different people reported being blown back to the beginning of time , traversing all of human history , and then passing through the present moment into a bright but indescribable event in the near future , barely missing some sort of target and getting blown back to the beginning of time again in faster and faster cycles until they whited out .
Wow !
The first time I heard this story it went down as an anomaly , the second time elevated it to the status of mystery , and the third one shocked me to the core .
I became obsessed with trying to figure out answers .
I served as Ground Control for anybody who would let me .
I attended conferences .
I put on raves , I went on Phish tour , and I started going to Burning Man .
I talked to hundreds upon hundreds of psychonauts ; current , former , and habitual .
The responses I routinely got to one question in particular haunt me , confuse me , intrigue , amaze , and terrify me more than any other .
That question is WHY ?
Why did you do it , Jimmy ?
Why did you choose to embark upon a risky and potentially life - transforming journey at Lollapalooza ?
Almost invariably , the answer was , “ I do n’t know ” .
And they really did n’t know .
Ingesting psychedelics in a crowded public place is dodgy at best .
Taking a handful of mystery drugs procured from some shady - looking character in the parking lot is downright stupid .
I suspect the revered elders of the old guard would mostly be shocked and dismayed by my temporary charges ’ choices of venue , and appalled by the apparent nonchalance with which such a profound endeavor often seemed to be undertaken .
I was appalled too , at times , but also intrigued .
I felt like I was discovering and documenting a whole new species of human being , one to whom such extreme forays were commonplace , easily entered into , and just as easily forgotten .
By doing my amateur research at concerts , raves , and festivals , I ’ve had an opportunity to study the habits of a unique and fascinating demographic , one which I cannot entirely deny being a part of , though I like to fancy myself more thoughtful and sophisticated than the mean .
We are largely young , hip , fairly well - off and well - educated , and willing to go to extraordinary lengths to be Truly Amused .
Born when the Sixties were already history , we came of age in an environment that was largely manifested by the psychedelic vision in one sense or another .
We ’ve been soaking in its imagery since we were born .
The current youth culture takes digital telepathy entirely for granted and gets impatient when it takes all of fifteen seconds to literally pluck any bit of information in the world out of thin air .
We ’ve been trained by consumer culture to seek maximum overload .
We want it brief , bright , interactive , hyperconnected and coming at us at a million miles per hour .
Ecological collapse is practically a foregone conclusion , and if we manage to dodge that bullet , novel doomsday scenarios are waiting in the wings .
We have always assumed that the Eschaton would come within our lifetimes in one form or another , and yet we carry on watching cartoons and playing video games .
We ’re like stunned bunnies frozen by the dazzling light of the onrushing singularity .
We have 50,000 songs in our pockets and ca n’t think of anything we want to listen to .
It should come as no surprise that some of us are willing to die for fun from time to time , so long as we stand a decent chance of living to tell about it .
The thing that is urgently manifesting itself on this planet burns brightly in our hearts .
It ’s calling us , shaping us , training us , and goading us to push the envelope .
The future , if any , is going to be much more intense than an acid trip and however clumsily we go about it , I do truly believe that we ’re preparing ourselves to meet it head on .
Almost every night for two springs and summers , I watched thousands of young people pour into that amphitheater in their mommies ’
SUVs , looking for an authentic experience .
And once in a while a few of them found , for a change , more than they bargained for .
So be it .
You buy the ticket and you take the ride .
I ’m lucky to have had the chance to help a few fellow travelers make their way through the night .
In the process , I ’ve been blessed with the opportunity to learn a great deal about the actions of these puzzling and impressive substances that humans have discovered or created , and the light they may shed upon who we are and where we ’re going .
This was a couple of years before Erowid first appeared , and nowhere near as awesome , but I like to think that I was driven by something like the same spirit that moved its founders , Earth and Fire , to start providing data online .
Direct experience may be the only true knowing , but in order to establish any kind of consensus we are obliged to ask , report , analyze , and speculate .
It took me about five years to give up on my naive fantasy of finding all the answers and settle into the serious business of trying to figure out what the questions are .
The project continues apace .

Even if you are against affirmative action , this cartoon hits the nail on the head .
( CNN ) --
The next large - scale military or terrorist attack on the United States , if and when it happens , may not involve airplanes or bombs or even intruders breaching American borders .
Cyberattackers shut down one Georgian government site and defaced another with images of Adolf Hitler .
Instead , such an assault may be carried out in cyberspace by shadowy hackers half a world away .
And Internet security experts believe that it could be just as devastating to the U.S. 's economy and infrastructure as a deadly bombing .
Experts say last week 's attack on the former Soviet republic of Georgia , in which a Russian military offensive was preceded by an Internet assault that overwhelmed Georgian government Web sites , signals a new kind of cyberwar , one for which the United States is not fully prepared .
" Nobody 's come up with a way to prevent this from happening , even here in the U.S. , " said Tom Burling , acting chief executive of Tulip Systems , an Atlanta , Georgia , Web - hosting firm that volunteered its Internet servers to protect the nation of Georgia 's Web sites from malicious traffic .
" The U.S. is probably more Internet - dependent than any place in the world .
So to that extent , we 're more vulnerable than any place in the world to this kind of attack , " Burling added .
" So much of what we 're doing [ in the United States ] is out there on the Internet , and all of that can be taken down at once . "
Watch experts discuss threat »
" This is such a crucial issue .
At every level , our security now is dependent on computers , " said Scott Borg , director of the United States Cyber Consequences Unit , a nonprofit research institute .
" It 's a whole new era .
Political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component .
The chief targets will be critical infrastructure , and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems . "
Do n't Miss ' Pentagon hacker ' loses extradition appeal
Hackers mounted coordinated assaults on Georgian government , media , banking and transportation sites in the weeks before Russian troops invaded .
Known as distributed denial of service , the attacks employ multiple computers to flood networks with millions of simultaneous requests , overwhelming servers and crippling Web sites .
Hackers shut down the Web site of the Georgian president , Mikheil Saakashvili , for 24 hours and defaced the Georgian parliament site with images of Adolf Hitler .
Saakashvili blamed Russia for the attacks , although the Russian government said it was not involved .
Web sites and computer networks have been targeted by hackers for decades , although large - scale , coordinated cyberattacks are still a relatively new phenomenon .
Some Internet - security experts believe that the Georgia conflict marks the first time a known cyberattack has coincided with a ground war , but others said that similar computer attacks have accompanied military operations in the Middle East and elsewhere .
The challenge to U.S. security experts is that such attacks can be mounted anonymously , and relatively cheaply , from anywhere in the world .
Georgia 's attackers employed " botnets , " or malicious automated programs that take root undetected in far - flung computers and barrage their targets with useless data .
By last Friday , some of those botnets were originating from Comcast Internet addresses in the United States , Burling said .
" It only takes a couple of experts ; it does n't take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off , " said Don Jackson , director of threat intelligence for SecureWorks , an Atlanta - based computer security firm .
" For a very small investment in resources , you can have a huge impact . "
In the United States , government computer networks parry millions of attempted intrusions every day , Internet - security experts say .
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security created a National Cybersecurity Center this year to coordinate federal cyberdefense efforts and quicken responsiveness .
However , a recent Homeland Security Department intelligence report , obtained by The Associated Press , concluded that there are no effective means to prevent a coordinated attack on U.S. Web sites .
" When it comes to our government IT security , we 're pretty strong in protecting against [ attacks ] , " Homeland Security spokesman William R. Knocke told CNN .
" But I would n't say ... we 're 100 percent impenetrable . "
So what would a cyberattack on the United States look like ?
And where is the U.S. most vulnerable ?
It depends on who you talk to .
Borg does not believe that the U.S. is susceptible to the kind of attacks launched at Georgia .
" We can command so much bandwidth that it 's hard to overwhelm our servers , " he said .
" We are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks , but right now most of the people who want to do us harm do n't have those capabilities . "
The Web sites of key government security agencies , such as the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency , are difficult to bring down , experts said .
So are the computer networks of large American banks .
But experts say a successful , large - scale attack on U.S. computer systems could hobble electric - power grids , transportation networks and industrial - supply chains .
" You 'd see some disruption of essential services , like electricity .
You 'd definitely see espionage , " said James A. Lewis , a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
" Would it be decisive ?
No. Nobody 's going to win a conflict with the United States in cyberspace .
But would it be disruptive and irritating ?
Yes . "
Federal researchers who launched an experimental cyberattack last year in Idaho caused a generator to self - destruct , prompting fears about the effect of a real attack on the nation 's electrical supply .
And a May report by the Government Accountability Office found that the Tennessee Valley Authority , which supplies power to almost 9 million people in the southeastern U.S. , had not installed sufficient cybersecurity measures .
Spokesman Jim Allen said the TVA , the nation 's largest publicly owned utility company , is " on track " to correct the problems .
What frustrates computer - security experts is that the features that make the Internet such an invaluable resource -- its openness and interconnectedness -- also make it easier for hackers to do harm .
As a staple of 21st - century warfare , cyberattacks will become increasingly sophisticated , forcing governments and private industry to build ever - stronger firewalls and other defenses , experts said .
Also , vague international laws and a lack of accountability will continue to make tracking down and prosecuting cyberattackers difficult .
" We do n't know quite what the rules are for this kind of conflict .
If it 's spying , it 's illegal .
But is it an act of war ?
And who do you arrest ? "
Lewis asked .
" We 're much safer [ in the U.S. ] than we were a year ago .
But we still have a long way to go . "

The Midwest region has also been hard hit by a series of tornadoes including one which killed four teenage boy scouts on Wednesday night when they were camping in western Iowa .
Forty eight people were also injured when the tornado ripped though the camp near Little Sioux .
One of the worst flooded areas is Cedar Rapids , Iowa 's second largest city , where more than 100 city blocks were inundated after the Cedar River broke its bank .
' Shut down '
Officials say that about 8,000 people have had to be evacuated and rescuers have been forced to use boats to get to residents trapped by the rising waters .
In Cedar Rapids more than 100 city blocks have been flooded

What are these ?
In March , shaken by the persistent controversy over comments pulled from the sermons of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , an icon in Chicago ’s black community and Obama ’s former pastor , Obama gave his now famous speech on race .
It was aimed , for the most part , at reassuring white voters over the Wright controversy , but it also marked the first time that he publicly addressed the generational divide his own campaign had exposed among black Americans .
“ For the men and women of Reverend Wright ’s generation , ” Obama said , “ the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away , nor has the anger and bitterness of those years .
. . .
At times , that anger is exploited by politicians , to gin up votes along racial lines or to make up for a politician ’s own failings . ”
Some older black politicians may have recognized themselves in Obama ’s subtle criticism , but those I spoke to said they took pride in seeing a black candidate articulate their experience to white America .
A lot of black incumbents who supported Clinton now find themselves trying to explain how they ended up so disconnected from their constituents , and many are preparing for their strongest primary challenges in years .
( In a primary last month , John Lewis , who had run unopposed since 1992 , had to beat not one but two primary opponents , including a 31 - year - old minister named Markel Hutchins who designed his campaign to look just like Obama ’s , right down to renting the same office space and using a red , white and blue logo in the shape of an “ O. ” )
So far , incumbents facing insurrection over their endorsements of Clinton have easily dispatched their challengers , leading to a collective exhalation inside the black caucus in Washington .
But then , as Jesse Jackson Jr. tried to remind his colleagues , the history of black politics is that such challengers are often heard from again .
On the first Tuesday in July , I traveled to Philadelphia , the site of Obama ’s landmark speech on race , to see the city ’s mayor , Michael Nutter .
Known as a reformer during a 14 - year stint on the City Council , Nutter played a central and intriguing role in this year ’s presidential contest , emerging as the black face of Hillary Clinton ’s campaign in Pennsylvania at a time when she desperately needed  and got  a solid victory in the state .
Nutter certainly was n’t the only visible black politician to campaign for Clinton deep into the primary season , but he was , in some ways , the least likely .
Nutter is only four years older than Obama , Ivy League - educated , bookish and doggedly unemotional .
He is , in short , the very prototype of the new generation of black political stars .
But unlike Cory Booker or Artur Davis or Deval Patrick , the governor of Massachusetts , Nutter sided with Clinton , and he enthusiastically campaigned for her .
I was curious to know whether Nutter , who was elected to a four - year term just last fall , was bracing for the consequences of that decision .
About 9 of every 10 black voters in Philadelphia pulled the lever for Obama , according to exit polls , and I heard at least one black Obama backer in Washington vow to make Nutter pay for his apostasy .
On the day that I visited him at City Hall , his aides had been reviewing the video of a sermon from last fall in which a prominent black minister in the city suggested that Nutter might have a “ white agenda . ”
It was late in the day when Nutter and I sat down at a long conference table in his office , accompanied by the sounds of subway trains rumbling underneath and R & B music piped in from mounted speakers .
He told me that he had made his decision methodically and had felt no pressure at all from his constituents .
Nutter said he sat down with both Clinton and Obama after his election as mayor and quizzed them about urban issues like housing , education and transportation .
Race , he said , had n’t entered into this thinking .
He understood , he said , why the prospect of a black president after hundreds of years of discrimination was “ powerful stuff ” for a lot of his constituents , but he had a greater responsibility , and that was to run the nation ’s sixth - largest city .
“ In the context of what I do for a living , I ’ve not figured out a black or white way to fill a pothole , ” he said , in a way that made me think he had said this many times before .
Nutter was a delegate for Bill Clinton way back in 1992 , and he said that the former first lady had shown a “ depth of understanding ” of what cities like Philadelphia were facing .
It probably did n’t hurt that Obama endorsed one of Nutter ’s opponents in last year ’s mayoral primary , either .
Nutter said he was n’t bothered by comments that the Clintons or their surrogates made during the campaign that had so incensed other black officials .
“ I think there was a lot of sensitivity , some warranted and some unwarranted , ” he said .
“ It ’s based on your life experience , and it ’s generational .
You know , if you have a sore on your arm , you do n’t necessarily have to touch the sore to feel the pain .
You can touch another part of your arm .
You ’ve still got a certain sensitivity to it .
So if race is the sensitive thing , then anything that even gets close to it  sounds like it , looks like it , feels like it  is it . ”

I wrote this a few weeks ago , and I was n’t sure what to do with it , or perhaps what to make of myself .
This looks like the place .
Here you go Craigslisters , I present my arguments , in bullet form , why Spongebob Square pants is the perfect girl .
1 . He ’s low maintenance .
No matter what happens to him , he never needs validation from anyone , for anything .
He never asks Patrick to tell him who he is , never uses his friction with Squidward to bolster his own ego .
All his energy is focused outward , albeit usually with mixed ( and hilarious ) results .
He never complains about those results either , just trudges ahead with blind , infectious optimism .
2 . He ’s a good cook .
In fact , he makes unquestionably the best burger in Bikini Bottom .
People come from everywhere to the Crab Shack for one of his Crabby Patties .
How rare is a girl who can cook , and enjoys it ?
3 . He lives in a pineapple .
Imagine having crazy sex in a giant pineapple .
All that gooey , sweet , sugary awesomeness providing both full body lubrication and a certain fun kinkiness .
Sex inside almost anything else would n’t be anywhere as much fun .
An orange would sting .
A tomato would stain .
While we ’re on the subject , do you want variety in your lovin ?
He ’s got HUNDREDS of holes , and he ’s not shy about himself or hung up in any way .
He also plays dress up .
Weekly .
And usually twice on Saturday mornings .
4 . He ’s comfortable with his job .
Mr. Crab pays him shit and he cares , never bitches .
Never comes home and says to his pet snail “ if that dude Squidward do n’t get off my ass , I ’m gonna kill him ! ”
The pineapple is a harmonious place because Spongebob checks that shit at the door .
5 . He manages his emotions .
We ’ve all seen Spongebob flip out .
We ’ve all seen chicks flip out .
The difference is that Spongebob Squarepants STAYS FOCUSED .
He may explode .
His eyes may shrivel up like raisins .
He might pull off his own legs and arms and beat himself with them in total panic and frustration .
He never loses sight of what he ’s flipping out ABOUT , though .
Every girl I ’ve ever met starts out being mad about the dish I just broke , or the amount of beer I may have drunk at her family reunion ( we all need help through the hard times , my Lord , my Lord ) but 15 minutes later it ’s why have n’t we bought a house yet , why are n’t I home more , why are n’t I home less , why are n’t I more communicative , and what about those boobs I was staring at back in May of 2002 .
Do ya feel me , boys ?
6 . He ’s devoted .
Patrick is an idiot , but he finds a way to relate and have fun .
Mr. Crabs is a jerk , but he gets past it and has a healthy work ethic .
He ’s maintained a healthy platonic relationship with a displaced female squirrel .
Even Squidward , despite all his efforts to the contrary , has a neighbor he can count on any time day or night .
( Aside : Squidward is a douche bag for not recognizing this )
7 . He knows how to have a good time .
Boy does he ever .
He likes eating contests , farts , TV , singing , hiking , playing with his body , sports ( did you see the snail race ?
better than Hoosiers ) , and just generally acting stupid and laughing about it .
I ’m telling you , he ’s got to be totally awesome to hang out with .
8 . He ’s comfortable with his body .
So he ’s not the ideal shape .
He ’s a square .
But he never complains .
You ’ll never hear the phrase “ height - weight proportional ” uttered from those yellow lips ( anyway his height - weight proportion is geometrically perfect , a fact which I am sure can be proven mathematically ) .
He do n’t give a shit .
He just buys the right clothes ( square ) and looks great and that ’s the end of it .
No endless questioning about why the universe shaped him the way he is .
No internal battles .
Just a simple square man with a healthy simple outlook .
9 . He ’s a virgin ( I ’d bet ) .
You say experience means everything ?
I say bullshit .
Comfort and communication trump experience every time .
Working at your sex life is only possible in a situation dominated by these two traits and amplified by a sense of adventure .
Spongebob has always demonstrated these characteristics .
Now , what do you want ?
A willing accomplice or the trick somebody else taught ?
10 .
He does n’t drink , smoke or do drugs .
Actually , I do enjoy the occasional cocktail or cigarette , and as you may have guessed , I have been known to puff it down a little and watch shows like , say , Spongebob Squarepants ( WTF , what did you do this morning that was so important , Mr. Smartypants ? ) , but the thing about our man Bob is that theses things do n’t rule his life , and could n’t you just imagine that first date at a bar ?
Somehow the idea of kicking two shots of Makers Mark back with Spongebob Squarepants is totally mesmerizing .
You think he ’d sit there and bitch about his exes ?
No way .
He ’s much more a load up the jukebox and kick up his heels on the bar kind of guy .
He ’ll take his lumps for it ( case in point , the Motorhead bar in the movie , where the fascist biker dudes kick his ass but he comes out grinning ) but I bet the night would be hilarious .
Imagine him pulling in a big drag and blowing it out all his orifices .
Imagine him talking to that drunken barfly you always see and making that old bitch laugh .
You ’d get to do all this shit with him for the first time .
11 . He demonstrates good parenting skills .
Did you see the episode where Spongebob and Patrick find a lost baby scallop and decide to raise it as their own ?
No ?!?
Well , allow me to elucidate .
Patrick takes on the male role and he sucks at it .
He sneaks off all day and night to watch TV at home while Spongebob , as the mother figure ( complete with apron and heels ) , holds the family together .
He does all the cooking , cleaning and baby - raising , all the while carrying an admittedly strained smile on his face .
Not to say I ’m looking for a wife to do it all and let me watch TV ( um , hmm ) , it ’s just that he demonstrates such strength and good humor .
The episode ends with a happy , well - adjusted scallop flying off (? ) into the sea-sky and a presumably happy well - adjusted scallop life .
It ’s not that Spongebob might make a good mom .
Spongebob is a good mom .
I ’m sure you all are going to think I am a pedophile ( why ?
Because I happen to be a little bit in love with a 6 year old boy cartoon character ? )
I ’m sure you ’ll all write me and tell me what a misogynistic jerk I am ( just substitute the words “ girl ” for “ boy ” and “ boy ” for “ girl ” throughout and I ’m sure my argument applies cross-genderally .
There .
Feel better , huge bull dykes with nothing better to do ? )
I ’m sure I ’ve sabotaged my e-mail account , but I wanted to do it .
I ’m in love , and people in love do and say stupid shit .
The U.S. missile defense program , which contributed to the deterioration of U.S. - Russian relations that helped generate the Russian - Georgian conflict , has benefited from that conflict and may cause a further downward spiral in the relationship between these two great powers .
Along with the recognition of Kosovo ’s independence from Serbia and repeated rounds of an expanding NATO  a Cold War alliance the Russians perceive as hostile  to Russia ’s doorstep , the unilateral U.S. abrogation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile ( ABM ) Treaty to pursue missile defense humiliated a weakened Russia .
But with oil prices high , economic growth robust , and new bold leadership , a much stronger and grumpier Russian bear has emerged from hibernation , as predicted by U.S. doves as early as the mid-1990s .
Now to take advantage of Russian " aggression " against Georgia ( even though Georgia started the conflict rolling ) and to demonstrate that the seemingly impotent United States has at least one retaliatory option , the Bush administration has provocatively reached an agreement with Poland to install 10 missile defense interceptors on its territory .
This unnecessary deployment will merely dump gasoline on the fire and will probably cause Russia to take more anti-Western actions in response .
Russia has already said that by agreeing to house the system , Poland has opened itself to targeting by Russia .
Although U.S. officials insist that the system is meant to counter Iranian , not Russian , nuclear - tipped missiles , the Russians are n’t buying this argument and are also humiliated by such a defense being erected in a former Warsaw Pact ally only 115 miles from their territory .
The administration claims that only 10 interceptors would not threaten a Russian nuclear deterrent force of thousands of warheads .
The Russians fear , however , that the missile defense radar , which will be erected in the Czech Republic , could look into Russia and that the system is only a precursor to a much larger system that could threaten the Russian nuclear deterrent .
The Russians are especially nervous about the survival of their nuclear force in the wake of its post - Cold War deterioration in reliability .
Also , the Russians note that there is no current Iranian nuclear threat to Europe and that such a danger via missile is a long way off .
The American taxpayer might wonder why the U.S. government is paying the Europeans to let the U.S. defend them from future Iranian missiles .
The price for Poland ’s agreement to deploy U.S. missile defense interceptors includes the provision of Patriot missiles , U.S. modernization of Poland ’s armed forces , and a strengthened U.S. commitment to defend Poland .
The Czechs got similar goodies for their agreement to house the system ’s radar .
Of course , the long - standing Republican obsession with missile defense  the Bush administration ’s preoccupation prior to 9/11 and after is only the most recent installment  is more political than strategic .
Missile defenses are very technologically challenging and expensive and can be countered relatively cheaply by building more nuclear - tipped missiles , putting more than one warhead on each missile , or using decoys to fool the system .
Besides , the combination of U.S. detection systems that can pinpoint the origin of a nuclear missile launch and the U.S. nuclear arsenal , the most powerful on earth , can deter any new nuclear - armed powers , such as Iran and North Korea , without the need to build an exorbitantly - priced missile defense system .
Even the current U.S. missile defense system , a vastly scaled down version of the pie - in - the - sky " Star Wars " system proposed decades ago during the Reagan administration , was deployed in California and Alaska and is now likely to be deployed in Europe before it has been sufficiently proved technologically  a potential nightmare for taxpayers .
That ’s where the politics comes in .
Republicans , allegedly the party of small government , have n’t minded wasting buckets of money over the years to bring to fruition the vision of their " conservative " hero Ronald Reagan .
The vision thing seems to be especially important after George W. Bush has wrecked the conservative brand name  perhaps for decades .
In sum , instead of trying to integrate Russia into the West after the Cold War , the United States alienated it .
U.S. abrogation of the ABM Treaty played a part in bringing about this estrangement .
Now in the wake of U.S. - Russian tensions over Georgia , the unnecessary U.S. deployment of missile defense in Europe risks a downward spiral in U.S. - Russian relations into active hostility .
In the peculiar neurological condition known as synesthesia , a person ’s senses meld together , so that a synesthete might “ hear ” colors or “ taste ” shapes .
Now scientists have stumbled on a previously unknown form of synesthesia in which visual flashes or movements trigger perceptions of sound .
California Institute of Technology neuroscientists Melissa Saenz and Christof Koch confirmed the existence of hearing - motion synesthesia , as they dubbed it , by creating a task at which the synesthetes would have an advantage .
The researchers presented four self - professed synesthetes and 10 nonsynesthetes with 100 pairs of Morse code–like rhythmic sequences , each composed of either auditory beeps or flashes of white on a black background .
The participants judged whether the two sequences in each pair were the same or different .
Both groups judged auditory patterns accurately about 85 percent of the time , the researchers report in the August 5 issue of Current Biology .
On the visual trials , nonsynesthetes ’ judgments fell to nearly chance levels , a result that corroborates other research showing that most people are better at judging auditory patterns than assessing visual patterns .
In contrast , synesthetes — who reported hearing sounds such as beeps or taps in time with the visual signals — distinguished matching from nonmatching rhythms 75 percent of the time .
“ I think of these people as having an enhanced soundtrack in life , ” Saenz says .
Her team is conducting brain - imaging studies to try to tease out the roots of that soundtrack as well as how a typical brain combines visual and auditory signals to improve perception .

BBC News , Pristina
Ethnic Albanians showed their anger at the Serb vote going ahead Serbia is holding an early general election on Sunday - and 300 polling stations will open in Kosovo , despite the declaration of independence in February .
The Serbs insist that Kosovo is still part of Serbia , and that no -one has the right to stop them flexing their democratic muscles .
The Kosovan government and the UN mission in Kosovo protest that only the UN has the right to organise local elections in Kosovo - and will not recognise the results .
But they have pledged not to stop the elections taking place .
" Kosovo is an independent state and we act according to that position , " deputy prime minister Hajredin Kuci told the BBC .
" Unfortunately people in Serbia , especially the government of Serbia , are trying to use Serbs in Kosovo not as a bridge for co-operation between Serbia and Kosovo , but as a movement for the integration of Kosovo into Serbia ...
" In any case , we will not give them the chance to build up new institutions according to the result . "
But that is exactly what the Serbs intend to do .
" These elections are important for us for many reasons , " said Jovan Stojanovic , a candidate of the Movement for the Survival of Serbs , in Caglavica .
" For the first time in nine years ( since Nato replaced Serbian security forces in the province in 1999 ) we are going to choose legitimate local representatives . "
Displaced communities
One of the many strange features about this election is that they are being organised according to the old , pre-1999 municipal boundaries .
Serbian politicians have been campaigning in Kosovo 's Serb areas So Mr Stojanovic is standing for a position on the Pristina city council , which will sit in exile in Gracanica - a parallel institution to the Albanian city council of Pristina elected in the Kosovan local elections last November .
Kosovan Serbs boycotted that vote .
" In the local elections we 're choosing people who will organise all the main areas of our lives , " said Zvonimir Stevic , candidate for the Socialist Party of Serbia in the same region .
" They are the people who will represent us in negotiations with the international community , and with our neighbours the Albanians as well . "
Many Serbs in Kosovo 's enclaves say that whatever the disagreements over the territory 's status , whether it is now independent or not , it is high time Albanians and Serbs sat down and solved the real problems together - local problems like the daily power cuts , rubbish collection , water supply , sewage .
Serb refugees from Kosovo are being encouraged to vote for the council of the town and village they fled from .
Pristina : Some ethnic
Albanians threw rubbish into the UN compound
There are only a few hundred Serbs still living in Pristina .
But there are around 6,000 Serbs displaced from Pristina on the voting register in central Kosovo , and a further 25,000 Serbs from Pristina now living in Serbia who can vote for the Pristina city council .
Deepening split ?
Another oddity is that Albanians who fled to Kosovo from the Presevo Valley in southern Serbia in 2001 , and now live as refugees in Kosovo , are being encouraged to cross back into Serbia this weekend , to vote for ethnic Albanian parties standing in the Serbian election .
They currently have only one deputy in the Serbian parliament .
Special buses are being laid on for the Albanians to go and vote in Serbia .
No one appears quite sure what happens when the voting dies down .
The biggest challenge to Kosovan independence would come if an idea put forward by Marko Jaksic , a prominent Serb nationalist standing for the Serbian Radical Party in northern Kosovo , is adopted by the new government in Belgrade .
He has proposed the formation of a Serbian parliament in Kosovo , made up of those elected this weekend .
" Serbs in Kosovo need a representative body through which they will realise their legal and legitimate rights , " he told the Reuters news agency this week .
In Pristina a rally against the Serbian elections , organised by student leader Albin Kurti's Self - determination movement , passed off peacefully on Friday .
Participants dumped rubbish outside the government building , to demonstrate their anger at what they see as the failure of both the government and UN mission to prevent the Serb voting .
They say the elections will serve to further partition Kosovo into Serb and Albanian areas , and will strengthen Serb ties to Belgrade , while weakening and undermining their ties to Pristina .

What are these ?
speakers .io will connect speakers and conferences tl ;dr : speakers .io is an app to connect speakers and conferences .
It ’s going to be awesome .
I ’ve been a conference organizer for almost 6 years now ( and a speaker for slightly longer ) , and year after year I ’ve hit the same points of friction in my work .
Seeing someone encounter the same thing with BritRuby made me realize that we could fix it !
Partially , at least .
An aside about BritRuby I had a long diatribe written about how everyone should stop forcing their priorities on event organizers and likewise organizers should find ways to include more people and people should n’t whine about people being passionate about diversity , but really it can just boil down to this : stop being a jerk .
If you think that statement could be about you , then it probably is .
So , stop it .
And let ’s get back to organizing mindblowing Ruby events that include everyone .
So , how does speakers .
io help that happen ?
Connecting speakers …
So watching this whole BritRuby thing , I kept thinking , “ could n’t we solve part of this with software ? ”
When I sit down to consider who to invite to speak at my events ( the keynote , typically ) , it would be really nice to not only get information about a presenter , but be able to know if they ’re interested in speaking , available to come , and then reach out to them easily .
If we had this utility with a lot of speakers on it ( including men , women , children , alien , golden retrievers , and anyone else who could operate a mouse ) that was easily navigable , searchable , and so on , it ’d make it way easier for organizers to hunt down some great , diverse speakers ?
Likewise , when I ’m looking to apply to some conferences , it ’s difficult to get a definitive list of what ’s available , what I ’d be interested in , and where my talks might fit .
What if there was a list of conferences that made it super easy to submit talks to ?
As a speaker and organizer , I look at services like Speaker Rate and Lanyrd and see the value somewhat .
There ’s a lot of information available on there and it ’s a pretty neat way for a speaker to build a profile .
I think if I attended more conferences rather than speaking or organizing them , I ’d probably derive more value from it .
But I ’ve always felt that they were n’t serving the right audience ( or that the right audience in my mind was n’t intended to be served but should be ) .
These apps represent some great tools for attendees to schedule things , get the scoop on a speaker , rate them and give feedback and so on , but they ’ve historically not been very helpful in terms of creating a community for conference organizers and speakers to work .
I ’d like to change that .
… with conferences
The first sort of “ arm ” of speakers .
io is the organizer - speaker .
First , obviously , we ’ll let speakers build profiles of talks with links and such to videos / slides / whatever so an organizer can review their past work .
The profile will also contain information like topics the person is interested in discussing and their schedule ( always frustrating to ping a speaker , wait a week , and then find out they ’re not available ! ) .
Organizers will be able to search for speakers and get results that only include speakers available on your event date and boosted by diversity index ( if a speaker has provided that information ) , topic expertise ( judged by tags and number of presentations on a topic ) , and so on .
Then organizers can issue “ talk requests ” for a speaker or even a specific talk .
Did you see a great talk by Zach Holman at TrollConf ?
You can request that he give that talk at your event next month , or you can request he come speak with some notes about what you ’d like to see .
You and Zach can work together then to put together an awesome talk description to work from .
We ’ll also be exposing some simple CFP functionality for organizers .
Speakers will then be able to search events by topic , location , dates , and so on , then submit a talk to multiple CFP ’s at once ( or submit a previously presented talk in one click ) .
Organizers can then filter and transform their submissions on axes like “ only show first run talks , ” “ sort by numebr of presentations , ” and so on .
… and other speakers
The second arm is the speaker - speaker functionality .
I really like the concept of SpeakerConf , in that it ’s a number of speakers getting together to present , hone their ideas , and practice their craft .
Why not re-create that in software ?
Speakers will be able to create a talk on speakers .
io that is n’t published to the public , and then invite other speakers to come and collaborate on it with them .
The vision here is still a bit ethereal , but basically , I want speakers to be able to help other speakers create better presentations through sharing slides , video , code , etc .
Like I said , I ’m still hammering out the vision here , but it will end up in there !
AND !
OK , there is no and .
That ’s it .
I want to keep the tool simple and focused .
I ’m fine with farming out slide sharing to Speaker Deck and selling tickets to one of the many fine ticket sellers .
It does n’t need to be a universal tool .
The point is to connect organizers to a wider array of speakers than they may have encountered otherwise and to connect speakers to events they may not even be aware of .
“ Is this a business or whatever ? ”
No , I ’m over the moon with working at GitHub .
It ’s just something I ’m doing on the side to make things easier : it ’s free and always will be .
I do n’t know about going open source or not ( that ’s because I do n’t want to manage it , not because I necessarily want to keep it secret ) , but I ’m going to push this out soon and see what happens beyond that .
So , head over to speakers .
io and sign up .
I had hoped to have an alpha version out to start getting speakers into and such , but I got bogged down a bit this week , so no such luck .
I should hopefully have a basic version done by next Monday so we can start playing with it !
Hit me on Twitter at @jm if you have any other cool ideas ( or want to do a UI design for it … I can send wireframe ideas ! ) .

I have got something cool !
I love Rolex .
The other day I randomly check out some new Rolex models and I ran into the website of a watch shop in Japan Tokyo .
They have an online store that I can get any models in just some clicks .
The models they have seem almost a full line that BLNR , Hulk , and many Daytona are in stock .
Even the latest Rolex Sea - Dweller 126600 is on the list !!
I ca n’t hold myself at the moment .
I just added it to shopping cart and paid for it right away .
Just some simple clicks .
The shop offers overseas shipping .
When I received the package , I was so glad I had made those clicks .

On a positive note : I ’m starting a positive newsletter .
I love surfing Twitter , checking Facebook , and hanging out on Reddit / Hacker News / etc. as much as the next person , but I ’ve got to be honest : you guys can kind of be douchebags .
Pair that with the constant cycle of terrible news being pumped out of CNN , FOXNews , and friends , it makes me feel pretty bad about the world when I go through my morning reading cycle .
Of course , the solution is easy : give it up .
Right .
So , I ’ll unplug from the world , stop associating with most people , and simply live in a silent bubble of limited information for the rest of my life .
That works great for some people ( the Information Diet is a “ thing , ” remember ? ) , but that ’s not how I roll .
I love absorbing information .
Learning is exciting for me .
But , the ( seemingly ) recent trend of Twitter arguments , crappy news , fear - driven reporting , and general crappery and loud - mouthiness associated with a lot of non-traditional news outlets ( e.g. , TechCrunch ) has really started to affect my mood .
I ’m more on edge .
I ’m quicker to get grumpy .
So , I ’m forcing myself to do some Happiness Therapy ™ everyday .
I ’ve started a newsletter called Good Morning , Interwebs , which will drop a little packet of positive into your inbox every morning .
By making myself seek out positive news , good things going in the world , and other stuff that will generally make me smile , I ’m thinking it ’ll make me feel better about things in general .
I ’ve tried things like this before , but I quit quickly .
“ OK I ’ve had a few days of this , great , OK , done . ”
But with the added pressure of “ people expect this in their inbox tomorrow morning , ” I ca n’t skip out on it quite as easily .
You can subscribe with this form : Email Sign up !
So , go forth and enjoy .
I ’m not sure how this is all going to take shape , but hopefully it ’ll add a bit of positivity to your morning before you wander out into the vast wasteland of negative , attention - hungry ( ZOMG DID YOU KNOW ANOTHER PERSON GOT SHOT IN YOUR CITY ? YOU DO NOW .
BE AFRAID ) , and frankly exhausting media . :) permalink
On Railcar : an isolated Rails environment Ever since launching Railcar , I ’ve been getting a lot of questions about why I ’m building it , how I ’m approaching things , how people can help , and so on , so I thought I ’d take a few minutes and share some things with you .
Why ?
The main reason is that the Kickstarter pointed to a real need that I did n’t realize still existed .
I ’ve become so separated from what it means to be “ new to Rails ” that I did n’t realize it was still a problem to get a Rails setup going on your machine , but thinking back on it , it was and still is a bit of a nutty process .
It ’s not just the installation of stuff , but the whole environment around the application .
How do you start it up ?
Why can’t I just stick it in my Apache root and let it go ?
Why do I have to configure a database file ?
Migrations ?
What is all this ?
I forgot how much cognitive friction really exists there that things like Locomotive removed when I was first starting out .
I had some spare time , experience building desktop apps , and some ideas about how it should work , so why not hack on something ?
Now , as I ’ve learned more about Tokaido ’s approach , I ’m really glad that I started building something else .
Statically linking everything is good for the tools to get started ( for example , we ’re going to make it such that you do n’t have to compile anything to get started with Rails and SQLite ) , but offering everything statically linked is just going make things difficult .
There ’s a reason that Apple does n’t like you to statically link things on OS X ( go ahead , try it ; there ’s no crt0.o for a reason ) .
You can find their reasoning through a quick Googling ( unfortunately , the original page explaining it appears to be gone now ) , but essentially they force you to dynamically link to the system libraries and kernel ( even in static mode ) .
Their position is that purely static linking is a Bad Thing because things can change and break under your code ( e.g. , moving a piece of functionality from the Mach kernel to userland ) .
Plus , if part of the reason you do n’t want people to have to compile things is the file size of the GCC package , you ’re not going to help that with statically linking everything .
Locomotive was about 100MB , and I think that ’s probably the absolute minimum file size you ’ll be able to pull off if you go that route .
Why not have them download ~ 150 MB and be able to install anything they want ?
Which leads to my second issue : discouraging people from using the tools they will be using in the “ Real World ” is a bad thing .
Yes , it ’s great to have a one click thing that you can develop in and really learn with , but your team will not work that way .
No matter how good you make it , I seriously doubt that experienced developers will use a GUI tool for something that can live and work better with a CLI .
Rails developers use homebrew .
Rails developers use compilers .
Rails developers encounter problems with installing gems sometimes .
After a certain point ( i.e. , once they move beyond their first few learning apps ) , attempting to hide these details from people learning is n’t helping them learn .
This issue is especially controlled thanks to homebrew and their extensive list of patches and OS X - specific fixes for many libraries .
And these are not problems you will solve , unless you think you ’re more talented than the thousands of developers from the past 20 + years who have attempted to solve it in every programming language ever used in a * nix environment .
Look , I do n’t think what Yehuda ’s doing is wrong or that Yehuda is wrong .
That ’s not what this is about .
I see this as the exact same situation as bundler / isolate , Merb / Rails , Sinatra / Ramaze , whatever / whatever else .
There are alternative ways to approach the same problem .
My philosophy is that I want people to use Railcar until it does n’t work for them anymore , at which point they can click the forthcoming “ install to system ” button and go about their merry way .
His approach is probably different .
We appear to be taking two valid approaches , and I ’m sure different people will gravitate to one or the other .
That ’s fine .
What ?
So , what am I doing exactly ?
Currently , I have a usable isolated app environment living in the repository .
It ’s written in MacRuby using XCode and Interface Builder ( I do n’t have any interest in using HotCocoa because I like pretty interfaces and it ’s incredibly hard to build those in HotCocoa ) .
On the first run , it will install Homebrew , RbEnv ( Why RbEnv ?
I could quickly figure out how it worked and its flexibility will make it easier to drop binary installs in .
I ’m not opposed to using RVM at all , but RbEnv was just easier to figure out and easier to hook with my code .
Patches accepted :) ) , Ruby , and some default packages .
Once it ’s bootstrapped , you can install popular packages in Homebrew , install various Ruby versions , generate ( or drag in existing ) applications and launch them with various options .
It ’s a little rough , some things are n’t quite wired up , but it ’s definitely a good MVP build right now I think .
Currently everything builds from source , but I ’m working on a setup for binary installations for Ruby and SQLite .
I ’m also setting up ( later today , hopefully ) a repository for a very , very small collection of statically compiled gems for SQLite , RMagick , and a few others .
Basically , I want to put the most popular gems in there so that in their initial learning , there wo n’t be a ton of issues .
I ’m also going to invest some time ( or invest some money in having someone else ) in converting a few gems to rake - compiler to make a lot of things with respect to compilation that much easier .
Once the binary installs are in place , I want to polish up the whole UI , put some nice icons in ( those are in the works ! ) , and get it really released as a product unto its own .
Then , I want to get to work on an educational piece that will either be part of the Railcar app itself or a separate application .
Basically , I want to make the documentation accessible , provide a number good on boarding tutorials , help with common errors , offer a “ help search ” that will search the mailing list , Stack Overflow , etc. to help find the best answer , and so on .
I have n’t decided the best place for that ; I ’m gravitating towards a second app so that you do n’t have to use Railcar , but we ’ll see .
How can I get involved ?
You can contribute code , for sure !
I ’m going to work on adding some tickets to Github today for some things that need to be done , but you ’ll find a few TODO : type things sprinkled throughout the code .
There are also a few rough areas that I ’d like to smooth out that do n’t really conform 100 % to the Cocoa way of doing things ( e.g. , I should be binding the per-application settings using Core Data probably ) , but those issues are minor .
Feel free to refactor / add / improve anything that you see .
I know MacRuby pretty well , but I ’m not the most expertest expert .
I know some people were saying things like ARC were creating issues for them , so if I have a weird build setting in XCode , please feel free to correct it and send me a pull request .
Oh , and tests .
We need some of those .
Secondly , if you ’d like ( and do n’t feel compelled at all ) , you can contribute monetarily .
While everyone likes money ( and it would be amazing to get a little boost around tax season ) , I do n’t really care about it , I ’m not “ seeking ” it , I do n’t need it to keep working on the project , but I ’ve gotten a number of requests for a PayPal button or whatever , so here you go :
Depending on the amount I gather , I plan on investing part of the money back into paying others to improve things like rake - compiler , Rails documentation , and so on .
I ’ll send you a sticker for contributing if you do n’t mind providing your address on the page after you finish with PayPal .
Please pardon the payment going to my business ’s PayPal account .
My wife uses my “ main ” PayPal account extensively for her business , and I do n’t want to risk PayPal freaking out and locking it up .
If you ’d prefer not to use PayPal , I can figure out something else if you ’ll e-mail me .
Where do we go from here ?
Well , I ’m going to keep hacking .
Getting people to help finish up a few loose ends would be great so we can get it into the hands of people to use .
Anything you can do to contribute to that ( even filing a Github ticket with a great idea ) , would be really helpful .
I ’m available via e-mail or Twitter if you wan to chat about any ideas / issues you can foresee .

Recruiters : why I ’m kind of rude to them , why they deserve it , and how to fix it ( IMHO ) I ’ve been dealing with recruiters for a long time .
Not the good kind that offer you awesome jobs , but the crappy kind that mailbomb you with irrelevant positions .
I ’ve been receiving their e-mails and such for years and years now , and eventually I decided I ’d afford them the same courtesy they afford me and simply write a form response for the ones that annoy me .
I posted it on Twitter yesterday after using it to respond to a recruiter who offered me a junior PHP / C# position ( tech I have n’t worked with for 5 + years ) that required relocating to a crappy area for terrible pay .
The response has been one of three things : General amusement at the contents
Sharing of their own form responses or experiences with recruiters ( some worse than mine ! )
Anger at the contents / the fact that I ’d be rude to a recruiter
The first two I expected , but I must admit , I did n’t expect the latter from anyone but recruiters ( and trust me , three recruiters felt it their duty to let me know what they thought via e-mail ; I ca n’t express how hard it was to not respond with my form response but I was civil :) ) .
So , I felt like maybe I should explain some things about recruiting , because I ’m not sure many of the people who were upset by it have actually experienced what a lot of people experience with recruiters .
What “ recruiters ” do Disclaimer :
The following does n’t describe every recruiter on the planet .
It does describe at least 90 % of the ones I ’ve interacted with , but I talk about some of the good ones later on .
I put “ recruiters ” in quotes there because the modern day recruiter is little more than a spammer who has legal authority to spam you .
I ’m almost surprised some of them have n’t taken to appending male enhancement ads to their job e-mails to make a little side cash .
Essentially , they have big databases of resumes that I ’m guessing are usually purchased rather than built given how out of date some of the information is in there ( we had an old cell phone number that we kept around for a while and we ’d still get calls on it 2 years after I ’d taken it off my resume ) .
They ’re probably tagged somehow or searchable by some means .
Recruiters take a job listing , search for keywords in their resume database , and e-mail everyone who could possibly match those keywords .
Everyone .
Even people like DHH , who obviously is n’t looking for a job .
So , why am I so offended by this practice ?
It ’s invasive Never has a single industry disrupted the general flow of my life so much as recruiting .
That ’s probably an exaggeration , but honestly , it ’s a bit much sometimes .
Here are some examples :
My wife now has my “ old ” cell phone number ( I got an iPhone 4 , she kept the 3GS and my number ) .
Unfortunately for her , that number is still on my resume ( and there ’s no legitimate reason to change it ; anyone who actually needs to reach me still can since , you know , she ’s my wife ) .
But she gets several daily calls from really pushy recruiters .
Once , a recruiter called at 9:30 p.m. , was told not to call again because I was n’t interested .
The same guy called at 8:20 a .m. the next morning about the same position .
Again , he was rebuffed , and he called back again at 4 p .m. that day .
Who else would do that ?
More recently , my wife told a recruiter that the number he was calling was hers but even if it was n’t , I was n’t interested anyhow .
This recruiter proceeds to try to strongarm my wife into putting me on the phone , give him my new number , give him a time he could call back , and any manner of things to try to get in contact with me .
He was already told I ’m simply not interested in anything he has right now , yet he felt it was imperative that he talk to me .
I ’ve never even had a debt collector be that adamant .
My inbox is pretty consistently invaded by just utter crap from recruiters .
It ’s pretty easy to identify junk ( “ MYSQL / PHP / SCALA / JAVA / C__ - $ 36 k SALARY - NYC — ” is the most recent subject line I ’ve received ) , but sometimes I get e-mail like “ Hey I ’d like to chat with you about work . ”
OK , great .
I ’m totally fine with “ networking ” with recruiters who actually care , but inevitably , this turns out to be a “ Oh , he actually reads his e-mail ” situation where they start firebombing me with “ leads ” every day .
I try to be charitable to most of those introductory e-mails because I always hope it ’s a recruiter really trying to do it right , but every time I ’ve “ fallen for it ” it ’s turned out badly .
Typically I ’ll send my response , mark as spam / block the sender , and move on .
But on a few occasions , I ’ve had someone else in the same agency start spamming me .
So , I block one person , they simply toss my address to another e-mail within their company , and start sending from that .
In one case , I ’d tried to be nice to a recruiter , told her I was n’t interested , but she continued to send “ leads ” my way ( of the “ you ’d have to relocate to the middle of Tennessee or South Carolina and be paid $ 22 k for a position requiring 5 years of Java experience ” variety ) .
Finally , I bluntly but civilly told her to never contact me again ( this was pre-The Response™ ) and blocked her .
She proceeds to e-mail me from her personal Yahoo !
account yelling at me for blocking her other address , telling me I ’m helping to put her out of business , and all this other crap that I ca n’t be hassled to remember right now .
You can point to those and say “ oh , those are the bad ones ! ” but frankly that ’s how most of my interactions with recruiters go , especially when it comes to phone pushiness .
The point is that this boorish behavior is n’t really abnormal .
The worst part is that 3 for 3 yesterday in the recruiter responses , they all blamed me .
“ Well if you would n’t post your resume on your website , we would n’t e-mail you . ”
“ If you did n’t mark yourself as ‘ for hire ’ on LinkedIn or WorkingWithRails , we could n’t call you . ”
Are you kidding me ?
PROTIP : I am for hire .
I run a consulting business .
I ’ve actually gotten 2 contracts from people pinging me from those mechanisms .
I ’m not going to act as if I ’m full up on work just so you wo n’t spam me .
That ’s just ridiculous , self - absorbed martyrdom .
Even further , just because I post some information publicly that does n’t give you the right to spam with tenuously related information .
I mean , what if I spammed you with some recruiter related product ?
Or what if I started a recruiter recruiting firm and just totally bombed you with e-mails about positions in it ?
I guarantee you ’d cry foul then .
It ’s not very effective Recruiting as it ’s currently practiced can’t possibly work very well .
Maybe it does .
Maybe they have enough resumes built up that they ’ll get a few hits that are actually viable .
I doubt that happens most of the time given the amount of repeat job spam I get , but it ’s always possible .
But even so , they ’re not doing their job as it ’s supposed to be done at all .
Part of the job of a recruiter is ( theoretically ) screening candidates on some surface level .
I did an experiment a couple of years ago by responding to 3 job spams I totally was n’t qualified for : one was a position using R or SAS or something like that at a financial firm , one was a C++ position at a games company , and one was a low - level network engineer position at some MegaCorp™ .
Every time the recruiter merrily passed on my information to the client , selling me up as a great candidate , and so on .
My resume said nothing about any of this stuff .
No experience , no education .
Nothing .
So , not only are these people not good at screening candidates to spam , they ’re also terrible at even telling whether a candidate is legitimate .
I felt bad telling the firms they ’d been duped into accepting a lead on a crappy candidate .
Two of the companies never responded at all , but the MegaCorp™ HR person told me they never expected high calibre candidates from recruiters anyhow .
It ’s a useless industry The way it ’s currently done , recruiting is totally useless .
What do recruiters offer beyond what a job board posting would offer ?
I ’d even venture to guess that a job board posting would have a better return since the people looking at it and applying are actually looking for another gig .
Spam recruiters are simply leeches , middle ( wo ) men who take a big slice for being a reverse job board .
What recruiting is supposed to be Recruiting is n’t always like this , though .
In Real Recruiting™ , recruiters actually spend time evaluating candidates ( not just e-mailing anyone who matches some keywords ) , searching out people who fit the position they ’ve been tasked with filling using information gathered from their own experience and their network ( not just doing a Google search for a resume and passing it on ) , getting to know the candidates ( not just merrily passing them along after the first response ) , and then making an informed and pointed recommendation to their client .
That ’s how it works in corporate America .
Do you think when a big corporation decides they want to hire a new CEO that their recruiter mailbombs everyone who has CEO experience ?
No , they have an informed process to make educated recommendations to the board .
For example , when Apple recruited John Sculley to be their new CEO , they spent a lot of time evaluating his effects on the company , what he would bring to the table , how it could shape Apple , help tame Steve Jobs , and so on .
Now , granted most developer positions do n’t carry that much gravity in a company , but a little consideration of the position and background of the candidate would be nice .
But … but … but !
When I ’ve shared some of these thougts with recruiters , I often get back , “ But that ’s not sustainable !
I do n’t get paid enough for that ! ”
Then let me be clear : Maybe you do n’t have a real business .
It ’d be great if I could sit on the side of the road and sell small carvings I make from the rinds of watermelons , but hey that ’s not sustainable either .
The hard truth is that you do n’t make enough to do that because you do n’t offer any value beyond a job board , and job boards are cheap .
I posted a job on one job board , got 20 credible leads ( and about 10 - 15 not - so - credible ones ) .
Would a recruiter have turned that around for less than $ 300 ?
I doubt it .
In this Era of the Internet , a lot of “ connector ” businesses are finding themselves replaced by websites these days .
Phone companies are finding stiff competition requiring staff reductions for things like directory assistance , driving directions , and so on .
The Internet has democratized information access and inter-personal connections to the point that middle ( wo ) men like recruiters are a fading industry .
Want to save yourself some cash ?
Want a programmer that does Java ?
Post the job on a board and do some searching on a community site .
You ’ll find people who are doing interesting things and probably looking for work .
Doin ’ it right
So , I hate blog posts that just complain the whole time and offer no concrete solutions .
How can recruiters start actually offering value ?
Learn the industry Anyone can do what I just described above ( Google and e-mail someone ) .
The CTO , the team manager , the little HR lady who always offers you a peppermint when you visit her office , they all know how to do that .
The value a recruiter can offer in knowing the tech , actually being able to evaluate candidates , talk intelligently with the client and candidates , and so on is nearly immeasurable .
I really think a firm of tech - educated recruiters who have real chops ( or at least some knowledge ) , who can connect with both sides , and can actually make educated recommendations would be a real winner .
Do n’t have the time or inclination ?
OK , understood , but then hire someone .
I tell you what : Arcturo will pre-screen all your candidates for $ 500 ( i.e. , toss out actual crap ) and technical screen them for $ 100 a pop .
I ’m sure a number of other firms would do the same .
Even better , talk to the client ’s current team or leadership about people and things they ’re looking for outside the job description .
I talked to a recruiter at Square who was totally doing it right .
She had dug up a few people to talk to , and then she went to the team there ( who would know who has good technical chops ) and said , “ What do you guys think ? ”
They helped her narrow her list down , and she contacted each of these people personally .
That is doing it right .
Contact me like a human
Do n’t form e-mail bomb me .
It ’s just offensive that you ca n’t be hassled to at least compose at least a semi-personal e-mail .
That carelessness was the genesis of my form response : they ’re taking less than a second to compose a message to me , so I ’ll afford them the same courtesy while also registering my displeasure .
I ’ve only gotten a single response to my form e-mail , and that was simply “ OK . ”
Usually they do n’t respond , which , to be fair , is the intended effect .
But had they reached out to me like a person , made me feel like they had done any degree of research at all , had actually evaluated whether I would even fit the position at all , I would respond differently .
If a recruiter has any familiarity with me at all ( even “ I saw your Github account ” is passable in some cases ) , I ’d be a lot more civil .
The CTO at Mixbook did a great job with this .
He ’d looked over my blog , seen my Github , and contacted me because he thought I ’d be a good fit ( I ’m guessing he did n’t have much success because they ’ve now hired a recruiter who is spamming people like DHH ) .
But even so , I thought that was a great approach , and were I looking for a job and to relocate , I ’d have definitely responded to him .
Use common sense
If my resume says nothing about SAS or SAP , then why are you e-mailing me leads dealing with those technologies ?
If my experience listing tells you that I have n’t touched C# in any real capacity in years , then why are you e-mailing me about a “ C# Expert ” position ( well , I ’ll you why , because they ’re not reading the resume , but still ) .
Evaluate the information you have available to you before you even reach out .
It ’ll pay off for you .
I also ca n’t tell you how irritating it is to get an e-mail with something like “ We need a developer for a Rails project .
It pays $ 27,000 a year with no benefits and requires at least 4 years experience with Rails and 6 in web development .
Oh and you ’ll need to be in ( Atlanta|NYC|San Francisco|Seattle ) ” ( not an exaggeration ) .
Who would take that position ?
Sometimes recruiters need to learn to say “ NO ” to crappy companies trying to hire like that .
Candidates would respect you a lot more if you would n’t toss this utter crap our way .
I know right now the economy is still pretty unstable and some people would be happy to have that job , but if the requirements and the compensation do n’t match up at all , then that ’s a huge red flag for candidates .
OK
So , that ’s my speel on recruiters .
I ’m sure I ’ll be “ blacklisted from [ another recruiter ’s ] extensive network ” as I was yesterday .
I ’m totally sure I ’ll “ regret saying such things in public . ”
OK , not really .
I feel like I ’m being fairly reasoned here given the amount of stupidity and abuse I ’ve put up with over the years .
By the way : I ’m on vacation right now ( thanks Tumblr post - queue ! ) .
If you e-mail , comment , tweet , etc. and I do n’t respond , I ’m not ignoring you .
Well , I sort of am , but only because I ’m probably on the beach or floating in the middle of the Caribbean .
Sorry , the Internet reception ’s not real good out here .

Let me work on - site for you !
( For a few days … )
I ’ve been tossing this idea around for a while , but now I ’m at a point where I can actually do it thanks to things in life and business stabilizing a bit .
I like to travel , I like work , and I ’ve been wanting to hang out with more people in person ( sitting in my office alone is great most of the time but other times it bites ! ) , so I figure why not combine the three ?
The deal I come to your office and work for you for any number of days ( up to 5 ) at a flat rate .
I ’ll hack on code , train your developers , pair program , fold your laundry , up vote all your Hacker News posts , make coffee , conduct dramatic readings from the Gang of Four book , whatever you want me to do .
The options are ( nearly ) limitless .
If you want just 1 day , that ’s OK .
I plan on giving everyone a good chunk of time before hand to familiarize myself with the code , their business , what they ’ll be needing , and so on .
I ’m not going to walk in on the first day with no clue about your business , spend 6 hours learning stuff , 1 hour contributing , and another hour telling jokes about airline peanuts .
The fee right now will be $ 2,000 per day , which is basically what I charge for 2 days of time right now at $ 125 / hour .
To be clear : I give you a ( basically ) a day ’s worth of time off - site reading documentation , talking to your team , looking at your code , getting familiar with your needs and a day on - site actually doing the work .
So , basically you ’ll be paying what I charge for remote work , except , you know , on - site .
This rate might go up in the next round , I do n’t know , but since this is sort of an experiment , I figured I ’d just stick with what works right now .
When and how ?
Well , I do n’t know when exactly .
My plan is to go to San Francisco for a week sometime soon and work at least 4 of the days of the week .
I ’m also considering a run in New York City .
If you want 4 - 5 days , we can work something out where I make a special trip just for you ( possibly even to places not in NYC or SF , but we ’ll have to talk about that :) ) , but if you want fewer , we ’ll have to try to coordinate dates with others who want fewer also .
So , if you ’re a company in San Francisco or New York City and could use a little extra Ruby , Rails , iPhone , or whatever muscle , then get in touch .

Bad ( or , my unfortunately unfavorable review of Bob Martin ’s Ruby Midwest keynote ) Uncle Bob Martin has had a lot of influence on the software development industry over his career .
His books are heralded as “ landmark ” and “ essential tome[s ] . ”
He is credited as “ legendary ” ( ugh ) in his author biography on Amazon .
I do n’t doubt that he ’s an incredibly smart guy from what I ’ve read from him .
Some of his articles are fantastic reads .
But I think perhaps either I have n’t read enough to get a real impression of him , or the conference talk I recently had a chance to watch is significantly more dishonest than his writing for some reason .
I was wandering down a rabbit hole of Twitter / Hacker News discussion , and I kept seeing people linking to his keynote video from Ruby Midwest 2011 as a “ very important talk to watch . ”
I ’d sat through at least one ( possibly more ) of his conference talks before without paying much attention ( I unfortunately often find it hard to focus on conference talks ) , really liked what I heard at his RailsConf 2009 keynote ( missed his 2010 one ) , and since this particular talk was relevant to what I was reading at the time , I figured I ’d give it a more attentive watch .
I realize I ’m probably going to tick off a lot of people here , but what I heard was seriously troubling .
( There ’s that and he took time to correct everyone else ’s talks at the start of his talk , so I figured turnabout is fair play . :) )
I ’d heard his talks described as “ sermons ” before , but I never realized how hand wavey they could be at times ( at least this particular one ) .
I had to watch it 3 times to get at his main point , which still ( to my ears ) does n’t really have any evidence behind it or meat to it outside of “ Uncle Bob says . ”
Even worse , as I was listening , I kept getting angrier by the minute at the gross mischaracterizations or downright mistruths he was spouting .
The following list is just a collection of things I caught on my first couple of listens .
Maybe there are more in there , but these were glaring enough to catch my attention .
Assertion : Architecture is about intent , and intent should be evident when looking at a software project , so the Rails directory layout sucks .
( around 11:00 )
He led everyone to this point by showing them blueprints of buildings , indicating that a building ’s purpose should be and is evident by how it is architected .
From this , he then makes the logical leap that this should absolutely be true of software , and that when you look at the top level directory of a project , the architecture should be evident , not the framework .
His criticism is that when you look at a Rails application ’s directories and files , you can readily see it ’s a Rails application but not what the application actually does .
Disregarding the fact that having standardized file placement driven by the framework is one of the biggest wins for development teams when using a framework , that ’s one of the most bizarre criticisms I have ever heard in a conference talk .
I have never in my career worked on a project where I could simply glance at the file layout and discern exactly what the application does .
Heck , even in things like XCode or Visual Studio , where one can have a logical layout of the files with smart groupings , I have n’t been able to do that .
The better question is : why would you need to ?
You ’re a developer .
You ’re going to be building the project out , so you ’ll figure out what the app does soon enough .
What is more convenient for you : a gangly file layout / “ architecture ” that is non-standardized , annoying to navigate , and requires documentation for others to navigate or something standard that makes your locating files and important logic in those files that much easier ?
And even so , as his argument indicates even , file layout does n’t speak to the functionality of the application .
You could just as easily follow his suggestions but put different , unrelated code in the files , and you ’d be in a worse position .
It ’s a foolish , silly criticism that probably sounded better on paper than when it came out in the talk .
The worst part was that at around 28:00 he advocates an alternative directory structure based on the architecture he ’s describing in the talk , which has names that are just as or even more opaque : interactors , entities , and so on .
He also suggests you ’d have interactor files named after use cases ( e.g. , create_order.rb , fill_order.rb , etc. ) ; I would personally kill myself if I had to navigate a huge project in this structure .
I get the idea here , but is the ability to quickly sort of discern what an application does worth making your developer ’s life a miserable existence during the other 99.9 % of the project ?
Who would want to figure out in which of the 500 use case files that this particular piece lived in ?
Nobody , that ’s who .
This point was one part of the talk where he totally lost me in terms of what he was actually trying to say other than “ I needed 5 more minutes of material and this seems like a good place to start the rest of my arguments from . ”
Assertion : Views should know nothing about the business objects .
( Around 32:15 ) Perhaps that ’s his opinion on things , but if we ’re going to appeal to MVC ’s origins and go by standard , accepted definitions , that assertion is just patently false according to much of the authoritative MVC documentation .
For example , in the paper where the terminology is finalized for MVC dated December 10 , 1979 , Reenskaug writes in reference to views and how they get or update data in models :
A view is attached to its model ( or model part ) and gets the data necessary for the presentation from the model by asking questions .
It may also update the model by sending appropriate messages .
All these questions and messages have to be in the terminology of the model , the view will therefore have to know the semantics of the attributes of the model it represents .
( It may , for example , ask for the model ’s identifier and expect an instance of Text , it may not assume that the model is of class Text . )
In the original vision of MVC , the model , view , and controller were separated but communicative .
A view can ask request data ( or update a model ( Heaven forbid ! ) , an action which he derides at about 31:45 ) as needed for its functionality ( so long as it does n’t violate its role in the triad ) .
Acting as if a view should be and always has been a “ stupid piece of tiny code ” that is simply feed flat data that it renders is false .
Assertion :
You should have “ hundreds ” of views , not just one view .
( Around 30:30 ) Again , he harkens back to MVC ’s roots and asserts that the Rails way of having one view ( the page ) is wrong , and according to the original plan , you should have hundreds of views , so MVC is a flawed model for doing things on the web .
And again , he is incorrect .
Quoting from How to Use Model - View - Controller , a paper describing the original implementation of MVC in Smalltalk : Views are designed to be nested .
Most windows in fact involve at least two views , one nested inside the other .
The outermost view , known as the topView is an instance of StandardSystemView or one of its subClasses .
In the original Smalltalk environments , having an overarching , top - level view for the M - V - C slice you were working with was common ( and likely required in most situations ) .
If we envision the page to be the same “ object ” as a window in the original implementation ( which I believe is how it should be viewed ) , then the pattern fits quite well , especially since partials ( and cells if we want to follow his assertion that all views should have an M - C piece to them ) provide the same subview functionality .
This fact is especially true if we get over the whole notion that the MVC pattern is a totally defined , prescribed Pattern™ that you must adhere to religiously and unwaveringly and instead take it for what it is , which is a loosely defined pattern that describes a way to reduce and manage complexity in systems ( post coming about that attitude tomorrow … ) .
Assertion : Point of writing tests first is to avoid coverage gaps ( or just about anything else he said about TDD in the talk ) .
A lot of his tangent into TDD starting at around 58:00 was silly .
First , he asserts that writing tests after the fact is “ a waste of time . ”
Granted , you ’re more likely to miss some coverage if you do only that , but who does n’t write quite a few tests after the implementation ?
Lay down a solid , basic set of tests covering what you ’re writing , then go back and cover the edge cases when you have a clearer picture of the logic and its interactions with other pieces of the system .
It ’s stupid to act as if writing any tests after the implementation is useless .
Secondly , he asserts that the reason everyone TDD ’s is to avoid coverage gaps .
Now , I do n’t know what sort of Magic Double Dream Hands TDD ™ he ’s doing , but the only “ coverage ” gains you ’re making by TDD'ing are the kind that do n’t matter ( i.e. , numbers not quality ) .
That ’s great that you have 100 % coverage , but are your tests actually robust ?
And , even further , if you ’re requiring 100 % coverage , are you over - testing things ?
( If I see a unit test for the existence of an attr_accessor or a constant value one more time , I will scream )
These questions do n’t seem to faze him however .
TDD'ing leads to perfect coverage , which , of course , means impeccable quality tests ! </ sarcasm >
Assertion : MVC is meant to be used in the small , so Rails does it wrong .
( Around 31:30 )
This was probably the most frustrating point in the whole talk .
He twists and contorts MVC ’s role in a Rails application and then muddles the terms of architecture pattern and design pattern to forge a point that Rails usage of MVC is inherently flawed according to how the inventor intended the pattern to be used .
Yes , as he asserts , MVC is meant to be used “ in the small ” in the sense that it takes one slice of your application , separates its concerns , and then lets you independently manage the complexity of those concerns .
He is correct in that it is not necessarily an architecture pattern .
But his diagram of how a Rails app looks versus this architecture he ’s discussing in the talk is just simply disingenuous .
https://img.skitch.com/20111231-n9qswtxgswfmmb1qq1qgj6c75y.jpg
Not only does he conveniently rearrange the pieces so that it seems disjointed , he also completely pulls it out of the proper place in the architecture diagram to make it seem sloppier than it really is .
Even further , Rails uses MVC in the exact way that the original creator of the pattern intended it to be used .
It does n’t use MVC to handle the entire cycle of interaction in the applicatio ( f.e. , it does n’t treat the web as part of the MVC mechanism ) .
When a request comes in ( i.e. , user input ) , the input is passed to the controller , which decides what should be done with it , how models should be updated , and which views should be rendered for that particular input from a view .
This is nearly exactly how it ’s done in Smalltalk , exactly how it ’s been done in nearly every other implementation of MVC , and this is exactly the “ small ” that it ’s meant to be used in .
It ’s not being used to build the framework ( i.e. , your app is n’t treated as some weird model plugged into one giant MVC mechanism or something ) , it ’s not used as the framework / application “ architecture ” ( that ’s actually something akin to a Model2 architecture pattern ) , and it ’s not being shoved somewhere it does n’t belong .
It ’s exactly where it ’s supposed to be .
In reality , Rails is fairly close to the architecture he discusses .
It ’s not as decoupled and interface driven as he ’d like it to be , but that ’s the real rub with this entire talk : he ’s complaining about Rails “ flaws ” that are n’t part of its DNA .
It ’s like complaining about how a sweater is n’t a very good conversationalist .
He ends the talk by harping on the fact that good architecture lets you defer decisions for as long as possible .
But here ’s a PROTIP : if you ’re using Rails , you ’ve already let someone else make a lot of decisions for you .
That ’s kind of the point since Rails is largely a curated set of Rack extensions that help you build web applications .
They ’ve decided your app layout .
They ’ve decided you ’re going to be using MVC .
They ’ve decided you ’re going to be piping things through a router of some sort and dispatching those requests to objects .
All of these decisions and many , many more are already made .
So , why waste the effort to whine and complain and hand wave that it ’s bad , when you ’re doing it to yourself ?
Pick a different framework or build your own , problem solved .
Seriously , wtf ?
Those are just the major points I had issue with .
There were several other minor things that grated me :
At 17:00 , he makes the remark that only classes derived from ActiveRecord : : Base go in app / models , not the business objects he ’s describing .
I know he was making a sarcastic remark since that ’s a general practice he disagrees with , but it ( a ) fell flat because a bunch of people yelled ‘ models ’ when he asked the baiting question and ( b ) is a fairly well known fact these days you can put anything in there that ’s a business object .
go in , not the business objects he ’s describing .

Around 25:00 , he takes issues with “ web stuff ” like session id ’s and so on getting into your business logic .
The problem with that is that sometimes you need that stuff .
There are many times where I need to know how to handle some logic because of a header or some other payload information from the web .
Around 33:00 he makes a snide argument that “ You gotta know a ton of languages to write a web app . ” Seriously ?
You really only have to know one programming language .
If you want your pages to look decent , you need to know one markup language ( and optionally know a second programming language if you want some fanciness ) .
What about desktop apps ?
You need to know a form designer or a mark up like XAML / WPF or how to manage frames and such in code ( which is n’t any easier than just learning a stupid mark up language ) .
The criticism is weird because the best part of the web is that we have standard , interpretable languages / mark up usable by clients that do n’t require client knowledge of any specific programming language .
I can write a web app in Java or Rails and the client , which could be a mobile phone , desktop computer , mainframe in the tundra of Russia , or whatever , does n’t give a crap which one it is .
That ’s awesome not annoying .
Around 40:00 , someone mentions they have “ too many tests . ”
He goes on to dismiss that attitude ( 2 or 3 times actually ) as a symptom of slow tests , and continues to point out that you should never get rid of tests , just write faster ones .
I hope he ’s kidding .
I can tell stories of many apps I ’ve inherited apps that were way overtested .
I ’m talking 5,000 Cucumber scenarios for an internal , non-mission critical application over - tested .
I mean 22,000 unit tests for 30 models over - tested .
I mean if I tweak the content of a constant array , the right tests fail , but I also have to clean 5 other tests where they simply tested the content of the array .
That ’s over - testing .
I could rant about this for a while , so I ’ll stop . :)
So , seriously , what happened ?
I think I ’m just so disappointed because I ’ve seen better stuff from him , but how have people been pointing to this talk as a really important talk that everyone should watch ?
I get he wants us to DECOUPLE ALL THE THINGS , but do we look past all this crap to get to a point he could have made much more directly and honestly ( and in only about 10 minutes ) ?
Or am I missing some grand overarching sarcasm that has placed me in the unenviable position of being part of the conference session equivalent of Punk’d ?

Introducing gem_git : tiny tools for working with gems ’ code via Git We ’ve all been there .

In some cases you can work around it ( or if you ’re desperate / crazy , just monkey patch over it and move on ) , but more often than not , you want to fork and fix it and / or send a pull request back to the original author .
Likewise , I ’ve been hankering to hack on some open source stuff lately , and while browsing Github for stuff to hack on is cool , more usually I ’m doing something and think , “ Hey , it would be cool if this gem did ( x ) ! ”
Tracking down a gem ’s source usually is n’t terribly difficult , but it ’s kind of annoying to go find the URL for the repository , pop that into my Terminal , clone it , and so on .
The friction is even more irritating if after hacking a bit I decide to fork it and keep my changes separate .
So I decided I ’d make things a bit easier .
I hacked out gem_git .
Right now it ’s just a couple of gem commands to help with hacking on gems .
The first one is gem clone , which hits the RubyGems API to find the gem ’s source and clones it .
So , if you want to clone paperclip : $ gem clone paperclip Cloning paperclip from https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip...
Cloning into paperclip ... remote : Counting objects : 5231 , done .
remote : Compressing objects : 100 % ( 2292/2292 ) , done .
remote : Total 5231 ( delta 3582 ) , reused 4377 ( delta 2822 ) Receiving objects : 100 % ( 5231/5231 ) , 798.34 KiB | 1.25 MiB/s , done .
Resolving deltas : 100 % ( 3582/3582 ) , done .
The next one builds on that and lets you actually create a Github fork .
So if I wanted to create a fork of pakyow , I ’d do this : $ gem fork pakyow Forking pakyow from https://github.com/metabahn/pakyow...
Repository forked , now cloning ...
Cloning into pakyow ... remote : Counting objects : 1109 , done .
remote : Compressing objects : 100 % ( 461/461 ) , done .
remote : Total 1109 ( delta 730 ) , reused 977 ( delta 598 )
Receiving objects : 100 % ( 1109/1109 ) , 139.93 KiB | 230 KiB/s , done .
Resolving deltas : 100 % ( 730/730 ) , done .
Now I have a shiny fork of pakyow for my own hacking .
Right now there are no tests and pretty poor error handling , but I ’ll be hacking on it over the next few days to improve that sort of stuff .
Please file any bugs you find on Github Issues and I ’ll get around to them .
Also , be sure to clone / fork the gem and send me patches .
That would be awesome . :) permalink
Attention API Provider :
How to make people using your API love you At Arcturo , we ’ve been working with a lot of remote API ’s and big data lately .
The more API ’s from all over the web I work with , the more I realize how much some companies really get how to build an API that developers love and use all the time , but at the same time , I ’m beginning to realize how little thought some teams really put into their API and how it will be used .
I rant about this often to Ryan , so I thought I ’d go ahead write up a little list of things that API consumers would really appreciate if you ’re providing an API .
Keep it consistent .
The number one most annoying thing I ’ve encountered is inconsistent treatment of API calls .
For example , let ’s say I ’m working with an API to a library .
If I pull a book from the main collection and then a book from the reserve collection , both should contain the same citation information .
If both of them , from my end , look like a book but contain different information ( or annoyingly differently formatted information ) , that ’s a big usability problem .
Much like we obsess over the user experience on the client side , investing time in your API ’s user experience will yield big results in terms of adoption and engagement from developers .
Think about what they will be doing and make the path from where they are to where they want to be as frictionless as possible .
Giving me inconsistent data is a huge blocker to actually getting things done because not only am I wrestling with the data itself , I ’m also trying to figure out what your assumptions about the data are and how they may affect something else I ’m doing .
Make it general .
I ca n’t count how many times I ’ve talked to teams who are building an API for internal use and are “ just going to give people access to that . ”
While that turns out well sometimes , in general your internal product , case - specific logic will end up being more annoying to someone attempting to adopt it .
I was working with an API once that kept returning boolean data in different ways among the different calls , and when I inquired as to why that was , I was told that their iPhone app interpreted the data one way , their internal web services another way , and the Ajax calls they were making a different way .
Of course , I was building something that cross-cut all the calls used by these services , so it made my life incredibly difficult ( I literally eventually built a BooleanParser class or some such silliness to handle all the different states ) .
If you ’re building an API for something internal , then keep it internal ; just because you can offer an API based on some internal thing does n’t mean you should !
Keep your information up to date .
Please .
Please .
I ’m begging you .
The first thing you should do after changing anything in your API is to ask “ Has then been documented and / or covered in our client libraries ? ”
Having your API documentation being out of sync with your actual running API is a death sentence .
This situation is becoming more and more of a problem as more sites are adding API ’s as a second thought rather than a core functionality .
Go ahead and compare your average web application ’s API documentation to someone like Twitter who have made their API a core competency ( though I could offer them as a counter - example to that about 2 years ago… ) .
Even more important is to make sure that the code developers are running and working with jives with what you ’ve got running on your servers .
If the documentation is wrong , that ’s not such a huge deal if I can dig around in your client ’s source and figure out what changed .
But if the client is wrong and the documentation is right ( or both are wrong ) , you ’re going to drive me to Bedlam before I figure out you have n’t updated something .
Keeping your API releases synced with documentation and client releases will go a LONG way to keeping your API users very happy .
Do n’t gimp it .
If you offer an API feature , offer to your clients evenly .
I understand “ premium API features ” and all that jazz make total business sense .
I ’m all about people monetizing their API ’s as much as it makes sense .
Where I think you , as a provider , cross a line is offering certain API ’s only to your in - house , product bound clients and no others .
Not only is it sort of gratingly protectionist to the point of turning off a lot of potential developers , it just does n’t make any sense .
If you ’re going to arbitrarily limit the ability to which I can engage your product via the API , you obviously do n’t want my competition or my contribution to your ecosystem very badly .
I understand limits in terms of not allowing blatant scraping of data or something that ’s core to the viability of your business , but disabling convenient features and neat additions in the name of arbitrary limits is a problem .
Twitter , while being fantastically open in a lot of respects , really put a bad taste in developers ’ mouths with the whole OAuth / XAuth split for example .
Limits like that can easily build up a lot of bad press and kill developer goodwill for very little benefit .
Be prepared for customer service .
As API usage grows , developers will inevitably have questions , requests , problems , and want to chat about their favorite beers from this really cool microbrewery in South Carolina that you just have to try when you get a chance ZOMG .
Many API providers simply tell a couple of their developers to answer all of these inquiries just sort of as they have time between all the Real Important Work™ .
E-mails and support tickets pile up , people get upset , and things explode .
No one wants that .
Instead , be prepared to offer actual customer support .
Even if it ’s one developer whose primary workload is flipped ( answer support inquiries first , fix bugs and add features second ) , then that ’s better than treating your existing developers as second class to building stuff .
Your developers will thank you and sing the praises of your API team all over .
Look no further than Twilio to see this in action ; these guys really get it in terms of working with developers directly to make sure they succeed .
TL;DR
Your API developers will appreciate you at least considering their sanity in how you build and operate your API .
Thanks .

The Hoedown 2011 Experience , Part 1 : Lodging Well , it ’s that time of year again : another Ruby Hoedown coming at you .
Registration is open , so head over and register now before we sell out ( we ’re not THAT far from doing it … ) .
When I started planning this year , I honestly did n’t know if I wanted to do it .
This is the fifth year in a row that I ’ve done this conference ( and the seventh conference I ’ve had a hand in planning over the past few years ) , and it had become a bit of rote repetition for me .
So , like a few years ago when I got bored with charging people , I decided to change it up again .
I started pondering a few things .
First , what makes a great conference ?
Secondly , what makes a great regional conference ?
These are n’t easy questions to answer , especially for someone so close to the experience as I ’ve been for the past few years .
So this year I sat out all conferences save for RailsConf ( and that was because I was speaking ) and MagicRuby ( for obvious reasons ) .
This distance gave me some time to think about it a bit , and I ’ve come up with a couple of core things ( if you do n’t really give a crap about what I think about conferences in general , you can slide down to the part about the hotels ) .
First , it needs to be an experience .
Not just an experience within itself ( i.e. , “ I went to RailsConf and it was what it was . ” ) , but a truly memory - creating , impact - enhancing , honest - to - goodness experience for attendees .
Too many regionals basically try to be a mini-( Ruby | Rails ) Conf .
I was guilty of falling into that for sure : try to shove as many people in as possible , give them what you expect in a conference ( a badge , a t- shirt , a piece of paper telling them what they ’ll hear over the next 2 - 3 days ) , and hope that you can at least muster a good review from the attendees .
I wo n’t point fingers , because I doubt the organizers who I think have fallen into this trap even realize it as a problem , and that ’s OK .
If that ’s how their conferences want to roll and it ’s successful for them , that ’s awesome .
I ’m just tired of trying to do that .
So instead , this year we ’re trying to create a really memorable experience for attendees .
The one conference that I think nailed this was Ruby Fringe .
I attended ( and spoke ) there , and from the very start , everything had a very nice handcrafted approach .
The organizers obviously put a lot of thought into how things progressed and the things that their attendees would see and do during the conference .
That sort of thoughtfulness really matters because people tweeted , blogged , and talked about that conference for years after ( and still do at times ) .
We ’re trying to put that same degree of thoughtfulness into the conference this year , and we hope it shows .
Second , I think regional conferences especially have to play up the “ flavor ” of their region .
I ’m always sort of disappointed when I go to a regional conference and I ’m not wrapped in the culture and experiences of the region it ’s representing .
I ’ve never put much effort into that .
The closest I ’ve come has been the general “ feel ” of the media ( effusing the “ dirty south ” aesthetic that ’s popular in a lot of Southern art these days ) and hosting at the OpryLand one year .
One conference that I think nails this year after year ( I ’ve only been once but heard from others how great it is at this ) is GoRuCo .
From the badge ( which is handwritten by a local graffiti artist ) to the parties ( which are held in totally NYC locales ) , everything screams New York , and it ’s awesome .
We ’re trying to capture that this year .
These few blog posts ( today , tomorrow , and Friday ) will layout some of the things we have in store for everyone this year .
We ’re going FULL NASHVILLE , and everyone knows you never go FULL NASHVILLE .
But we ’re doing it this year , from the food to the venue to the music ( that ’s right ! ) , it ’s going to steep you in the South like we ’ve never done before .
So , let ’s take a look at what we have in store so far …
The Hotels So in the past , we ’ve usually had the conference at a hotel or at the least picked a hotel as “ the ” conference hotel .
This year we ’re sort of doing both .
First , the venue has lodging on - site that ’s nice and super affordable .
Like , $ 40 a night and you wo n’t get accosted by a hooker while staying there nice and affordable .
Now , the arrangements are sort of spartan ( see photo below ) and they were previously a dorm , so the bathroom sharing situation might not be ideal for everyone .
But , they were a freaking dorm .
What does that mean ?
Late night hackfests ?
I think so .
Camaraderie not seen since your college days ?
You betcha .
I ’m going to place a Dean of Nerds in the dorms to plan activities and answer any questions you may have about the conference ( I ca n’t do this but if you ’d like to volunteer , ping me on Twitter or e-mail ) .
I think that people will not only enjoy the price point , but it ’ll create a great environment for cool stuff to happen .
For those of you to whom that does n’t appeal , I plan on staying at the nearby Hilton Garden Inn .
It ’s only about half a mile away , only $ 89 a night , and should prove to be a little more luxurious .
Beyond that , there are more luxurious options if you ’d prefer to travel just a bit further .
Within a mile or so , there ’s a super nice Loews hotel and a great boutique hotel named Hutton Hotel .
My wife and I stayed there about 2 weeks after they opened and it was really chic and interesting ( they used sustainable materials in the construction , so you have bamboo floors , etc. ) .
There are other hotels near that area , too , such as a Doubletree or Hotel Indigo , if those are you thing .
So there you have it .
That ’s our lodging strategy for this year .
Stay tuned for tomorrow ’s post on the food and venue !

Youths who persistently misbehave and intimidate others in their communities should be " harassed themselves " , Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has said .
She said she wanted police in England and Wales to " turn the tables " on those who would not " live by the rules " .
This could include repeated home visits and checks to identify benefit fraud or council and road tax non-payment .
But the government should be " nipping these problems in the bud much earlier " , the Liberal Democrats said .
The party 's home affairs spokesman , Chris Huhne , said " in the most serious cases " it was important for the police and other authorities to " come together and make sure they 're dealing with the problem " .
But he said treating violent and disruptive behaviour with a " heavy hand " did not work , and ministers should adopt " the sort of measures which have been pioneered by Lib Dem councils " to tackle such problems .
Meanwhile , the number of anti-social behaviour orders ( Asbos ) issued in England and Wales has fallen by a third , according to Home Office figures .
In all 2,706 orders were granted in 2006 , the most recent period for which statistics are available , compared to 4,123 in 2005 .
There were proportionally more breaches of Asbos in 2006 , however : 49 % , whereas the total for 2000 to 2005 was 47 % .
' Early intervention '
Ms Smith , speaking in Westminster to an audience of professionals who deal with anti-social behaviour , announced £ 250,000 to fund an " action squad " which will encourage areas to better use such measures .
There could be " no excuse for inaction " while people lived in fear , she added .
If persistent offenders know that they 'll be able to get away with it , then they will , by definition , persistently offend .
They will try it on again and again
Jacqui Smith
Home Secretary Home Office figures suggest that two - thirds of those involved in anti-social behaviour - including vandalism , threatening behaviour and street drinking - abandon it after their first warning .
But 7 % of individuals continued misbehaving even after three encounters with the authorities - " still too many " , Ms Smith said - and police should be paying particular attention to these repeat offenders .
She said she wanted to ensure " the tables were turned on offenders so that those who harass our communities are themselves harried and harassed " .
Those who were being anti-social should also have their road tax , car insurance , TV licence and council tax payments checked , she added .
" That car of theirs : is the tax up to date ?
Is it insured ?
Let 's find out .
Police officers were targeting and disrupting those who cause anti-social behaviour for years until the presence and value of the bobby on the beat was no longer recognised
Jan Berry
Police Federation
" And have they got a TV licence for that plasma screen ?
As the advert says , it 's all on the database .
" And as for the council tax , it should n't be difficult to check whether or not that 's been paid .
And what about benefit fraud ?
Can we run a check ?
" If persistent offenders know that they 'll be able to get away with it , then they will , by definition , persistently offend , " Ms Smith said .
" They will try it on again and again .
" We need to send them a strong message that we 're not having it , there 's no room for that sort of behaviour in our communities and that there are tough sanctions for it . "
She also called for greater help for parents " who struggle to keep their kids under control " and an automatic requirement for courts to consider granting a parenting order - aimed at parents who would not cooperate - whenever they issued an Asbo to a young person .
But Jan Berry , chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales , said there was " nothing new " in the home secretary 's speech .
The proportion of Asbo breaches has risen , although fewer are being issued " Police officers were targeting and disrupting those who cause anti-social behaviour for years until the presence and value of the bobby on the beat was no longer recognised .
" Frontline policing must be carried out by fully attested officers , and not by community support officers who , despite their best efforts , are not respected by the yob element . "
The home secretary urged forces across the country to follow the example of Essex Police , who have mounted an operation to target those who repeatedly cause problems .
They used local intelligence to identify offenders , knocked on their doors and warned them their behaviour would not be tolerated .
They then photographed and questioned them and their friends over the next few days .
" Dramatic " results from the new approach included burglaries , criminal damage and car crime stopping altogether on one estate during the operation and staying at a low level afterwards .
" Those responsible for anti-social behaviour had no room for manoeuvre and nowhere to hide , " Ms Smith said of the operation .
Asbo figures Regarding the drop in the number of Asbos issued , the Home Office believes this could be down to the wider use of " early intervention " procedures by local authorities , police and magistrates .
These include acceptable behaviour contracts , parenting orders and individual support orders which aim to encourage better behaviour .
Shadow home secretary David Davis claimed ministers were , however , " giving up on Asbos " because of " their appalling breach rate " .
" The government 's answer is to replace them with acceptable - behaviour contracts , " he said .
" National Audit Office figures show these are breached by almost two - thirds of under - 18 - year - olds .
The government is repeating the same failed strategy under a new name . "
Martin Narey , the chief executive of children 's charity Barnardo's , said each Asbo issued was " a sign of failure " .
The government needed to introduce methods of " constructive intervention " rather than having an " over - reliance on anti-social behaviour orders on their own " , he added .
" It is important that government panic over their polling unpopularity does not usher a return to Asbo mania . "

An Israeli military expert has said the Olympic opening ceremony in Beijing sparked memories many would rather forget .
Colonel Yehuda Wegman is an expert on military doctrines and Israeli military history .
He said he started watching the ceremony but immediately felt something was wrong .
“ The phenomenon of thousands of people moving together in huge blocks , like a machine operated by one person to serve one purpose , is a phenomenon that history has proven to be associated with regimes we would rather forget ever existed , ” he said .
( Article continues below )
Colonel Wegman found similarities between the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony and the ceremonies held by the Nazi regime .
He quotes from the biography of Hitler ’s Minister of Armaments , Albert Speer .
“ Opposite the giant stages , Speer positioned huge blocks of people dressed in brown and black uniforms who , together , formed an impressive geometric shape …
The spirit of the generation , which was disturbed by the anarchy and disorder , could n’t but watch the scene in great awe . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ The visitors in Nuremberg , including many foreigners , were so impressed they were ready to disregard the repulsive aspects of the regime . ”
Colonel Wegman recently published an article on Ynet–a major Israeli newspaper ’s website .
The article calls the public ’s attention to the dangers the Bejing ceremony represents to the Free World .
“ If this was about a small country like Andorra , then that would n’t have been a reason for concern .
But this is China – a country that accounts for a fifth of the world ’s population and has enormous power and natural resources .
It has the ability to bring into action the ideas that lie behind those ceremonies – ideas of imperialism , intervention and oppression . ”
Colonel Wegman said history is repeating itself .
Colonel ( Res. ) Yehuda Wegmen served for over a decade as a senior instructor of fighting doctrine at the IDF Command and General Staff College .
During the Yom Kippur War he served as an officer in the first reservist battalion to reach the Golan Heights .
Today he develops military instructional methods and writes on military and security matters .

Comment on this article
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Sports fans around the world have been swindled by an international Internet scam which offered thousands of bogus tickets for the Beijing Games , Olympic officials said on Monday .
The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) announced it was taking action to shut down the fraudsters , but the move came too late to help the victims find replacement seats at the Games .
Among those left out of pocket were the families of Olympic athletes in both Australia and New Zealand , with people in the United States , Japan , Norway , China and Britain also reportedly conned by the sophisticated sting .
“ We can not accept people paying money for tickets and not getting them , ” said Gerhard Heiberg , an IOC executive board member .
Heiberg said the issue was raised last week , with both the IOC and the United States Olympic Committee filing a lawsuit on Friday in a district court in California , accusing at least six websites of selling illegitimate or nonexistent tickets .
However , a U.S. lawyer who said he had lost $ 12,000 in the fraud , accused the IOC of complacency .
“ They have known about these sites for months and months and did nothing , ” said Jim Moriarty , the partner of a Houston - based law firm which is looking to represent fellow victims in any subsequent legal actions .
“ They have dashed the hopes and dreams of thousands of people who have been planning for years to go the Games , and have already paid thousands of dollars for airfare and what they thought were legitimate tickets , ” he told Reuters .

STILL UP AND RUNNING
Despite last week ’s IOC suit , one of the sites accused of fraud -- www.beijingticketing.com -- was still operating on Monday , offering seats for numerous events , including Friday ’s opening ceremony , with prices topping $ 2,150 .
The professional - looking site , which carries the official Beijing Games logo , provides a London phone number , which rang dead on Monday , and a U.S. address in Phoenix , Arizona .
Australia ’s Olympic Committee ( AOC ) offered commiserations but no solutions to the scores of Australians left out of pocket .
“ Our sympathy goes to them ... but we certainly are n’t in a position to step in , compensate or find other tickets , ” AOC chief John Coates said on Monday .
“ We warned folk to only deal with authorized ticket suppliers , ” he told a news conference .
The press reported that some Australian nationals had been swindled out of almost $ 45,000 .
Moriarty said one unnamed individual had lost $ 57,000 .
“ The worst thing is that some people do n’t even know yet that they bought tickets that wo n’t arrive , ” he said .
“ Some were told they could pick up the tickets at an office in Beijing , and they wo n’t be there .
My guess is they sold thousands of tickets that do n’t exist . ”
Tickets for events in host city Beijing completely sold out last week , Games organizers said , leaving only seats for competitions in co-host cities still available .
Many tickets are still being offered on the e-Bay auction website , but Australia ’s Coates urged caution .
“ There may be tickets on eBay that are delivered ... but I think it is a great risk .
That would be my message , ” he said .

I just read this article about a company that supposedly got stiffed by the Clintons .
I ’ve read these types of stories about Hilary before .
I do n’t know if her people are cheap , dishonest or just disorganized , but she needs to keep out of the press for this type of stuff .
I ’ve emailed the Top Job Services for an insider perspective on the situation .
Hopefully , we ’ll be hearing from them soon .
Milk Float Corner has Closed

Novel tool that shows root causes of iron imbalance discovered
Tue , 01 Jan 2008 ANI
Washington , August 6 ( ANI ) : U.S. scientists have discovered a novel tool for distinguishing among root causes of iron overload or deficiency in humans .
Reporting their work in the journal Cell Metabolism , University of Utah researchers in Salt Lake City highlighted the fact that iron helps the body produce haemoglobin that enables red blood cells to carry oxygen , but too much iron could bind up and eventually damage organs .
The researchers said that the balance of iron in mammals is controlled by a liver - produced hormone called hepcidin and the iron transporting receptor ferroportin .
Hepcidin binds ferroportin to stimulate its break down , thereby lowering iron export .
While too much hepcidin results in anaemia , too little of it disables the body to get rid of enough iron .
Now , the researchers have identified the critical hepcidin - binding domain ( HBD ) on ferroportin .
According to them , by placing that binding site on a bead , they now have a very specific method for detecting hepcidin levels in human blood .
" We 've identified the hepcidin - binding site .
It will allow the diagnosis of underlying inflammation to distinguish diseases of iron metabolism that stem from hepcidin versus those with other causes , " said Jerry Kaplan , a university researcher .
He said that hepcidin was first known not for its effects on iron but for its antimicrobial action , and that the liver produces more of the hormone in response to inflammatory cytokines as a defence mechanism .
He further said that given that microorganisms need iron , increases in hepcidin that lead to a decline in ferroportin and iron were believed to be antimicrobial .
Kaplan and his colleague Diane Ward have also found that their HBD assay can readily detect variations in serum hepcidin levels due to mutations in genes known to affect hepcidin levels as well as mutations in other genes involved in iron metabolism .
They said that while other tests for hepicidin have been developed , the new assay was unique in that it specifically identifies the hormone 's biologically active form .
They believe that the new assay could also be used in other vertebrates due to remarkable degree of evolutionary conservation of the binding site .
" This test narrows it down to ( active hepcidin ) .
It can help us divine the effects of inflammation on body iron stores , " Ward added .
Apart from that , the researchers have also discovered that human hepcidin binds ferroportin at 37 degree Celcius , but not at four degree Celcius .
It so happens because the hepcidin from humans changes its conformation at low temperatures , they say .

" It will obviously have all its old fans but Jason 's comedy is hugely popular with youngsters so it will open it up to a whole new audience . "
Teh stoopid , it hurts .
By all measures , Martin Luther King Jr. was a true leader .
Barack Obama , on the other hand , is just another politician - one who has demonstrated far more regard for the interests of teacher unions than for the children they are paid to serve , far more regard for the pro-abortion lobby than for the future of the black community , and far less good sense than the average person has when it comes to picking a spiritual mentor .
The positions and values of Senator Obama stand mightily against those espoused , and what 's more , practiced , by Martin Luther King Jr. Based on all these considerations , I think it is quite probable that King , were he alive today , would not vote for Barack Obama .
Oy .
As Matt Yglesias says , perhaps the National Review should leave the divining of political leanings of slain civil rights leaders to conservative rags that were n't around in the 50s and 60s .
You know , the kind that did n't write such racist tripe as Will Herberg 's commentary on King 's Nobel Peace Prize " ' Civil Rights ' and Violence : Who Are the Guilty Ones ? " .
I 'm just sayin ' ...
On a related note , PFAW offers a look back at the way the GOP has tried to continually paint themselves as the non-racists by looking at their origins during the Civil War and ignoring their actions from the 60s forward .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraq will not accept any security agreement with the United States unless it includes dates for the withdrawal of foreign forces , the government ’s national security adviser said on Tuesday .
But the government ’s spokesman said any timetable would depend on security conditions on the ground .
Their differences underscore the debate in Baghdad over a deal with Washington that will provide a legal basis for U.S. troops to remain when a U.N. mandate expires at the end of the year .
But Washington played down calls from Baghdad for a firm withdrawal deadline , saying both sought greater Iraqi security .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Tuesday he expected to pull more U.S. troops from Iraq and stressed any decision to withdraw would be based on the ability of Iraqi troops to take responsibility for security and combat .
On Monday , Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki suggested for the first time that a timetable be set for the departure of U.S. forces under the deal being negotiated , which he called a memorandum of understanding .
National Security Adviser Mowaffaq al - Rubaie appeared to go further on Tuesday .
“ We ca n’t have a memorandum of understanding with foreign forces unless it has dates and clear horizons determining the departure of foreign forces .
We ’re unambiguously talking about their departure , ” he told reporters in Najaf after meeting Iraq ’s top Shi’ite cleric , Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani .
He said he had spoken to Sistani about the U.S. talks , but did not say if the cleric had an opinion on the negotiations .
The revered cleric is routinely briefed on key national issues .
“ I informed the ( clerical leaders ) about some of the advances in the talks ...
There is a big difference in outlook between us and the Americans , ” Rubaie said , adding Iraq ’s 500,000 - strong security forces had greatly improved .
Government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh , speaking on al - Hurra television , said it was an Iraqi demand to know when foreign forces would leave .
“ Will this be through a timetable , a timeframe or time horizon ?
It depends on the situation on the ground .
I think this will determine the dates or will affect whether it is possible to put ( the departure ) under a timetable . ”
A senior Shi’ite official added : “ It is very soon to talk about details .
The talks are in the early stages . ”

U.S. SEES “ SHARED GOALS ”
The Bush administration has always opposed setting any withdrawal timetable , saying to do so would allow militant groups to lie low and wait until U.S. troops in Iraq left .
Gates , speaking to reporters during a visit to the Fort Lewis Army base in Washington state said , “ As the Iraqi security forces get stronger and get better then we would be able to continue drawing down our troops in the future . ”
“ This transition of control and primary responsibility for security is a process that is well under way and , based on everything I ’ve heard , we will be able to continue , ” the Pentagon chief said .
“ However , that really depends on the situation on the ground . ”
Washington was looking for an agreement “ that satisfies both our needs , ” U.S. State Department spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos said .
“ The U.S. government and the government of Iraq are in agreement that we , the U.S. government , we want to withdraw , we will withdraw .
However , that decision will be conditions - based , ” he said .
In a further complication , Iraq ’s deputy parliament speaker Khalid al - Attiya said deputies must approve any deal the Iraqi government reaches and will probably reject the document if American troops are immune from Iraqi law .
It would be virtually unthinkable for the United States to allow its soldiers to be subject to Iraqi law .
Maliki ’s preference for a memorandum of understanding , which could be an attempt to bypass parliament , is in contrast to earlier talks which have all been leading to the signing of a formal Status Of Forces Agreement , or SOFA .
“ Without doubt , if the two sides reach an agreement , this is between two countries , and according to the Iraqi constitution a national agreement must be agreed by parliament by a majority of two thirds , ” Attiya told Reuters in an interview .
Washington has SOFA pacts with many countries , and they typically exempt U.S. troops from trial or prison abroad .
Iraq said last week Washington was showing flexibility on some key issues , including dropping a demand for immunity for private contractors working for the U.S. government .
Control of military operations and airspace are other points of contention , along with the detention of prisoners .
The Pentagon has 146,000 troops in Iraq .
That force level should drop to about 140,000 by the end of July under a planned reduction .
Commanders will then assess security conditions before recommending further troop cuts .

A Briton accused of hacking into secret military computers has lost his appeal against extradition to the US .
Glasgow - born Gary McKinnon was said to be " distraught " after losing the appeal to the European Court of Human Rights .
He faces extradition within two weeks .
The unemployed man could face life in jail if convicted of accessing 97 US military and Nasa computers .
The 42 - year - old admitted breaking into the computers from his London home but said he sought information on UFOs .
Mr McKinnon asked the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg to delay his extradition pending a full appeal to the court against his extradition but his application was refused .
He claimed the extradition would breach his human rights .
' Absolutely devastated '
His solicitor Karen Todner said this had been her client 's " last chance " and appealed to Home Secretary Jacqui Smith to intervene .
Our client now faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot
Solicitor Karen Todner
" He is absolutely devastated by the decision , " she said .
" He and his family are distraught .
" They are completely beside themselves .
He is terrified by the prospect of going to America . "
She added Mr McKinnon had recently been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and would ask for the case to be tried in this country .
" The offences for which our client 's extradition is sought were committed on British soil and we maintain that any prosecution ought to be carried out by the appropriate British authorities , " she added .
" Our client now faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot . "
Mr McKinnon , from Wood Green , north London , was arrested in 2002 but never charged in the UK .
He first lost his case at the High Court in 2006 before taking it to the highest court in the UK , the House of Lords .
Computer nerd
The US government claims he committed a malicious crime - the biggest military computer hack ever .
The authorities have warned that without his co-operation and a guilty plea the case could be treated as terrorism and he could face a long jail sentence .
The former systems analyst is accused of hacking into the computers with the intention of intimidating the US government .
It alleges that between February 2001 and March 2002 , he hacked into dozens of US Army , Navy , Air Force , and Department of Defense computers , as well as 16 Nasa computers .
Prosecutors say he altered and deleted files at a naval air station not long after the 11 September attacks in 2001 , rendering critical systems inoperable .
However , Mr McKinnon has said his motives were harmless and innocent .
He denies any attempts at sabotage .
He said he wanted to find evidence of UFOs he thought was being held by the US authorities , and to expose what he believed was a cover -up .

What are these ?
“ Is this a joke ? ” That seemed to be the question du jour when my phone started ringing off the hook at 6:45 am here in Alaska .
I mean , we ’re sort of excited that our humble state has gotten some kind of national ‘ nod ’ …. but seriously ?
Sarah Palin for Vice President ?
Yes , she ’s a popular governor .
Her all time high approval rating hovered around 90 % at one point .
But bear in mind that the 90 % approval rating came from one of the most conservative , and reddest - of - the - red states out there .
And that approval rating came before a series of events that have lead many Alaskans to question the governor ’s once pristine image .
There is no doubt in my mind that many Alaskans are feeling pretty excited about this .
But we live in our own little bubble up here , and most of the attention we get is because of The Bridge to Nowhere , polar bears , the indictment of Ted Stevens , and the ongoing investigation and conviction of the string of legislators and oil executives who literally called themselves “ The Corrupt Bastards Club ” .
So seeing our governor out there in the national spotlight accepting the nomination for Vice Presidential candidate is just downright surreal .
Just months ago , when rumors surfaced that she was on the long version of the short list , she was questioned if she ’d be interested in the position .
She said she could n’t answer ,
“ until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the VP does every day .
I ’m used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration .
We want to make sure that that VP slot would be a fruitful type of position , especially for Alaskans and for the things that we ’re trying to accomplish up here … . ”
There is no doubt that Palin has fierce territorial loyalties .
When elected governor there was much concern because she came right out and said she would favor her own home town of Wasilla ( where she was mayor ) and its surrounding environs collectively known as “ the Valley ” while leading the state .
And it ’s obvious from her statement that Alaska was on her mind when accepting the VP nod ( see my emphasis above ) .
So what is it that we ’re “ trying to accomplish up here ” ?
Palin is currently in the middle of a controversial gas pipeline project in Alaska .
She ’s favored the ‘ Trans Canada ’ proposal that will run the pipeline through Canada , in effect shipping US jobs over the border .
Many Alaskans , including former governors , have favored the “ All Alaska Route ” .
She is also suing the federal government over listing the polar bears as a threatened species .
The science was even compelling enough to convince the Secretary of the Interior that the bears needed to be listed .
But acknowledgement of this issue , and the potential disruption to development on Alaska ’s oil - rich north slope spurred Palin to attempt to stop the listing .
Does she want to open ANWR ?
Yes .
Every politician in Alaska wants to open ANWR .
It ’s basically a requirement if you ever hope to get elected for anything .
Even Mark Begich , the progressive Democrat running against the indicted Senator and Alaskan institution Ted Stevens , is pro-drilling .
That ’s the sea we swim in up here .
There are a few anti-drilling folks , but you have to look hard to find them , and work hard to have them admit it .
Will all this wash with voters in the ‘ Lower 48 ’ ?
Time will tell .
18 Million Cracks in the Glass Ceiling
It was obvious anyway , but became beat - you - over - the - head - with - a - two - by - four obvious when Palin referenced the ‘ glass ceiling ’ line , that this choice is a blatant pander to women .
I would like to believe that women will actually feel insulted by this .
Yes , it would have been historic if Hillary had gotten the nomination .
It was historic that she made it as far as she did .
Yes , it would be great to have a woman in the oval office , or in the VP slot if they are the right woman … a woman who got there with her own drive , grit , determination , intelligence , skill and merits .
When you ’re hand - picked by a man to win votes simply because you are a woman , that does n’t count , and it does n’t break any kind of ceiling .
Would we have had a Stan Palin as our VP pick ?
No .
So choosing a woman because you think her gender will get votes is insulting .
Governor “ Squeakyclean ” …. or not .
Another focus of Palin ’s introduction today was her reform image .
Listen to John McCain and you ’ll hear about a maverick reformer who took on big oil , took on corrupt Alaska politicians , and whose ethics are unquestioned .
Alaskans really want to like Sarah Palin .
In a state where corruption is the rule , and the same faces keep recycling over and over and over again like a bad dream , a new face , with a promise of reform seemed like a breath of fresh air .
Palin defeated incumbent governor Frank Murkowski ( father of Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski who he appointed to his own Senate seat when he was elected governor ) because he was such an obnoxious , bloviating , downright BAD politician .
This staunchly republican state voted with relief , not having to cross over and vote Democratic , but still able to get Murkowski the hell out of office .
In the general election Palin swept into office running against a former Democratic governor , Tony Knowles , who was capable but came with baggage .
And he represented to Alaskans more of the same , tired old - style politics , and special interests that we have come to loathe .
So , if McCain had made his selection six months ago , the squeaky - clean governor meme would have made a little more sense .
But , Sarah Palin is currently under an ethics investigation by the Alaska state legislature .
The details of this investigation read like a trashy novel , and I suspect that the players will soon have new found celebrity on the national stage .
I ’ll try to explain for all you non-Alaskans who suddenly have good reason to want to know more about Sarah Palin .
For those of you not interested in trashy novels , feel free to skip ahead .
Here it is … what we in Alaska call “ TrooperGate ” .
Sarah Palin ’s sister Molly married a guy named Mike Wooten who is an Alaska State Trooper .
Mike and Molly had a rocky marriage .
When the marriage broke up , there was a bitter custody fight that is still ongoing .
During the custody investigation , all sorts of things were brought up about Wooten including the fact that he had illegally shot a moose ( yes folks this is Alaska ) , driven drunk , and used a taser ( on the test setting , he reminds us ) on his 11 - year old stepson , who supposedly had asked to see what it felt like .
While Wooten has turned out to be a less than stellar figure , the fact that Palin ’s father accompanied him on the infamous moose hunt , and that many of the dozens of charges brought up by the Palin family happened long before they were ever reported smacked of desperate custody fight .
Wooten ’s story is that he was basically stalked by the family .
After all this , Wooten was investigated and disciplined on two counts and allowed to kept his position with the troopers .
Enter Walt Monegan , Palin ’s appointed new chief of the Department of Public Safety and head of the troopers .
Monegan was beloved by the troopers , did a bang - up job with minimal funding and suddenly got axed .
Palin was out of town and Monegan got “ offered another job ” ( aka fired ) with no explanation to Alaskans .
Pressure was put on the governor to give details , because rumors started to swirl around the fact that the highly respected Monegan was fired because he refused to fire the aforementioned Mike Wooten .
Palin vehemently denied ever talking to Monegan or pressuring Monegan in any way to fire Wooten , or that anyone on her staff did .
Over the weeks it has come out that not only was pressure applied , there were literally dozens of conversations in which pressure was applied to fire him .
Monegan has testified to this fact , spurring an ongoing investigation by the Alaska State Legislature .
But , before this investigation got underway , Palin sent the Alaska State Attorney General out to do some investigative work of his own , so she could find out in advance what the real investigation was going to find .
( No , I ’m not making this up ) .
The AG interviewed several people , unbeknownst to the actual appointed investigator or the Legislature !
Palin ’s investigation of herself uncovered a recorded phone call retained by the Alaska State Troopers from Frank Bailey , a Palin underling , putting pressure on a trooper about the Wooten non-firing .
Todd Palin ( governor ’s husband ) even talked to Monegan himself in Palin ’s office while she was away .
Bailey is now on paid administrative leave .
As if this were n’t enough , Monegan ’s appointed replacement Chuck Kopp , turns out to have been the center of his own little scandal .
He received a letter of reprimand and was reassigned after sexual harassment allegations by a former coworker who did n’t like all the unwanted kissing and hugging in the office .
Was he vetted ?
Obviously not .
When he was questioned about all this , his comment was that no one had asked him and he thought they all knew .
Kopp , defiant , still claimed to have done nothing wrong and said to the press that there was no way he was stepping down from his new position .
Twenty four hours later , he stepped down .
Later it was uncovered that he received a $ 10,000 severance package for his two weeks on the job from Palin .
Monegan got nothing .
After extensive news coverage about all this nasty behind - the - scenes scandal , which is definitely NOT squeaky clean , Palin ’s approval ratings fell to 67 % , still high , but a far cry from the 90 % number that ’s being thrown around so glibly by the Republicans today .
Alaskans are quickly becoming disillusioned once again .
“ Executive Experience ”
Before her meteoric rise to political success as governor , just two short years ago Sarah Palin was the mayor of Wasilla .
I had a good chuckle at MSN .
com ’s claim that she had been the mayor of “ Wasilla City ” .
It is not a city .
Just Wasilla .
Wasilla is the heart of the Alaska “ Bible belt ” and Sarah was raised amongst the tribe that believes creationism should be taught in our public schools , homosexuality is a sin , and life begins at conception .
She ’s a gun-toting , hang ’em high conservative .
Remember … this is where her approval ratings come from .
There is no doubt that McCain again is making a strategic choice to appeal to a particular demographic – fundamentalist right - wing gun-owning Christians .
And Republican bloggers are already gushing about how she has ‘ more executive experience ’ than Obama does !
Above is a picture of lovely downtown Wasilla , for those of you unfamiliar with the area .
Behind the Mug - Shot Saloon ( the first bar I visited when I moved to Alaska long ago ) is a little strip mall .
There are street signs in Wasilla with bullet holes in them .
Wasilla has a population of about 5500 people , and 1979 occupied housing units .
This is where your potential Vice President was two short years ago .
Can you imagine her negotiating a nuclear non-proliferation treaty ?
Discussing foreign policy ?
Understanding non-Alaskan issues ?
Frankly , I do n’t even know if she ’s ever been out of the country .
She may ‘ get ’ Alaska , but there are only a half a million people here .
Do n’t get me wrong ….
I love Alaska with all my heart .
I ’m just saying .
I , and all Alaskans will be interested to see how this whole process unfolds .
This is definitely a gamble for McCain , and in my humble opinion , a gift to Obama and to Joe Biden who just got thrown a big hunk of red meat for the vice presidential debate .
This is the wedge - issue , desperate ‘ Hail Sarah ’ pass of the McCain campaign .
Now I ’m off to get some Jiffy Pop .

BBC News , Patna
It 's argued that rats are a good source of nutrition
An official in the Indian state of Bihar has come up with a new idea to encourage low caste poor people to cope with food shortages - rat meat .
The Principal Secretary of the state 's Welfare Department , Vijay Prakash , said that he was advancing his proposal after " much survey and ground work " .
Bihar 's extremely poor Musahar community are rat-eaters by tradition .
The Musahar are on the bottom strata of the caste system with the lowest literacy rate and per capita income .
Less than one percent of their 2.3 million population in Bihar is literate and 98 % are landless .
Delicacy Mr Prakash says his proposals to popularise rat meat eating are intended to uplift their social - economic condition .
People now prefer to eat rat meat instead of chicken or goat as it comes cheaper and is more tasty and healthy
Vijay Prakash
" There are twin advantages of this proposal .
First , we can save about half of our food grain stocks by catching and eating rats and secondly we can improve the economic condition of the Musahar community , " he told the BBC .
According to Mr Prakash , about 50 % of total food grain stocks in the country are eaten away by rodents .
He argues that by promoting rat eating more grain will be preserved while hunger among the Musahar community will be reduced .
He said that rat meat is not only a delicacy but a protein - enriched food , widely popular in Thailand and France .
" Rats have almost no bones and are quite rich in nutrition .
People at large do n't know this cuisine fact but gradually they are catching up . "
However he may find it difficult to popularise such a strategy in a conservative society like Bihar and other north Indian states .
Mr Prakash says that he has recipes to make rat eating a delicacy , which he now wants to distribute to all the hotels in Bihar .
He also wants to encourage rat farming in the same way that poultry is farmed .
While eating rat meat is still stigmatised in urban areas of the country , Mr Prakash says that his research has revealed that it is a popular food item in some parts of Bihar where it is known at roadside hotels by the name of " patal - bageri " .
This is not the first time that the department secretary has come out with such an innovative idea .
Earlier , he proposed to recruit eunuchs as security guards to maternity wards in hospitals .
" Yes , that proposal is in its advance stage and we 'll very soon engage them in various social activities of our department , " he said .
And the welfare secretary 's next plan ?
" I 'll make snake catching popular for the economic value of its venom , " he said .

Hillary Clinton has at her disposal a handful of accounting maneuvers .
HRC ’s reward : Bundle of campaign cash ?
Though Hillary Rodham Clinton racked up more than $ 30 million in debt during her Democratic primary campaign , she could emerge from her loss with a bundle of campaign cash to either play kingmaker or mount another campaign of her own .
At her disposal are a handful of accounting maneuvers — some never before tried in presidential politics — that would render her political debt practically insignificant , while at the same time freeing up $ 24 million in currently off - limits cash , according to interviews with her lawyer and outside campaign finance experts .
Advertisement
Enhancing her flexibility is that all but $ 1 million of her $ 9.5 million in unpaid bills at the end of April was owed to allies and political firms unlikely to cause her legal or political headaches by demanding prompt payment .
In fact , their assumed — but unspoken — cooperation is a key part of the New York senator ’s most likely path to robust campaign finances .
That financial path would go something like this : Reclassify as a contribution most of the $ 11.4 million or more she loaned her campaign , which would be a personal financial hit because she would n’t be able to recoup much of it .
Ask her donors to redirect $ 23.7 million they gave for her presidential general election campaign to her Senate campaign committee .
Meanwhile , try to raise some fast cash — possibly with assistance from her vanquisher , presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama — to pay off vendors who might sue her presidential campaign , leaving “ friendly ” debt to be paid down gradually as she raises money from her Senate perch .
A riskier route would be to ask her general election donors to redirect — or “ redesignate , ” in campaign finance parlance — their general election contributions to Obama ’s presidential campaign as part of a deal under which the Illinois senator would ask his donors to give to Clinton to help her pay down her debt .
The most aggressive approach would be to redesignate the general election contributions to her Senate committee , transfer her debt to the same account , and then use the general election contributions to pay off the debt .
There ’s a budding debate in the campaign finance bar about the legality of such of a maneuver .
Some contend it would amount to illegally “ laundering ” general election contributions to pay off primary election bills .
But others assert a 30 - year - old Federal Election Commission decision regarding “ surplus ” campaign cash allows flexibility in the brave new world of privately financed presidential campaigns .
Clinton ’s own campaign finance lawyer , Lyn Utrecht of Ryan , Phillips , Utrecht & MacKinnon , declined to discuss Clinton ’s plans .
But Utrecht ’s legal analysis , set forth in e-mails to Politico this week , seems to suggest the campaign will take a cautious financial approach .
“ The contributions to the presidential general election ca n’t be used to pay presidential primary debt , because those donors already maxed out to the presidential primary , ” Utrecht wrote .
She also asserted Clinton could not transfer her presidential debt to her Senate committee , an interpretation with which some election lawyers disagree .
But Utrecht said there ’s nothing stopping Clinton from asking donors to redesignate their general election contributions to the Senate account .
There ’s no precedent for that , however , because all previous major - party presidential nominees have participated in a public financing system that bars acceptance of general election contributions .
And there are conflicting opinions about whether Clinton can seek to redesignate general election cash to her Senate campaign .
Michael Toner , a former Federal Election Commission chairman who was the lawyer for Republican Fred Thompson ’s aborted presidential campaign , and Paul Ryan , a lawyer for the Campaign Legal Center , agreed with Utrecht that Clinton can redesignate general election cash to her Senate campaign .
But others question the legality of such a maneuver .
Craig Holman , a campaign finance lobbyist for Public Citizen , and Jason Torchinsky , a lawyer for the failed presidential bid of Republican Rudy Giuliani , both pointed to Connecticut Sen .
Chris Dodd ’s situation as potentially clearing or barring Clinton from steering general election cash to her Senate committee .
Dodd ended his own bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in January and has asked the FEC ( which currently lacks the quorum needed to render official opinions ) for permission to redesignate $ 1.7 million in general election contributions to his 2010 Senate campaign .
“ If the FEC rules ‘ no ’ for Dodd , they would have to also invalidate it for Hillary Clinton , ” said Holman , who called politicians ’ ability to operate two or more campaign committees a “ loophole . ”
Utrecht said Dodd ’s request is “ irrelevant ” because it pertains to his accepting public financing in the primary election , which Clinton declined .
If Utrecht is right , Clinton would have 60 days from the end of her campaign ( it ’s unclear if the clock started ticking when she suspended her campaign Saturday ) to either return general contributions or ask donors to redesignate them to another campaign .
Redesignating cash between committees controlled by a candidate can be quick , since the money never actually has to change hands .
But donors can also decline and instead request a refund .
So there ’s no guarantee donors would oblige if Clinton asks them to redesignate their contributions to Obama ’s presidential campaign , instead of to her Senate campaign or even a potential Obama - Clinton joint campaign , unlikely though that is .
Clinton has until the end of the Democratic convention on Aug. 28 to pay back the $ 11.4 million or more she loaned her campaign .
After that , the bulk of it would become a contribution , and repayment would be limited to $ 250,000 plus interest ( her campaign reported owing $ 16,000 in interest to her at the end of April ) .
During the race , Clinton ’s campaign indicated it would pay off vendor debts before her personal loans , but it also asserted she intended to repay her loans .
The latter transaction is looking increasingly unlikely .
Still , the hit might not sting too badly , because Hillary and Bill Clinton have earned $ 111 million since leaving the White House .
As for the vendor debts , it ’s common for big campaigns , particularly losing ones , to let unpaid bills linger , sometimes for years .
“ I do n’t think the debt is as big of an issue as the media seems to be making it out to be , ” Torchinsky said .
“ Yes , it ’s debt , but there are many campaigns that have carried debt for years without paying it back .
Her debt has no effect on her future campaigns . ”
Bill Clinton ’s 1996 reelection campaign this year reported $ 219,000 in debts , though all of it was disputed .
At the end of April , Giuliani ’s presidential campaign owed $ 3.6 million , while Delaware Democratic Sen .
Joe Biden ’s owed $ 1.2 million .
There ’s no deadline to pay back vendor debts .
But campaigns have to be careful not to let debts stand for too long without paying interest or partial payments , lest they be considered illegal corporate contributions .
Firms that do a lot of work for campaigns understand that complaining to the press or suing over lingering bills are big no -nos sure to get them blacklisted , said David Louis Plevan , an official with Electrum Productions .
( http://www.electrumproductions.com/)
The company staged more than 500 events for Clinton ’s campaign , including her Saturday concession speech at the National Building Museum , and was owed $ 193,000 at the end of April .
“ You try to take as many precautions to protect yourself , ” Plevan said , “ but you have to be flexible with it . ”
Among Clinton ’s top creditors are the firms of a number of her inner-circle allies .
At the end of April , pollster and strategist Mark Penn ’s firm was owed $ 4.8 million , ad - maker Mandy Grunwald ’s was short $ 695,000 , strategist Minyon Moore ’s was due $ 216,000 , Utrecht ’s was owed $ 85,000 and lawyer Bob Barnett ’s was due $ 25,000 .
Moore and Barnett were among three Clinton liaisons reportedly set to meet this week in Chicago with Obama campaign representatives to discuss how the former adversaries could assist one another , including what Obama might do to help Clinton retire her debt .
Contribution limits bar Obama from giving Clinton more than the $ 2,300 maximum donation .
So his main recourse would be appealing to his supporters to contribute to Clinton , and it ’s not clear how they ’ll respond after the brutal primary .
Cash for debt retirement is among the toughest money to raise in politics .
But Clinton ’s position in the Senate and as a party leader could make things easier .
She ’s reportedly hauled in $ 1 million since the final primaries last week .
As her campaign rounded the final bend with dwindling hopes of winning , campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe characterized the mounting debts as a cost of doing business .
“ I ’ve been involved in a lot of debt situations with the Clintons for a long time , ” he told a handful of reporters late last month .
“ It ’s never bothered us before , and it wo n’t bother us in the future . ”
On Wednesday , Joe Lieberman wrote on this page that the Democratic Party he and I grew up in has drifted far from the foreign policy espoused by Franklin Roosevelt , Harry Truman and John Kennedy .
In fact , it is the policies that President George W. Bush has pursued , and that John McCain would continue , that are divorced from that great tradition – and from the legacy of Republican presidents like Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush .
Sen . Lieberman is right : 9/11 was a pivotal moment .
History will judge Mr. Bush 's reaction less for the mistakes he made than for the opportunities he squandered .
The president had a historic opportunity to unite Americans and the world in common cause .
Instead – by exploiting the politics of fear , instigating an optional war in Iraq before finishing a necessary war in Afghanistan , and instituting policies on torture , detainees and domestic surveillance that fly in the face of our values and interests – Mr. Bush divided Americans from each other and from the world .
At the heart of this failure is an obsession with the " war on terrorism " that ignores larger forces shaping the world : the emergence of China , India , Russia and Europe ; the spread of lethal weapons and dangerous diseases ; uncertain supplies of energy , food and water ; the persistence of poverty ; ethnic animosities and state failures ; a rapidly warming planet ; the challenge to nation states from above and below .
Russia freezes all military cooperation with NATO
Russia has informed Norway of its intention to completely cut back its military cooperation with NATO .
The statement was made the next day after the emergency meeting of NATO ministers on the situation in Georgia and South Ossetia .
The ministers agreed not to end their ties with Russia , although the future cooperation would depend on Russia ’s pullout from Georgia .
NATO members did not decline their cooperation with Russia despite USA ’s appeals .
Russia freezes all military cooperation with NATO
A top official spokesperson for Russia ’s Defense Ministry called the Embassy of Norway in Moscow and said that Moscow was planning to freeze all military cooperation with NATO and its allies , Espen Barth Eide , state secretary with the Norwegian ministry said .
Eide told The AP that Russia would soon send a written note of its decision to Norway soon .
Norwegian diplomats were going to meet their Russian counterparts Thursday to clear out the situation .
" It is our understanding that other NATO countries will receive similar notes , " Eide said .
The ministry said the Russian official is known to the embassy , but Norway declined to provide a name or any further identifying information .
Neither Kremlin officials , nor Russia ’s ambassador to NATO , Dmitry Rogozin , made any comments on the report .
US officials described Russia ’s decision as unfortunate .
" If this indeed is the case , it would be unfortunate .
We need to work with Russia on a range of security issues , but we are obviously very concerned about Russian behavior in Georgia , " U.S. State Department spokesman Robert Wood said .
Under a 2002 agreement that set up the NATO - Russia Council , the former Cold War foes began several cooperation projects .
They include occasional participation of Russian warships in NATO counterterrorism patrols in the Mediterranean Sea , sharing expertise to combat heroin trafficking out of Afghanistan and developing battlefield anti-missile technology .
Last week , Russia 's ambassador to NATO Dmitry Rogozin warned the Western alliance against cutting off cooperation , saying it would hurt both sides , the AP reports .
The military cooperation between Russia and NATO ended de-facto upon the initiative of the latter .
A Russia -NATO naval exercise FRUKUS became the first on the list .
The event was supposed to take place in the Pacific Ocean with the participation of the USA , Britain , France and Russia .
Afterwards , the USA barred Russia from a joint anti-terrorist operation Active Endeavor .
Russia ’s sea patrol ship Ladny had to return back to its base in Sevastopol .
The USA decided to cancel US - Russian anti-terrorist exercise slated to take place on August 28 - 30 .
Moscow responded similarly .
On Tuesday Moscow pulled out of Open Spirit 2008 annual exercise .
SÃO PAULO , Brazil 
In an unprecedented move against rogue cattle ranchers in the Amazon , the Brazilian government has seized livestock grazing there illegally , the new environment minister announced Tuesday .
Officials carted off 3,100 head of cattle that they said were being raised on an ecological reserve in the state of Para , in an operation intended to serve as a warning to other ranchers grazing an estimated 60,000 head on illegally deforested land in Amazonia , the environment minister , Carlos Minc , said .
“ No more being soft , ” Mr. Minc told reporters in the capital , Brasilia .
“ Those that do n’t respect environmental legislation , your cattle are going to become barbecue for Fome Zero , ” he said , referring to the government ’s food program for the poor .
Mr. Minc said the cattle would be auctioned in two weeks and the proceeds go to Fome Zero , as well as to health programs for indigenous peoples and to finance cattle removal operations .
What Is the Best and Worst On Hold Song of All Time ?
Nobody likes being on hold , but a good on hold song can make the experience a little bit better .
The perfect hold song might even make you forget you ’re waiting !
The science confirms it : good music on hold can keep customers on the line a lot longer than those who use none .
Similarly , there ’s nothing worse than an annoying , repetitive , or simply bad bit of hold music .
It can straight up make you want to give up on whatever you ’re waiting for , no matter how important it might be .
Here are some of the best and worst call waiting music practices used today :
A Brief History of on Hold Music
The inception of listening to a song on hold came around in 1962 , and it was a total accident .
Inventor Alfred Levy had an issue with his phone lines : whenever he would put someone on hold , a song would play through the phone .
Why ?
The culprit was a loose wire , which was accidentally touching some metal in the building .
This effectively turned Levy ’s building into a receiver , which would pick up the signals of the radio station next door to him .
I guess Levy ’s customers must have been a big fan of this , so in 1966 he patented his discovery and on - hold music was born .
Nowadays , there are much more convenient methods of acquiring and playing music on hold than turning your building into a receiver , but without this little mistake , we may not have music on hold as it is today .
The Best on Hold Songs
There are a few things to consider when finding the perfect music on hold , from genre to artist to general sound .
Everyone ’s music tastes are different so it ’s hard to please everyone , but there are certain rules that make it easier to make a decision .
One avenue to consider is the “ pun ” or using a song that has something to do with holding on .
Popular choices fitting this category are Baby Hold On by Eddie Money and Hold The Line by Toto .
If nothing else , these songs might give you a hardy chuckle while you ’re sitting on the line , and that ’s certainly better than nothing .
If you want to consider genre , there are some interesting avenues to go down .
Classical music is commonly used , but the major setback of any type of music that intricate is the loss of quality .
Therefore , something simple and light is probably best .
Classical is calming , though , and it keeps the customer invested .
It also gives your company a “ professional ” vibe before the customer even gets through the line .
The genre you choose for your hold music should represent your company to a degree .
Oftentimes , it ’s best to just go with something simple and breezy .
The term that comes to mind is muzak , otherwise known as elevator music .
It may not be the most exciting or topical music , but it does the job by appealing to a wide audience and not suffering too much from quality loss .
Plus , using licensed music can get expensive , and is n’t an option for some companies .
It ’s best to avoid using anything licensed and popular without permission .
No hold music is worth getting sued over .
The Worst on Hold Songs
There are a lot of bad choices for hold music , and a lot of bad choices you can make .
The worst choices are something alienating , or niche .
Rap music is often a risky one as it can be seen as too “ aggressive ” , and anything vulgar is a definite no -no .
Beyond price , radio hits are a bit of a deadly choice , as you run the risk of playing something over - saturated .
You may love the latest Taylor Swift track , but after the millionth time hearing it literally everywhere you ’re running the risk of someone getting annoyed and hanging up .
Classic rock or oldies are often a better choice , as they ’re heard less but are still familiar to most .
Bad quality can make bad hold music even worse , especially for newer or more intricate songs .
It also does n’t get much worse than music on loop , or anything overly repetitive .
Sometimes silence is preferable to hearing the same sound over and over again , so make sure you ’re giving the customer something interesting to listen to .
You might be tempted to use a company jingle or tune for hold music too , but this should be done tactfully .
Some people do mix in a message , ad , or something related to the company while the customer is holding , but your hold ca n’t be all company - related .
The customer know why they ’re waiting , they do n’t need to be reminded .
Some of the worst choices for hold music would be yodeling , Crazy Frog , or anything from the Limp Bizkit catalog .
Any polarizing artist is risky , so even top artists like Justin Bieber or Cardi B can be bad options despite their radio play .
Keep it simple , upbeat , and fresh and you ’re on the right track .
Why You Should Use a Good on Hold Song
There are some legitimate benefits to using the right hold music , including a boost in retention rate , and even giving the customer the perception that they ’ve waited less time on the line .
If you want to be the true king of hold music , some services even allow the customer to skip a song by pressing a button .
Now that ’s a considerate move .
If you ’ve got good hold music , it shows you ’re thinking about every little aspect of your business right down to the time on hold , and that reassures a customer that they ’re making the right choice calling you .
Thank You for Holding
Hold music is something you might not think twice about , but it would be a mistake not to consider it .
A good on hold song can keep your customers entertained and on the phone , and in the end that ’s what it ’s all about , is n’t it ?

At the Wall Street Journal : Why Is Bush Helping Saudi Arabia Build Nukes ?
Here ’s a quick geopolitical quiz :
What country is three times the size of Texas and has more than 300 days of blazing sun a year ?
What country has the world ’s largest oil reserves resting below miles upon miles of sand ?
And what country is being given nuclear power , not solar , by President George W. Bush , even when the mere assumption of nuclear possession in its region has been known to provoke pre-emptive air strikes , even wars ?
If you answered Saudi Arabia to all of these questions , you ’re right .
Last month , while the American people were becoming the personal ATMs of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was in Saudi Arabia signing away an even more valuable gift : nuclear technology .
In a ceremony little - noticed in this country , Ms. Rice volunteered the U.S. to assist Saudi Arabia in developing nuclear reactors , training nuclear engineers , and constructing nuclear infrastructure .
While oil breaks records at $ 130 per barrel or more , the American consumer is footing the bill for Saudi Arabia ’s nuclear ambitions .
Saudi Arabia has poured money into developing its vast reserves of natural gas for domestic electricity production .
It continues to invest in a national gas transportation pipeline and stepped - up exploration , building a solid foundation for domestic energy production that could meet its electricity needs for many decades .
Nuclear energy , on the other hand , would require enormous investments in new infrastructure by a country with zero expertise in this complex technology .
Have Ms. Rice , Mr. Bush or Saudi leaders looked skyward ?
The Saudi desert is under almost constant sunshine .
If Mr. Bush wanted to help his friends in Riyadh diversify their energy portfolio , he should have offered solar panels , not nuclear plants .
Saudi Arabia ’s interest in nuclear technology can only be explained by the dangerous politics of the Middle East .
As a relatively tall person , I know that excessive height means struggling to find fashionable shoes that fit and fighting sneeze guards at salad bars .
Here are the stories of several people way taller than me , the good they 've done with their extreme height , and the problems encountered along the way .
Sandy Allen
Until her death on August 13 , Sandy Allen was verified by Guinness Book of World Records as the world 's tallest woman — over 7 - feet , 7 - inches — a record she held since 1976 .
She initially contacted Guinness in order to meet someone her own height .
" It is needless to say my social life is practically nil , " she wrote , " and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life . "
Indeed , she became a public figure , appearing in the Guinness Museum of World Records in Ontario and making speaking appearances for youth and church groups .
She turned her experiences into a book ( Cast a Giant Shadow ) , appeared in many film projects , and was the subject of a 1982 Split Enz song .
Robert Wadlow
Robert Pershing Wadlow of Alton , Illinois , is the tallest person in recorded history .
Everyone in his family was of average height , and Robert was a standard size when he was born .
His height is attributed to hypertrophy of his pituitary gland , which created an excess of human growth hormone .
At the time of his death , he was a staggering 8 - feet , 11 - inches tall , and he would have continued to grow due to his medical condition .
Wadlow received a scholarship and planned to become an attorney , but his size made college difficult .
Pens and pencils were hard to grasp , and the icy Illinois winters made him fear a fall while walking between academic buildings .
After a year of college , he joined the circus and later became a goodwill ambassador for the International Shoe Company .
He and his father toured the west coast , and the nation became enamored with the Alton Giant .
In 1940 , Wadlow did n't notice that he had developed a blister from his leg braces .
This led to a lethal infection .
His funeral attracted more than 30,000 mourners — he was buried in a half - ton coffin that was interred within a vault of solid concrete to deter vandals and thieves .
His family had all of his belongings destroyed in order to prevent collectors from displaying them as freak show items .
Many life size figures and statues of Wadlow have been erected across the country .
Yao Defen
Defen may be approved by Guinness as the world 's tallest woman in the near future , as she claims to stand 7 - feet , 8 - inches tall .
Though she was scouted as a potential athletic superstar in China , she proved to be too weak due to health problems caused by acromegaly ( a condition where the pituitary gland continues to produce growth hormone well after puberty , usually caused by a tumor ) .
Illiterate and in need of money to support her aging parents , she became a circus performer and traveled with her father .
After he died , she was severely mistreated by the circus manager , who denied her medical treatment and bullied her into contract extensions .
A British documentary crew discovered Defen impoverished , malnourished and in failing health .
They filmed a special about her for The Discovery Channel and were able to arrange free medical care from two leading acromegaly specialists .
The doctors established a website for her , and thanks to many generous donors , enough money has been raised to provide Defen with proper living conditions and nutrition .
Once her health stabilizes , she will undergo surgery to remove the remainder of her pituitary gland tumor , which is making her go blind .
Gheorghe Muresan
No list of tall people would be complete without a basketball player .
Romanian Gheorghe Muresan is the tallest NBA player of all time , a hair above the previous record holder , Manute Bol .
Muresan 's height is attributed to a pituitary disorder .
His professional career was often derailed by injuries , and he was sent back to the European league after one season in the NBA .
Muresan overcame his ailments , returned to the NBA and was named Most Improved Player in 1995 .
He completed his career with a per-game average of 9.8 points and 6.4 rebounds , and a .573 field goal percentage .
After retiring from basketball in 2000 , Muresan dabbled in acting , playing a ventriloquist in Eminem 's " Slim Shady "  video and the title role in the film My Giant .
Bao Xishun
Mongolian herdsman Bao Xishun was listed as the world 's tallest living man until August 2007 .
He is only 7 - feet , 9 - inches tall , but has no known growth disorder .
He played basketball for the army , but severe rheumatism forced him to quit .
He returned to Inner Mongolia and became a greeter at a local restaurant and drew the attention of the media , who wrote to Guinness on his behalf .
Though Leonid Stadnik quickly surpassed his record , Xishun is still a hugely popular figure .
In December 2006 , he used his extra long arms to remove dangerous shards of plastic from the bellies of two dolphins .

Leonid Stadnyk
Ukranian veterinarian Leonid Stadnyk may be the tallest living person , standing at an impressive height of 8 - feet , 5 - inches .
For years , Stadnyk refused to be officially measured because of his desire to live a quiet life .
Like Yao Defen , he was the subject of a documentary by The Discovery Channel and received treatment from specialists .
Stadnyk 's excessive growth began after brain surgery when he was 14 years old .
After the surgery , he developed acromegaly and continued to grow until he was in his mid-30s , when his tumor naturally disappeared .
His height forced him to give up his job as a veterinarian after suffering frostbite on his feet — he was unable to afford the specially - made shoes .
Like many people with acromegaly , Stadnyk 's health is deteriorating at a young age , and he is currently suffering from heart and foot problems .
His height keeps him confined to his tiny village .
He once said , " Taking a public bus for me is the same as getting into a car 's trunk for a normal person . ''
However , his life seems to have improved at least slightly since he claimed the world height record ; he has received many gifts , including an extra large bicycle and a computer with internet access .
Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko even gave him a car .
To relax , Stadnyk cultivates exotic plants and pampers his tiny blue and yellow parakeet .
NOTE : Stadnyk has repeatedly refused to be measured by Guiness officials ; he was originally awarded the title of world 's tallest person based on a letter from his doctor .
But Guinness has made their guidelines more strict and will no longer accept non-Guinness measurements for submission .
Bao Xishun will once again be coronated as the world 's tallest man when the 2009 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records is released in September .
[ In case you were wondering , the above photo is Stadnik with Ukranian President Viktor Yushchenko . ]

This could be the mother load .
The fact that bush - cheney - rove etc could have access to all Congressional computers explains more than a lot .
Like some others who post on Raw Story who never accepted the IMPEACHMENT off the table for Bush 's multiple high crimes and misdemeanors from Congressional leaders because of the " not enough votes " excuse or " the dem - rep family division " excuse or simply pointing to the clock in the middle of the game .
Excellent exposition of a completely manipulated system that has been basically executed in secrecy .
With all official departments and or branches corrupted by this destructive criminal regime , this case illustrates how this corrupted regime could perpetuate itself by 1 . evading discovery and 2 . continuing their reign of terror unhitched by never investigating themselves let alone 3 . ever finding themselves guilty of anything .
Thank you and look out for another outbreak of White Alqueda anthrax that has n't occurred since October 2001 .
That was Bush - Cheney post 9 - 11 false flag war games on the homefront for controlling opposition who threatened their plans .

As one of the nine Regional Coordinators for the Green Party Ohio Recount , I always knew there was more there than we could uncover at the time .
MUCH more .
But even though all this is terrific , one comment on Spoonamore what said --- ... You set up a bunch of grandmothers to put together a bunch of computers once every two years ...
I 've been a pollworker for MANY years and I am nobody 's grandmother .
Please can't we expose election fraud and fight for election integrity without hurling backhanded insults at pollworkers ?
( and grandmothers ? )
Regardless of age , pollworkers are not generally the cause of these problems .
The real culprits are corporations like Triad , Diebold , and ES&S alongside corrupt insider officials like Blackwell and Rove .
Incidentally , Avi Rubin is also a pollworker and I do n't think he is anyone 's grandmother either .

The fact that McCain is married to the Phoenix mob ( an important branch of the Lansky - Bronfman organized crime syndicate , ) indicates that he probably has , in place , sufficient operatives to steal the 2008 election , already .
At the moment it looks as though the Campaign is going to be a total fraud and scam , designed to allow the theft of the election by the Bush gang , whose connections to organized crime have been carefully hidden , but are merely a continuation of the marriage of the Republican Party and the Mob that has been a scandal since the time of Richard Nixon , no matter how carefully swept under the rug .
Since most of the Federal judges have been appointed by that same Bush gang , just how do you expect to clean out this Augean Stable ?
Obama may think he has a good chance to become President , but the fix is in .
Unless a miracle happens , it 's another stolen election , another totally corrupt Republican President , and the END of the United Sttates as an honest broker in International relations , as well as a total impoverishment of its citizens .
Permanent war , and turning over of the country to the drug lords as we amalgamate with Mexico and Canada , seems to be in the cards .

Someone also needs to check into FL in 2004 ...
There was a " Supposed Bomb Threat " ( a suspicious legal size envelope at the front door )
Which closed the RA Gray Bldg .
This is the Bldg. which houses the Div. of Elections .
Which is where all the electronic voting results are uploaded to .
The supposidly suspicious pkg. was discovered in the early morning the day prior to the General Election .
And Bush was polling behind in FL as was Mel Martinez who was polling behind Betty Castor .
I in my soul know that something was up with this particular incidence .
We have bomb threats at many bldgs such as the Supreme Court , the Federal Court the County Court , the Capitol , etc. all of the time , here in Tallahassee .
But , this one at the RA Gray Bldg. was different .
The usual Bomb squad was not the team that was at the bldg .
I for one was so suspicious that I actually called Tad Devine who was the chief advisor to the Kerry campaign ( I worked on a US senate campaign with him , ) the day after to election .
I got Tad 's voice mail ... and never heard back from him .
But , something was very wrong with the circumstances that morning in Nov. 2004 !

This is a case of Mulder saying " I Want to Believe " --- and I do .
But I am having difficulty with the theory of the crime .
It seems to me that penetrating the Rapp family and its operatives should have and would have been a lot easier , or that someone in the know ( about the commission of the crime ) would have come forward by now .
It seems to me you are talking about lots of witting accomplices driving all over Ohio replacing hard drives and booting up faulty ballot counts .

Does it seem like we 've reached a critical mass here ?
I do n't know .
I gotta be honest , I have about lost hope in America .
Maybe it's the fact that I live in Central Ohio , and voted that day .
I went to bed believing .
We all know how that went .
So here 's one for you .
I returned to vote in 2006 and my name was missing from the rolls .
I 've voted in the same school gym for 11 years now .
No redistricting , no nothing .
All the sudden I do n't exist .
Probably just me being paranoid , but damn it , there 's so much reason to be paranoid these days .
I voted provisionally .
The Ohio primary ?
My name restored .
Weird huh .
Anyway I 'm just one person , why the hell would it matter if I was n't listed ?
Why would anyone bother ?
I do n't know .
Bottom line ?
There 's a lot of truth out there somewhere .
It would be interesting to find it .

Either someone butchered the facts , I have a reading comprehension problem , or Spoonamore is full of shit .
If so , it would be the second time he 's issued a non-credible statement .
He did an exceptionally unsophisticated and factually challenged press release a while back .
Check his credentials more carefully please .
I think he was a filmmaker before he assigned himself " most expert security guy " status .
The specifics on the clockfix file would indicate that either he never looked at it or the details were misreported .

That article does n't provide any history on Spoonamore , just reiterates his claim that he is an expert , which I STILL have not seen solid corroboration on .
The Rebecca Abrahams name on that article is interesting .
She popped up in connection with Spoonamore 's previous non-credible press release .
It may be that the game plan this fall will be to muddy up the waters , suckering in prominent figures in the election reform community and providing just enough disinformation that , when they stick their head in the honey pot to eat that information up , their error can be used to taint them later on .
Exactly like they did to Dan Rather , but going after the currently credible Internet bloggers .
I 'm not here to attack anyone , but I 've seen enough to throw up a cautionary flag on this .
I have no comments about any of the other Ohio information .
I like Fitrakis et. al , hope they will watch their backs .

Natl Journal does huge story on cyber security and cites expert Stephen Spoonamore .
OK , so should we believe Bev or the National Journal ???
Oh Bev , BTW , Brad was an actor before he became a blogger .
China 's Cyber - Militia http://www.nationaljourn...ine/cs_20080531_6948.php
National Journal - Washington , DC,USA
May 30 , 2008 Stephen Spoonamore , CEO of Cybrinth , a cyber - security firm that works for government and corporate clients , said that Chinese hackers attempt to map the IT networks of his clients on a daily basis .
He said that executives from three Fortune 500 companies , all clients , had document - stealing code planted in their computers while traveling in China , the same fate that befell Gutierrez .
Spoonamore challenged U.S. officials to be more forthcoming about the breaches that have occurred on their systems .
“ By not talking openly about this , they are making a truly dangerous national security problem worse , ” Spoonamore said .
“ Secrecy in this matter benefits no one .
Our nation ’s intellectual capital , industrial secrets , and economic security are under daily and withering attack .
The oceans that surround us are no protection from sophisticated hackers , working at the speed of light on behalf of nation - states and mafias .
We must cease denying the scope , scale , and risks of the issue .
I , and a growing number of my peers believe our nation is in grave and growing danger . ”

Brad himself relied on Spoonamore two years when he was instrumental in breaking the release of the Pentagon Papers of evoting , the unredacted SAIC report on Diebold machines .
https://bradblog.com/?p=3731
Both Rebecca and Sponnamore were involved with that SAIC release , so were they trolls , working on behalf of the WH or ABC to create a smokescreen ?
Is having a GOP cyber expert not an asset or is just the fact that Spoonamore is a Republican reason to believe that he is a plant to discredit the evoting community ?
Arnebeck 's suit in OH does not at all depend on Spoonamore .
His filings do not even mention him .
Spoonamore was simply asked to tell the press that in his opinion as a cyber security expert who chases bad guys every day , the data from the 2004 election should have led to a criminal investigation and if the people involved with that election are not held to account , the 2008 election will also be manipulated .
So Bev , what is wrong with that ?
What are you trying to imply when you say to watch their backs ?
That they have been duped into going after the bad guys ?
That they should not pursue this legal case ?
That Spoonamore is somehow going to manipulate the best election lawyers in the country to make claims that are not supported by the facts .
Arnebeck wants to take targeted discovery / depositions from bad guys to ask questions that have never been answered .
He believes that that will lead to a RICO filing against the bad guys .
That discovery does not in any way depend on Spoonamore or you or anyone in the election integity community .
If the discovery determines that no one did anything wrong then we can all celebrate that our elected leaders have protected our vote .
But neither you nor Arnebeck believe that .
Instead , he believes that people under oath will talk and our elections will be safer as a result .
That is what you have been advocating for years and he deserves your support rather than some whisper campaign designed to undermine .

Arnebeck 's suit in OH does not at all depend on Spoonamore .
As I said , I am a fan of Fitrakis and the other folks .
And as I said , my comments pertained to Spoonamore 's alleged examination of the Georgia patch .
The analysis of the clockfix patch shows someone did not do their homework and you 've gotta wonder why a guy who touts himself as an internationally renowned security expert would put his name on an analysis that mixes things up .
So Bev , what is wrong with that ?
What are you trying to imply when you say to watch their backs ?
That they have been duped into going after the bad guys ?
No .
That they need to be careful about forming links with any person who puts out incorrect information .
Do n't put words in my mouth .
Most of your speculations about my motivation , " racehorse " , are just making up things in your own imagination .
Arnebeck wants to take targeted discovery / depositions from bad guys to ask questions that have never been answered .
Outstanding .
Has nothing to do with Spoonamore and the Georgia patches .
He believes that that will lead to a RICO filing against the bad guys .
Which would be outstanding , and high time for it !
That discovery does not in any way depend on Spoonamore or you or anyone in the election integity community .
Which is why I say they should watch their backs , because there will be people shoe - horning their way in , not always credible people , and that can taint the process .
he deserves your support rather than some whisper campaign designed to undermine .
If I was whispering , I would n't use my real name and I would n't publish information publicly .
And it 's not I who is undermining .
I 'm saying , watch out for coattail - hangers bearing so - called gifts .
Wonder how Spoonamore ended up in that press conference at all --- whether he maneuvered himself in , or they asked him .
No matter .
The short story on Spoonamore and the Georgia patches is that he appears to have both his timelines and his patches mixed up , which components of the system were patched , and when .
His analysis of the clockfix patch references a GEMS patch .
( clockfix was for the touchscreens , and did n't happen until later . )
If he actualy looked at the clockfix patch , he would know that it's for CE , and the language file patches are for the GEMS server , which was running on NT .
That 's pretty hard to miss , and that kind of gaffe looks pretty embarrassing to me .
As in , he never even looked at the clockfix patch at all .
Instead , he looked at the robgeorgia patch , which was not a clockfix and was implemented before the clockfix problem surfaced .
And further , he 's blabbing on about the auditory language files and fails to mention the elephant in the room , that robgeorgia replaces Accubasic files , which are the files identified in all the studies as the tampering mechanism .
There now .
I 've provided enough information for someone to climb out of the hole they just dug themselves into .

The information in that story was incorrect .
Would you rather it gets a life of its own and sails all over the blogosphere ?
Agree that the Georgia issue has waylaid this post , bear in mind that it is hijacking and headlining the more important posts about the Ohio actions .
That 's happening now all over the Internet .
Please remove the libel by whats - is - face , Brad , unless the guy wants to back it up with proof point by point .
He can't , because it 's the same old pack of lies .

Bev ,
If you are going to lie , at least do so convincingly .
No one is backing away with anything relating to the Raw Story article .
What you have done is conflate Brad 's article with the Raw Story article and then went on to make allegations which are false .
First of all , Raw Story interviewed the whistle - blower who provided the chain of custody on the patch .
Spoonamore made his own allegations public , which is why we also included the audio in our story .
As to whom I did or did not interview , not you or Cliff is privy to that .
Now , if you have actual issues with my article , I suggest you list them from my article .
You are and continue to be one of the most dubious people in this entire movement .
But because you actually are now claiming to have knowledge regarding my story and are now spreading lies about me ( I think you called that libel ? ) , then I thought I would come and address you myself .
I have also seen the copies of your list serve emails claiming that the entire story is a lie and implicating both Brad and myself in fabrication .
That is something that I believe is also called libel .
So , if you have issues with my story , then point them out nice and clear and word for word so we can all see just what it is your are so busy whining about .
And then you wonder why no one thinks you are reliable ?
This is why Bev .
This vanity kick you are on and your unethical behavior towards others when all you want is attention .
You got my attention , so make it count , because it will be the last time you will ever have my attention again .
Larisa Alexandrovna PS
I wonder why it is that Cliff and the others did not include you in the prepping for the presser or in all of the discussions that many of the credible leaders of election issues were part of ?
Do n't you think it strange Bev ?

I 've still got all the emails , links to posts as well .

Good words John , Heller 's story is about the Arnebeck strategy which is brilliant in its power and simplicity .
Maybe Larisa got her info from a whistleblower other than Spoonamore and then heard Spoonamore say something related at the Ohio press conference .
If so , the story was double sourced .
Larisa is one of the best reporters out there and so let 's give her the benefit of the doubt and wait to see what she follows this up with .
It looks to me like an opening salvo on her part and I would not be surprised if she comes out swinging in a few days with more on this issue that will put a lot of this stuff to rest .

... Bev Harris said on 7/19/2008 @ 4:29 pm PT ...
John ,
Any time we can get any of these guys on the record or under oath it is tremendous .
Carefully reading the article here by Steve Heller , it looks like Connell is still in the " hostile " camp .
But any of these guys --- ANY of them under oath and the whole thing could go nuclear .
So I wish I could put the following in tiny , tiny print because it is not germane to the Ohio story , as you point out , John .
And it 's the last I have to say on this .
Follow the links , download the actual patches , it 's all clearly documented and provable .
Larisa asked for the specific issues with the RawStory reporting .
I will quote the parts that are a problem and yes , the way they are reported , are not true .
That does n't mean I 'm calling anyone a liar , it just means RawStory got the facts wrong .
This first part is Chris Hood , who is for some reason still being treated as an anonymous whistleblower even though he 's gone public and most of his information was published quite a while ago by Robert Kennedy Jr. :
" The first red flag went up when the computer patch was installed in person by Diebold CEO Bob Urosevich , who flew in from Texas and applied it in just two counties , DeKalb and Fulton , both Democratic strongholds .
The source states that Cox was not privy to these changes until after the election and that she became particularly concerned over the patch being installed in just those two counties .
"
That is interesting and does not jive with the facts , which are that the clockfix patch was applied to all 22,000 voting machines in all counties .
Also , Cathy Cox is on the record as knowing about it , because her office issued a press release about it in fall 2002 , about 6 weeks before the election .
The facts are that there were two kinds of patches , a clockfix patch which was applied to all the touchscreens , and a GEMS patch .
Each of these two kinds of patches had more than one permutation .
This is clearly documented in the Diebold memos , and the whole kit and caboodle is documented here :
http://www.bbvdocs.org/h...tory/georgia-patches.pdf including actual copies of the patches .
What is very interesting is that maybe the " two county " scenario explains the existence of the GEMS patch .
That was not a clockfix patch , though .
The RawStory article goes on to say : " The whistleblower said another flag went up when it became apparent that the patch installed by Urosevich had failed to fix a problem with the computer clock , which employees from Diebold and the Georgia Secretary of State ’s office had been told the patch was designed specifically to address . "
This is mixing up two issues .
The clockfix patch went onto all the voting machines .
The two - county explanation does n't jive with the facts , which are that there was a clockfix patch put on machines all over the state .
But I think it might explain the GEMS patches , which Georgia officials have never explained at all .
Than the article says : " the whistleblower approached Spoonamore because of his qualifications and asked him to examine the Diebold patch . "
Okay , so this has Spoonamore examining the patch .
But which patch ?
I think , based on what Spoonamore is reported to have said , he did not examine the clockfix patch .
Here 's why :
The article says : " Individuals close to Arnebeck 's office said Spoonamore confirmed that the patch included nothing to repair a clock problem .
Instead , he identified two parallel programs , both having the full software code and even the same audio instructions for the deaf . "
Yes , well that 's not the clockfix patch .
That 's the GEMS patch .
The GEMS patch contains the extra programs containing audio instructions ( which would be for the blind , by the way , not the deaf ; the deaf would n't be able to hear audio instructions ) .
The GEMS patch also contains instructions to replace the ACCUBASIC files .
The clock problem was on the touchscreens .
You would n't fix it with a GEMS patch .
The audio files were on the GEMS patch .
You would n't find that on the clockfix patch , which was an nk.bin file .
The clockfix nk.bin file basically is like reinstalling windows , but customized for Windows CE on the touchscreen .
nk.bin rewrites the whole ball of wax , and is consistent with fixing a clock problem .
What Spoon examined was not the touchscreen CE file , it was the GEMS robgeorgia file or it's little brother , the GEMS 6 - 28 file .
So basically , Spoonamore was n't looking at the clockfix patch .
Maybe I 'm the only one who cares whether these details are precisely reported , but I do worry about it , because it 's so easy to debunk .

Bev , I know you 're a stickler when it comes to complete accuracy , and sometimes others might feel offended by it , but I understand it , and where you are coming from , first hand .
I remember when we were working behind the scenes nailing therealrobp , aka Diebold 's Robert Pelletier .
I knew I had him , especially when you beat me to the punch by coming up with his and his wife 's address ... but still , you were insisting that everything must be ironclad , and you drove to his house with Kathleeen and took photos , including the yellow car , and then days later , you drove to the Diebold parking structure , and filmed the same yellow car entering the structure .
Now THAT is completing the work , and making something 100 % ironclad .
I remember before you took your two fieldtrips that I was positive I had nailed him , and part of my various feelings were a little hurt because you were n't quite sold ... but you were right , we had to close the deal , you went out there and did it , and then released the result of all our hard work - a 100 % ironclad expose ' that " the trolls " came out from the woodwork to try and debunk , including AnonymousArmy .
You did great !
And Larisa , if you are still around , I also have the emails about the crap you said about this expose ' , and about Bev .
She was a hero , and she relentlessly pursued the story until it was 100 % ironclad .
I 'm sure that is an example of something you wish you could take back .
We 've all been there , we 're all humans with flaws , we 've all jumped off the deep end prematurely , and no matter how hard we try , we might again someday .
But we 're all better people for what we 've done , whatever the scope and size .

Bwahahaha hah .
Hey there it is in print .
It must be true ...
Right ?
Hmmm , there sure seemed like an awful lot of information and anachronisms and such were just crammed into that ( Spoonamore ) rah rah story .
Somebody crawls out of the intelligence community and that instantly makes them credible ?
Sheesh , how stupid do you think people are ?

Good morning everyone , Glad to see a consensus is forming here - solidarity is very critical , in my opinion .
Connell is the story .
Spoon is now a player in the story , and based on my private discussions over the past day , he 's a legitimate player , and we should all be glad he 's chosen the path he is now on .
All the cards are now in play , and it 's time to watch how the hand is played out .
Arnebeck has the lead .
Here is another good link for background information on Connell and company .

Issuing conclusions on the wrong patch does little for the credibility of the election reform community or anyone else .
This is not a minor matter and I am dead certain that Hursti would not have made this error .
Nor would Dr. Hugh Thompson .
I repeat , it 's the second sloppy set of conclusions from Spoon .
Legitimate or not , he 's issuing political conclusions based on sloppy work .
I realize that there are two different paths on this stuff :
One , political and partisan , ends justify the means , details not so crucial .
The other , on behalf of the people themselves without regard to politics , getting facts , facts , facts and rebuilding democracy brick by brick .
I believe where we diverge is in the belief that a particular political party automatically means that democracy will be rebuilt on behalf of the people .

Decide for yourself .
Here is Spoonamore 's factually problematic and very political ( pro-DEMOCRAT ) press release from Nov. 2005 .
http://www.bbvforums.org...ms/messages/8/13057.html
It is my understanding that none of the other computer scientists gave permission to use their names in the release .
I know for a fact that Thompson demanded retraction of his name .
I heard --- you can call that whispering if you like --- that Rubin and Dill did too .
Link to the release , which was posted Nov. 2005 : ( By the way , does this sound like a Spoonamore 's a Republican ???? )
Press release Nov. 2005 : " Steven Spoonamore , President , Cybrinth , Inc. Phone : 646 351 2255 “ 1 . Voting Tabulators are where the primary hacks are happening , especially in counties where the Republican is already expected to win .
2 . Incidence of hacks increases with the level of GOP partisanship and how much control that partisan GOP has over the voting .
Also a high correlation with prominent Christian Right anti-abortion operatives .
3 . Watch the suspect counties carefully .
Usually they start counting and have some strange malfunction ( Power outage , " Humidity Malfunction " , Computer Error , Terrorist Threat ect . )
They often times need to have a technician " reset " the machines , and whether it is done by a technician or remotely , they need some reason so the tabulator with the force balancer can finish counting much later than other counties , you have big cause to worry .
The total number of which is known , then " breaks " in favor of the GOP .
‘ Force Balancers ’ need to know the total number of votes they have force BEFORE they begin forcing .
And only the last county , or couple of counties doing that can do that as they have to know starting ratios and intended finishing ratios .
4 . If the Democrat leads across the state , and then suddenly the last counties have huge returns in favor of the Republican , those hard drives should be obtained and searched .
Even if they install and erase the code it will still be there until a deep wipe is done . ”

I 've already conveyed this privately ... now I 'll post it publicly .
By " legitimate player , " I meant that he IS a player ... not that he IS legitimate .
Fact is , the more some folks did tonight , the odder things appear .
Is Spoon a Republican ?
According to this link , there 's a Stephen Spoonamore in NY who gave over $ 1700 to Howard Dean 's campaign in 2004 .
It says there that he is an " owner / media producer . "
According to this next link , the Stephen Spoonamore we are discussing has founded / co - founded eleven previous companies , including a company that developed television studios , and won two Emmys .
Sure looks like the same guy , and if they are the same guy , it seems odd that this " Republican " would donate over $ 1700 to Howard Dean 's campaign .
Connell is the story here , and it is important that we do n't take our eyes off the ball .
Spoonamore is involved , therefore he 's a " legitimate player " - but I have to agree that the jury is out on whether Spoon himself is legit or not .
Certainly there are troubling issues .

Final update then bed ...
Spoon also donated $ 500 to John Sweeney in 2004 , a congressman in the US House of Representatives , and a Republican .
I also read an article that mentioned he had met Howard Dean while living in Vermont , so perhaps that is why he donated to him .

It 's funny strange what some people will say in private versus what they say in public .
Maybe John Dean would like to tell the world how he really feels about the Clint Curtis story , how he feels AnonymousArmy got plenty of things right , and how Larissa could n't have been more wrong when she declared that AA was posting from a Dept. of Defense computer address .
Bev Harris had every right to post what she did .
Larissa RawStory had no right to continue with the same old tired Bev bashing .
Brad Friedman also likes to play both sides of the fence .
He acts all righteous as regards to proof and sources , but where was the journalistic diligence with the Curtis story ?
Why would someone select this Agent99 as a moderator , someone who accepts sources based on superficial ideology rather than on merits ?
There is no excuse for Raw Story to be linking to Wayne Madsen .
A website called Progressive Independent , with deep ties to Michael Rivero and thus to a vast right woos left network of neonazis , has listed The Velvet Revolution as being a collaborative affiliate .
Hmmm .
So Brad Friedman can be tied to Michael Rivero ?
Brad can be downright creepy when you look beneath the facade .
I used to always wonder why Brad and others ignore serious information , when it 's spoonfed to them .
It 's all making perfect sense now .
You have these people who are either ambitious egos turned into dupes , or some of these people are willing participants in spreading disinformation .
You can take your fake zeitgeist and stuff it .
Bev , if you only knew how Brad really feels about you .
This is how they operate .
There is what they say in emails versus what they say in public .
Larissa 's afraid of " the credible people " being attacked ?
Ha. Stop linking to Madsen .
Stop attacking Bev Harris for politely asking that the story be vetted .
Raw Story is not all that .
Nor is Brad Friedman .
Nor is the gatekeeping trollbuster who thinks the Curtis story smells something rancid .
You may have your manufactured right woos left zeitgeist , but there are pockets of awareness who can see through all the sophisticated bullshit that gets pushed on the internet .
Clint Curtis spoke of touch screen computers before the 2000 election .
Sorry , that does n't add up .
Robert Hertzberg was one of the first to sponsor a bill for new electronic technology right after the 2000 elections .
But that 's not big news to this information overload website .
Read the blogposts for the overload , then y'all come to the comments for some good old - fashioned tinfoil zeitgeist .
The scientific method be damned .
I do n't care if you guys are shallow dupes or big fat egos in love with the mirror .
People can see through all the bullshit .
Agent99 is the moderator here ?
What a bad joke you are Friedman .
And go on , tell Bev how you really feel .
Tell her how you feel people had the right to rip into her with those bullshit threads at the Democratic Underground .

Divide and conquer ?
Socrates , Jeremy Lowe , or whatever your name is , Brad is well aware that both Bev and I have always had serious misgivings about the Clint Curtis story .
And yes , AA was right about some things , and wrong on some other things , and he peaks all of our interest , and yes , Larisa was way off with what she posted at Daily Kos regarding AA 's IP coming from a Dept. of Defense computer .
As I have said over and over , you do n't reverse the sequence of an IP , and then run a reverse DNS and use that result as " the answer . "
As for Robert Hertzberg , have you displayed any proof that he is related to Steven Hertzberg ?
Because that 's where you are going with that line .
I remember when Jeremy Lowe used to link all sorts of people together , simply because their last name was the same .
Produce proof that Robert and Steven are related , otherwise what have you got ?
As for the rest of your early morning rant , I 'll stay out of it .
Connell is the story here .
Sorry you were left out of the loop ... but then of course , if you had been in the loop , all sorts of radioactive mutations would have been posted at your chemtrails site .
Time for work .
A real job .

Check out pictures of both of them and tell me they are n't related .
It 's obvious the cover up of the Hertzberg story continues .
There is widespread " weather mitigation " going on .
No disinformation can hide the obvious truth .
One need only look up to the sky more often .
You 'll witness it eventually .
But you guys keep covering things like this up .
Engine search Brett Kimberlin of Velvet Revolution .
Check out the links at Progressive Independent where it says Velvet Revolution is a collaborative partner .
Check out PI 's ties to Mike Rivero .
Check out Hertzberg 's links to Ron Paul on the internet .
Or simply continue to ignore .

Why is it that the investigation is taking place now under cover with very small numbers of people knowing about this .
When millions of people who
saw the election results of 2000 and 2004 suspected fraud .
But nothing was done about it then and little is known about the investigation now .

A famous Neolithic Iceman is dressed in clothes made from sheep and cattle hair , a new study shows .
The researchers say their findings support the idea that the Iceman was a herdsman .
The social and cultural background of the Iceman , dubbed Oetzi , has been the subject of much debate since his mummified remains were discovered in an Alpine glacier in 1991 .
Although his clothes were known to be made of animal skins , their exact origin was uncertain .
This new study focuses on hair samples taken from Oetzi 's coat , leggings and moccasin shoes .
Oetzi was discovered in 1991 in the Italian / Austrian Alps and was approximately 1.60 meters in height and aged 40 - 45 years .
Picture credit : Fowler , 2000 .
Researchers say that the technique they used , reported today in the journal Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry , has use in the modern clothing industry .
" We found that the hairs came from sheep and cattle , just the types of animals that herdsmen care for during their seasonal migrations , " says lead researcher Klaus Hollemeyer of Saarland University in Germany .
The researchers analysed hair samples in excess of 5,000 years old using MALDITOF mass spectrometry .
This allowed them to study patterns of peptides of fermented proteins present in the ancient hair and compare them with those of modern day animals .
They found that Oetzi 's coat and leggings were made from sheep 's fur , whilst his moccasins were of cattle origin .
The researchers believe that MALDITOF mass spectrometry may be faster and more reliable than methods based on DNA analysis and that it could be applied in archaeology and evolutionary biology .
" This method could , for example , be used in checking the purity of products made from animal hair , such as pullovers and jackets made of Cashmere wool , " says Hollemeyer .
" I think that a major field of application will be to help manufacturers abide by the European Union law concerning the ban of dog and cat fur trade next year . "

• Al - Jazeera welcomed by liberals , protested by conservatives
Al Jazeera English broadcast today from the Buffalo Rose , an Old West biker bar in downtown Golden , a small city near Denver .
Golden is a charming place .
Clear Creek runs through it , and supplies the gigantic Coors Brewery with the water it turns into Colorado ’s most famous beer .
Golden is also known as the home of the Colorado School of Mines .
Their athletic teams ’ symbol is a miner ’s donkey .
This donkey would be a great symbol for the Democratic Convention of 2008 .
The stick of dynamite in the stubborn baggage - laden donkey ’s mouth could symbolize a party that wo n’t let go of a destructive philosophy of collectivism and partisanship that could well destroy it .
In a local shop window , a nod to the Convention in nearby Denver .
On the right , the Buffalo Rose .
The establishment is over 150 years old .
It ’s a fun place .
One band that plays there regularly is the Clam Daddys .
The guy on the left plays a mean harmonica .
The bar is popular with bikers .
A couple of ladies arrived on their Harleys right after I got there .
I was surprised to see all of the staff wearing T - shirts with this symbol :
One of the employees told me they were wearing these T - shirts all week , to make their dislike of Al Jazeera known .
Many residents of Golden do not like the idea of their city laying down the welcome mat to Al Jazeera .
The Qatar based Arab news network ’s level of anti-American ( and anti-Israel ) propaganda is notorious .
A few weeks ago Al Jazeera ’s Beirut bureau threw a welcome home party for brutal child - killer Samir Kuntar .
Golden ’s mayor backed out of his invitation to host a BBQ at his home for Al Jazeera .
Some locals produced these shirts , which say “ No Al Jazeera in Golden ” on the back .
The bar ’s owner had more of the shirts made up ( without the words on the back ) as an “ ironic sort of joke ” ; apparently the Arabic says Buffalo Rose .
The patio out back .
The aroma of toasting and brewing grain often envelopes the town of Golden .
The Buffalo Rose is just down the street from the gigantic Coors brewery .
Coors draft is excellent , fresh and very inexpensive .
Police temporarily sealed off the street for the Fire Department to come in .
The Golden Fire Department got their ladders up to the roof of the building across the street .
I guess there is no other roof access .
They put a lot of equipment up there for the police who were also posted on top of another building on the other side of the Buffalo Rose .
Inside the bar , Al Jazeera journalists set up underneath large photos of Native Americans toting guns c. 1890 .
Business went on as usual , with the journalists and equipment concentrated in one corner .
It is my opinion that this corner of the Buffalo Rose was chosen because of these iconic , “ heroic ” photos of gun toting indigenous Americans from the late 1800s .
This is an attempt to draw a not so subtle parallel between the Palestinians and the war on terror in general and the American Indian Wars of more than a century ago .
This is an old and effective propaganda device used by the Muslim Brotherhood since its conception by Sayyid Qutb in Greeley , Colorado .
Comparing American settlers of European descent to Jews returning to their homeland from their Roman imposed exile is absurd and racist at its root .
Why are n’t the Jews able to claim “ indigenous peoples ” status in their struggle against the Moslem Arab invader from far off Arabia ?
The Jewish presence in “ The Holy Land ” preceded that of the Arab invader by thousands of years .
The beautiful thing about racist Arab propaganda is how simple it is to understand if you are simple minded .
The picture above al Jazeera ’s table : Grey Eagle , son of Chief Douglass of the White River Utes , eloped with Pi-Av ( Honey Dew of the Mountains ) , daughter of a Uinta Ute chief .
Because Pi -Av had been promised to another warrior , they were armed and running for their lives .
Not sure where to go , or how to survive , they sought out and were given refuge by the crew of the Powell Geographical Survey Team .
Photo by Edward O. Beaman , Powell Survey , near Green and Uinta Rivers , Utah , August 1 , 1871 .
This incident occurred thirteen years after the Buffalo Rose was established in 1858 .
The Al Jazeera reporter on the left is Josh Rushing .
Last year , a liberal American reporter quit Al Jazeera because although he ’d expected a certain bias , it was far beyond what he could tolerate on an ongoing basis .
Al Jazeera reporters step outside the bar for a smoke
Behind the back patio , an abstract sculpture raises a crescent over the satellite truck servicing the Islamic news network .
The network ’s presence brought several fans .
The girl in the knit cap , whose mother is a journalist , came “ out of profound respect for Al Jazeera ” .
Kyle Caskey , president of School of Mines College Democrats , came down to the Buffalo Rose today .
He says that Al Jazeera is misinterpreted by a lot of people , and he ’s come to show support for them , as a Democrat .
Beyond that , he wants them to report that the Democratic party is about more than politics , it ’s about volunteering , doing good things in neighborhoods .
The backpack of another Al Jazeera supporter from the School of Mines College Democrats
A group of locals , mainly veterans and military families , assembled across the street from the bar to voice their dislike for Al Jazeera .
A few brought signs which were not politically correct ; mostly they brought flags .
A middle aged couple , plastered with Obama buttons , walked by the protesters as I stood with them .
They asked “ Do n’t you believe in the First Amendment ? ”
When it was pointed out to them that nobody was obstructing any free speech , in fact none of the protesters were even close to the Buffalo Rose , they went on to say that they like Al Jazeera , gave the flag wavers dirty looks and left .
This fellow had just ridden in from countering the anti-war protesters in Denver , as part of a group of Bikers for McCain .
He had n’t known about Al - Jazeera being there .
He went in to get a beer , sitting as far away as possible from the journalists .
An assortment of vehicles including bikes , trucks and cars circled the area , to big cheers from the growing anti-al Jazeera crowd .
Several reporters interviewed the protesters .
This one from Denver kept saying “ Al Qaeda ” instead of Al Jazeera , as in “ So , why do you object to Al Qaeda coming to your town ? ” and then apologizing meekly , “ I ’m sorry , I meant Al Jazeera . ” I heard her make that mistake twice .
I think it ’s her daughter that came out of profound respect for Al Qaeda , oops , I mean Al Jazeera .
Obama supporters arrived on unicycles , enthusiastically asking “ Where ’s Al Jazeera ? ”
They then performed tricks for the self identified Al Jazeera cameraman , who was posted out front to cover the street action .
Here is a shot I took last year during Golden ’s famous Buffalo Bill Days .
The owner of the bar , on horseback , had just ridden his horse through the bar , robbed it , and proceeded out the front door .
Next came a big gun fight between our hero and the Sheriff ’s posse .
Murray Martinez , owner of the Buffalo Rose
This was one of the posse .
He had five loaded vintage weapons and shot them all in quick succession in an impressive display of skill .
On my way home , I passed this Obama supporter at my exit ramp about sixty miles away from Denver .
Earlier today , the DNC organized Delegate Service Day .
For two hours this morning delegates from every state went to clean up graffiti and litter , and toil in the hot sun picking weeds in city parks .
If Denver had sugar plantations they would gladly have cut cane for the greater good .
Besides the fact that two hours of such an activity contributes nothing other than making the participants feel good , this reeks of Soviet style volunteerism , when comrades were forced to volunteer to clean the streets .

Diana Kennedy has always trashed the “ so - called Mexican restaurants ” north of the border and the “ overly large platters of mixed messes ” they serve .
Following her lead , food snobs on the East and West Coasts ridicule Tex - Mex - - which they seem to think is the invention of a bunch of dumb rednecks who ca n’t cook Mexican food .
In fact , if you study old menus , you find that the “ so - called Mexican restaurants ” opened by Mexicans and Mexican - Americans in Texas combined authentic Mexican dishes , like tamales and enchiladas , with Texas creations , like chili con carne , to create an American regional cuisine .
Tex - Mex restaurants also offered Mexican - Americans rare opportunities for economic and social advancement .
Take the case of Raul Molina , whose father worked on a railroad crew for the International & Great Northern line .
Raul worked as a waiter for many years to save the money to own his own restaurant .
When they bought one , Raul Molina and his wife Mary lived on the second floor above the restaurant with their children .
Every member of the family was employed by the business .
And when they expanded , there was always a family member in charge of each new location .
In their later years , Raul and Mary Molina became prominent members of Houston society and generous donors to charities .
They were very active in the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo .
None of which makes Molina ’s combo platters taste any better .
Hey -- some people prefer authentic Mexican food to Tex - Mex , some people like risotto better than spaghetti and meatballs -- to each his own .
But maybe you should think twice before you trash somebody ’s culture based on your taste in tacos .

An unsigned 1990 article unearthed by Politico offers a glimpse at Obama 's views on abortion policy and the law during his student days .
Exclusive : Obama 's lost law review article
As president of the Harvard Law Review and a law professor in Chicago , Senator Barack Obama refined his legal thinking , but left a scant paper trail .
His name does n't appear on any legal scholarship .
But an unsigned — and previously unattributed — 1990 article unearthed by Politico offers a glimpse at Obama 's views on abortion policy and the law during his student days , and provides a rare addition to his body of work .
Advertisement
The six - page summary , tucked into the third volume of the year 's Harvard Law Review , considers the charged , if peripheral , question of whether fetuses should be able to file lawsuits against their mothers .
Obama 's answer , like most courts ' : No .
He wrote approvingly of an Illinois Supreme Court ruling that the unborn cannot sue their mothers for negligence , and he suggested that allowing fetuses to sue would violate the mother 's rights and could , perversely , cause her to take more risks with her pregnancy .
The subject matter took Obama to the treacherous political landscape of reproductive rights , and - unlike many student authors - he dived eagerly into the policy implications of the court decision .
His article acknowledged a public interest in the health of the fetus , but also seemed to demonstrate his continuing commitment to abortion rights , and suggested that the government may have more important concerns than " ensuring that any particular fetus is born . "
The temperate legal language does n't display the rhetorical heights that run through his memoir , published a few years later , but provides insight into his support for abortion rights and expanded social services .
" [ T ] he case raises the broader policy and constitutional considerations that argue against using civil liability to control the behavior of pregnant women , " Obama wrote of Stallman vs. Youngquist .
And he concluded the article with a flourish : " Expanded access to prenatal education and heath care facilities will far more likely serve the very real state interest in preventing increasing numbers of children from being born in to lives of pain and despair . "
Law students elected to the prestigious Harvard Law Review spend two years working there .
In their first year , most write the brief , anonymous " case comments " like Obama's , which bears the unwieldy heading : TORT LAW - PRENATAL INJURIES - SUPREME COURT OF ILLINOIS REFUSES TO RECOGNIZE CAUSE OF ACTION BROUGHT BY FETUS AGAINST ITS MOTHER FOR UNINTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF PRENATAL INJURIES .
Obama 's tenure at the Review has been chronicled at length in the Politico , the New York Times , and elsewhere .
But Obama has never mentioned his law review piece , a demurral that 's part of his campaign 's broader pattern of rarely volunteering information or documents about the candidate , even when relatively innocuous .
When Politico reporters working on a story about Obama 's law review presidency earlier this year asked if he had written for the review , a spokesman responded accurately - but narrowly - that " as the president of the Law Review , Obama did n't write articles , he edited and reviewed them . "
The case comment was published a month before he became president .
The notion that Obama had n't written at all for the Review prompted skepticism .
" They probably do n't want [ to ] have you [ reporters ] going back " to examine the Review , University of Southern California law professor ( and Michael Dukakis campaign manager ) Susan Estrich said at the time .
The Obama campaign swiftly confirmed Obama 's authorship of the fetal rights article Thursday after a source told Politico he 'd written it .
The campaign also provided a statement on Harvard Law Review letterhead confirming that the unsigned piece was Obama 's - the only record of the anonymous authors is kept in the office of the Review president - and that records showed it was the only piece he 'd written for the Review .
" Like most second - year law students on the Harvard Law Review , Senator Obama wrote an unsigned student case comment that summarized a recent decision by a state or lower federal court .
The piece analyzed a case in which a mother was sued by her child for injuries caused by the mother 's negligent driving during her pregnancy .
Senator Obama concluded that , in such cases , the Illinois Supreme Court was correct not to allow lawsuits by children against their mothers , " said Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt in an email .
" He wrote that the best way to protect the health of fetuses was to provide prenatal education and health care to pregnant women - issues he remains committed to today and which he has worked to advance as a legislator and in this campaign . "
LaBolt also provided a brief analysis from Cass Sunstein , a University of Chicago law professor who supports Obama .
" Student Obama was acutely attuned to the limits of the judiciary , and of suits between children and their mother , in this sensitive area , " Sunstein wrote .
" This is a modest and balanced piece that fits easily within the framework of the law at the time . "
Outside lawyers who reviewed the piece for Politico also said it was a fairly standard example of the genre , an approving recap of an interesting - and quite mainstream -- state court verdict .
The recent case reviews take a basically " journalistic " approach to the decisions they analyze , said Scott Altman , another professor at the University of Southern California Law School .
Obama approached " what remains a controversial issue in a temperate way , " said Altman , who was on the Harvard Law Review a few years before Obama .
He noted that Obama 's terms were carefully hedged - " may " and " many people think " in place of bold declarations .
" It 's a very narrow essay , " he said .
The case at issue in Stallman , though , was an interesting one .
According to Obama 's footnotes , the child 's mother , Bari Stallman was involved in a car accident in 1981 with a Clarence Youngquist .
Her daughter , Lindsey , was born with severe injuries from the wreck , and so Stallman 's husband , acting for the baby , sued both his wife and Youngquist for negligence , hoping to recover damages from their insurance companies .
After a series of court rulings and reversals , the Illinois Supreme Court held that the fetus does n't have the right to sue its mother .
The court warned that allowing a fetus to sue its mother could make them " legal adversaries from the moment of conception until birth . "
Obama 's article addressed only the narrow question of whether a fetus could sue its mother for negligence .
He did n't take on the broader question of the fetus 's personhood , or whether it could sue others .
He described cases " involving maternal activities that might be considered intentional or reckless infliction of prenatal injuries on the fetus " as " more difficult , " though he wrote that as a matter of encouraging good maternal behavior , giving fetuses the right to sue their mothers remained " ill - conceived . "
Fetal rights is , as Obama acknowledged , a charged issue largely because of its connection to the abortion debate .
That 's a question Obama touched in passing , and from both sides , in his article .
On one hand , he warned that allowing fetuses to sue their mothers could actually lead to more abortions .
" Imposing civil liability on mothers may be as likely to deter the carrying of pregnancies to term as to deter maternal negligence during pregnancy , " he wrote .
He was also acutely sensitive to women 's rights , and to the consequences of involving civil law in childbearing .
" Fetal - maternal tort suits might entail far more intrusive scrutiny of a woman 's behavior than the scrutiny involved in the discrete regulation of the abortion decision , " he wrote .
" On the other hand , the state may also have a more compelling interest in ensuring that fetuses carried to term do not suffer from debilitating injuries than it does in ensuring that any particular fetus is born . "
Obama 's article , which begins on page 823 of Volume 103 of the Harvard Law Review , is available in libraries and subscription - only legal databases .
Government opposes appeal by imprisoned attorney to visit dying wife
The Department of Justice and prosecutors in Mississippi have filed a motion opposing the appeal of Mississippi trial lawyer Paul Minor to visit his dying wife .
Minor , who became famous for taking on big tobacco in the 1990s , is now imprisoned on what many consider to be questionable charges .
The primary grounds for denial offered by Justice Department attorneys is that letting Minor visit his wife would present a danger to the community .
They cite an incident  when he was found drunk and escorted out of a hotel by security while free on pre-trial bond , after which he was ordered to attend treatment for alcoholism , as well as an occasion when he met with a hurricane expert at a restaurant near his home while he was supposed to be under house arrest .
 The district court previously found that Minor presented a danger to the community based on his alcohol abuse ,  they wrote .
 There is evidence that supports the district courts finding that after a lengthy inpatient treatment , Minor defied and tested the courts condition of pretrial release , which had been tailored to protect the public and prevent him from abusing alcohol . 
 Minors unauthorized Sept. 5 , 2006 meeting with a hurricane expert at a restaurant serving alcohol not only raised issues concerning his substance abuse problems , it also showed his deception of the court . 
Minor says he met with the hurricane expert to assess damage to his home for insurance purposes after seeking approval from his probation officer and receiving no reply .
Court records show that he was out of range of his electronic monitoring device for slightly over four hours .
Minor successfully completed treatment for alcoholism .
He says that his drinking was aggravated by the trial and his wife 's cancer .
In their brief , the Justice Department did not contend that Minor was drinking when he met with the hurricane expert , only that the restaurant served alcohol .
They argue that his 11 - year sentence for bribery gives more credence to their assertion that he is a danger to the community because he could relapse .
The government response in full is here .
In 2003 , the US Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi , Dunnica Lampton , brought federal bribery charges against Minor , sitting Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Oliver E. Diaz Jr. , and Judges Wes Teel and John Whitfield .
Diaz was twice acquitted , and Minor and the other judges were acquitted on most of the governments charges during the first trial .
Lampton then brought additional charges which resulted in a second trial and the conviction of Minor , Teel and Whitfield .
Minor has been incarcerated for more than two years during his appeal .
For some , he is yet another victim of political prosecution by a politicized Department of Justice .
Others bemoan his lionization as " pro-convict , pro-bribery rotgut " and say , " Minor had a total disregard for the Court . "
" Government prosecutors have chosen to continue the political prosecution of Paul Minor , " Justice Diaz wrote RAW STORY by email Tuesday .
" In a case where even the [ Justice Department ] has raised the question of improprieties , these prosecutors have refused to show compassion for a man whose wife is dying with cancer Instead , the politicization of the criminal justice system is continued by these protégée of Monica Goodling . "
Lamptons office did not return calls for comment .
As previously reported by Raw Story , Minors wife Sylvia developed breast cancer during the trial , which metastasized to her brain and lungs .
Last month doctors stopped all medications other than those for pain management , indicating that Mrs. Minor is in the final stages of her illness .
Minor has been attempting to get an appeal bond to be with his wife before she passes
According to Minors attorney , Abbe Lowell , it will be up to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to rule on Minor 's appeal bond request .
Lowell also indicates that Minor could apply for a furlough instead , writing in an email on Monday that Minor " can seek a compassionate furlough from the Bureau of Prisons based solely on his wife 's condition . "
Note :
In an earlier version of this article , it was stated that the government had denied Mr. Minors appeal bond .
The editorial error has been corrected .
A government motion has simply been entered to oppose the appeal .

How long do you think it 's going to take before this guy starts spinning the backlash from this into some stupid MTV reality show .
They 'll have Diddy pumping free gas for people while Farnsworth Bentley holds that stupid fucking umbrella up his ass .
Or grabbing people out of the airport and giving them a free ride in his jet .
This guy is the worst kind of whore .
If it were n't for Biggie , this no talent ass clown really would be pumping gas now .
The only skills this guy possesses is having creative friends .
He just whores them out and sits back and makes all the money .
But in the end , his hubris will be his downfall .
I do n't condone at all the fact that this guy is going to catch so much shit for this clip because I think we are way to sensitive about these kinds of things .
But I can't wait to see this tool sucking the big media dick when everyone turns on him .
Many key features of TiVo , the much anticipated digital television recorder , will be disabled when it is launched at the end of the month so Seven can charge for them via a software update early next year .
The $ 699 device will be on sale at all Harvey Norman and Domayne stores from July 29 but the home networking features - such as the ability to transfer music , photos and video from a PC to the TiVo box - will be disabled .
The home networking functionality and the ability to load recorded shows to a portable device like the iPod will only be available early next year for a fee in the " tens of dollars " , Seven 's TiVo general manager Mark Hughes said .
The Bush administration was forced yesterday to issue a grovelling apology to the Italian prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi , after White House officials briefed the travelling US press corps that Berlusconi was regarded as a political amateur who had used his massive media influence to gain political power .
The briefing given to White House press corps was lifted , administration officials said , from the Encyclopedia of World Biography , and put in a briefing pack as though it represented the views of the administration .
Berlusconi has prided himself on being Bush 's natural ally in Europe .
But the profile described him as " one of the most controversial leaders in the history of a country known for governmental corruption and vice ... regarded by many as a political dilettante who gained his high office only through use of his considerable influence on the national media until he was forced out of office in 2006 . "
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said the biography used " insulting " language and " the sentiments expressed in the biography do not represent the views of President Bush , the American government , or the American people .
We apologise to Italy and to the prime minister for this very unfortunate mistake , " he wrote in a letter distributed via email .
When asked about the biography , Berlusconi said that he was n't the one who had sought an apology , suggesting the Italian media had generated the controversy .
Italy " is a country that loves to flagellate itself and make itself look bad " , he said .

Party Of One : Surviving A Hobby Open - Source Project May 13th , 2008
Last week ’s JavaOne had a separate track on open source , and there ’s been a substantial number of very interesting panels , discussions and presentations .
However , i felt that these talks concentrated mostly on big , well - established and very broad open - source communities .
While it is perfectly understandable , the few dozens of these high - profile communities do not reflect the specific problems of a much vaster landscape of the open - source in general .
Here I ’m talking about literally hundreds of thousands of projects that only have a single active developer .
I call it the “ party of one ” type of project , and these pose a number of quite significant challenges to their “ owners ” , especially if it is done as a part time hobby .
I had a number of such projects ( where i am the only developer ) over the last decade , and some of them are still quite active .
This series talks about the specifics of one - man projects and how to maintain a long - term level of commitment .
First , a little bit of statistics from SourceForge :
Statistics , of course , can be used to back up pretty much any point of view , but i do believe that the numbers above are a good reflection on what happens when a developer out there has an idea .
Nowadays , it is extremely easy to find a free web - based code repository and wait for the entire world to come .
However , the absence of any entry - level barrier to create a project quite often results in the idea being just that – an idea .
Just over half of SourceForge projects have any kind of downloadable content , and i’m sure that you saw your share of great ideas that died once their creator faced the first major implementation hurdle ( or even when his level of interest in implementing the idea never matured to the actual coding ) .
While it is difficult to create even a first implementation , it is even more difficult to maintain the level of commitment and arrive at a stable release .
As you can see , only one in every six projects were deemed to be stable by their own developers .
When all you need to create a project is an Internet connection and enough imagination to come up with a name , you have another interesting side effect .
While every project has a potential to reach millions of developers , they all compete for the eyeballs and attention span of those few tens of thousands that are looking .
You can have a great idea , you can even have a great implementation , but most certainly you ca n’t expect everybody to come .
It is a big world out there , and the competition for the attention is even bigger .
It takes determination , commitment and perseverance to be willing to continue working on a project when nobody but you seems to be interested in it .
It takes discipline and clear prioritization to understand that while coding is fun , every project has less pleasant ( to us as the developers ) tasks , such as bug fixing , testing , documenting and promoting .
It does n’t matter if your project is big or small .
However , if you ’re the only one working on your project ( and here is specifically do n’t use “ the only developer ” ) , you do n’t have anybody else to do the “ boring ” tasks .
And without understanding what these tasks are , and being ready to step up and make sure that all these secondary tasks get done – you might as well not begin in the first place .
The next entries will talk about the specific project tasks .
Part 2 talks about the development
Part 3 talks about the maintenance
Part 4 talks about the promotion
Part 5 summarizes the discussion

JACKSON HOLE , Wyoming ( Reuters ) - U.S. consumer spending will tail off as the effects of government rebates to taxpayers wear off , hurting economic growth in the second half of the year , the director of the Congressional Budget Office said on Saturday .
“ While it ’s early , it looks to us like the stimulus helped to support consumption in the middle part of this year , ” CBO head Peter Orszag told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the Kansas City Federal Reserve ’s annual monetary policy conference here .
“ One of the things we ’ll be experiencing later this year is the withdrawal of that effect leading to economic weakness , ” he said .
Orszag said CBO ’s analysis refutes economists who say households used their rebate checks primarily to save or pay down debt .
“ You would have had much weaker consumption without it , ” he said .
According to initial government data , the U.S. economy grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the second quarter , a soft pace but enough to push it away from the brink of recession .
Analysts said much of that expansion was driven by spending from the rebate checks .
The Commerce Department ’s second reading on economic growth for the second quarter is due out on Thursday .
Economists have a median forecast for revised growth of 2.7 percent , according to a Reuters poll .
Strong U.S. exports , helped by a weak dollar , have also buoyed economic activity .
The economy shrank in the final quarter of 2007 , the first U.S. contraction in six years , before barely edging up at the start of the year .
The hope behind the first stimulus package was that it would generate economic momentum , but a deep housing slump and credit crunch have persisted .
“ The economy has not recovered sufficiently , so that withdrawal of the stimulus does look like it will create an air pocket afterwards , ” Orszag said .
While we hope you enjoyed our How - To : Etch a printed circuit board , toner transfer certainly is n’t the only way to get the job done .
[ Garrett ] from macetech has recently been playing around with using an Epilog laser to etch PCBs .
He started by applying a thin even coat of flat black spray paint to the copper board .
The laser is used to remove paint in areas that you want the copper removed .
Once that ’s done , you proceed with etching as usual .
He eventually removed the paint mask using acetone .
The result has very fine , sharp traces , but most people that have tried this agree that using spray paint is less than ideal .

Glyn sez ,
The Open Rights Group 's report into e-counting of votes cast in the London Elections is out today .
The report finds that :
" there is insufficient evidence available to allow independent observers to state reliably whether the results declared in the May 2008 elections for the Mayor of London and the London Assembly are an accurate representation of voters ' intentions . "
Votes for London Mayor and the 25 member London Assembly were counted electronically , and overall the election was well - managed by the independent body set up to run elections in London , London Elects .
However , transparency around the recording of valid votes was a major issue , leading many of our team of 27 official observers to conclude that they were unable to observe votes being counted .
And while hundreds of screens set up by vote scanners showed almost meaningless data to observers , London Elects admit that the system was likely to be recording blank ballots as valid votes .
The report also details how London Elects are unable to publish an audit , commissioned from KPMG , of some of the software used to count the London vote , because of disputes over commercial confidentiality .
The situation highlights the problems that arise when the very public function of running elections is mixed with issues of commercial confidentiality and proprietary software .
In the context of a public election , it is unacceptable that these issues should preclude the publication of the KPMG audit .
When Apple ’s iPhone 3G came out , I was pretty sure I ’d get one .
It had all the features I was waiting for .
But the lines just were n’t going away .
I searched Twitter .
For a week , then two , every day brought fresh reports of five - hour waits .
And then the reports of bugs started coming in .
The Exchange synchronization features were n’t up to snuff , I heard .
The phone crashed regularly , I heard .
Basic operations were painfully slow .
Battery life was abysmal .
Adam Curry suggested getting a Nokia E71 .
I had never heard of this thing .
Nokia ?
Really ?
For years I had always thought that Nokia made chunky Europhones that were always just one button short of a usable user interface .
But , no , the more I investigated , the more it seemed that the E71 was a truly credible alternative to the iPhone 3G .
The reviews coming in from Europe were stellar .
There was one hitch : it did n’t seem to be on sale over here .
There was one last hope .
Around the corner from the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue , Nokia had opened a pricy boutique where they sold unlocked , unsubsidized cell phones , mostly to foreign tourists who invaded New York to take advantage of our banana - republic currency .
“ Do you have the E71 ? ” I asked .
“ I have a demo model you can look at , ” the guy said .
It seemed very sleek .
Smaller than the iPhone , all metal , nothing chintzy … with the best keyboard I ’ve ever used on a phone .
“ They ’re not on sale until tomorrow … if we have any left after tonight ’s super - exclusive launch party .
Which is invite only , ” he emphasized .
I ’m shameless .
“ How do I get invited ? ”
“ Well , um , put your name on this list . ”
He gave me a blank piece of paper .
“ And come back at 6 pm . ”
Which I did .
There was a short line of a dozen Nokia fans — a somewhat ghetto version of the five hour iPhone lines .
Within minutes , I had my E71 , and they even helped me with the arduous task of popping in the SIM .
Plink !
It worked !
I ’ve been using it for a month now , and I ’m completely sold .
This is the best phone I ’ve ever had .
I love it .
Now , do n’t get me wrong : I think the iPhone is brilliant .
The Apple iPhone is truly an inspired piece of design that pushed the state of the art and then went about ten steps further .
If the iPhone competed in the Olympic swimming tournaments , Michael Phelps would have just retired on the spot and given up swimming for life .
For many people , the iPhone 3G is perfect .
I thought that it meant “ game over ” for all the other handset makers .
But Nokia is a fantastic company and they were n’t going to give up that easy .
Their new E71 is a fantastic phone , clearly inspired by the competition , and the game is not over .
There were three reasons I was looking to upgrade .
I wanted a phone with a decent MP3 player , so I do n’t have to carry two devices .
I wanted to be able to use the phone ’s internet connection to get online with my laptop on the train out to the Hamptons ( there ’s tolerable 3G coverage on AT&T for the first two hours of the trip ) .
I needed great Exchange synchronization , not just an IMAP client .
For the last few weeks I ’ve been desperately trying to get Merlin Mann ’s Inbox Zero concept working and you need a great Exchange client , not a 1.0 Exchange client .
The E71 met most of these requirements .
It ’s got a decent music player , a built - in podcasting client ( so I can download podcasts directly instead of going through my desktop PC ) , and it ’s even got an FM radio .
There ’s a third party software app called JoikuSpot which uses the 3G connection and the WiFi in the phone to turn your phone into a mobile hotspot so you can surf from your laptop .
When I tried JoikuSpot , it kept dropping the connection , so I ca n’t say that was the perfect experience , but I ’ll keep trying .
Nokia ’s built in Exchange synchronization is very 1.0 .
It does n’t know about folders , which means there ’s no way to get things out of my inbox into an archive folder after I deal with them .
This was unacceptable .
It meant I would have to go through all those emails again when I got back to my desk .
But there ’s a third party app , DataViz RoadSync , which handles Exchange synchronization and does support folders , and that works perfectly .
There are some other great features I discovered when I really got into this phone .
The GPS is great fun .
It does n’t work indoors .
It does n’t work in the city where the sky is a distant memory .
But it works when you ’re out in the country , and it ’s really fun to get Google Maps satellite images showing exactly where you are .
That is , if you ’re not so far out in the country that there ’s no cell reception .
Combined with the 3 megapixel camera , if you ’re really lucky , you can snap pictures and then upload them directly to your Flickr account , and the picture will be tagged with its exact location .
You have to be pretty lucky for this to work : getting the GPS to find enough satellites is not always possible .
The pictures are , um , well , cellphone quality .
I uploaded a few sample pictures .
It ’s for snapshots and memories , not photography .
The fit and finish of this phone is amazing .
It ’s the slimmest Nokia I ’ve ever seen : smaller in every dimension than an iPhone .
It feels solid .
The keys on the keyboard are really clicky and extremely easy to type with , especially combined with the predictive word autocomplete .
( Why do n’t desktop word processors have autocomplete yet ? )
The battery lasts a couple of days under heavy use , and is easy to replace , so I keep a spare around for those days when I forgot to charge the phone .
The call quality is the best I ’ve ever experienced .
After years of using junky phones I literally did not know cell phone calls could be this good .
The external speaker ( for hands - free operation ) is the loudest I ’ve ever heard .
The phone will announce your callers by name using a synthesized voice .
There are probably dozens of other features buried in here which I have n’t found .
I think there ’s a second camera in front for video calls but I ’m way too old to figure out how to make that work .
The music player is adequate , but not great .
It ’s amazing how something as simple as playing MP3s is so fraught with minor problems …
Apple makes it look easy to build an MP3 player , so when someone else tries , it ’s always surprising to see just how hard it is to get right .
On the E71 :
The sound quality is not quite as good as Apple
It takes too many steps to shuffle music
You hear unexplained static in the headphones when no music is playing .
The volume control has exactly ten choices .
It reminded me of those old AT&T public telephones with three amplification choices for the hearing impaired .
You have to choose between too soft and too loud .
When you ’ve listened only to a part of a long podcast , the phone does n’t remember where you were up to , so if you go back to it , you have to search around for the point where you left off .
The built - in browser was decent , but ignore that … just install Opera Mini , which is stellar .
I still have n’t found a website which does n’t display respectably on this phone with Opera Mini .
There ’s a built in GPS map application , which always freezes .
Ignore that , too .
The free Google Maps is better .
This phone is inevitably going to be compared to the Apple iPhone 3G , so I might as well list the big pros and cons of each .
The iPhone has a bigger , touch - sensitive screen , which makes the browsing experience better .
On the other hand , the Nokia E71 has a fantastic physical keyboard that makes it very easy to reply to email .
This is just a tradeoff ; you ’re going to have to decide whether the browsing or the typing is more important to you .
The iPhone apps are easier to use and simpler .
Apps on the Nokia tend to have more features ( for example , there is true multitasking , so you can listen to podcasts while working on email and downloading web pages in the background , and then you can take a picture without losing a beat ) .
In general I think that geeks will prefer the Nokia for its functionality , while the iPhone is totally the phone for people who are less technical and do n’t want to spend any time setting up their phone and downloading software to get it exactly the way they want it .
The Nokia has a replaceable battery and a replaceable storage card which may make it fit your lifestyle better if you ’re a heavy user .
In any case , it ’s the best phone I ’ve ever had and I ’m loving it .
Kermit Love , the costume designer for some of ballet ’s most renowned choreographers whose greatest fame came as a creator , with Jim Henson , of the beloved “ Sesame Street ” characters Big Bird and Mr. Snuffleupagus , died on Saturday in Poughkeepsie , N.Y .
He was 91 and lived in Stanfordville , N.Y .
The cause was congestive heart failure , said Christopher Lyall , Mr. Love ’s partner of 50 years .
Although Mr. Love collaborated with luminaries of dance like George Balanchine , Agnes de Mille , Robert Joffrey , Jerome Robbins and Twyla Tharp , it was the 8 - foot - 2 , yellow - feathered Big Bird and his 7 - foot , woolly mammoth - like friend Mr. Snuffleupagus  both perennially 6 years old  that brought him global attention .
“ For Kermit , the costume was just the beginning , ” said Kevin Clash , who is now senior puppet coordinator for “ Sesame Street ” and considers Mr. Love his mentor .
“ He taught how to create the character out of the costume . ”
Caroll Spinney , 74 , the man inside the bird since “ Sesame Street ” was first telecast in 1969 , said , “ We traveled the world doing shows for kids , sometimes with Big Bird conducting orchestras . ”
There has been discussion within the impeachment movement over whether George Bush can formally be accused of treason , or if such accusations are fanciful and would not meet legal muster .
I believe they would .
Some pretty smart lawyers I know are discussing this question , and as a layman I can only apply the law as I understand it .
Valerie Plame
The first case for treason centers on Valerie Plame .
The definition of treason according to Article 3 , Section 3 , of the US Constitution :
" Treason against the United States , shall consist only in levying War against them , or in adhering to their Enemies , giving them Aid and Comfort . "
On July 12 , 2007 George Bush admitted :
In the Dorgan - Waxman Committee Hearings of July 22 , 2005 , on the damage to the national security done by Plame 's identification , an expert witness , Special Forces Col .
Patrick Lang said that , as a result of Plame 's identification :
" The possibility of penetrating these groups , the possibility of knowing that they 're going to carry 10 - pound bags of explosive in the subway stations , will go right down the drain . "
This was in addition to similar testimony by other expert witnesses , including many former CIA officers .
Walter Pincus in the Washington Post , October 4 , 2003 , quoted a former diplomat as affirming that :
" every foreign intelligence service would run Plame 's name through its databases within hours of its publication to determine if she had visited their country and to reconstruct her activities . "
" Every foreign intelligence service " would include the Pakistani ISI , the Inter - Intelligence Services , which is riddled with Al Qaeda sympathizers .
It was only a matter of time before Al Qaeda knew if you had been passing secrets along to that Plame woman .
Summary : Someone in the Bush administration gave information to our enemies , which constitutes " aid and comfort " which made it easier to attack us .
In conventional war , the parallel would be telling the Germans where the main assault would hit on D - Day .
Remember , Ike , General Eisenhower , knew it was important to keep them guessing .
In the war on terror the serial number of a single cargo container docked at an American port is more important than armies , as this is a HUMINT ( spook talk for Human Intelliegence ) war .
Amounts of hardware ( tanks , planes ) have sunk to near irrelevance in protecting us , as stealth determination of the enemy 's precise actions and intentions , assessed by covert agents , is now most important .
This is exactly what Plame 's job was for the 20 years .
She was non -official cover , meaning she was set up in a private business as a front to hide any connection with the U.S. government .
Many details of her career are still classified , but we know she worked as a clandestine operative in the area of " non-proliferation . "
Non-proliferation means stopping the spread of unconventional weapons , like bio-weapons and nukes .
CBS confirms that part of Plame 's job was to keep Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons .
When the administration blew Plame 's cover to Al Qaeda , any potential informants seen with Plame , who as a gorgeous blond stands out and is memorable , were suspect .
The shadowy world of trade in weapons of mass destruction was now filled with walking dead men .
As a ( suddenly ) high - profile American officer , Plame herself was probably untouchable , but not so an Algerian banker or a Pakistani technician whom she had encouraged to talk .
In Dorgan - Waxman hearings Special Service Forces Colonel Lang , a decorated veteran trained as a Middle East specialist and a professor of Arabic at West Point , said :
HUMINT is about human beings .
It 's about one person , an American person , a case officer in the parlance of the trade , causing some foreign person to trust him enough and to trust his unit and to trust the United States enough to put his life , his fortune and , indeed , his sacred honor in many cases into the hands of this case officer ...
By Bush 's own description of this " new kind of war , " in which the enemy has no armies , he committed the worst form of treason .
It would have been less damaging had he given bin Laden the blueprints for an F - 16 .
Why prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald went with the lighter charge of violation of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act is a mystery .
You can unmask a covert agent and still not do too much damage , if , for example , they are working in a Western diplomatic post charged with spying on officials of an allied nation .
In such a case the charge of violation of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act would be appropriate .
But the Bush administration did untold damage , because Plame was working on the non-proliferation of unconventional weapons .
Bush poked the eyes out of our ability to know where in the underground world WMD was coming from and where they were going , according to testimony in the Dorgan - Waxman hearings on Plame .
Col .
Lang testified :
The federal government can invade every aspect of my life as long as they keep me safe from those drug- running Mexicans .
WaPo reported Wednesday that the Department of Homeland Security is building a database that tracks every every American citizen 's border crossings and catalogs the data for as long as 15 years , with little to no privacy measures in place to prevent abuse .
The federal government has been using its system of border checkpoints to greatly expand a database on travelers entering the country by collecting information on all U.S. citizens crossing by land , compiling data that will be stored for 15 years and may be used in criminal and intelligence investigations .
When Wolf Blitzer asks CNN's Resident Xenophobe , Lou Dobbs , for his opinion , the pseudo - intellectual said this story is troublesome not because of the invasion of privacy issues it raises , but rater because those damn illegals are still sneaking into the country with their horrific ( i.e. non-existent ) diseases and contraband .

" The State Department has been tracking what 's happening with our passports for years and years and years .
There seems to be some dust - up here .
The real story to me is that all of this concern about tracking citizens going about their lawful activities entering and exiting this country , while they have done nothing at the DHS to shut down the flow of illegals aliens across our borders , potential terrorists , and still Mexico , for example , is the primary source for methamphetamines , heroin , cocaine and marijuana into this country ... and it's not being stopped !!! "
Is there no issue out there that this hack wo n't exploit in order to bash illegal immigrants ?
The State Department certainly has n't been tracking border crossings " for years and years and years , " and keeping that information in a central computer for 15 years with no oversight provisions .
The fact that we 're becoming a bona fide surveillance state does n't bother Lou Dobbs .
All he cares about is twisting a story in order to rail against his favorite target .
He 's always sure to slip in his talking points , too , even if they 're bogus .

Payday Loan Scams
How is this for consumer protection .
The province of Nova Scotia has added a new law for Payday Loans :
" Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board set the maximum cost of borrowing at $ 31 per $ 100 borrowed . "
How does this add up for consumers ?
Let 's take a look at a 10 day loan :
$ 100 Loan + $ 31 in fees = 1132 % interest rate
What a deal !
Can it get any better ?
What if I am a day late with Payment ?
Let 's take a look at the same loan with the payment made one day late :
" loan default fees are set at a maximum of $ 40 per loan "
$ 100 Loan + $ 31 in fees + $ 40 default fee = 2356 % interest rate
Do n't worry consumers , it 's not all bad .
The maximum you now pay on your default fees is limited at 60 % .

More than a dozen computers seized in questionable search
* Berkeley , CA* —
At 10:30 am on Wednesday , August 27th , the UC Berkeley police , plainclothes FBI agents , and an Alameda County sheriff raided at gunpoint the Long Haul , a long - standing community library and info shop .
Police spent at least an hour and a half searching the premises without allowing Long Haul members entry to their building .
More than a dozen computers and other equipment were seized in the morning raid .
Having made no attempt to contact Long Haul members , agents forced their way into the building by entering a neighboring non-profit office with guns drawn .
Police refused to provide a search warrant until after the raid was over and property was seized .
“ This is an outrageous abuse of authority by the federal government , ” said TKTK , a member of the Long Haul .
“ What cause could the police have to come into a community center like the Long Haul and seize information belonging to the people of Berkeley ?
They must return our property immediately . ”
The police went through every room , both public and locked – cutting or unscrewing the locks – and removed every computer from the building .
Most of the computers taken were removed from an un-monitored public space where people come to use the computers just as they would at a public library .
The remaining computers were taken from closed offices where they are needed for the day - to - day operation of the work done by members .
Offices were rifled through , and a list of people who had borrowed books from the library was checked , as was the sales log .
The warrant , which was produced after the raid , had little relevant information ( claiming the officers were searching for 1 – Property or things used as a means of committing a felony ; 2 – Property or things that are evidence that tends to show a felony has been committed , or tends to show that a particular person has committed a felony ) .
The Long Haul has been a community resource for 25 years , offering accessible meeting space to radical groups , access to alternative magazines and journals , a lending library and a historical archive of independent media .
Long
Haul also produces the well - known slingshot organizer pocket calendar .
Multiple groups have met and continue to meet there as one of the few remaining inexpensive radical venues in the increasingly gentrified bay area .
The same pattern of abuse was experienced recently when the convergence space for protesters against the Democratic National Convention in Denver was raided and supplies seized .
Since the Long Haul raid occurred , lawyers have been working to seek the immediate return of the seized property , though the Long Haul continues to welcome legal support .
The Long Haul is also in urgent need of computers to replace what was taken , while the fight continues to get the hard drives returned .
Long
Haul members have vowed to protest this latest act of political repression .

TRAVERSE CITY , Michigan ( Reuters ) - Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm said on Thursday she would not grant a pardon to Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick on perjury and other charges , reiterating that the situation needed to be resolved .

Granholm , a Democrat like Kilpatrick , said on Detroit radio station WJR she received the pardon request on Wednesday in relation to a hearing in September in which she will consider whether to use her official powers to remove him from office .
“ I will not be pardoning or issuing immunity for anyone testifying in that hearing , ” Granholm said in the radio interview conducted at an auto industry conference .
The governor has so far resisted calls for her to remove Kilpatrick from office but will preside over a hearing on September 3 to consider a request by the Detroit City Council to remove him .
She said she would decide quickly .
“ I ’ve said all along this has got to be resolved , ” Granholm told reporters .
“ This has been very , very difficult for the city , for the state , and that ’s obviously why we need a resolution . ”
Kilpatrick ’s counsel had asked Granholm to grant immunity from prosecution or a pardon to clear the way for the mayor to testify on his own behalf at the governor ’s hearing .
On Thursday , the governor ’s legal counsel said Granholm had no authority to issue a pardon before a conviction .
Kilpatrick , 38 , faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of perjury , obstruction of justice and official misconduct charges stemming from his handling of a whistle - blower lawsuit , which exposed his affair with a former staff member .
Kilpatrick also faces a possible two - year prison term on separate assault charges in which he is accused of pushing a deputy sheriff trying to serve a subpoena on one of the mayor ’s friends .
Kilpatrick is out on bond in that case .
Kilpatrick ’s deepening legal woes have added to the uncertainty over the leadership of Detroit at a time when the 11th largest U.S. city faces hard times due to the decline in the auto industry .
Michigan is considered a battleground state in the U.S. presidential election on November 4 and Kilpatrick , once seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party and a superdelegate to the Democratic Party convention , faces pressure to resign .
He made court appearances in the two criminal cases on Thursday .
In the first , Kilpatrick pleaded not guilty in the perjury case and the judge eased travel restrictions placed on the mayor and ordered an electronic tether removed .
The judge also said he could attend the party convention .
But at a second hearing on the assault charges , Judge Ronald Giles , who ordered the mayor jailed last week , restored the travel restrictions and ordered the tether put back on .
Kilpatrick was jailed for one night last week for violating terms of his bond by traveling to the neighboring Canadian city of Windsor in July .
His release was conditional on a stiffer bond , confinement to the Detroit area and a requirement to wear an electronic tether .
WASHINGTON  As Congress and the Bush administration struggle to contain the housing and credit crises  and prevent more Wall Street firms from collapsing as Bear Stearns did  a split is forming over how to strengthen oversight of financial institutions after decades of deregulation .
The administration and Democratic lawmakers in Congress agree that the meltdown in credit markets exposed weaknesses in the nation ’s tangled web of federal and state regulators , which failed to anticipate the effect of so many new players in the industry .
In Congress , Democrats are drafting bills that would create a powerful new regulator  or simply confer new powers on the Federal Reserve  to oversee practices across the entire array of commercial banks , Wall Street firms , hedge funds and nonbank financial companies .
The Treasury Department is rushing to complete its own blueprint for overhauling what is now an alphabet soup of federal and state regulators that often compete against each other and protect their particular slices of the industry as if they were constituents .
Two down , two to go .
Futurama fans Australia - wide finally get a chance to grab their copies of Futurama : The Beast with a Billion Backs , the second feature - length Futurama release from the house of Matt Groening and our interview subject , David X. Cohen .
In this interview , Cohen spills some serious beans about the current status of a proper theatrical release Futurama movie , and he also details the Blu-ray release of the current DVD movie series , special features , easter eggs and much , much more in this very entertaining chat .
' Futurama : The Beast with a Billion Backs ' is out in Australia on August 6 .
A+rare+photo+of+the+man+himself.+Give+it+up+for+David+Cohen,+everybody !
Thank you very much – we really appreciate all the coverage IGN has given us .
Yeah , we 've been through a few ' ordeals ' since then ![ laughs ]
I find it hilarious that you ask that question because , uh , I 'm nervous to say this but Matt Groening was the driving force in insisting that we research that area .
' Research ' is putting it a little too strongly [ laughs ] but I 'd say as far as the cover design of the box in particular – that subject did come up .
I 'd describe it more as , the discussion did come up on the subject of that fetish , so it did n't pass unremarked on ! [ laughs ] [ laughs ]
Yeah !
It was on our minds !
Anyone who says otherwise was lying !
Well , we were very pleasantly surprised .
I mean , we knew the hardcore fans would be happy to have it back , but overall the word I got – which may get filtered a little bit – was that people were pleased with it .
And as far as the success of it , it sold very well and , more importantly , it sold much better than FOX expected .
No , their expectations were low and therefore we are able to surpass them .
But as far as I know , it actually greatly surpassed their expectations for Bender 's Big Score .
And then , just today , I was able to email around [ that ] we managed to occupy the number one best - seller spot with Beast with a Billion Backs on Amazon in the US , Canada and the UK .
We bounced around in and out , but we hit number one in all three of those markets .
… I 'm hyping that up with FOX executives !
Somebody will notice .
Well , I 've been telling people that we 're cautiously optimistic .
The success is apparent and FOX has said as much – but they may not make that phone call and say they want more .
And ' more ' could be one of several forms .
It could be DVD or it could be more episodes for cable or the FOX Network here in the US , or it could be a real feature movie , it could be on the internet , a board game … [ laughs ]
The call has not come in , but we think there is some reason for optimism .
KINGSTON–
The sun was shining , the wind was gentle , and the water calm as a boatload of visitors to Kingston , guests of budding offshore wind developer Trillium Power , embarked last week on a three - hour tour of Lake Ontario .
The cruise was timed to coincide with a global wind power conference at St. Lawrence College .
Trillium 's goal was simple :
Show people , rather than just tell , how much stronger and consistent the wind is when venturing offshore .
About 30 minutes into the ride the mission was accomplished .
What was a relatively smooth cruise became a stomach - churning experience as the wind - battered Catamaran , big enough to hold 180 people , began shifting back and forth in the water .
Staff ran to keep bottles of wine from smashing on to the floor , while guests were urged to stay seated .
" The wind here is three times more powerful , " said John Kourtoff , chief executive of Trillium , as he compared the potential wind energy from his project to existing onshore wind farms scattered around southern Ontario .
Kourtoff wants to build a 750 - megawatt offshore wind farm in these waters , about 15 kilometres off the shore of Prince Edward County .
That works out to about 150 wind turbines , seen as specks from the shoreline .
And there 's potential to double that .
Earlier this month , he announced the creation of Tai Wind , a consortium of North American offshore wind developers who hope , by combining their collective needs , to attract a turbine manufacturer to Ontario .
Already , Germany 's Multibrid is seriously considering the invitation and , sources say , has begun high - level discussions between its executives and Ontario government officials .
Multibrid 's interest is understandable .
A recent report from energy consultancy Helimax concluded there were 64 sites on the Ontario side of the Great Lakes representing up to 34,500 megawatts of offshore wind capacity .
This means the Trillium project is just scratching the surface .
Last week , for example , Toronto Hydro said it was renewing its efforts to establish an 80 - turbine offshore wind farm near the Scarborough Bluffs .
" Offshore wind will be a driver of growth for the wind industry in the years to come , " concluded investment firm Kyoto Planet Asset Management in a research report issued last week .
Also understandable is the government 's interest .
Embracing offshore wind is more than just adding more renewable energy to the grid , it could form the basis of a new " green " industrial strategy aimed at creating green - collar jobs .
Multibrid is potentially the seed for that strategy , as it would need to develop a supply chain to support its Ontario growth plan .
More than that , it sees Ontario as a manufacturing hub as it seeks to expand sales across North America and beyond .
It 's welcome news at a time when production lines and plants are being shut down at Ontario automotive manufacturers .
The idea makes so much sense that some unlikely alliances are being formed .
When Trillium announced the Tai Wind consortium earlier this month , representatives from environmental groups WWF Canada and the David Suzuki Foundation shared the stage with the Canadian Auto Workers union , which fully backs the consortium 's goals .
Natural Resources Minister Donna Cansfield told the Star that Ontario is " open for business " when it comes to offshore wind .
George Smitherman , now minister of energy and infrastructure , wanted so much to express his support for wind - industry growth in Ontario that just days after his appointment he made an unscheduled speech at the Kingston wind conference .
There 's a sense of urgency , and a recognition that if Ontario does n't act on the opportunity , other jurisdictions will .
But a big question remains :
How much does offshore wind cost ?
The Ontario Power Authority , the government agency that effectively determines which large power projects live or die , says offshore wind costs too much to be considered in its 20 - year power system plan .
It acknowledges that the technology provides more power than onshore projects , but not enough to justify the higher cost of building offshore wind farms .
" It should be borne in mind that there is currently no experience in Ontario with offshore wind resources , and it may be that additional information may become available over time that would justify further review of this issue , " the power authority concluded in a recent amendment to its 20 - year plan .
Herein lies a classic chicken - and - egg dilemma .
How can the province get a true sense of development costs without forging ahead on at least one project ?
We can point to ocean - based offshore projects in Europe and make comparisons , but there are major differences to consider that may work in Ontario 's favour .
For one , planting a big wind turbine in relatively shallow and calm lake waters would seem to be an advantage in terms of costs .
And since we 're talking fresh water , there 's no risk of salt degrading the mechanical performance of turbines .
Also important to consider is the degree to which local manufacturing could reduce turbine and component costs .

It 's unclear whether the power authority has taken this into account .
Nor has the agency considered larger economic considerations , such as job creation .
Technically , it does n't have that mandate .
It exists to get what it perceives to be the cheapest , most reliable power it can for consumers and industry .
Power authority executives , mostly former Ontario Hydro engineers who are smart and well intentioned , are n't naturally inclined to include wind , solar and other intermittent sources of renewable energy in their big - picture plans .
They reluctantly do so under direction from the government .
The power authority , said one cruise guest , " has its hands full with nuclear " ( see " Comparing " ) .
Clearly , the government has some strategic decisions to make .
Sooner , it would appear , than later .

From a friend in DC Republican circles …
I think you may be missing a key element of McCain ’s strategy .
Remember , he has NO national ground game to counter Obama ’s vaunted field organization .
No Bush - style 72 hour GOTV operation , no large and disciplined staff — just a small core staff and media operation .
In order to win without a ground game he literally has to destroy Obama as a viable alternative — it is n’t enough to just get close .
That means the ads will be harder edged , more plentiful and more relentless than we ’ve ever seen .
I think Mark McKinnon realized that early on , and did n’t want to be the guy to do to Obama what has to be done to win , as that person will become a political scourge ( a la Atwater ) when all is said and done , even if it works .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
On Friday , federal regulators approved a biotechnology drug from Amgen that treats a rare blood - clotting disorder .
The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug , Nplate , for patients with a disorder that causes the body to attack its own platelets , tiny components of blood that help with clotting .
The condition , which can cause bruising and bleeding after minor injuries , affects about 140,000 people .
Regulators said Nplate is the first drug that directly encourages platelet production by stimulating the patient ’s bone marrow .
The F.D.A. approved the drug based on two studies that showed that it increased patients ’ platelet count over six months .
Patients received weekly injections of Nplate , a genetically engineered version of the protein that encourages platelet production .
The first flyby of the planet Mercury in more than 30 years is resolving some long - standing puzzles about the closest planet to the sun .
Among the findings : the planet 's iron - rich core seems to be shrinking , causing its crust to buckle and crack .
These and other results , documented in 11 papers published today in Science , come from the first round of data from the MErcury Surface , Space ENvironment , GEochemistry and Ranging ( MESSENGER ) spacecraft , which buzzed Mercury earlier this year .
Mercury , the smallest of the eight planets , is unusual among its brethren in that it is mostly core .
Based on its density , researchers know the core is mostly iron , and they estimate that it makes up at least 60 percent of the planet 's mass and accounts for 75 percent of its diameter .
The last time a spacecraft studied the planet up close was from 1974 to 1975 , when the Mariner 10 probe flew past and took images of some 45 percent of the diminutive world .
MESSENGER is the first spacecraft designed to orbit Mercury .
To do so , it will make three flybys of the planet , adjusting its trajectory after each encounter .
During the first flyby on January 14 , MESSENGER flew within 125 miles ( 200 kilometers ) to snap new shots and perform other tests .
Mariner 10 revealed that Mercury has a magnetic field around its equator — the only one of the solar system 's inner planets besides Earth that has one .
That left researchers wondering whether it is generated by the core or if a field frozen in the crust is its source .
MESSENGER found no signs of widespread crustal magnetism , indicating the core has a flowing — molten — outer layer similar to Earth 's core to support the electric currents necessary to generate a magnetic field .
The exact thickness of that layer is unknown , but as it gradually cools , it should form solid chunks that sink like iron snow into the denser , solid inner core , also of unknown size , says geophysicist Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington 's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism , the mission 's principal investigator .
Because solid iron is denser than the liquid form , " as you grow the inner core , the whole volume of the core shrinks , " he says , causing the planet itself to contract .
" We are understanding how much shrinking there has been . "
That understanding comes from images captured by MESSENGER that show elongated " scarps , " or steep slopes riddling the surface .
Researchers interpret these as places where one piece of crust has slid underneath another and forced it upward .
MESSENGER took photos of an additional 20 percent of the planet that Mariner missed as well as areas that it had covered , but with light coming in at a different angle .
This allowed researchers to identify additional scarps missed by its predecessor .
They estimate that Mercury has one third more cracks than they had counted .
Another 30 - year debate has revolved around smooth patches of rock in the planet 's craters , which could represent hardened lava or material ejected during asteroid impacts .
Researchers say the new images reveal geological details indicating that the patches were indeed volcanic in origin .
In another study , the craft used its Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer to identify energetic charged atoms and molecules ( plasma ) caught in Mercury 's magnetic field .
The MESSENGER data reveal charged silicon , sodium , sulfur and water , which researchers conclude was dislodged from the planet 's surface by the sun 's own stream of charged particles , the solar wind .
Solomon says that studying Mercury provides a useful test case for ideas about how planets assemble and operate .
He says he expects to learn even more when MESSENGER enters orbit March 18 , 2011 .

Not a Quirk But a Quark ... a Quark Star !
Super - luminous stellar explosion observed via Caltech 's Palomar Observatory , possibly resulting in a quark star
Illustration of a supernova explosion .
June 26 , 2008
Astronomers recently announced that they have found a novel explanation for a rare type of super - luminous stellar explosion that may have produced a new type of object known as a quark star .
Three exceptionally luminous supernovae explosions have been observed in recent years .
One of them was first observed using a robotic telescope at the California Institute of Technology 's ( Caltech ) Palomar Observatory .
Data collected with Palomar 's Samuel Oschin Telescope was transmitted from the remote mountain site in southern California to astronomers via the High - Performance Wireless Research and Education Network ( HPWREN ) , funded by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) .
The Nearby Supernova Factory research group at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory reported the co-discovery of the supernova , known as SN2005gj .
Researchers in Canada have analyzed this , along with two other supernovae , and believe that they each may be the signature of the explosive conversion of a neutron star into a quark star .
These three supernovae , each 100 times brighter than a typical supernova , have been difficult to explain .
The Canadian research team thinks the explosions herald the creation of a previously unobserved and new class of objects , designated as quark stars .
A quark star is a hypothetical type of star composed of ultra dense quark matter .
Quarks are the fundamental components of protons and neutrons , which make up the nucleus of atoms .
The most dense objects known to exist today are neutron stars -- stars composed entirely of tightly packed neutrons .
A typical neutron star is some 16 miles across , yet has a mass one and a half times the mass of our Sun .
Neutron stars are formed when a massive star undergoes a supernova explosion at the end of its life .
The question is , is a neutron star indeed the most dense object that exists ?
It is thought that if the neutrons are too tightly packed -- if what scientists consider a neutron star is too dense -- the resulting instability may lead to a further collapse , resulting in a second explosion and the creation of a quark star .
The energy that powers that second explosion comes from neutrons breaking down into their component parts : quarks .
Further observations should help to confirm or defeat the hypothesis of quark stars , but in either case , the use of a high - speed network like HPWREN helps astronomers across the world explore the frontiers of science .

In negotiations between Archbishop Williams ’s staff and three American bishops designated by Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori , presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church , the consolation offered to the American for not being seated was an opportunity to be interviewed , at a conference session , by a BBC reporter .
Bishop Robinson said he rejected that as falling short of the “ substantive and meaningful ” role he wanted , but said he had urged other Episcopalian bishops , at a meeting this spring in Navasota , Tex. , not to boycott Lambeth on his behalf .
In the end , 150 American bishops came , led by Bishop Jefferts Schori .

Bishop Robinson characterized the role he fashioned for himself here as nonconfrontational .
“ I think the leadership here expected me to show up , and protest , and try to wrestle the microphone from Archbishop Rowan , or try to get into meetings to which I was n’t invited , and I ’ve done none of these things , ” he said .
Instead , he said , what he had sought with his gadfly presence was “ to bear witness to the love of God I know as a follower of Jesus Christ , and to be a constant reminder to the bishops gathered here that there are gay and lesbian Christians sitting in the pews in every one of their churches , and that they have taken vows to serve all in their flock . ”
Talking in the courtyard of the Falstaff , founded as a 15th - century pilgrims ’ inn , it seemed natural to ask whether he saw himself in the mold of Thomas à Becket , the archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred in the cathedral a slingshot away .
“ Heavens no ! ” he said , chuckling , “ I have no aspirations of that kind at all , only to be a good bishop . ”
To make the point , he gestured to a burly British Army veteran seated close by , hired as his security companion for the tour , and cited the fact that he and his partner , Mark Andrew , wore bulletproof vests at his consecration five years ago .
By Bishop Robinson ’s estimate , at least some countries represented at the Lambeth meeting have the death penalty for homosexuality , while about 25 others make same - sex relationships punishable by imprisonment .
But he said that at least some conservative bishops seemed open to dialogue .
American bishops have held two evening sessions to introduce Bishop Robinson to non-Americans at the conference ; these have drawn about 200 bishops and their spouses , including some from African provinces that have been strongly hostile to compromise on homosexuality .
“ A goodly number of the bishops took a considerable risk by being there , ” the bishop said .
“ There were those among them who spoke very movingly , and without rancor , of the problems my consecration has posed for them .
Afterwards , they told me they would pray for me , and asked me to pray for them . ”
If there was any edge to the bishop ’s feelings , and it was only fleeting , it came in his references to Archbishop Williams .
As an Oxford - and - Cambridge educated theologian , the 58 - year - old archbishop gained a reputation as a deep - thinking liberal , strongly sympathetic to gay rights , and underscored that as archbishop of Wales by appointing openly gay men to the clergy .
“ We were dancing in the streets when Archbishop Rowan was appointed , ” Bishop Robinson said of the prelate ’s elevation to the Canterbury seat in 2003 .
But then came the archbishop ’s efforts to placate the conservatives , and his denial of a Lambeth invitation to Bishop Robinson .
The two men have met only once , in 2005 , and that meeting , Bishop Robinson said , was held at the deanery of St. Paul ’s Cathedral , not at Lambeth Palace , to avoid any chance of it being noticed by the British press .
He said he sympathized with the archbishop , who had been placed in “ an impossible position ” by the uncompromising attitude that hard - line conservatives in the communion had taken on homosexuality .
But by excluding him , the American said , the archbishop had made a strategic miscalculation .
“ In the end , the conservatives did n’t come to the conference anyway , only proving that bullies never get enough , ” he said .
“ They always come back for more . ”
" Some seem to believe we should negotiate with terrorists and radicals , as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along , " said Bush , in what White House aides privately acknowledged was a reference to calls by Obama and other Democrats for the U.S. president to sit down for talks with leaders like Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
" We have heard this foolish delusion before , " Bush said in remarks to the Israeli Knesset .
" As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American Senator declared : ' Lord , if only I could have talked to Hitler , all of this might have been avoided . '
We have an obligation to call this what it is — the false comfort of appeasement , which has been repeatedly discredited by history . "
— JERUSALEM ( CNN ) –
In a particularly sharp blast from halfway around the world , President Bush suggested Thursday that Sen. Barack Obama and other Democrats are in favor of " appeasement " of terrorists in the same way U.S. leaders appeased Nazis in the run-up to World War II .
Suzanne Goldenberg reports that after the primary results in Kentucky and Oregon Obama is on the verge of nomination for the Democratic party

The derailment of the original E.P.A. report was first made known in March by Representative Henry A. Waxman , Democrat of California , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
The refusal to open the e-mail has not been made public .
In early December , the E.P.A. ’s draft finding that greenhouse gases endanger the environment used Energy Department data from 2007 to conclude that it would be cost effective to require the nation ’s motor vehicle fleet to average 37.7 miles per gallon in 2018 , according to government officials familiar with the document .
About 10 days after the finding was left unopened by officials at the Office of Management and Budget , Congress passed and President Bush signed a new energy bill mandating an increase in average fuel - economy standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 .
The day the law was signed , the E.P.A. administrator rejected the unanimous recommendation of his staff and denied California a waiver needed to regulate vehicle emissions of greenhouse gases in the state , saying the new law ’s approach was preferable and climate change required global , not regional , solutions .
California ’s regulations would have imposed tougher standards .
The Transportation Department made its own fuel - economy proposals public almost two months ago ; they were based on the assumption that gasoline would range from $ 2.26 per gallon in 2016 to $ 2.51 per gallon in 2030 , and set a maximum average standard of 35 miles per gallon in 2020 .
The White House , which did not oppose the Transportation Department proposals , has become more outspoken on the need for a comprehensive approach to greenhouse gases , specifically rejecting possible controls deriving from older environmental laws .
In a speech in April , Mr. Bush called for an end to the growth of greenhouse gases by 2025  a timetable slower than many scientists say is required .
His chairman of the Council of Environmental Quality , James Connaughton , said a “ train wreck ” would result if regulations to control greenhouse gases were authorized piecemeal under laws like the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act .
VirtualBox and VMware are two of the most popular virtualization apps you can get for your PC .
Between them , they let you run virtual machines of the most popular operating systems from the whole spectrum of platforms – Linux and its many distros , Android , even macOS .
But the two virtualization heavyweights have their differences .
Both have free and premium versions , each offering a different degree of functionality and variations in performance .
Here we weigh the two up against each other , helping you decide which one is best for your needs .
We ’ll mainly be comparing the free versions of VirtualBox and VMware , though will also mention the premium versions when relevant .
Want to know more about how virtualization works ?
Here ’s our full explanation of virtualization , or you can check out our list of the best free virtualization tools for Windows 10 .
License
VirtualBox is distributed with the GNU General Public License and is free for everyone to use .
Its Extension Pack is also free for personal , educational or evaluation use , but requires a Enterprise license fee for commercial use .
VMware Workstation
Player is free for non-commercial , personal and home use .
The Workstation Pro comes with a fee , but provides more advanced virtualization solution .
Features
Both VirtualBox and VMware offer vast repositories of virtual machines you can use .
VirtualBox maybe has a bit of an edge here because it has a whole bunch virtual machine options built into it ( macOS , Windows XP , various Linux builds and so on ) .
Obviously for licensed products like Windows and macOS , you ’ll need to legitimately procure the boot media to actually use them .
VMware does n’t offer any virtual machine presets from the off , but they ’re easy enough to find at sites like OS Boxes or directly from sites like CloudReady ( a Chromium OS fork ) or Android -x86 .
VirtualBox has one feature that really separates it from VMware Workstation Player , and that ’s snapshots .
These are essentially save - states that let you save a virtual machine in its exact state at that moment .
You can then return to that exact point in its usage whenever you like , or even transfer that snapshot to use on another system .
You can also download an extension pack that adds support for USB 2.0 and 3.0 devices , virtual disk encryption etc .
In VMware Player , you ’ll need to download specific drivers with the virtual machine to add USB 2 and 3 support , while certain older OSes , like Windows Vista , wo n’t allow it altogether .
VMware only offers snapshots and the option to run multiple VMs simultaneously in the paid Workstation Pro , which comes with a whole host of other features related to networking and security that will particularly benefit enterprise users .
Overall , both VirtualBox and VMware make it very easy to get virtual machines up and running .
They also both have useful features like shared folders , drag - and - dropping of windows between guest and host , and shared data transfers .
Performance
It ’s in the area of performance that a gap starts really opening up between VirtualBox and VMware .
Testing of various virtual machines has shown VMware Player to have much faster performance than VirtualBox , which suffers from slowdowns and bugs that really become visible if you start dabbling in games or more demanding software .
The drag - and - drop feature , which is in both VirtualBox and VMware Player , often does n’t work in VirtualBox , and can even cause the entire app to crash .
In general , the more powerful your PC , the less visible VirtualBox ’s performance problems become , as your PC can make up for its shortcomings .
But not everyone has access to a high - end machine , so if you ’re looking for performance above all then the free version of VMware wins out .
Networking
Both VirtualBox and VMware utilize a NAT interface to communicate with guest machines , and let the guest machines communicate with each other ( assuming you ’re running more than one ) .
But the NAT setup is n’t quite as effective in VirtualBox , because it relies on port forwarding .
VMware has an advantage here , in that it directly uses the host ’s adapter in the virtual machine ’s NAT virtual switch .
This makes it much simpler and faster for all the guest machines to “ see ” the host in their networks .
Conclusion
For people just starting out in virtualization , or simply wanting to test apps in various operating systems , both VirtualBox and VMware do a good job .
VMware is more stable and offers better graphics support , so will work better if you , for example , want to play Android games in an Android virtual machine .
VirtualBox does however have a few more features that may interest those wishing to play around in multiple VMs simultaneously ( and snapshots are awesome ) .
For bigger businesses and enterprise users however , VMware ’s paid offerings like vSphere and Workstation Pro offer a lot more versatility with things like networking and server virtualization .
In other words , for professional purposes , it ’s worth paying up to get VMware ’s more advanced products .

Colonel Arthur Anderson is the chief of human use and ethics at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ) , the bioweapons facility where Dr. Ivins worked and where the anthrax strains were apparently obtained by the anthrax killer .
In that position , Colonel Anderson 's responsibilities include the following jobs :
" Conduct inquiries and investigations upon receipt of allegations of scientific misconduct or improper researcher behavior .
***
Prepare timely and intensive fact - finding reviews of minimal risk protocols that qualify for expedited review ; ...
Advise senior officials in writing of the approvability of protocols , and addenda ; ... Conduct substantive continuing review of active protocols ; ... Investigate issues arising during conduct of studies "
Colonel Anderson is also a highly - respected scientist in his own right ( a pathologist ) .
Anderson disputes two of the government allegations against Dr. Ivins .
First , he disputes the allegation that Ivins told no one that he had found anthrax in his lab for many months .
Specifically , as reported in today 's Wall Street Journal :
" Col . Anderson says Dr. Ivins told him about the lapse in safety shortly after it occurred , contradicting Army findings in 2002 that Dr. Ivins had told no one . "
Anderson 's role as the person in charge of " conduct[ing ] inquiries and investigations upon receipt of allegations of scientific misconduct or improper researcher behavior " and of " investigat[ing ] issues arising during conduct of studies " is therefore important .
He was an appropriate person for Ivins to speak to about his anthrax tests ( admittedly , protocol required Ivins to tell others as well ; but the fact that Ivins told Anderson shows good faith and a lack of guilty conscience on Ivins ' part ) .
Second , Anderson says that social worker Jean Duley 's conduct was wholly inappropriate and lacked credibility .
Anderson , as an ethics expert and someone who knew Ivins well , simply does n't buy Duley 's allegations .
Again , I do n't know whether Ivins is guilty or not .
But the government 's allegations to date hold no water .
FBI said to have stalked Ivins ' family Diane Sweet
Published : Wednesday August 6 , 2008
Print This Email This Did FBI cross the line in anthrax probe ?
Before killing himself last week , Army scientist Bruce Ivins told friends that government agents had stalked him and his family for months , offered his son $ 2.5 million to rat him out and tried to turn his hospitalized daughter against him with photographs of dead anthrax victims .
The pressure on Ivins was extreme , a high - risk strategy that has failed the FBI before .
The government was determined to find the villain in the 2001 anthrax attacks ; it was too many years without a solution to the case that shocked and terrified a post - 9/11 nation .
The last thing the FBI needed was another embarrassment .
Overreaching damaged the FBIs reputation in the high - profile investigations : the Centennial Olympic Park bombing probe that falsely accused Richard Jewell ; the theft of nuclear secrets and botched prosecution of scientist Wen Ho Lee ; and , in this same anthrax probe , the smearing of an innocent man  Ivins colleague Steven Hatfill .
In the current case , Ivins complained privately that FBI agents had offered his son , Andy , $ 2.5 million , plus  the sports car of his choice  late last year if he would turn over evidence implicating his father in the anthrax attacks , according to a former U.S. scientist who described himself as a friend of Ivins .
Ivins also said the FBI confronted Ivins daughter , Amanda , with photographs of victims of the anthrax attacks and told her ,  This is what your father did ,  according to the scientist , who spoke only on condition of anonymity because their conversation was confidential .
The scientist said Ivins was angered by the FBIs alleged actions , which he said included following Ivins family on shopping trips .
Washington attorney Barry Coburn , who represents Amanda Ivins , declined to comment on the investigation .
An attorney for Andy Ivins also declined to comment .
The FBI declined to describe its investigative techniques of Ivins .
Detox and rehab for Ivins ?
The Washington Post reports today accounts from a fellow scientist , and Ivin 's counselor alleging that Ivin's had difficulty with alcohol and prescription drugs that led to two inpatient stays for detoxification , rehabilitation , and therapy sessions from the counselor who eventually sought a protection order from Ivins : " Late last fall , Bruce E. Ivins was drinking a liter of vodka some nights , taking large doses of sleeping pills and anti-anxiety drugs , and typing out rambling e-mails into the early morning hours , according to a fellow scientist who helped him through this period .
It was around the time that FBI agents showed Ivins 's 24 - year - old daughter pictures of the victims who had died in the 2001 anthrax attacks and told her , " Your father did this , " the scientist said .
The agents also offered her twin brother the $ 2.5 million reward for solving the anthrax case -- and the sports car of his choice .
Ivins " was e-mailing me late at night with gobbledygook , ranting and raving " about what he called the " persecution " of his family , said the scientist , a recovering alcohol and drug user who had been sober for more than a decade .
The scientist , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said that he had been contacted by a co-worker of Ivins 's at the sprawling Army biodefense laboratory in Fort Detrick and that the co-worker said the veteran anthrax researcher " has really gone down the tubes . "
The scientist agreed to help Ivins , focusing on a 12 - step recovery program .
He was one of many people who intervened in Ivins 's life before he committed suicide last week as law officials were preparing to indict him in the anthrax attacks that killed five people .
Before he died July 29 of a Tylenol overdose , Ivins , 62 , had two inpatient stays at Maryland hospitals for detoxification and rehabilitation and attended two sets of therapy sessions with a counselor who eventually sought court protection from him .
Ivins had just returned from a four - week stay at a psychiatric hospital in Western Maryland in late May when he wrote the fellow scientist in recovery a calm , six - sentence e-mail .
" I hope , " it said , " that both of us avoid relapsing into our previous substance abuse . "
Since his death , Ivins 's long - term mental health and the psychological effects of the investigation have become increasingly prominent questions .
The counselor he saw for group therapy and biweekly individual sessions , who would eventually tell a judge that he was a " sociopathic , homicidal killer , " had a troubled past .
Jean C. Duley , who worked until recent days for Comprehensive Counseling Associates in Frederick , is licensed as an entry - level drug counselor and was , according to one of her mentors , allowed to work with clients only under supervision of a more - seasoned professional .
Shortly before she sought a " peace order " against Ivins , Duley had completed 90 days of home detention after a drunken - driving arrest in December , and she has acknowledged drug use in her past .
In a 1999 interview with The Washington Post , Duley described her background as a motorcycle gang member and a drug user .
" Heroin . Cocaine . PCP , " said Duley , who then used the name Jean Wittman .
" You name it , I did it . "
Ivins starting working with Duley after a stint in rehabilitation about six months ago .
It was not the first time , though , that people sensed that he had an addiction problem .
W. Russell Byrne , an infectious disease specialist who worked with Ivins in the bacteriology division at Fort Detrick until Byrne 's 2000 retirement from the Army , has kept up with his former colleagues .
Byrne said he remembers offering Ivins a beer one night several years ago when Ivins made a rare appearance at a party at Bushwaller 's , an Irish pub in the heart of Frederick where their crowd of scientists sometimes gathered .
" He declined , " Byrne recalled .
" He said he had a family history of alcoholism . "
Gerry Andrews , who worked with Ivins at Fort Detrick for nine years and was the bacteriology division 's chief from 2000 to 2003 , said that it was rare for Ivins to join the other researchers after work for beer and that Ivins drank so little he was kidded about being a teetotaler .
Andrews said that after he retired from the Army , he kept in touch with Ivins via e-mail , sharing jokes and pondering scientific questions .
Then in fall 2007 , Andrews said , " he kind of fell off the radar screen .
I found out that there was some issues with his house being surveilled . "
According to the scientist , who said he spent about 80 hours with Ivins to help him recover from his addiction , the FBI agents pressured Ivins 's children , and they were pressuring Ivins in public places .
One day in March , when Ivins was at a Frederick mall with his wife and son , the agents confronted the researcher and said , " You killed a bunch of people . "
Then they turned to his wife and said , " Do you know he killed people ? " according to the scientist . "
Case ' solved ' but will ' remain open '
The case of the anthrax - laced letters that killed five people in 2001 and alarmed a nation already traumatized by the Sept. 11 terror attacks has been solved  but will remain open for now to wrap up legal and investigative loose ends , according U.S. officials .
The government were to begin briefing victims and their survivors at FBI headquarters Wednesday  eight days after the top suspect , Army biowarfare scientist Bruce Ivins , killed himself as prosecutors prepared to charge him with murder .
Ivins ' lawyer maintains the brilliant but troubled scientist would have been proven innocent had he lived .
And some of Ivins ' friends and former co-workers at the Fort Detrick biological warfare lab in Frederick , Md. , say they doubt he could or would have unleashed the deadly toxin .
But after nearly seven years  much of which was spent pointing the finger at the wrong suspect  the FBI is ready to end the " Amerithrax " investigation by outlining its evidence against Ivins , according to two U.S. officials .
They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case publicly .
The Justice Department " has a legal and moral obligation to make official statements first to the victims and their families , then the public , " Attorney General Michael Mukasey said Tuesday .
" And that 's the order in which we 're going to do it . "
Officially , the case will stay open for an undetermined but short period of time .
That will allow the government to complete several legal and investigatory matters that need to be wrapped up before it can be closed , the officials said .
Families of victims were to get the first glimpse inside the case at the morning FBI briefing .
The Justice Department , meanwhile , was expected to ask a federal judge to unseal documents revealing how the FBI closed in on Ivins .
That evidence should answer many questions in the bizarre investigation .
Still , skeptics may never be satisfied if the documents fail to show conclusively that Ivins was solely responsible for mailing the anthrax letters that killed five and sickened 17 in the weeks following the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York and Washington .
The case may turn on a couple of key points , including : _ An advanced DNA analysis that matched the anthrax used in the attacks to a specific batch controlled by Ivins .
It is unclear , however , how the FBI eliminated as suspects others in the lab who had access to it .
_ Ivins ' purported motive of sending the anthrax in a twisted effort to test a cure for it , according to authorities .
Ivins complained of the limitations of animal testing and shared in a patent for an anthrax vaccine .
No evidence has been revealed so far to bolster that theory .
_ Why Ivins would have mailed the deadly letters from Princeton , N.J. , a seven - hour round trip from his home .
In perhaps the strangest explanation to emerge in the case so far , authorities said Ivins had been obsessed with the sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma for more than 30 years .
The letters were sent from a mailbox down the street from the sorority 's offices at Princeton University .
Investigators can't place Ivins in Princeton but say the evidence will show he had disturbing attitudes toward women .
Other haunting details about Ivins ' mental health have emerged , and his therapist described him as having a history of homicidal and sociopathic thoughts .

There ’s Something Fishy In That Soda
Sky News reports that the Japan Tobacco Company has launched Â a new ‘ fizzy ’ drink called Unagi NoboriÂ or ‘ Surging Eel ’ .
Â
The drink went on sale this month during the country ’s eel - eating season .
The yellow - colored fizzy drink contains extracts from the head and bones of eel plus five vitamins that are contained in the fish .
Â
It ’s said to be the best way to stay cool in hot weather .
“ It ’s mainly for men who are exhausted by the summer ’s heat , ” said company spokesman Kazunori Hayashi .
Eel is a sought after delicacy in Japan often prepared in a style called ‘ kaba - yaki ’ in which it is broiled and covered in a sweet sauce .
The drink costs about one - tenth as much as broiled eel but is said to have a similar flavor .
I suppose the next step will be to use it as a mixer with rice wine and Â offer it as liquid fish cakes .

Employment and Support Allowance rules have changed – new evidence is needed for claims
UNIVERSAL
Credit is not the only state benefit to be forced to alter due to coronavirus .
New Style Employment and Support Allowance ( ESA ) has also been altered , with new rules issued today .
This ...
There has been a somewhat heated debate about Scala vs. Erlang on the blogosphere recently .
The future will be multi-cored , and the question is how the multi- core crises will be solved .
Scala and Erlang are two languages that aspire to be the solution , but they are a bit different .
What are the pros and cons with their approaches ?
The problem
Moore ’s law has changed .
We do n’t get the same increase in clock frequency as we used to .
Instead , we get more cores .
Today , even your laptop probably has two cores .
To utilize more than one core , your application has to be concurrency - aware .
If your customer bought an eight - core machine , you will have a hard time explaining to them that it ’s normal that the application only uses about 12 % of the CPU capacity , even if the machine is dedicated to that particular application .
In the future , this will be even worse .
Not only will your sequential code not run faster , it will actually run slower .
The reason is that the more cores you get , the slower each core will run for power and heat reasons .
In a couple of years , Intel will give us 32 cores , and there are trends that suggests that will have thousands of cores before we know it .
But each core will be very slow compared to todays cores .
Concurrent code
One obvious way to solve the problem is to write ( and rewrite ) software to be concurrent .
The most common way to do that is to use threads , but most developers consider thread - based applications particularly hard to write .
Deadlocks , starvation and race conditions are concepts that are way too familiar for a majority of developers doing concurrency .
Both Erlang and Scala take away a lot of that pain .
An brief overview of the languages
Scala is sometimes seen as the next big JVM language .
It combines the object - oriented paradigm with the functional paradigm , has a terse syntax compared to Java , is statically typed and is as fast or sometimes even faster than Java .
There are numerous reasons to take a serious look at Scala .
Erlang is a language designed for robustness , but because of its design , it is thereby a language that scales well .
It predates Java , but it is often considered to be a language of the concurrent future .
It is a dynamically typed , functional language , with some remarkable examples of uptime .
The debate
So what ’s the Scala vs. Erlang debate all about ?
In the end , performance and scalability , but the debate includes other things like style , language features and library support as well .
The debate was started unintentionally when Ted Neward gave his opinions about a number of languages and that “ the fact that [ Erlang ] runs on its own interpreter [ is ] bad ” .
Steve Vinoski and Ted then had a couple of rounds of debate , but the discussion then moved to a couple of other blogs where it highlighted interesting differences and similarities between Scala and Erlang .
We ’ll summarize each interesting point to show pros and cons of each language and the different views on some problems .
Reliability
Steve Vinoski wrote a response to Ted ’s post where he gave his take on that Erlang runs its own interpreter :
The fact that it runs on its own interpreter , good ; otherwise , the reliability would n’t be there and it would be just another curious but useless concurrency - oriented language experiment .
Steve is talking about the problem that even if a language itself is reliable , everything it stands upon has to be reliable too .
Since Erlang is designed from the bottom up for reliability and thereby concurrency , it does n’t suffer from usual problems when it comes to concurrency , primarily that the underlying libraries needs to play well in a concurrent setting .
Scala on the other hand lives on top of the JVM and one of the most important selling points is the potential usage of all existing Java code .
However , a lot of Java code is not designed for concurrency , and Scala code needs to take this into account .
Lightweight processes
To run massively concurrent applications , you need a lot of parallel execution .
This can be done in several ways .
Using threads is one common way , using processes is another .
The difference is that a thread shares memory with other threads , processes share nothing .
That means that threads needs locking mechanisms like mutexes to prevent two threads from manipulating the same memory at the same time , but processes do n’t suffer from that problem and instead uses some kind of message passing to communicate with other processes .
But processes are normally expensive regarding performance and memory , and that is a reason why people often choose thread based concurrency , even though it ’s a harder programming model .
Steve Vinoski writes :
Massive concurrency capabilities become far easier with an architecture that provides lightweight processes that share nothing , but that does n’t mean that once you design it , the rest is just a simple matter of programming .
Erlang takes this approach to concurrency .
An Erlang process is very lightweight , and Erlang applications commonly have tens - of thousands of threads or more .
Scala on the other hand does the same thing with event - based actors .
Yariv Sadan explains how :
Scala has two types of Actors : thread - based and event based .
Thread based actors execute in heavyweight OS threads .
They never block each other , but they do n’t scale to more than a few thousand actors per VM .
Event - based actors are simple objects .
They are very lightweight , and , like Erlang processes , you can spawn millions of them on a modern machine .
Yariv explains that there is a difference though :
The difference with Erlang processes is that within each OS thread , event based actors execute sequentially without preemptive scheduling .
This makes it possible for an event - based actor to block its OS thread for a long period of time ( perhaps indefinitely ) .
Immutability
Erlang is a functional language .
This means that data is immutable , like Java ’s strings , and there is no risk of side effects .
Any operation on some data will result in a new modified version of that data , but the old one stays the same .
Immutability is a highly regarded ingredient when it comes to robustness , since no code can unintentionally change data that someone else is dependent upon , but from a concurrency point of view , it is also an important feature .
If data is immutable , the risk of it being changed by two parallel execution paths does n’t exist and data can even be copied to other machines since there is no way for it to change and nothing to keep in sync .
Since Scala is based upon the JVM and combines an object - oriented and functional approach , there are no guarantees of immutability like in pure functional languages .
However , in the comment section of Yariv ’s post , a very interesting discussion between Yariv and David Pollack on interesting differences between the languages took place .
David , who is the creator of the Scala web framework Lift , gives his views on immutability .
Immutability — Erlang enforces this and there ’s almost no way around it .
But you trade the rest of Scala ’s amazingly powerful type system for enforcement of this single type .
I do my Scala Actor coding with immutable data and I have Scala ’s type system to enforce the rest of my types .
Yariv asks :
Does n’t sending only immutable types a big limitation ?
It means you can’t , for example , load a simple bean from Hibernate and send it to another actor .
David answers :
I ’ve built a number of production systems based on Scala Actors .
There ’s very little work actually required to deal with the immutable issue .
You just define your case classes ( the messages ) to be immutable and away you go .
Type systems
Erlang is dynamically typed .
Scala is statically typed and has a stronger type system than Java .
However , a big difference compared to Java is that Scala has type inference .
This means that you can omit a lot of type annotations , which makes the code cleaner but the compiler will still do all checks .
The debate about pros and cons of dynamic and static type systems will likely never come to an end , but that is a noticeable difference between Erlang and Scala .
Tail recursion or loops
Yariv again :
Functional programming and recursion go hand - in - hand .
In fact , you could hardly write working Erlang programs without tail recursion because Erlang does n’t have loops — it uses recursion for everything ( which I believe is a good thing :) ) .
This is definitely something that differs Erlang a lot from Scala .
Scala has a much more traditional style of iterations , but David Pollack does n’t see an advantage for tail recursion in this context :
Tail recursion —
It ’s a non-issue for event - based actors .
In that case , it all comes down to preference and style .
Hot swapping code
Since Erlang was designed for reliability , hot swapping code ( replacing code in runtime ) is built in .
The JVM has some support for hot swapping code .
Classes can be changed , but due to the static type system , method signatures can not be changed - only the content of a method .
There are third party tools to get around that , and there are frameworks that promotes a programming style that makes it easier to swap classes in running systems , but because of how a Scala Actor is built up , how swapping works even though it runs on the JVM .
Jonas Bonér gives a thorough example of how to do it .
Summary
Both Scala and Erlang are languages that target the multi-core crises .
They come from different background and eras and thereby approach some problems differently , but in many ways they have more in common than they differ , at least when it comes to the concurrency issues .
Erlang has been around for a couple of decades , and has proved itself in many critical real - world systems .
One of it ’s drawbacks is that it is a bit of an island and the recent polygot programming trend is not likely to affect Erlang community that much .
Scala on the other hand is the new kid on the block for the same type of applications .
There are real world applications just coming out the door , and there are companies that are betting their future on it .
Scala ’s biggest advantage compared to Erlang is that is runs on the JVM and can use all existing Java code , frameworks and many of the tools .
That said , that power comes with great responsibility , since most Java code do n’t automatically fit well the Scala ’s Actor model .
Both languages offer similar ways to solve a increasingly pressing problem that mainstream languages do n’t help developers with very well .
Hopefully you have a slightly better insight about which language to take a closer look at for your particular situation after reading this debate summary .
The future is multi-cored .
Scala and Erlang is likely to increase in popularity .
Normally , the cutter charges are high - explosives strapped to a metal wedge on the side of the beam .
Many scientists and engineers have looked at the way the WTC towers fell and remarked that it had the appearance of controlled demolition .
The buildings collapsed symmetrically , and fell straight down .
The speed of the fall indicated that the buildings were collapsing unimpeded .
They must have had the “ legs ” simultaneously pulled out from under them , because a layered collapse from the top down would have taken several minutes , whereas the observed collapse took place in less than 20 seconds .
But the conjecture has been that the cutter charges consisted not of explosives but of finely - powdered aluminum mixed with iron oxide , with added sulfur .
This mixture contains both fuel and oxidant – it needs no air – and it burns hot enough to melt steel .
The trade name for this product is “ Thermate . ”
In addition to the speed and symmetry of collapse , another anomaly in the WTC collapse was the violent explosions .
Firemen reported earthshaking blasts from the basement before collapse , and the impact areas in the upper floorss of the buildings exploded just at the onset of collapse .
Jet fuel burns but cannot explode .
In an article published this week in the journal Environmentalist , chemical engineer Kevin Ryan collects evidence from EPA documents that suggest there was both Thermate and high - explosives in the debris from the WTC collapse .
Ryan was formerly employed by Environmental Health Labs , a division of Underwriters Labs , before he was fired for raising these and other questions .
Fires at the WTC site persisted for weeks after 9/11 , despite firefighters ’ use of water and chemical extinguishers to smother the flames .
This suggests that it was a fuel - oxidant mixture that was burning .
Pools of red - hot molten iron could not have been caused by burning jet fuel or building materials , because these burn at a much lower temperature than steel melts .
Ryan ’s evidence consists in traces of 1,3 - diphenylpropane as well as sulfur and particulate matter , reported by the EPA to have appeared in spikes continuing as late as March , 2002 .
Ryan believes that these came from brief , intense fires ignited by the molten steel when it came in contact with yet - unburned plastic building materials during the clean - up process .

Progress , of the best kind , is comparatively slow .
Great results cannot be achieved at once ; and we must be satisfied to advance in life as we walk , step by step .
Samuel Smiles ( 1812 -1904 )
These days the typical , on one knee , at dinner , proposal is n’t always what women are looking for .
A more unorthodox approach is not only welcomed , but often expected .
Here ’s a look at some of the most outrageous marriage proposals that may help you rediscover what Michael Bolton truly meant when he graced us with his interpretation of “ When a Man Loves a Woman . ”
Baby , You Make Me Feel Weightless !
Alexander & Graciela Loucopoulos
Alex wanted to give his space cadet , soul mate Graciela a very special birthday gift , so he booked a Boeing 727 aircraft to take them on a zero - gravity adventure .
The aircraft is designed to fly up to 35,000 feet and then nose dive to 24,000 , giving thrill seekers a chance to experience a near - zero - gravity effect .
As they floated around the cabin in weightless delight , Alex popped the question .
He was worried that the ring might float away during the dive , but all went as planned .
Graciela is possibly the only woman in the world who can say she got engaged at zero gravity .
The couple plan on spending their ten year anniversary in orbit .
“ If I Call You Cortana , Can I Be Your Masterchief ? ” Moviesign & Furtive Penguin On November 3 , 2007 Moviesign ( his username ) made a Forge map in Halo® 3 , and set up what his girlfriend of over two years ( Furtive Penguin ) thought was going to be a two - on - two match with his friends .
After they started the game , Moviesign led Furtive Penguin to a spot where he claimed he ’d left an energy sword .
Instead there was a nice top - down view where he had spelled out a proposal using weapons .
He then asked her to be his teammate for life .
Furtive Penguin and Moviesign recently moved from Indianapolis to Chicago where she ( Penguin ) is a copyeditor and he ( Movie ) is a graphic designer .
They have n’t set a wedding date yet .
As Furtive Penguin said , “ We ’re waiting to see what the release date is for the next Halo game .
We do n’t want any conflicts . ”
I Know You Love Writers , So I Wrote You a Book Cameron & Angie Kelly Cameron wrote and published a 113 page book , 50 Reasons Why You Should Marry Me and 51 Reasons Why I Should Marry You .
The book included pictures and reasons such as , “ I always clean the bathroom , ” and “ I ’m a great spooner . ”
He gave her the book on Valentine ’s Day while they enjoyed breakfast together .
She said yes !
No Diamonds , Only Bejeweles Bernie Peng & Tammy Li Once Bernie and Tammy began discussing marriage , he became determined to find a creative way to propose .
Tammy , who does n’t consider herself a video game lover , happens to be a fan of Bejeweled .
Bernie , a financial software programmer , spent a month reprogramming the popluar video game , Bejeweled , to propose to Tammy .
On December 22 , Bernie told Tammy he had found something for her and presented the game .
She played the game until she hit a score that triggered a digital pink sapphire ring and a marriage proposal .
Do n’t worry , Bernie did give her an identical ring that she could actually wear .
The makers of Bejeweled were so impressed by Bernie they offered to pay for part of the wedding .
PopCap is providing over 200 copies of “ Bejeweled 2 Deluxe ” as wedding favors for the guests and are throwing in $ 1,000 for decorations to give the wedding a jewel theme .
They are also flying the couple to Seattle for part of their honeymoon .
She said yes !
Come on Baby Light My Fire Todd & Malissa Grannis
Todd has some very interesting friends .
One in particular was well - known stunt man Eric Barkley , who ’s done many human - torch fire jumps .
Todd devised a plan to not only entertain family and friends at their annual 4th of July family reunion , but to surprise his girlfriend , Malissa , with a red hot proposal .
With Eric ’s help ,
Todd set up a stunt to launch himself off a platform above a swimming pool while completely engulfed in flames .
Eric dressed him in the appropriate fire - retardant attire , flaming cape and all .
Todd ’s family was in on his proposal plans and the entire event was kept secret until sunset .
As Todd stood ready to jump , Eric lit his good friend on fire , and while engulfed in flames , Todd ran off the platform in a breathtaking fiery display of passion .
As he lit up the night sky and soared through the air like Superman , he somehow prepared himself to pop the question .
After an extinguishing splash , he surfaced and pulled off his hood , walked over to Malissa and got down on one knee .
“ Malissa , you make me hot .
I want to get the point across that I ’m on fire for you , ” said Todd .
Malissa was laughing from the excitement and insanity of the whole display .
“ I kept laughing , thinking he was so funny – why was he on his knees ? ”
Then Todd pulled out the ring and popped the question .
“ Will you marry me , Malissa ? ”
Todd placed the ring on her finger .
“ Yes ! ” she exclaimed .
The couple had been dating for a year and had discussed marriage , but never seriously .
Not surprisingly , they share a personal hero , Richard Branson as well as his adventurous , risk - taking personality .
But Did You Know , that When it Snows Seal & Heidi Klum Many stars ’ marriage proposals take place during romantic getaways .
But music star Seal took the idea of a romantic getaway one step further when he popped the question to Heidi Klum .
On December 23 , 2004 , the crooner flew the supermodel by helicopter to the top of a glacier in Whistler , British Columbia , and he proposed in an igloo that was built especially for the occasion .
The couple married on a beach in Mexico on May 10 , 2005 , and since then , they have had two sons together .
Message in a Bottle Stephen & Kimberly Berg Stephen and Kimberly met while attending college in Florida .
He thought he had no chance with such a beautiful girl and held off pursuing her , but when they finally started dating , it was n’t long before they realized they were really onto something .
Stephen wanted to find a one - of - a - kind way to start their life together , and Kimberly had recently planned a day trip for some girl time with a few of her girlfriends .
He knew it was the perfect opportunity to propose , and began brainstorming fun ideas .
A little mystery goes a long way in every romantic relationship , so Stephen set out to give his love a day in paradise she ’d not soon forget .
He chartered a boat for the day and worked in cahoots with the captain to plant his message in a bottle on a secluded island where he planned to pop the question .
When Kimberly arrived at the docks expecting to take a day with the girls , who were a part of his plot , she was met by her beau who kidnapped her away for a day of fun on the open sea .
The captain navigated his vessel to the location as planned and dropped the two off to explore .
As they walked along the beach , Kimberly ’s eyes caught sight of this bottle , and the two moved in to check out what they had “ discovered ” .
As she read on her heart sank and she soon found herself in the arms of her fiancé .
Of course she said yes !
When Abstract Hearts Collide George & Sara Aye
Over a four day period ( this is after all the planning was completed ) , George spent a total of 24 hours constructing what would soon become his engagement proposal to his beautiful girlfriend Sara .
With plans to display an art piece at a gallery exhibit , industrial designer , George , took the opportunity to design the piece to also function as an elaborate and meaningful marriage proposal .
So he sat down at his computer and designed the piece in a three dimensional program , then laser cut foam core to create different pieces forming the words , “ Will You Marry Me . ”
To add a thoughtful twist , he named the art piece “ My Early Muir Owl , ” which is an anagram of “ Will you marry me . ”
He even went to the trouble of hiring an actor , whom he dubbed “ Serge Gandaora , ” who played the part of the “ artist ” for the night .
( “ Serge Gandaora ” is an anagram of “ George and Sara ” ) .
When “ Serge ” asked Sara to view the art installation through a carefully placed frame , George dropped down to one knee beside her .
As the words took shape before her eyes , she responded with a resounding “ yes ” and George placed the ring on her finger .

Public Display of Affection Rand & Geraldine Fishkin Rand dated Geraldine for about five years before the time had come for him to pop the question .
He wanted to propose in a genuine , unique and romantic way , equal to the love he felt for Geraldine .
Die - hard NFL fan that he is , Rand began to play with the idea of proposing via Super Bowl commercial .
Obviously , the task would be monumental , but luckily Rand works within an industry that lends itself well to the task .
Rand works in search marketing , specializing in search engine optimization and online viral marketing .
Rand put his idea into action in late August of 2006 .
He constructed a website and started working his magic , quickly drawing a lot of attention online .
He posted his game plan on his website , described the hurdles that lay ahead , and explained everything he needed to execute his epic Super Bowl proposal .
Rand discovered that in order to purchase ad space during the 2007 Super Bowl , he would have to raise approximately $ 2.5 million .
He put up a good chunk of his own cash and patiently waited for the donations to pour in .
On February 1 , just three days prior to the Super Bowl , he ’d only collected $ 85,000 .
Though this eased his mind regarding those costly wedding invitations , it was n’t nearly enough for the Super Bowl ad space he ’d set out to attain , though his proposal gained the attention of Entertainment Tonight , MSNBC , Good Morning America , and Fox News .
Despite his many efforts , CBS was unwilling to part with such valuable advertising time for a mere $ 85 G’s , so he carried out his contingency plan and purchased a local ad time slot during Geraldine ’s favorite television show , “ Veronica Mars ” .
On February 6 at 9:23 p.m. , Geraldine was caught completely off guard as Rand appeared on screen , and in a valiant public display of affection , he expressed his undying love for her , and popped the question .
As most of us were hoping , she said yes !
As a charitable gesture , Rand donated the remaining money to the Vanderbilt Children ’s Hospital .

Baby ,
You and I are on the Same Frequency Bryson & Christne Katzel Radio conversation with air traffic control typically moves quickly , using the official 300 - odd word vocabulary given to ATC .
When the frequency is not so busy , there ’s a bit of chat , some jokes and personal greetings .
Bryson , an air traffic controller , took advantage of radio down - time to propose to his girlfriend , Christine .
Bryson asked the pilot of the plane if he could propose to his girlfriend , a passenger on the plane .
The pilot switched Bryson onto speaker so the entire plane could listen to his proposal .

Looney Tunes Jeffrey & Natasha Paul Jeffrey Paul teaches 3D animation at the Art Institute of California .
He assembled a team of twenty co-workers and students to create a cartoon entitled “ Love Letters ” for his girlfriend , Natasha .
The entire process took three months .
A team from The Learning Channel arranged for Natasha to be brought to a theatre under the pretense that she ’d won a prize .
Roughly one hundred friends and family members were already in the darkened theater when the cartoon was shown .
Natasha ’s reaction was recorded for the TV show “ A Perfect Proposal . ” Jeff and Natasha were married on June 30 , 2006 .
They used another cartoon to invite the wedding guests .

You Just Won The Super Bowl , Will You Marry Me? Tom Brady & Ines Gomez Ines Gomez Mont , an entertainment reporter for Mexico based TV Azteca , proposed to New England Patriots quarterback , Tom Brady , in front of an entire room of reporters after the Super Bowl .
“ Would you marry me , Tom ? ” she asked .
Of course , Tom Brady declined the offer with a comment about being a “ one - woman ” man .
Ms. Gomez Mont was attired in a skimpy white wedding gown that has been described as looking like something from the Britney Spears collection .
After Tom Brady ’s rejection , Gomez Mont made the rounds , starting with New York Giant ’s quarterback , Eli Manning .
She told Eli Manning she was in love with him .
Upon Eli ’s brush - off , Gomez Mont basically made a pass at virtually all the players for both teams .
Watch this hilarious video :
A Sign of True Love David & Kelly Tan For this Valentine ’s Day , businesswoman Kelly Tan E Li received an unexpected marriage proposal .
“ This is the biggest surprise of my life .
And , the whole thing started as a very normal Wednesday .
We went out for dinner and my boyfriend David Tan insisted on sending me home . ”
Kelly said , “ The date ended very late , close to midnight .
We got talking in the car and as we drove along the LDP in Kelana Jaya , he got excited and asked me to look at an “ interesting ” billboard by the side of the road . ”
As David was working in an advertising firm , Kelly assumed he wanted to show her some fancy new advertisements .
“ I looked and was stunned .
David ’s picture was on the board !
And beside his picture , were the magic words ‘ Kelly Tan E Li , will you marry me ? ’
“ I was so shocked and could not speak for about ten minutes .
He finally smiled when I told him ‘ yes ’ . ”
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The Justice Department on Wednesday recommended a reduction in jail time for the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff , who became a crucial witness against lawmakers and Congressional aides .
Prosecutors asked federal judges in Washington and Florida to shave years off the sentence of Mr. Abramoff , citing his work in an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that sent numerous people to prison and contributed to the Republican Party ’s loss of Congress .
Mr. Abramoff ’s cooperation helped send to prison former Representative Bob Ney , a Republican , and former Deputy Interior Secretary J. Steven Griles .
In 2006 , Mr. Abramoff began serving almost six years in prison for a fraudulent Florida casino deal .
In addition , he faces about 11 years in prison when he is sentenced Sept. 4 for corrupting Capitol Hill lawmakers .
In all the discussion of John McCain 's recently recovered memory of a religious epiphany in Vietnam , one thing has been missing .
The torture that was deployed against McCain emerges in all the various accounts .
It involved sleep deprivation , the withholding of medical treatment , stress positions , long - time standing , and beating .
Sound familiar ?
According to the Bush administration 's definition of torture , McCain was therefore not tortured .
Cheney denies that McCain was tortured ; as does Bush .
So do John Yoo and David Addington and George Tenet .
In the one indisputably authentic version of the story of a Vietnamese guard showing compassion , McCain talks of the agony of long - time standing .
A quarter century later , Don Rumsfeld was putting his signature to memos lengthening the agony of " long - time standing " that victims of Bush 's torture regime would have to endure .
These torture techniques are , according to the president of the United States , merely " enhanced interrogation . "
No war crimes were committed against McCain .
And the techniques used are , according to the president , tools to extract accurate information .
And so the false confessions that McCain was forced to make were , according to the logic of the Bush administration , as accurate as the " intelligence " we have procured from " interrogating " terror suspects .
Feel safer ?
Holy cow , what kind of industrial grade pharmaceutical are they smoking over there ?
Think Progress :
Apparently the McCain campaign is feeling the sting of comparisons to George Bush .
McCain describes himself as the strongest support of the war in Iraq .
His answer to $ 4.00 gasoline is to cut oil company taxes by $ 4 billion a year .
And McCain has embraced a Bush proposal to radically change our health care system .
( These and other similarities are described in a memorandum released today by the Center for American Progress Action Fund . )
Swimming upstream , McCain policy advisor Douglas Holtz - Eakin now argues that it is Senator Obama – not McCain – who wants to continue Bush ’s fiscal policies .
Obama ’s budget “ is dedicated to the recent Bush tradition of spending money on everything , ” he said .
This is exactly backwards .
Consider :
Nancy Pelosi is Pissed at Joe Lieberman
Here is what Nancy Pelosi recently said about Joe Lieberman :
You are right .
Joe Lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to Barack Obama
Evidently she considers a man who is standing up for his beliefs instead of putting partisan politics first is acting irresponsible .
( I understand that technically Lieberman is an Independent but we all know he is a IINO .
He is a democrat , that ’s what McCain likes about him . )
President Obama is the candidate of change , the man who will bring us all together , the man who will work in a bi-partisan manner to save Americans from themselves .
Yet how can the man who claims he will unite the country actually achieve this if his own party feels it is irresponsible for a party member to not put partisan politics ahead of his own beliefs ?
The liberal rhetoric and hypocrisy is on full display here .
The rhetoric of working in a bi-partisan manner is shown to be untrue by the speaker herself .
Is not what Lieberman doing in his support of John McCain showing bi-partisanship ?
The Democrats publicly say that they want to work with Republicans yet that is exactly what Lieberman is doing and he is being shunned by Pelosi and other Democrats who are poised to punish Lieberman after the election for his indiscretion of working with a Republican in just the manner Democrats claim that they want to do .
“ it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the Senate , the Democratic leadership in the Senate , does ( after the election ) in terms of Joe Lieberman ’s chairmanship of his committee . ”
There has been speculation that if Democrats bolster their Senate majority this fall , they could seek payback by stripping Lieberman of the chairmanship .
In truth what the Democrats mean when they talk about bi-partisanship is that they expect Republicans to capitulate to their every whim .
That is not bi-partisanship , did the Democrats capitulate to the Republicans when the Republicans extended their majority in 2004 ?
No , they talked about the rights of the minority and fought Republicans every step of the way .
There has been no talk of the rights of the majority since the Republicans have been in the majority .
The ironic part of this is the fact that one presidential candidate has worked in a bi-partisan manner in his time in the senate and one has not worked in a bi-partisan manner in his 400 or so days in the senate .
President Obama claims that he wants to work with Republicans as president but nothing in his record indicates a willingness to do so .
He never has worked with them in the past .
Yet John McCain has shown that not only has he worked in a bi-partisan manner , he actually prefers to work with Democrats than Republicans .
( Much to my chagrin . )
Nancy Pelosi has shown us that she is more interested in the good of the party than the rhetoric that President Obama has been spewing .
Joe Lieberman has been practicing the politics that President Obama has been touting and he is in danger of losing his committee chairmanship because the Democrats have shown us that while they talk a good game they have no intention of backing up their promises .
Beth Modica Rockland County Sheriff's Office via AP NEW CITY , N.Y . ( AP ) 
A former prosecutor was sentenced Wednesday to two years in prison for having sex with boys , after her 16 - year - old daughter told the judge she and her mother had competed for the same 15 - year - old boy .
Beth Modica , 44 , wept as her daughter Danielle told the judge she banged on the bathroom door at the family home in Sloatsburg one day last year as her mother and her boyfriend engaged in oral sex .
" I was betrayed by both of them , " Danielle Modica said .
Modica told her children to lie to their father — the Spring Valley police chief — about the marijuana and alcohol she gave to them and their friends , Danielle Modica said .
She urged Rockland County Judge Catherine Bartlett to send her mother to state prison .
Modica , in an orange prison jumpsuit , her hands shackled to her waist , apologized through sobs to her family and her victims , saying she knows she has destroyed her family .
" I will be eternally remorseful , " she said .
Her attorney , Gerard Damiani , asked for a shorter sentence or just probation .
He noted that Modica , a former prosecutor in Queens and Rockland , had already lost her law license and custody of the children .
Besides two years in state prison for Modica 's guilty plea to statutory rape and criminal sex act , Bartlett imposed 10 years ' probation , sex offender registration and 10 - year orders of protection for the two boys she had sex with .

( Epistemic status : I am not entirely satisfied with the Merchant here , but it 's the closest I 've been able to get so far . )
When managing developers , and when watching conversations between developers online , I sometimes notice them arguing past each other about what constitutes " good code " .
One group will assert that good code must adhere to specific programming practices .
The other will assert that good code is code that makes money for its author .
In the worst cases , each camp derides the other .
The first camp will say the other is immature and inexperienced , begging for trouble ; the second camp that the other are mindless slaves to old dogmatism , and want everyone else in their chains .
The first will say the other is dangerously unprofessional ; the second will reply " Do n't care : shipping and billing ! "
In the course of trying to work through the arguments on each side , so that I can explain them to myself and others , I have started using the names " Priest " and " Merchant " as categories to help give me a handle on the attitudes expressed .
While the following descriptions are necessarily caricatures , I think they capture some recognizable qualities of the Priest and Merchant : what they care about most , their goals and focus , their time preferences , and their blind spots .
In each case we start with the question , " What is good code ? "
The Priest
When you ask the Priest " what is good code ? " , his answers will have this flavor :
Good code is SOLID .
Good code is well - abstracted and well - encapsulated .
Good code is well - separated into appropriate layers and concerns .
Good code is cleanly organized and architected .
Good code has tests -- especially unit tests .
There are similar variations on these answers ; they reveal that the Priest is program oriented .
He cares first and foremost about the code for its own sake .
The overarching goal of the Priest is holiness -- sometimes known as " code quality , " or " correctness , " or " conformance to standards . "
The Priest is focused on peer satisfaction -- that is , on the satisfaction of other Priests who review his code .
It is other Priests who will determine how well he has achieved holiness in his code .
The Priest has a preference for the long - term time horizon .
He is driven to make working with his code frustration - free for the many years he expects it to exist .
One problem with the Priest - like desire for holiness in code , is that it leads into holiness spirals .
Priests engage in arguments about whether sufficient code holiness has been achieved -- and of course , the answer is always that the code is not holy enough .
Each Priest , to demonstrate his own holiness , is eager to point out how his code is holier than yours , and to explain how yours could become even holier than it is .
There is always a way for your code to be more SOLID .
There are ever more finely - tuned abstractions to implement .
The testability , and the tests themselves , can always be improved .
The spiral towards more - perfected holiness never ends .
The Priest recognizes no boundary or limiting principle to coding for holiness -- why would a Priest ever volunteer to be less holy than possible ?
The Merchant
When you ask the Merchant " what is good code ? " , his answers will have a different flavor :
Good code is code that makes money -- the sooner , the better !
This answer , and its variations , reveal that the Merchant is product - oriented .
He cares first and foremost about the product being marketed , not about the code behind the product .
The overarching goal of the Merchant is market success -- whether in financial terms , or in terms of beating out competitors .
The Merchant is focused on customer satisfaction -- that is , the satisfaction of people who use the product , and do not ncessarily care about how the code behind the product operates .
It is the customers who will determine the market success of his product .
The Merchant has a preference for the near - term time horizon .
He is concerned with shipping code sooner rather than later , so that the product can achieve market success more quickly , and so that product iterations through the market are more responsive .
Every minute of coding effort that does not line up directly with market success through customer satisfaction is a minute of coding effort to be avoided .
One problem with the Merchant - like desire for quick market success is that it leads quickly to technical debt .
Speed in getting product to market means that little attention is paid to longer - term program concerns , which makes the product more difficult to improve over time .
The codebase becomes resistant to change , which means the product cannot respond quickly to changed conditions for market success .
This means living with the product and the pain it produces , abandoning the product and moving on to another one , or rewriting it entirely -- again , as quickly as possible .
The Merchant recognizes no boundary or limiting principle to coding for market success -- why would a Merchant ever volunteer for less market success than possible ?
Which Is Better ?
This is the old program - vs - product dichotomy again .
In some ways it represents an argument about primacy : which mode is to dominate the other , the Priest - like or the Merchant - like ?
The program - oriented developer ( the Priest ) wants a good codebase on which the product is founded .
The product - oriented developer ( the Merchant ) wants a good product to present to the market .
But which approach is the right one ?
Or at least , which one is more pragmatic than the other -- which is the more practical approach ?
Both the Priest and the Merchant will defend their attitude as being " practical . "
However , to quote Rand : " What is ' practical ' depends on what you want to practice . "
Obviously , says the Priest , coding for the long - term is practical .
It helps to keep the codebase lower - cost in the end , even if it takes longer to ship to production .
The venture will be better for it over all .
And obviously , says the Merchant , coding for the near - term is practical .
The longer it takes to get the product to market , the longer it takes for the venture to succeed .
There wo n't be a long - term if we do n't make it through the near - term .
The Priest is OK with shipping later , to avoid foreseeable technical debt in advance , since avoiding technical debt is clearly a practical approach .
The Merchant is eager to ship sooner , and deal only with actually - realized technical debt later , since achieving market success earlier is clearly a practical approach .
The Priest wants to " do things the right way " to satisfy other Priests .
The Merchant wants to " do things the right way " to satisfy the market .
The Priest will try to argue for excellence in the program according to various quality measures .
The Merchant will argue that mass appeal in the market is itself a form of excellence in the product .
For just about any variation of these kinds of arguments , both the Priest and the Merchant have strong but conflicting cases .
Resolving The Conflict
What occurs to me is that both of these attitudes or aspects are simultaneously present in developers .
The difference is not that one attitude or the other is present or absent , but that one aspect or the other is emphasized or de-emphasized by each developer to a different extent .
Stated differently : it is not that a developer is a Priest or a Merchant .
It is that each developer emphasizes the Priest - like and Merchant - like aspects of his approach to different levels .
One developer may give the vast majority of emphasis to his Priest - like desires .
Conversely , another will much more strongly emphasize the Merchant - like aspects of his personality .
Even so , every Priest exhibits some Merchant behaviors once in a while , and every Merchant acts like a Priest sometimes .
This is because doing so 100 % either way leads to trouble .
On the Merchant side , if it's all product all the time , you end up with a program that is a mess , and the product cannot continue -- at least , not without greatly increased frustration and pain while working with the code .
On the Priest side , if it 's all program all the time , you never get a product to market -- or at least , it takes more time than you have available , and the codebase is discarded when the venture fails .
A Priest - only developer would never ship a product , because the program can never be holy enough .
A Merchant - only program would be entirely unreadable by others , since the program behind a successful product need not conform to the expectations of other developers .
Yet the Priest ships code to market ( though perhaps not as early as the Merchant ) , and Merchant code conforms to expectations ( though perhaps not as well as that from the Priest ) .
So it must be that every developer possesses at least some amount of each aspect .
This means the two aspects are each in tension with each other .
And whereas neither of the two aspects has a limiting principle of its own , each aspect can act as a limit on the other .
As an exercise , try to see which of those aspects you emphasize more strongly .
Then , consciously practice consulting the other aspect -- in doing so , you may be able to more effectively evaluate tradeoffs when deciding when code is not yet holy enough , or for when it would be better to ship now and deal with technical debt later .
Then the Merchant aspect might be able to accept some more non-product efforts for the sake of the program .
And the Priest aspect might be able to accept some more unholiness in the program for the sake of the product .
Afterword
The " quality of product versus quality of program " topic looks like a running theme with me ; here are some other posts on the subject .
New NSA Spying Decision Undermines Arguments for Telecom Immunity
Today , Chief Judge Vaughn Walker of the Northern District of California , issued an opinion in Al Haramain v. Bush , one of the cases challenging the NSA warrantless wiretapping program .
The Court found that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) preempted the state secret privilege .
This important decision is particularly timely , as it undermines key arguments for telecom immunity on the eve of the Senate vote on a FISA bill , set for next week .
The Court's Holding
The Al Haramain case alleges that the Bush Administration illegally targeted the leaders of an Islamic charity and their lawyers for warrantless surveillance by the NSA .
Their claims are based on a secret document that was accidentally disclosed to the plaintiffs by the government that the plaintiffs allege demonstrates they were subjected to warrantless wiretapping ( the contents of the document are tightly sealed as a state secret ) .
In today 's decision , Judge Walker dismissed the Al Haramain case for the time being , but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to assert more facts .
This was the government 's second attempt to dismiss the Al - Haramain case .
The first motion to dismiss reached the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , which returned the case to Judge Walker 's court to consider whether FISA preempted the government 's claim to secrecy .
The good news is that the Court held that " FISA preempts the state secrets privilege in connection with electronic surveillance for intelligence purposes and would appear to displace the state secrets privilege for purposes of plaintiffs ’ claims . "
The Court rejected the expansive view of executive power promoted by the government , holding that the President 's authorities under Article II of the Constitution do not give him the power to overrule FISA .
The bad news is that " FISA nonetheless does not appear to provide plaintiffs a viable remedy unless they can show that they are ' aggrieved persons ' within the meaning of FISA . "
The Court ultimately found that Al Haramain had not provided a sufficient showing that they were " aggrieved , " but gave permission to re-file the complaint with more information .
Decision Undermines Telecom Immunity Arguments
While the case only directly addressed the Al Haramain case , Judge Walker did mention the cases against the telecommunications giants who participated in the illegal surveillance program :
Plaintiff amici [ i.e. EFF and others ] hint at the proper showing when they refer to “ independent evidence disclosing that plaintiffs have been surveilled ” and a “ rich lode of disclosure to support their claims ” in various of the [ NSA spying ] cases .
Accordingly , so long as the telecom plaintiffs have unclassified evidence tending to establish that they were surveilled -- which exists , for example , in Hepting v. AT&T , via AT&T documents provided by whistleblower Mark Klein -- FISA 's procedures kick into effect and the Bush Administration cannot unilaterally get rid of the telecom cases pursuant to the state secret privilege .
Moreover , this ruling would allow the telecoms to present their defenses .
A major talking point for telecom apologists is that the the telcos were unfairly prevented from mounting a defense by the state secret privilege .
By holding that FISA 's existing evidence security procedures preempt the state secrets privilege , the decision belies telecom immunity proponents ' claims that the litigation was unfair because the privilege prevented the telecoms from defending themselves .
It also refutes claims that the lawsuits against the telecoms were n't going to go anywhere anyway .
Yet , even as the prospects for accountability from the telecoms grow brighter with this decision , Congress is poised to prevent the courts from doing their job by unjustifiably granting immunity to these companies that violated the rights of millions .
Call your Senators today , and ask them to vote against retroactive immunity for law breaking telecommunications companies .
The steady stream of bad news about Afghanistan this week served to highlight two inescapable truths regarding the conflict against Al Qaeda and the Taliban .
First , Barack Obama is right that the ongoing commitment of American forces in Iraq is limiting the United States in its pursuit of Al Qaeda along the Pakistan frontier .
Second , the Bush Doctrine - with its first tenet of " no safe havens " for terrorists - is still dead .
In Washington , President Bush acknowledged that June , which saw the highest U.S. casualties of the Afghan war , was a " tough month . "
Bush , who is reported to have recently ordered U.S. intelligence assets and Special Forces to make a final push to capture Osama Bin Laden , then promised more soldiers and Marines for the fight .
As Time rightly noted :
" We 're going to increase troops by 2009 , " Bush said , without offering details about exactly when or how many .
The President would have done well to first consult with Admiral Michael Mullen , his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs .
On the very day that 2,200 U.S Marines learned their tours in Afghanistan will be extended by 30 days , Mullen admitted to reporters at the Pentagon that the United States could deploy more forces there only by drawing down from Iraq :
" I do n't have troops I can reach for , brigades I can reach , to send into Afghanistan until I have a reduced requirement in Iraq .
Afghanistan has been and remains an economy - of - force campaign , which by definition means we need more forces there . "
Unfortunately , that " reduced requirement " in Iraq does n't appear likely to happen any time soon .
As the AP reported last week , the Pentagon is preparing to rotate 30,000 troops in a move that maintain U.S. force levels in Iraq at 15 combat brigades through 2009 .
While General Petraeus may yet recommend further force reductions , American troop levels at 142,000 are currently slated to remain above pre-surge levels through next year .
Failing the commitment of additional forces by NATO members , the U.S. is going to have to rob Peter to pay Paul when it comes to choosing between the missions in Iraq and Afghanistan .
During his joint Senate testimony with General Petraeus in April , the U.S. ambassador to Baghdad Ryan Crocker acknowledged to Senator Joe Biden ( D - DE ) that the Afghan - Pakistan border region was a higher priority than Iraq for the United States in its global fight against Al Qaeda .
Crocker 's trade - off is precisely the one advocated by Barack Obama throughout the 2008 campaign .
As he has insisted repeatedly , the Bush administration let Al Qaeda off the mat in 2002 and with its solitary focus on Iraq , has taken its eyes off the prize .
As Obama put it just two weeks ago :
" The people who were responsible for murdering 3,000 Americans on 9/11 have not been brought to justice .
They are Osama bin Laden , al Qaeda and their sponsors – the Taliban .
They were in Afghanistan .
And yet George Bush and John McCain decided in 2002 that we should take our eye off of Afghanistan so that we could invade and occupy a country that had absolutely nothing to do with 9/11 …
… We had al Qaeda and the Taliban on the run back in 2002 .
But then we diverted military , intelligence , financial , and diplomatic resources to Iraq .
And yet Senator McCain has said as recently as this April that , ' Afghanistan is not in trouble because of our diversion to Iraq . '
I think that just shows a dangerous misjudgment of the facts , and a stubborn determination to ignore the need to finish the fight in Afghanistan . "
As it turns out , Obama is right , and George W. Bush and John McCain are wrong , on both counts .
As Admiral Mullen readily admitted , overstretched American forces in Iraq are simply unavailable for the campaign against Bin Laden .
And as a devastating account in the New York Times this week revealed , the Bush administration 's diversion of assets to Iraq and its confused policy towards the Musharraf government enabled Al Qaeda to establish a safe haven in Pakistan .
Dating back to the moments after the September 11 attacks , " no safe havens " emerged as one of the three pillars of the Bush Doctrine .
( The other two – preemptive war and democracy promotion – rose and fell with the invasion of Iraq and the chaos in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories . )
In his address to Congress on September 20 , 2001 , a determined President Bush declared his " no safe havens " principle even as the World Trade Center towers still smoldered in lower Manhattan :
" We will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism .
Every nation , in every region , now has a decision to make .
Either you are with us , or you are with the terrorists .
From this day forward , any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime . "
But seven years later , an Al Qaeda safe haven in the Pakistani tribal regions is precisely what the United States now encounters .
As President Bush himself confessed in the wake of a July 2007 National Intelligence Estimate :
" One of the most troubling [ points in the NIE ] is its assessment that al Qaeda has managed to establish a safe haven in the tribal areas of Pakistan bordering Afghanistan . "
Little has changed since .
As the New York Times detailed Monday , the new Bush policy of authorizing unilateral strikes against Al Qaeda leaders and the deployment of U.S. Special Forces into Pakistan remains stymied by disagreements within the administration and with the new government in Islamabad .
( Ironically , John McCain attacked Barack Obama for the same aggressive posture towards Al Qaeda in Pakistan that President Bush belatedly adopted . )
Despite the new - found willingness of the U.S. to act alone within Pakistan , Bush 's past dependence on Musharraf and Musharraf 's truce with tribal leaders sympathetic to Bin Laden and the Taliban had left Al Qaeda firmly entrenched :
" It is increasingly clear that the Bush administration will leave office with Al Qaeda having successfully relocated its base from Afghanistan to Pakistan ’s tribal areas , where it has rebuilt much of its ability to attack from the region and broadcast its messages to militants across the world . "
For Barack Obama 's part , he 's still right when it comes to America 's unfinished business with – and the White House 's diversion of resources from – Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda .
As for President Bush and John McCain , they 're still wrong .
And to paraphrase Chevy Chase from the old Saturday Night Live news sketches , the Bush Doctrine is still dead .
Hillary Quits : ' I Will Extend My Congratulations To Senator Obama And My Support For His Candidacy '
Undercover Maryland state troopers infiltrated three groups advocating peace and protesting the death penalty — attending meetings and sending reports on their activities to U.S. intelligence and military agencies , according to documents released Thursday .
The documents show the activities occurred from at least March 2005 to May 2006 and that officers used false names , which the documents referred to as “ covert identities ” - to open e-mail accounts to receive messages from the groups .
Also included in the 46 pages of documents , obtained by the Maryland chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union through a Freedom of Information
Act lawsuit , is an account of an activist ’s name being entered into a federally funded database designed to share information among state , local and federal law - enforcement agencies on terrorist and drug trafficking suspects .
ACLU attorney David Rocah said state police violated federal laws prohibiting departments that receive federal funds from maintaining databases with information about political activities and affiliations .
The activist was identified as Max Obuszewski .
His “ primary crime ” was entered into the database as “ terrorism - anti govern ( ment ) . ”
His “ secondary crime ” was listed as “ terrorism - anti-war protestors . ”
The database is known as the Washington - Baltimore High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area , or HIDTA .
“ This is not supposed to happen in America , ” said Mr. Rocah .
“ In a free society , which relies on the engagement of citizens in debate and protest and political activity to maintain that freedom … you should be able to attend a meeting about an issue you care about without having to worry that government spies are entering your name into a database used to track alleged terrorists and drug traffickers . ”
Mr. Rocah called the surveillance “ Kafka - esque insanity . ”
State police Chief Col. Terrence B. Sheridan said the agency “ does not inappropriately curtail the expression or demonstration of the civil liberties of protesters or organizations acting lawfully . ”
The surveillance of Mr. Obuszewski , of Pledge of Resistance - Baltimore , and another person came to light during his trial for trespassing and disorderly conduct in a 2004 protest outside the National Security Agency ’s headquarters in Fort Meade , Md .
Documents released by the prosecution revealed that the protesters had been under surveillance by an entity called the Baltimore Intelligence Unit .
The Maryland ACLU sued last month , claiming the state police refused to release public documents about the surveillance of peace activists .
The documents , which include intelligence reports and printouts from the database , show that several undercover officers from the state police ’s Homeland Security and Intelligence Division attended meetings of three groups : Mr. Obuszewski ’s group ; the Coalition to End the Death Penalty ; and the Committee to Save Vernon Evans , a convicted murderer who was slated for execution .
The documents show at least 288 hours of surveillance over the 14 - month period .
The undercover officers attended at least 20 organizing meetings at community halls and churches and a dozen rallies against the death penalty , including several at the state ’s SuperMax jail in Baltimore .
Included in the documents are references to a proposed sit-in at the offices of Baltimore County State ’s Attorney SandraA .
O’Connor .
However , they show no trooper reports of violence or threats of violence .
Organizers repeatedly stressed the importance of peaceful and orderly demonstrations , the documents show .
“ There were about 75 - 80 protestors at the rally and none participated in any type of civil disobedience or illegal acts , ” said one report of a demonstration against the death penalty at the SuperMax jail .
“ Protesters were even careful to move out of the way for Division of Correction employees who were going into the parking lot for work . ”
Still , information about the protesters and their activities was sent to seven agencies , including the National Security Agency and an unnamed military intelligence official .
“ Americans have the right to peaceably assemble with others of a like mind and speak out about what they believe in , ” Mr. Rocah said .
“ For state agencies to spend hundreds of hours entering information about lawful and peaceful political activities into a criminal database is beyond unconscionable .
It is a waste of taxpayer dollars , which does nothing to make us safer from actual terrorists or drug dealers . ”

A group of Wall Street executives released a report on Wednesday that outlined how the industry failed to foresee the financial meltdown of the last year and what companies can do to improve risk management .
The 172 - page report , written by chief risk officers and senior executives at banks like Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch and Citigroup , also provides suggestions about technical issues at the same time as it offers a bit of a mea culpa .
“ Virtually everybody was frankly slow in recognizing that we were on the cusp of a really draconian crisis , ” said E. Gerald Corrigan , a managing director at Goldman Sachs and a chairman of the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group III , which released the report .
Wall Street failed to anticipate how wide - reaching problems with mortgage bonds would spread into seemingly distant corners of the financial markets , the report said .
Awash in easy money , banks doled out credit without sufficiently charging for the risk .
Wall Street also created complex structures that masked connections between asset classes as well as compensation incentives that pushed traders to take risky steps for short - term gain .
The industry ’s failings have now translated into pain for the broader economy , the report said .
DERBY LINE , Vt. , Aug. 24 ( UPI ) --
Some residents of a Vermont town say recent border security efforts in their community on the U.S. - Canada border has stirred " hate and discontent . "
Derby Line , which has a shared library with the neighboring Canadian community of Stanstead , has had lettering painted on three side streets : " Canada " on one side , " U.S.A. " on the other .
Then came an influx of U.S. Border Patrol agents who chased motorists who ignored signs telling drivers to use official entry points .

The Washington Post reported Sunday that there was a proposal last year to erect fences on the town 's small streets to officially barricade the United States from Canada .
" They 're stirring up a little hate and discontent with that deal , " said Claire Currier , who grew up in the border area .
" It 's like putting up a barrier .
We 've all intermingled for years . "
The changes are part of an effort that began shortly after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
The so - called Secure Border Initiative calls for more than tripling the number of agents along the northern border , as well as adding boats and helicopters , and deploying sophisticated new technology .
" It was freer before , but we live in a different world now , " said Mark Henry , the operations officer at the Border Patrol 's Swanton Sector in Swanton , Vt .
In this video , a previously little known group calling itself the Turkestan Islamic Party claims it carried out several fatal bombings in the country in recent months .
The group 's self - described military commander , Seyfullah , said it was responsible for incidents in Shanghai in early May and in the southern city of Kunming on July 21 that killed a total of five people .
He also said the group had bombed a plastics factory in the province of Guangdong .
Most ominously , he threatened to carry out further attacks during the Beijing Olympics , which are scheduled to open on August 8 .
Indeed , the video begins with Beijing 's Olympic logo in flames and with a grainy image of a sports facility superimposed with an animated bomb blast .

We are entering a zone which is weaponised to boggle .
Our first glimpse of the Atlas experiment is a vast white hole , like a tube for launching aircraft carriers into the Earth .
A fenced diving board overhangs the 100 m drop .
As you stare down , your brain spins .
If , at the same time , a physicist is telling you that a photon arrives on earth at the same time as it leaves the sun because it travels at the speed of light which is the speed of time so in fact a photon can be everywhere at once , you do n't know whether your vertigo is physical or mental .
The Atlas chamber itself is a subterranean cathedral of physics .
It is genuinely awesome .
What you see is a bit like a colossal electric motor with a horizontal spindle .
The spindle is the collider tube .
It is perhaps a metre wide and for most of the 27 km circuit that 's all it is .
But here , it has had a gargantuan outburst .
Twenty - five metre high electromagnets built from melted Russian warships surround the tube and fill the space from floor to ceiling .
Flat muon chambers , like graphite doors , fan out from the tube .
Flurries of smaller components and webs of bundled wires spray through the gaps .
Each instrument is mounted with micron precision .
And because that 's more wayward than a batsman in Hastings trying to hit runs off a bowler in Scarborough , everything is swept and mapped by lasers to produce a true record of its position .
The experience is rapidly so impressive you start to salute each fact .
The protons will make the 27 km circuit 11,000 times every second .
The accelerator tube will be one of the coldest places in the universe .
We are making one of the coldest places in the universe .
You have to salute that with both hands .
Almost all the collision events will be lost !
Of the few you can detect , you can't even record 5 % .
But look !
Cern has built the world 's fastest computer .
Its data storage will consume one good laptop every twenty seconds .
Reeling , we cross to a similar chamber called the Compact Muon Solenoid .
It is here that the famous " God Particle " may emerge .

They try to soften the blow by claiming that physicists find it difficult to visualise extra dimensions too .
That 's easy to say when you 're packing 26 of them .
They 've got the maths .
They can pull down extra dimensions whenever they want their equations to balance .
You just have to accept them .
That makes you vulnerable .
Your rationality dissolves .
Then someone hits you with the seething vacuum .
You think a vacuum is empty space .
Quantum theory says yes - but it is also full of spontaneous eruptions of energy .
This virtual energy comes from nowhere .
It does and does n't exist .
You can use the bit that does , so long as you pay it back .
This beats sub -prime .
A physicist called Polkinghorne says the quantum vacuum is the nearest analogy to God in the physical world .
Then again , the physicist who is brainwashing me in the CMS says quantum theory is " probably bollocks " .
At a meal afterwards , we babble .
Will the collider suck us into a black hole ?
There 's a website where some health and safety nut has calculated that Cern could be 18 times more lethal than death .
Captain Underpants sees commercial potential in the proton .
He wants to start a line of cosmetics .
He actually wants people to rub their faces with massive nuclear fragments .

I grew up in the mid-west .
Lots and lots of flat , open never ending flat .
We industrious human have cut down just about anything and replaced it with endless acres of corn , wheat , soy , and umm…corn , wheat and soy .
I grew up with a father than had a personal farm of a quarter acre , goats , chickens , pigs etc .
I have always loved growing things , especially things you can eat .
I have always wanted a garden of my very own , when I moved to Boston I faced a unique problem .
I live in a tiny little apartment , my front yard is a road , my back yard … I do n’t have a back yard .
There was however a small , pathetic , and rocky square of soil tucked next to the paved street , and the concrete sidewalk .
It was roughly a square yard ( around a square meter ) .
The soil was …not there .
Even the weeds were having a hard time growing , it was full of rocks , and god knows what else ( anyone ever change oil onto this soil , lead , mercury , who knows ) .
I did n’t give up , the first thing I did was go get some seeds .
I started my seedlings months before it was nice enough to plant stuff outside .
I laid out some shelves near a nice big bay window ( who am I kidding , the ONLY window in my place ) , and kept them well watered .
They were sitting on top of a big radiator , so that kept them warm during the cold cold night .
They shot up like rockets .
I planted green onions , zucchini , peppers , and tomatoes .
The food I eat the most .
Once it got a little warmer out I took a hammer ( I did n’t have any garden tools ) to the soil to see what was under the surface .
It was n’t good , rocks , glass , and more rocks .
Raised beds were my only hope .
Down the street I found an abandoned wood pallet .
The planks from that pallet made a nice little border to hold the dirt I purchased from the garden center .
I was not comfortable eating food that grew in nasty soil so I put a good 7 inches of soil down on top of the nasty rocky soil .
I have no idea if this will keep me safe from soil nasties , but if I wanted anything to grow I would need some better soil .
Once it got a bit nicer ( no more frost danger ) I took my tiny baby plants outside and gently planted them in my square yard .
I immediately had a problem , too many plants , not enough space .
How to solve my problem ?
I just planted them all right next to each other .
I had no idea what that would do to my yields , but hey this was an experiment right ?
To my great surprise not only did my plants like their new home , they started to grow like crazy !
Eventually I was forced to “ thin the flock ” by plucking a few of the plants , they were shading each other out .
For the most part , however , I was able to get away with a very very high density of planting .
A so it went , the tomatoes , and squash constantly were fighting over space .
Next year I will be sure to have some sort of rack for the tomatoes to grow on , they grew up and over everything in there path .
Surprisingly this did little to the other plants , they stubbornly grew up through any space not covered with tomato .
The peppers and green onions especially seemed to like the slightly shadier environs .
And now as summer slowly fades into fall the best part of my little experiment has come to fruition .
FRESH GARDEN PRODUCE EVERY FREAKING DAY !
I come home every day to the MOST DELICIOUS tomatoes , peppers , squash and green onions .
Seriously , the best tomato you have ever tasted at the store , is crap , compared to anything you grow yourself .
Picking a ripe red tomato out of the warm sun , wash , sprinkle a little salt on it and prepare for a party in your mouth .
Sooooo goooood .
I have made zucchini muffins , a bunch of dishes with the tomatoes , used the green onions to season a bunch of meals , and am going to make salsa from the peppers .
I have started giving away tomatoes to friends .
Like crack , once they have a taste they all come back for more .
The best part about this garden is that the damn thing keeps pooping out food .
I am going to get another couple pounds of tomatoes out of it , and a lot more peppers and green onions ( the zucchini got some sort of fungus and dies this week , but not before kicking out a bunch of food ) .
This garden is so small that just about anyone could find this much space .
I spent about 30 dollars on the whole thing , and have gotten about 10 pounds of squash , a bazzilion tomatoes , bunches of green onions , and a bushel of peppers .
More than paying back my investment .
I used no fertilizer , or pesticides .
If you live in a concrete jungle , and have not even a small little square of land , you could do this same project in some large pots and get probably an even better yield .
Look around .
You probably have soda cans , pizza boxes and take out containers lying all over the place .
Come on man , just because you are a lazy bachelor does n't mean you can't enjoy a little home cooking every once in awhile .
So , with that in mind , check out the following list of gadgets .
You too can eat like a king at home - and save a little money while you are at it .

For more than fifteen years , Hillary Clinton has worked full throttle to bring socialized heath care to America .
Trashing the most sophisticated and efficient health care delivery system in the world has truly become an obsession with this old school socialist and obscenely rich elitist .
As a result , in this the season of exaggerated political promises and foolish expectations , Hillary is the Missiah of Medicine to the unwashed masses living and , presumably dying , without a nanny tyrant in the White House to pummel greedy physicians and insurance moguls into submission .
According to Clinton campaign myth , securing universal care for everyone in America is really quite simple : Just vote to give Hillary the key to the Oval Office !
Like Samantha on the Bewitched television series , Hillary would then fix health care by twitching her nose 300 million times and presto !
— America would be covered !
Witch - President Hillary would also use nose twitches to end the war in Iraq , prevent and reverse global warming , pay off mortgages for all unqualified home owners who face foreclosure , end the Bush recession , and vanquish Monica Lewinsky and other “ Friends on Bill ” with dirty laundry still hanging in that little room just off the Oval Office .
The first item of business in a Clinton Administration would be to twitch away that devastating CBS video of Hillary ’s “ Sniper fire ” experience in Bosnia !
Hillary ’s commitment to health care is so powerful that the issue has become the centerpiece of her campaign .
Think health care , and the name Hillary Clinton immediately comes to mind , right ?
That may be so for slovenly Americans looking for another government handout , but not necessarily so when it comes to professionals working on Clinton ’s presidential campaign staff .
As it turns out , Hillary has failed to pay $ 292,000 in health care insurance premiums for staff members who are supposed to be covered as a condition of employment and patronage .
To date , no staff member has actually been denied heath care because of the unpaid premiums , but it ’s still early !
See : http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0308/9274.html
The big question :
How much trust should America invest in a rich and powerful socialist with known truth issues who promises universal care for all , but who has failed to meet the needs of her own small staff ?
An elderly woman misunderstood instructions while checking in at Sweden 's main airport and was whisked down a baggage chute after she placed herself instead of her luggage on the belt , media reported .
The 78 - year - old woman , who was not named , was preparing to fly from Stockholm 's Arlanda airport to Germany on Tuesday when she lay down on an unmanned baggage belt in the belief she was following check - in instructions , the Upsala Nya Tidning local daily reported on its website .
She was quickly swept off to the baggage handling centre , where staff members helped get her back on her feet .
The woman suffered no serious injury and caught her flight as planned .

Washington , DC A chemical found in everything from water bottles to CDs has been given a reprieve by the US Food and Drug Administration .
According to the FDA bisphenol A does not pose a risk for humans , although " there are always uncertainties associated with safety decisions , " the agency says in a statement .
But the story does n't end there .
Despite its reassurances the FDA has been criticized for using industry - funded data in order to arrive at its conclusion , and health advocates continue to claim that bisphenol A is anything but safe .
Bisphenol A is a commonly found chemical used to harden plastic , which is in turn used to manufacture everything from baby 's bottles , to sunglasses , to water bottles and CDs .
Anything that is required to have the strength and rigidity of glass , has bisphenol A in it .
Even canned food will have plastic containing bisphenol A lining the inside of the can .
Its use is so prolific that manufacturers such as Dow Chemical , BASF and Bayer AG collectively produce six billion pounds of the stuff each year in the US .
But is it safe ?
The jury is still out on that one .
It appeared earlier this year that bisphenol A was doomed after the National Toxicology Program raised concerns over bisphenol A , commonly found in shatterproof water bottles , including baby 's bottles .
At issue is the potential for the chemical , similar to the hormone estrogen , to leach from the plastic and to be ultimately ingested by humans .
It is that concern which promoted the Canadian government to ban the use of baby bottles containing bisphenol A. Some US States are considering similar moves , and the State of California is on the verge of enacting legislation that bans the chemical for the manufacture of baby 's bottles there .
Needless to say the chemical industry has greeted the FDA position with enthusiasm .
The American Chemistry Council has defended the safety of bisphenol A all along , and states that it relies on the FDA for guidance .
However , not everyone is happy with the FDA , or agrees with its findings .
" It 's ironic FDA would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the National Institutes of Health — this country 's best scientists — and instead rely on flawed studies from industry , " said Pete Myers , chief scientist for Environmental Health Sciences , in a statement to MSNBC .
Myers goes on to claim that the agency disregarded recent studies of bisphenol A's effects included in the National Toxicology Program 's April draft reportthat suggested low doses of bisphenol A can cause changes in behavior and the brain , and that it may reduce survival and birth weight in fetuses .
The findings were derived from animal studies .
The FDA concluded that any levels leaching out from water bottles , baby 's bottles or the liners of food cans would not be at a sufficient level to harm humans .
The agency also determined , in its view , that there remained " inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings .
" Meanwhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in Atlanta maintains that a whopping 93 percent of Americans have been found to have traces of bisphenol A in their urine .
Studies have suggested that bisphenol A can disrupt hormones in mice , although the FDA takes the position that the levels to which people are exposed are thousands of times below what would be considered dangerous .
No one appears to be denying that the leaching is happening in the first place , so it appears quite certain that traces of bisphenol A are getting into your system from that water bottle , or from handling that CD .
Same goes for baby 's bottles .
The debate then , is how much is considered safe .
The FDA , and the chemical industry , appears to suggest that a little bit is okay .
However , health advocates and parenting groups maintain that even trace amounts are a reason for worry , and continue to advocate a total ban on its use .
As various States continue to wrestle with the issue , including California , the FDA is gearing up for a September meeting that will see various independent advisors debate the chemical 's safety .
Critics wonder about the timing of the FDA 's preliminary report , released on the eve of California 's expected adoption of statutes aimed at banning the chemical in baby 's bottles .
Was the early release of the report intended to sway State lawmakers , or cause them to appear misguided in the passage of the new legislation ?
Time will tell .
In the meantime some manufacturers of water bottles , including Nalgene and Camelback , have begin producing water bottles without bisphenol A in anticipation of a deepening rift in the debate and a worsening outcome , pending further study , for bisphenol A .
Tomgram : Welcome to the Age of Homeland Insecurity
Kiss American Security Goodbye
15 Numbers That Add Up to an Age of Insecurity
By Tom Engelhardt
Once upon a time , I studied the Chinese martial art of Tai Chi -- until , that is , I realized I would never locate my " chi . "
At that point , I threw in the towel and took up Western exercise .
Still , the principle behind Tai Chi stayed with me -- that you could multiply the force of an act by giving way before the force of others ; that a smaller person could use the strength of a bigger one against him .
Now , jump to September 11 , 2001 and its aftermath -- and you know the Tai Chi version of history from there .
Think of it as a grim cosmic joke -- that the 9/11 attacks , as apocalyptic as they looked , were anything but .
The true disasters followed and the wounds were largely self - inflicted , as the most militarily powerful nation on the planet used its own force to disable itself .
Before that fateful day , the Bush administration had considered terrorism , Osama bin Laden , and al - Qaeda subjects for suckers and wusses .
What they were intent on was pouring money into developing an elaborate boondoggle of a missile defense system against future nuclear attacks by rogue states .
Those Cold War high frontiersmen ( and women ) could n't get enough of the idea of missiling up .
That , after all , was where the money and the fun seemed to be .
Nuclear was where the big boys -- the nation states -- played .
" Bin Laden determined to strike in U.S. , " the CIA told the President that August .
Yawn .
After 9/11 , of course , George W. Bush and his top advisors almost instantly launched their crusade against Islam and then their various wars , all under the rubric of the Global War on Terror .
( As Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld pungently put the matter that September , " We have a choice -- either to change the way we live , which is unacceptable , or to change the way that they live ; and we chose the latter . " )
By then , they were already heading out to " drain the swamp " of evil doers , 60 countries worth of them , if necessary .
Meanwhile , they moved quickly to fight the last battle at home , the one just over , by squandering vast sums on an American Maginot Line of security .
The porous new Department of Homeland Security , the NSA , the FBI , and other acronymic agencies were to lock down , surveil , and listen in on America .
All this to prevent " the next 9/11 . "
In the process , they would treat bin Laden 's scattered al - Qaeda network as if it were the Nazi or Soviet war machine ( even comically dubbing his followers " Islamofascists " ) .
In the blinking of an eye , and in the rubble of two enormous buildings in downtown Manhattan , bin Laden and his cronies had morphed from nobodies into supermen , a veritable Legion of Doom .
( There was a curious parallel to this transformation in World War II .
Before Pearl Harbor , American experts had considered the Japanese -- as historian John Dower so vividly documented in his book War Without Mercy -- bucktoothed , near - sighted military incompetents whose war planes were barely capable of flight .
On December 8 , 1941 , they suddenly became a race of invincible supermen without , in the American imagination , ever passing through a human incarnation . )
When , in October 2001 , Congress passed the Patriot Act , and an Office of Homeland Security ( which , in 2002 , became a " department " ) was established , it was welcome to the era of homeland insecurity .
From then on , every major building , landmark , amusement park , petting zoo , flea market , popcorn stand , and toll booth anywhere in the country would be touted as a potential target for terrorists and in need of protection .
Every police department from Arkansas to Ohio would be in desperate need of anti-terror funding .
And why not , when the terrorists loomed so monstrously large , were so apocalyptically capable , and wanted so very badly to destroy our way of life ?
No wonder that , in the 2006 National Asset Database , compiled by the Department of Homeland Security , the state of Indiana , " with 8,591 potential terrorist targets , had 50 percent more listed sites than New York ( 5,687 ) and more than twice as many as California ( 3,212 ) , ranking the state the most target - rich place in the nation . "
In the administration 's imagination ( and the American one ) , they were now capable of anything .
From their camps in the backlands of Afghanistan ( or was it the suburbs of Hamburg ? ) , as well as in the murky global underworld of the arms black market , al - Qaeda 's minions were toiling feverishly to lay their hands on the most fiendish of plagues and pestilences -- smallpox , botulism , anthrax , you name it .
They were preparing to fill suitcases with nuclear weapons for deposit in downtown Manhattan .
They were gathering nuclear refuse for dirty bombs .
Nothing was too mad or destructive for them .
Every faint but strange odor -- the sweet smell of maple syrup floating across a city -- was a potential bio-attack .
And everywhere , even in rural areas , politicians were strapping on their armor and preparing to run imminent - danger , anti-terror campaigns , while urging their constituents to run for cover .
Meanwhile , that former Sodom of the New World , New York City , had somehow been transformed into an I - heart - NY T - shirt - and - cap combo .
So , thank you , Osama bin Laden for expediting the Department of Homeland Security , glutting an already bloated Pentagon with even more money , ensuring that all those " expeditionary forces " would sally forth to cause havoc and not find victory in two hopeless wars , enabling the establishment of a vast offshore prison network ( and the torture techniques to go with it ) , and creating a whole new global " security " industry to " thwart terrorists " that was , by 2006 , generating $ 60 billion a year in business and whose domestic wing was devoted to locking down America .
When the history of this era is finally written , based on the Tai Chi Principle , Osama bin Laden and his scattering of followers may be credited for goading the fundamentalist leaders of the United States into using the power in their grasp so -- not to put a fine point on it -- stupidly and profligately as to send the planet 's " sole superpower " into decline .
Above all , bin Laden and his crew of fanatics will have ensured one thing : that the real security problems of our age were ignored in Washington until far too late in favor of mad dreams and dark phantoms .
In this lies a bleak but epic tale of folly worthy of a great American novelist ( wherever she is ) .
In the meantime , consider the following little list -- 15 numbers that offer an indication of just what the Tai Chi Principle meant in action these last years ; just where American energies did and did not flow ; and , in the end , just how much less safe we are now than we were in January 2001 , when George W. Bush entered the Oval Office :
536,000,000,000 : the number of dollars the Pentagon is requesting for the 2009 military budget .
This represents an increase of almost 70 % over the Pentagon 's 2001 budget of $ 316 billion -- and that 's without factoring in " supplementary " requests to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as the President 's Global War on Terror .
Add in those soaring sums and military spending has more than doubled in the Bush era .
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , since 2001 , funding for " defense and related programs ... has jumped at an annual average rate of 8 % ... -- four times faster than the average rate of growth for Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid ( 2 % ) , and 27 times faster than the average rate for growth for domestic discretionary programs ( 0.3 % ) . "
1,390,000 : the number of subprime foreclosures over the next two years , as estimated by Credit Suisse analysts .
They also predict that , by the end of 2012 , 12.7 % of all residential borrowers may be out of their homes as part of a housing crisis that caught the Bush administration totally off - guard .
1,000,000 : the number of " missions " or " sorties " the U.S. Air Force proudly claims to have flown in the Global War on Terror since 9/11 , more than one - third of them ( about 353,000 ) in what it still likes to call Operation Iraqi Freedom .
This is a good measure of where American energies ( and oil purchases ) have gone these last years .
509,000 : the number of names found in 2007 on a " terrorist watch list " compiled by the FBI .
No longer , in George Bush 's America , is a 10 Most Wanted list adequate .
According to ABC News , " U.S. lawmakers and their spouses have been detained because their names were on the watch list " and Saddam Hussein was on the list even when in U.S. custody .
By February 2008 , according to the American Civil Liberties Union , the names on the same FBI list had ballooned to 900,000 .
300,000 : the number of American troops who now suffer from major depression or post - traumatic stress , according to a recent RAND study .
This represents almost one out of every five soldiers who served in Iraq or Afghanistan .
Even more -- approximately 320,000 -- " report possible brain injuries from explosions or other head wounds . "
This , RAND reports , represents a barely dealt with " major health crisis . "
The depression and PTSD alone will , the study reported , " cost the nation as much as $ 6.2 billion in the two years following deployment . "
51,000 : the number of post - surge Iraqi prisoners held in American and Iraqi jails at the end of 2007 .
In that country , the U.S. now runs " perhaps the world 's largest extrajudicial internment camp , " Camp Bucca , whose holding capacity is , even now , being expanded from 20,000 to 30,000 prisoners .
Then there 's Camp Cropper , with at least 4,000 prisoners , including " hundreds of juveniles . "
Many of these prisoners were simply swept up in surge raids and have been held without charges or access to lawyers or courts ever since .
Add in prisoners ( in unknown numbers ) in our sizeable network of prisons in Afghanistan , at Guantanamo , and in our various offshore and borrowed prisons ; add in , as well , the widespread mistreatment of prisoners at American hands ; and you have the machinery for the manufacture of vast numbers of angry potential enemies , some undoubtedly willing to commit almost any act of revenge .
Though there is no way to tabulate the numbers , hundreds of thousands of prisoners have certainly cycled through the Bush administration 's various prisons in these last seven years , many emerging embittered .
( And do n't forget their embittered families . )
Think of all this as an enormous dystopian experiment in " social networking , " the Facebook from Hell without the Internet .
5,700 : the number of trailers in New Orleans -- issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as temporary housing after Hurricane Katrina -- still occupied by people who lost their homes in the storm almost three years ago .
Such trailers have also been found to contain toxic levels of formaldehyde fumes .
Katrina ( " Brownie , you 're doing a heck of a job " ) was but one of many security disasters for the Bush administration .
658 : the number of suicide bombings worldwide last year , including 542 in Afghanistan and Iraq , " more than double the number in any of the past 25 years . "
Of all the suicide bombings in the past quarter century , more than 86 % have occurred since 2001 , according to U.S. government experts .
At least one of those bombers -- who died in a recent coordinated wave of suicide bombings in the Iraqi city of Mosul -- was a Kuwaiti , Abdallah Salih al - Ajmi , who had spent years locked up in Guantanamo .
511 : the number of applicants convicted of felony crimes , including burglary , grand larceny , and aggravated assault , who were accepted into the U.S. Army in 2007 , more than double the 249 accepted in 2006 .
According to the New York Times , between 2006 and 2007 , those enrolled with convictions for wrongful possession of drugs ( not including marijuana ) almost doubled , for burglaries almost tripled , for grand larceny / larceny more than doubled , for robbery more than tripled , for aggravated assault went up by 30 % , and for " terroristic threats including bomb threats " doubled ( from one to two ) .
Feel more secure yet ?
126 : the number of dollars it took to buy a barrel of crude oil on the international market this week .
Meanwhile , the average price of a gallon of regular gas at the pump in the U.S. hit $ 3.72 , while the price of gas jumped almost 20 cents in Michigan in a week , 36 cents in Utah in a month , and busted the $ 4 ceiling in Westchester , New York , a rise of 65 cents in the last year .
Just after the 9/11 attacks , a barrel of crude oil was still in the $ 20 range ; at the time of the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 , it was at about $ 30 .
In other words , since 9/11 , a barrel of crude has risen more than $ 100 without the Bush administration taking any serious steps to promote energy conservation , cut down on the U.S. oil " addiction , " or develop alternative energy strategies ( beyond a dubious program to produce more ethanol ) .
82 : the percentage of Americans who think " things in this country have gotten pretty seriously off on the wrong track , " according to the most recent Washington Post - ABC News poll .
This is the gloomiest Americans have been about the " direction " of the country in the last 15 years of such polling .
40 : the percentage loss ( " on a trade - weighted basis " ) in the value of the dollar since 2001 .
The dollar 's share of total world foreign exchange reserves has also dropped from 73 % to 64 % in that same period .
According to the Center for American Progress , " By early May 2008 , a dollar bought 42.9 % fewer euros , 35.7 % fewer Canadian dollars , 37.7 % fewer British pounds , and 17.3 % fewer Japanese yen than in March 2001 . "
37 : the number of countries that have experienced food protests or riots in recent months due to soaring food prices , a global crisis of insecurity that caught the Bush administration completely unprepared .
In the last year , the price of wheat has risen by 130 % , of rice by 74 % , of soya by 87 % , and of corn by 31 % .
0 : the number of terrorist attacks by al - Qaeda or similar groups inside the United States since September 11 , 2001 .
So consider " the homeland " secure .
Mission accomplished .
And if you doubt that , here 's one last figure , representative of the ultimate insecurity that , by conscious omission as well as commission , the Bush administration has left a harried future to deal with :
That number is 387 : Scientists at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii just released new information on carbon dioxide -- the major greenhouse gas -- in the atmosphere , and it's at a record high of 387 parts per million , " up almost 40 % since the industrial revolution and the highest for at least the last 650,000 years . "
Its rate of increase is on the rise as well .
Behind all these figures lurks a potential world of insecurity with which this country has not yet come to grips .

Human Organs for Sale , Legally , in … Which Country ?
Here is an oversimplification of a complex problem :
1 . Thanks to the miracles of modern medicine , a sick or dying human being can receive a transplanted organ from another human being .
2 . Some of those organs must inevitably come from cadavers : i.e. , you ca n’t give your heart to someone else and still live .
But some transplanted organs can come from living people .
Chief among them is the kidney : we are born with two but can live with one .
3 . As the science has improved , there has been a huge increase in demand for transplantable organs .
But the supply has not kept up with demand .
The kidney waiting list gets longer every year , and every year more people die while still on the waiting list .
The supply of kidneys from both cadavers and living donors is insufficient .
4 . There are fewer cadaver organs than one might wish for because :
a ) Traffic fatalities continue to fall .
b ) Improved emergency - room care keeps alive people who in the past may have died .
c ) Not that many people in the U.S. choose to be organ donors upon their death .
( This could be significantly improved if the U.S. adopted a “ presumed consent ” rule , as some countries have . )
5 . There are fewer organs from living donors than one might wish for because too few people are altruistic enough to undergo surgery and give an organ to someone they may or may not know and receive no compensation for said act .
6 . Therefore , a movement is afoot to create a market for human organs in the U.S. whereby “ donors ” would be compensated for their time , trouble , and organ .
There are many objections to this market :
a) Some say , for instance , that it would exploit poor people ( although poor people are often the ones who need organs , which are currently not available ) .
b ) Others say that such a market would be impossible to properly design and regulate ( although this “ kidney exchange ” program , created by market - design expert Al Roth of Harvard , shows that one problem can have many clever answers ) .
Also , compensation could come in various forms , ranging from cash to tuition to lifetime healthcare .
c ) There seems to be a natural repugnance toward buying and selling human organs — illustrated nicely in this presentation by the economist Julio Elias , who has written with Gary Becker on a potential market for organs .
Considering all of these factors , it is hard to imagine that the U.S. will have an organ market any time soon .
There is a fervent ongoing debate over our organ shortage , including an actual debate scheduled here .
While there has been some movement toward compensating donors in Israel and in Holland , there is just one country in the world that has apparently gotten rid of its organ shortage by creating a market .
Before you read the name of that country in the following paragraph , take a guess .
Now guess again , and again — maybe 20 more times .
Benjamin E. Hippen , a transplant nephrologist ( and scholar ) in North Carolina , recently published a paper called “ Organ Sales and Moral Travails : Lessons From the Living Kidney Vendor Program in Iran . ”
Yes , Iran .
“ Although Iran clearly does not serve as a model for solving most of the world ’s problems , ” Hippen writes , “ its method for solving its organ shortage is well worth examining . ”
Here are a few facts from Hippen ’s paper :
Insofar as the kidney procurement system in Iran can be characterized as a “ market , ” it is a highly standardized and regulated market with only modest room for negotiation .
…
Vendors are paid in two ways .
First , the Iranian government provides a fixed compensation to the vendor of approximately $ 1,200 plus limited health insurance coverage , which currently extends to one year after the exchange and covers only conditions deemed related to the surgery .
Second , the vendor receives separate remuneration either from the recipient or , if the recipient is impoverished , from one of a series of designated charitable organizations ; this amount is usually between $ 2,300 and $ 4,500 . …
The most contentious disagreements in the literature regarding kidney vending in Iran have to do with the personal , physical , and financial consequences for vendors themselves .
This issue is complicated by an absence of routine follow - up . …
Despite a flourishing kidney vendor program , biologically related donation has consistently constituted 12 to 13 percent of all donated kidneys , and that fraction has persisted in tandem with the rapid rate of growth in kidneys procured ( without compensation to the donor ’s estate or family ) from deceased donors . …
I wrote to Hippen to ask what sort of reaction his paper has received .
He said it has been received “ cautiously . ”
One prominent transplant surgeon , he said ,
… is reluctant to go out of his way to include Iran in the public discussion .
While he has no quarrel with the paper that I ’m aware of , he ( legitimately ) worries that it is n’t the whole story .
I share the concern , which under the circumstances is not definitively answerable .
The other concern , phrased in various ways , is that it is just unfortunate that all of this information is coming from Iran , for obvious reasons .
Ca n’t do much about that .
People who are ideologically opposed to a market in organs , Hippen told me ,
… do n’t dispute the data , but deplore the example .
I freely concede ( and take pains to highlight ) that a crucial moral failing of the Iranian system is that there is insufficient data on the long - term outcomes of organ vendors , and the data that exist suggest that vendors are disproportionately impoverished , which in turn may put them at long - term risk for kidney disease .
The Iranian transplant professionals I corresponded with in the course of writing the paper share the concern .
When I asked Al Roth about Hippen ’s paper — which he said he admired — he raised a separate point of concern .
Not only is the health and welfare of the vendors hard to quantify , Roth said , but it is also hard to get reliable data on “ what percentage of patients with E.S.R.D. ( end - stage renal disease ) fail to get treatment , and how much this contributes to the absence of a transplant waiting list . ”
These considerable caveats aside , here is what Hippen thinks the U.S. should make of the Iranian organ market :
The portion of the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 which prohibits the sale of organs should be repealed .
…
Because so much is still unknown regarding how organ sales would work in the United States , individual transplant centers and organ procurement organizations should be permitted to experiment with how to implement a system of organ vending .
This proposal strikes me as rational and wise , though it may never be tried out here .
The repugnance factor in this country , as Roth and Elias have pointed out , may simply be too large to overcome .
But if data , like justice , is truly blind , then it is probably worthwhile to look toward a country that many Americans hate in order to save the lives of the people they love .
( If you ’ve made it to the end of this long post , you may be interested to know that I ’ll be discussing this topic sometime shortly after 6 a.m. E.D.T. on Wednesday , April 30 , on the new public - radio show The Takeaway . )
[ Addendum : Here ’s the Takeaway radio segment . ]
Some months back , Project Gazelle was launched .
It was an attempt to build a new and improved BitTorrent tracker script .
The ultimate goal is to produce a new framework for private torrent sites , faster than the common TB source , while being more secure from a code point of view , easier to modify , and more flexible .
TorrentFreak covered Gazelle at various points along its development .
From inception , through beta testing , to its public dÃ©but on What.cd , we ’ve followed the development and progress .
That progress has now lead to what could arguably be the most important day in any product ’s lifecycle , initial release day .
Yes , all those nay - sayers and early fans that have populated the comment sections of our previous stories on Gazelle can finally prove theÂ exploitsÂ and Â badÂ codingÂ that they ’ve been claiming , as the first public release candidate of the script is now available for download .
Reactions from those that have given the site a try , have been mostly positive .
The main negative comments stem from the fact it ’s not an intuitive install .
Part of that comes from the memory caching software , memcached , which gives the project its ‘ blazing speed ’ .
Also , right now the system uses XBTT as a tracker , but we ’re told that it will have its own ( multithreaded ) tracker ready for later versions , codenamed ‘ Ocelot ’ .
Also , as things stand , while they hoped for around a doubling of capacity over the older TBsource script , in practice it ’s become more like double that , meaning a 10,000 user site under TBSource can probably handle 40,000 without any major difference in site response or system load .
Project head WhatMan told TorrentFreak : “ We out - shot our initial projections by a very wide margin . ”
Interest in Project Gazelle has been fairly strong , and at least half a dozen sites are now running the new script .
Perhaps more interestingly , though , is that Gazelle is n’t JUST a torrent site .
Due to its modular nature , it can be used for regular sites as well .
It ’s a bit like a content management system in that respect , and perhaps our earlier comparison to Diferior was n’t all that far from the mark .
If you ’re interested in getting your hands on the Gazelle code , then just head over to the project site and follow the instructions .
The whole kit - and - caboodle is released under a modified version of the GPL , so have fun .
With Barack Obama on vacation and John McCain maintaining a schedule light on generating news , we decided to poke around at the Open Secrets site , to see where the money is going from donors in likely battleground states .
Advantage : Obama .
Now we realize where the donations come from does NOT mean that the votes will follow .
But it 's still interesting to take the measure of it .
Below is The Times ' interactive map of states , with the battleground states defined as those in which the margin of 2004 victory was less than 8 percentage points .
Now we go over to Open Secrets and look at its tables of states and political contributions .
For the purposes of these tables , we 're leaving out the withdrawn candidates .
And the totals include primaries , which skews the results a bit for Obama since the Democratic fight was more protracted than the Republican fight .
But it 's still interesting to mull .
State McCain raised Obama raised advantage Colorado $ 1,791,828 $ 3,386,366 Obama Delaware 208,016 230,955 Obama Florida 9,793,200 8,092,536 McCain Iowa 254,430 644,961 Obama Michigan 2,942,741 2,467,003 McCain Minnesota 1,215,608 1,786,394 Obama Missouri 1,359,332 1,988,004 Obama Nevada 1,147,931 751,545 McCain New Hampshire 538,505 945,474 Obama New Jersey 2,990,941 4,727,378 Obama New Mexico 319,863 1,192,070 Obama Ohio 1,866,001 2,134,689 Obama Oregon 650,964 1,813,428 Obama Pennsylvania 2,575,068 4,942,149 Obama Washington 1,317,906 4,995,383 Obama Wisconsin 831,661 1,378,850 Obama

Ron Paul : ' There 's no difference ' between McCain and Obama David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday August 28 , 2008
Print This Email This Former Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul has declined to endorse either John McCain or Barack Obama , and he told CNN's Kiran Chetry on Thursday that he sees " no difference " between them because both espouse foreign policies that only create more threats to our national interests .
Chetry asked Paul , " Do you think it 's a valid argument ... that a John McCain administration would be a four - year extension of the Bush administration ? "
" Sure , but I think that 's what 's going to happen with Obama , too , " Paul replied .
" There 's no difference . "
" Their foreign policies are identical , " Paul explained .
" They want more troops in Afghanistan .
They want to send more support to Georgia to protect the oil line there .
Neither one says bring home the troops from Iraq from the bases -- you know the bases are going to stay there , the embassy as big as the Vatican , that 's going to remain .
So their foreign policies are exactly the same .
They 're both very , very aggressive with Iran .
So I would say there 's no difference . "
" How would you handle these global threats , then , if it 's not to send our troops there and make sure that we 're protected ? "
Chetry asked .
" We create the threats ! " Paul replied emphatically .
" Why are we on the borders of Russia provoking the Russians ?
I mean , the Georgians initiated the military attack against these enclaves where there were mostly Russians .
...
It 's the fact that we 're over there that we create these crises . "
" Is n't it part of our duty , though , to support these fledgling democracies that ask for our help ? " asked Chetry .
" No , it 's not our responsibility to do that , " Paul said firmly .
" We should endorse the principle but not send troops and money .
...
Once we get over there , we just aggravate the situation . "
" We bombed Serbia in order for Kosovo to become independent , " Paul concluded .
" Now the Russians are doing the same thing .
...
It 's this total inconsistency . "

Why does gasoline cost so much ?
Lutz Kilian
Gas prices are a product of supply and demand .
This column attributes recent gas price increases to stagnant oil supplies and growing global demand from emerging Asian economies – not speculators .
Additional shocks to the US refining capacity further tightened gas prices in the US .
These forces will likely keep gas prices high for the foreseeable future .
At the end of 2007 , both gasoline and crude oil prices ( adjusted for inflation ) were at levels last seen in 1981 and they continued to climb throughout much of 2008 .
While Europe has been cushioned in part from these developments , as the dollar depreciated against the euro , the fundamental forces that drove up US gasoline prices have done the same in Europe .
With retail gasoline prices in the US persistently above $ 4 per gallon , the determinants of gasoline prices is no longer an esoteric topic best left to industry insiders .
The debate has moved into the mainstream .
Congressional committees as well as media pundits have advanced explanations and proposed policy changes to stem or reverse the increase in gasoline prices .
Why did this surge occur ?
To answer this , it is important to distinguish between :
the price of gasoline and other motor fuels , and
the price of crude oil in global markets .
A distinction often ignored in discussions of higher energy prices .
In a recent Vox column , Francesco Lippi discussed the price of crude .
My column focuses on the US gasoline market , which is an interesting case for understanding the underlying market forces because of the availability of high quality data for extended periods .
Supply and demand shock in the US gasoline market
Recent research has stressed the importance of identifying the demand and supply shocks underlying unpredictable shifts in the price of imported crude oil .
1
The same distinction between demand and supply shocks obviously applies to the retail gasoline market .
While crude oil is the main input in the production of motor gasoline , the US retail price of gasoline is also affected by gasoline - specific demand and supply factors , such as the ability of US refiners to process crude oil .
Refinery fires , changes in the regulatory environment or refinery outages caused by hurricanes , for example , may cause increases in the retail price of gasoline that are not driven by events in the crude oil market .
But the US market does not operate in isolation .
We can only hope to understand the evolution of US retail gasoline prices if we also account for the global demand and supply shocks that drive the price of crude oil .
In recent research , I propose such a model where global and US demand and supply shocks co-exist and there is feedback between the markets .
Estimating it on US data , my analysis helps us understand the forces been behind the surge in US gasoline prices since 2002.2
The model allows for five distinct demand and supply shocks :
global crude oil supply shocks ;
shocks to the demand for industrial commodities ( including crude oil ) that reflect fluctuations in global real activity ;
demand shocks that are specific to the crude oil market ;
domestic gasoline supply shocks ( such as refinery outages ) ; and
domestic gasoline demand shocks ( reflecting changes in the degree of urbanisation , driving habits , tastes , etc. ) .
Given the importance of crude oil imports , it is natural to focus first on developments in global crude oil markets as the likely cause of the gasoline price increases in recent years .
Crude price hikes : it ’s the demand shocks not the supply shocks
The model results show that unpredictable global oil supply disruptions ( such as unanticipated production cutbacks by OPEC or disruptions of oil production in Venezuela or Nigeria , for example ) played no role in the recent build - up of gasoline prices .
Rather the bulk of the increase in US gasoline prices since 2002 has been associated with a series of unanticipated increases in global demand for crude oil ( along with other industrial commodities ) .
Where did the extra crude demand come from ?
It can be shown that this sustained growth of demand was driven not so much by unusually high economic growth in OECD countries – although some of these economies experienced robust growth – but by additional demand from emerging Asia .
In addition to fluctuations in oil demand driven by global real activity , the model allows for demand shocks that are specific to the oil market .
Economic theory suggests that growing uncertainty about future oil supply shortfalls boosts demand as oil companies attempt to build inventories to protect themselves from being caught short .
3
As uncertainty shifts may be sudden , large and persistent , such “ precautionary ” demand shocks are a natural suspect in explaining the recent surge in oil ( and gasoline ) prices .
Precautionary inventory holding was not to blame
Such shocks played an important role in the oil price shocks of 1979 and 1990 .
My estimates , however , show that such shocks have not played a major role in recent years .
This evidence is important .
There has been a lot of public discussion in recent years about the alleged role of speculators in crude oil markets and how speculators may be reigned in by legislative changes and regulatory supervision .
4
A speculator in this context refers to someone who buys crude oil now , stores it , and hopes to sell it at a higher price later in anticipation of future shortages .
If there were speculation in global crude oil markets , the resulting extra demand in the model would by construction be reflected in an increase in the component of the price of oil driven by precautionary demand .
My model estimates clearly tell us that there is no such increase , suggesting that speculation is not behind the recent gasoline price increases .
The same conclusion is reached when looking at petroleum inventory data .
If speculation were important , we would expect to see a noticeable increase in OECD oil inventories .
The data show no such increase .
Finally , this conclusion is also consistent with the fact that most industrial commodity prices – not only the price of oil – have been growing at rapid rates in recent years .
This pattern is consistent with a general increase in the global demand for industrial commodities but not with explanations that are specific to the crude oil market .
Having reviewed the role of shocks in the global crude oil market , I now turn to the role played by US domestic gasoline demand and supply shocks .
The US gas market : shocks to US refining capacity matter
A striking result is that US domestic gasoline demand shocks have had virtually no impact on the US retail price of gasoline in recent years .
This is not surprising , as US consumption of gasoline has been moving very slowly and predictably .
Indeed , that evidence is fully consistent with the notion that increased demand for crude oil and refined products comes from emerging Asia rather than the US .
In contrast , US domestic gasoline supply disruptions have played a role – in particular following Hurricanes Rita and Katrina in 2005 .
The primary effect of these exogenous events was not the reduction in US crude oil production ( which was negligible on a world scale ) , but the reduction of crude oil refining capacity in the Gulf of Mexico .
Given that other US refineries were already operating close to capacity at the time , this event constituted a major unanticipated reduction of the supply of gasoline in the US , which would be expected to raise the price of gasoline sharply ( while lowering slightly the price of crude oil , as demand for oil imports falls ) .
The model indeed shows a sharp increase of US gasoline prices driven by adverse refinery shocks in late 2005 .
Only half a year later , the price seems to have stabilised again , although there is evidence of intermittent unanticipated refining shortages in 2006 and 2007 as well .
In short , the primary reason for the recent surge in gasoline prices has been growing global demand driven by developments abroad , given fairly inelastic global oil supplies .
This evidence helps us understand why gasoline prices have risen to record levels , but what about the future ?
Forecasting the future
Predicting gasoline prices is an all but impossible task even at horizons as short as one year .
In recent co-authored work ( Alquist and Kilian , 2008 ) , I have shown that simple no - change forecasts are the most accurate forecasts of the price of crude oil in practice .
In other words , the change in the price of oil is unpredictable .
Given the close relationship between global crude oil prices and domestic retail gasoline prices , the same result is likely to apply to US gasoline prices .
The problem with forecasting the change in gasoline prices is not so much that we do not understand its economic determinants , but that it is difficult to predict the future evolution of these determinants .
The fact that many media pundits disagree on the future course of gasoline prices reflects to a large extent the fact that they disagree on the future evolution of these determinants .
It is this uncertainty that renders the no-change forecast of gasoline prices a good approximation .
Conjectures on the future price of US gasoline
It is instructive to speculate about the future evolution of the determinants of the price of gasoline .
Abstracting from unpredictable refinery outages , the future evolution of US gasoline prices will depend primarily on developments in the global crude oil market .
Although past oil price increases have been followed by substantial increases in crude oil production with a delay of a few years , there is reason to be sceptical of the idea that substantial increases in oil production will be forthcoming in the foreseeable future .
This is not a problem of the geological scarcity of oil .
The problems are :
Oil exploration had been neglected , as the price of oil fell in the late 1990s .
The political environment in many oil - producing countries discourages oil companies from making the much - needed large - scale investments .
In particular the threat of expropriation of successful investments in many countries prevents investments from taking place at the needed pace .
Additional crude oil likely to be available in the short run is heavy crude oil that US refineries are ill equipped to process .
Building new refineries in the US takes many years .
Thus , a fair presumption is that the crude oil market will remain supply - constrained for the next few years .
With supply constrained , demand growth is the key
With crude oil production remaining flat or increasing only slowly , the price of crude oil and hence the price of gasoline will depend first and foremost on the extent to which countries in emerging Asia will continue to grow .
Clearly , the current expansion in Asia will not continue unabated – all the more so as rising energy prices will leave their mark abroad while the US economy is already slowing .
While a decline in demand seems inevitable , what is not clear is how soon that decline will occur and by how much global demand for industrial commodities will slow .
If past global expansions are a guide , global demand will recede only gradually .
This is a direct implication of the model underlying this analysis .
This suggests that US gasoline prices will remain high for the time being .
Barring a major economic collapse in emerging Asia , prices will stabilise only as the world economy learns to economise on the use of oil and gasoline and as the supply of crude oil expands .
Both corrective forces will take time to gain momentum .
In addition , there is reason to be concerned that oil - market specific developments , which for the most part have played no role since 2002 , could become more important in the future .
Oil - market specific developments
Sharp shifts in the precautionary demand for oil reflecting uncertainty about political developments in the Middle East tend to occur only when demand for crude oil exceeds supply .
When they do occur , they tend to cause sharp increases in the price of crude oil , as in 1990 / 91 , for example .
Under the current conditions , the world economy is particularly vulnerable to threats of military conflict in the Middle East .
A good example is Iran ’s threat to close the Straits of Hormuz if Iran were to be attacked by Israel .
Such developments could potentially cause US gasoline price movements that dwarf the effect of sustained strong global demand for industrial commodities .
In short , based on this interpretation of the evidence , the price of crude oil and hence the price of gasoline is likely to stay high for the foreseeable future , but there is considerable uncertainty in either direction .

Django is one of the best web frameworks out there .
Although no project is perfect , any project wanting to best Django has a tough act to follow .
Here ’s why :
Django is a full stack .
This means that while it is possible to replace bits and pieces with other bits and pieces , it provides everything you need by default .
Each of the provided pieces is well integrated and works .
For example , the auto - generated admin interface is quite a time saver , and is possible only because the forms , templating , authentication , and ORM systems are all working nicely together .
Django is trivial to extend .
When you are working on a project and you come up with some crazy idea , you can make it real in minutes .
Django Middleware allows you to extend how requests are handled .
Want to add an HTTP response header that tells you how long it took Django to process the page ?
Done .
Middleware also allows you to modify content .
This can be useful for database debugging .
Want to add templating commands ?
Template tags to the rescue .
The list goes on and on .
Django is written in Python .
Python is really easy to learn , and regardless of what you hear , the significant whitespace makes code enjoyable to read .
How easy ?
I hired someone who had never used Python or Django , and they wrote the Chesspark forum in about a week .
Other benefits of Python abound .
Want a certain view to be locked down ?
Python ’s decorators will help ; just add ‘ @login_required ’ above the view definintion and you ’re done .
Django has a large and helpful community of users .
Got some code snippets to share ?
Try Django snippets .
Have a question ?
Ask on the mailing list or in the chat room .
Look at what those users create at djangosites .
They also love to write about Django in their blogs .
Django documentation is excellent .
It amazes me how good the documentation is .
It ’s not just “ most open source projects documentation sucks so this is infinitely better ” good ; it is really good .
Anytime I have some weird question , it ’s almost surely mentioned in the documentation along with an example .
Just look at it .
It ’s huge .
This documentation puts many commercial projects to shame , and is something that other open source projects should aspire to .
It makes the project accessible to many that probably gave up in frustration using other web frameworks .
If you have n’t looked at Django yet , the overview is a great place to get a feel for it .
I highly encourage you to take a peek and see what you ’re missing .
The best part of it all is , Django is not even finished !
The 0.96 version is very stable and in wide use , but those guys have not been resting on their laurels .
The 1.0 version has a tentative date of September 2008 , with alpha and beta releases to start in about a month .
A lot of the bits and pieces are getting significantly better .
You do n’t even have to wait for them if you are curious since most of them are completed ( or nearly so ) in the repository .
I look around at young people these days , and I honestly fear for the future of my country .
People are becoming less and less resilient and more and more clueless on how to survive in the real world .
We live in a society of namby pamby men and women who whine when they do n’t get what they want and think they are entitled to all the comforts the world has to offer .
What do I blame it on ?
Bad parenting .
Baby Boomer parents developed a parenting philosophy that was soft on discipline and heavy on spoiling their children .
Because many Boomer couples were both working , they wanted to make sure their children liked them to make up for the lack of time they were spending with their children .
Generation X parents are even worse about coddling their kids .
To many many Gen X parents , children are just an accessory you get to dress up with ironic t- shirts and fauxhawks .
In an effort to stop the wussification of yet another generation of children , here are six ways young fathers can raise strong , resilient , and independent children .
1 . Give them some independence
Several weeks ago there was a large brouhaha over a NY journalist — Lenore Skenazy — having allowed her 9 year old son to ride the subway home all by himself .
Some people chastised the mother for putting her son in danger , while others wrote in to applaud her decision and to share their own stories of taking solo adventures as a child .
I , of course , side with the latter .
Kids ca n’t venture a half a mile from their homes these days without parents worrying for their safety .
I live in a quiet suburban neighborhood adjacent to a middle school .
Every day , SUVs line up down the street to pick up their kids because heaven forbid they would walk the mile home by themselves .
They could be snatched !
This culture of obsessive over - protectiveness is bred by the media .
As the 24 hour news networks and Satan ’s minion , Nancy Grace , regurgitate stories of abduction over and over and over again , it begins to seem like the world outside your suburban castle is a very dangerous place indeed .
Yet the reality is very different from how the media spins it .
According to Newsweek :
Nationwide , stranger abductions are extremely rare ; there ’s a one - in - a- million chance a child will be taken by a stranger , according to the Justice Department .
And 90 percent of sexual abuse cases are committed by someone the child knows .
Mortality rates from all causes , including disease and accidents , for American children are lower now than they were 25 years ago .
According to Child Trends , a nonprofit , nonpartisan research group , between 1980 and 2003 death rates dropped by 44 percent for children ages five to 14 and 32 percent for teens aged 15 to 19 .
Do n’t coddle your kids by keeping them under lock and key and only letting them out if you can keep a constant eye on them .
You ’re squelching their development and sense of independence .
Teach your kids how to stay out of trouble and away from strangers , and then turn them loose to ride their bikes , roam the neighborhoods , run errands , and walk to school by themselves .
Listen to our podcast interview with Lenore :
2 . Let them do unsafe things
“ Helicopter parents ” not only worry about their child being abducted , they wring their hands over letting their children do anything mildly unsafe .
Everything today is childproof and fun proof .
Have you been to a playground lately ?
Did you notice what was missing ?
Teeter - totters , merry - go - rounds , and sometimes even swings are going extinct , replaced by plastic coated , low to the ground , snooze inducing apparatuses .
Some playgrounds even have signs that say “ no running . ” I kid you not .
While these changes are often pushed by city managers worried about liability , parents are equally at fault in trying to clear any dangers from the path of their children .
They fail to understand that while sticking kids in a protective bubble may keep them in safe in the short - term , it leaves them more vulnerable in the long run .
Some lessons in safety must be learned from trial and error .
If children do n’t learn to deal with dangerous tools and situations growing up , when they finally leave the nest , they will be lacking in the skills necessary to negotiate the real world .
Check out our article on 23 dangerous things every kid should do .
3 . Do n’t be their best friend
I recently read an interview with Billy Ray Cyrus in which he was asked how he keeps his daughter Miley from turning into another Hollywood train wreck ( this was before the topless pictures in Vanity Fair episode ) .
He responded by saying , “ I always try to be her best friend . ”
While many parents applaud such a philosophy , it is fundamentally the wrong way to raise a child .
Parents want to believe they can be their child ’s best friend because they enjoy such a healthy , close relationship .
The reality is that parents want to be their child ’s best friend because they ’re afraid of their kid not liking them .
But parenting is not a popularity contest .
Being a true parent means that sometimes you have to lay down the rules , and oftentimes your kid is not going to like it .
While “ tough love ” may be painful for both child and parent in the short term , it greatly benefits both in the long term .
Kids do n’t need a best friend , they need an authority figure .
Deep down , they do want someone to lay down the rules and give them some structure .
They want guidance .
Best friends are equals , parents and children are not .
If you insist on being your kid ’s best friend , a situation will inevitably arise where you do finally try to reign them in and make them respect you .
But it will be too late ; they ’ll feel free to toss your advice aside like they would for any friend .
4 . Do n’t automatically take their side
My mom works at an elementary school .
One day , one of the students was causing all manner of trouble : disrespecting the teachers , throwing tantrums , and antagonizing the other children .
It got to the point where the girl ’s parents actually had to be called to come take the child home .
When the mom arrived , she gave the teachers the stink eye , turned to her kid and said , “ Awww , you ’ve been having a tough day , have n’t you Sweetie ?
Let ’s go buy you a toy . ”
While it ’s natural to think the best of your children , do n’t be overly defensive when others criticize them .
Teachers and friends typically do not have ulterior motives when sharing a story of your child ’s misbehavior .
As outside observers , they may have valuable insight into something about your kid that you have overlooked and need to address .
Your child needs to earn your trust , just as anyone else does .
Do n’t give it to them automatically .
5 . Make them work for what they get
Many young people today are swimming in debt up to their ears .
They feel entitled to the things it took their parents 30 years to acquire .
Such a problem exists because many young people have never had to earn the things they ’ve enjoyed .
They expect the good things in life to naturally flow into their lives .
If children are not given responsibilities and work as a young age , it ’s harder to instill the ethic when they ’re older .
You ’re doing your child a great disservice if you buy every stinking thing they want .
Sure , it ’s easier to just buy them the $ 10.00 toy just to shut their tantrum up .
But all you ’re doing is conditioning them to the idea that if you whine enough , you ’ll get what you want .
By encouraging your children to work for what they get , you ’ll be teaching them valuable skills that they will carry with them the rest of their life .
Not only will they develop an appreciation for work , they ’ll learn valuable money management skills , responsibility , and initiative .
During the early 1900s kids were working 60 hours a week in factories and coal mines .
While it was a deplorable situation , it shows that kids are capable of taking on far greater tasks than parents today are willing to give them .
They may no longer have to break slate , but they can at least clean the bathroom and mow the lawn .
6 . Do n’t praise them indiscriminately
“ If everyone is special , then no one is ” - The Incredibles
One year , I volunteered at an after - school program at an elementary school .
At the end of the summer we had an awards ceremony for the kids .
The very PC director ( no Pilgrim or Indian crafts on Thanksgiving ! ) insisted that every kid , whether they deserved one or not , had to receive an award , lest anyone should feel left out .
So we were forced to think of awards even for the kids who had consistently misbehaved and caused trouble .
Upon such students we ended up bestowing the “ High Energy Award . ”
What a crock .
What ’s the point of an award if everyone gets one ?
What ’s the point in striving to be your best , if everyone is equally rewarded ?
Praise then loses all of its meaning , even for those who really deserve it .
Every parent believes their kid is special ; that ’s natural .
But if you heap enormous and unwarranted praise on your kids , it ’s going to end up debilitating them .
Praising your child indiscriminately sends the message that praise is not earned , it is something one is naturally entitled too .
It will end up dissolving their competitive drive .
These children grow up believing they can do anything and everything well .
Thus , they become restless at every job , quit , go to culinary school , then getting a masters in philosophy , and then think they ’d like to try to enter the space program .
The reality is that there are certain things we are good at , and certain things we are not .
If you praise your kids for everything , they ’ll have a harder time honing in on their true talents and abilities .
Instead of praising them indiscriminately , center your praise on specific achievements .
For example , say , “ You did a great job on your math test . ”
Not , “ You are so smart and wonderful ! ”
Matt Aimonetti has a client that believes Rubyists do n't scale .
Sorry Matt , your client is wrong .
It 's as easy to hire great Ruby programmers as it is to hire great Java programmers or great programmers for any given popular language .
The problem is , it 's not easy to hire great programmers in any language .
Worse , companies still think they need to hire one or two great programmers and a supporting cast of average programmers .
As Martin Fowler pointed out , cheaper developers are actually more expensive than experts .
To make things worse , if you end up with a NNPP or two you 'll be headed in the wrong direction .
As I 've said before , 50 % of all programmers need to find a new profession .
In the short term this will create a much larger demand for developers , and salaries will rise .
However , since one expert programmer produces significantly more ( up to 28 times more ) than two terrible programmers , companies will ultimately save money .
It 's unlikely that salaries of experts will rise to the sum of 28 terrible programmer 's salaries .
Some people believe that the average programmers are valuable because they do the jobs the experts do n't feel like doing .
This is simply wrong .
Average programmers will do average jobs on mundane tasks , which often turns into a mess for expert programmers to fix .
Even if the solution proposed by average programmers does n't require an entire rewrite , it is often sub-optimal and can have implications with other pieces of software that rely on it .
There 's a better way .
Give mundane tasks to expert programmers .
Expert programmers remove or automate mundane tasks .
The solutions will be superior , and either way the experts wo n't be doing mundane tasks .
If you have great programmers producing up to 28 times more , and you only hire great programmers , how many programmers do you think you need ?
Of course the answer depends on how much software needs to be written , but in general teams can become a lot smaller .
And this is the problem with Matt 's client 's statement .
While they may not be able to easily build a team of average Ruby developers , it does n't matter , that 's the wrong goal .
Of course , I have no way of knowing the caliber they were looking to hire .
But , I do know if they wanted Ruby experts that will travel , ThoughtWorks employs several .
So , I 'm left to guess that they fell into the same old misguided pattern of trying to pay average salaries to average developers .
I'm left wondering why they would take expert advice on what technology to use , hire an expert , achieve success and then stop pursuing experts .
Of course , I 'm not surprised .
As a consultant , I saw it time and time again .
The question is n't whether you can hire rubyists or not , it 's whether or not you are willing to put the effort in to hire experts .
It is n't easy to hire experts regardless of the language , but it is worth it .
A bumper sticker I had n’t seen before :
How much truth do you think is in that statement ?
Certainly , you do n’t hear about many openly atheist killers .
But not all murders occur in the name of God , either .
It ’s easy to argue that people who kill , while most may be theistic , were n’t particularly “ Godly ” at the time of their crime .

If you have n’t read part 1 and are n’t familiar with the term Unobtrusive JavaScript and / or the basics of Dan Webb ’s lowpro , I strongly recommend reading part 1 before going on with this part .
Taking it further – lowpro behaviors
Let ’s re-visit the rollover example from part 1 .
We wanted to have a simple rollover effect for all our images with the CSS class rollover .
Just for fun , I ’ll start at the end and show you the code that results from using a behavior before we implement the actual behavior :
Event .
addBehavior ( { // expects image names to be in the following format : some_image.extension ' img.rollover ' : Rollover } ) ;
Wow – we ’ve compressed 20 lines compressed into a single line of code .
And it ’s even more declarative than before !
But of course this does n’t come for free – we still need to define the behavior ourselves :
Rollover = Behavior .
create ( { initialize : function ( ) { this .
split_src = this .
element . src . split ( /\./ ) ; this .
parts = this .
split_src . first ( ) . split ( /_/ ) ; // split main part and extension this .
extension = this .
split_src . last ( ) ; } , onmouseover : function ( e ) { if ( this .
parts .
last ( ) != ' over ' ) { this .
parts .
push ( ' over ' ) ; this .
element . src = [ this .
parts .
join ( ' _ ' ) , this .
extension ]. join ( '.' ) ; } } , onmouseout : function ( e ) { if ( this .
parts .
last ( ) == ' over ' ) { this .
parts . pop ( ) ; this .
element . src = [ this .
parts .
join ( ' _ ' ) , this .
extension ]. join ( '.' ) ; } } } ) ;
Most of the code still looks the same as in part 1 but now we ’ve encapsulated the behavior into a separate behavioral class – which is great , from an OO point of view .
Every element on the page that suffices the conditions ( i.e. it is an image with class rollover_ ) will instantiate its own Rollover object that handles its events ( _onmouseover and onmouseout ) .
Taking a closer look at the Rollover class , you ’ll notice that there is an initialize method that we have n’t had before .
As usual in Prototype , this is the constructor :
It takes responsibility for setting up a basic Rollover object .
In this case , it initializes the parts array and the extension for further use in the actual behavioral methods .
We can go further and apply a namespacing strategy to keep our behaviors neatly ordered : Just rename Rollover to Image .
Rollover to be more explicit .
For practice , let ’s also rewrite the labeled form example from the first article to be a behavior .
NOTE : I had a little error in the code of the first part .
I set the value correctly ( using .value for textfields and .innerHTML for textareas ) but when reading the values I only used the .value version .
This has been corrected for this article to use the $ F utility method .
I ’ve also internalized the hiding of the associated label .
Form .
WithInlineLabels = Behavior .
create ( { initialize : function ( ) { this .
label = this .
element .
previous ( ' label ' ) ; this .
label . hide ( ) ; this .
labelText = this .
label .
innerHTML ; this .
element .
tagName == ' TEXTAREA ' ?
this .
element .
innerHTML = this .
labelText : this .
element .
value = this .
labelText ; this .
element .
addClassName ( ' with_label ' ) ; } , onfocus : function ( e ) { if ( $ F ( this .
element ) == this .
labelText ) { this .
element .
removeClassName ( ' with_label ' ) ; this .
element .
tagName == ' TEXTAREA ' ?
this .
element .
innerHTML = '' : this .
element .
value = '' ; } } , onblur : function ( e ) { if ( $ F ( this .
element ) . blank ( ) ) { this .
element .
addClassName ( ' with_label ' ) ; this .
element .
tagName == ' TEXTAREA ' ?
this .
element .
innerHTML = this .
labelText : this .
element .
value = this .
labelText ; } } } ) ;
Yet again , this makes the call in Event.
addBehavior dead easy :
Event .
addBehavior ( { // makes all textfields and textareas use inline labels ' input [ type=text ] , textarea ' : Form . WithInlineLabels } ) ;
Do n’t rewrite – reuse !
So what ’s the advantage of using this approach apart from saving a few lines of code and making the body of Event .
addBehavior way more declarative and concise ?
Well , a behavior is a set of definition how a certain element reacts to given events ( e.g. when hovered with the mouse , when clicked , etc. ) .
So each behavior object encapsulates functionality – and in OOP , encapsulated functionality usually means that the functionality is reusable and maintainable .
It ’s like that for lowpro behaviors :
You can easily re-use the behavior in other projects .
Just put all your behaviors in a separate JavaScript file .
After that , you could have a setup like the following :
< script src= " /javascripts/prototype.js " type= " text / javascript " ></script > < script src= " /javascripts/lowpro.js " type= " text / javascript " ></script > < script src= " /javascripts/behaviors.js " type= " text / javascript " ></script > < script src= " /javascripts/application.js " type= " text / javascript " ></ script >
behaviors.js keeps a collection of all your behavioral classes ( you could even split it into multiple files once you ’ve defined a bunch of behaviors that are related ) and application .js connects them to DOM elements using Event.addBehavior .
Great and clean separation of concerns !
If you find that you ’ve created lots of behaviors , you can even split them further and have behaviors.image.js , behaviors.form.js etc .
Making it more dynamic – passing in arguments
Let ’s look at an example where we extend our existing behavior because this also gives us the opportunity of looking at the possibility to pass in arguments to a behavior to make it a little more dynamic .
Take a look at the form with inline labels again and assume that you want some forms to not hide the labels but instead show them together with the inline labels .
Form .
WithInlineLabels = Behavior .
create ( { initialize : function ( options ) { this .
options = options || {} ; this .
label = this .
element .
previous ( ' label ' ) ; if ( ! this .
options [ " showLabels " ] ) { this .
label . hide ( ) ; } this .
labelText = this .
label .
innerHTML ; this .
element .
tagName == ' TEXTAREA ' ?
this .
element .
innerHTML = this .
labelText : this .
element .
value = this .
labelText ; this .
element .
addClassName ( ' with_label ' ) ; } , // ... onfocus and onblur definitions } ) ;
Now the behavior takes an optional hash named options as a parameter .
Now we can use both variants , with and without labels ( default is , of course , without labels ) :
Event .
addBehavior ( { ' form.withLabels input[type=text ] , form.withLabels textarea ' : Form .
WithInlineLabels ( { showLabels : true } ) , ' form.withoutLabels input[type=text ] , form.withoutLabels textarea ' : Form . WithInlineLabels } ) ;
Why did I use an options hash instead of just using a simple parameter ?
After all , we ’re only passing in one argument , right ?
Well , for now , yes , there ’s only one option : showLabels .
But we do n’t know what we might add in the future :
There might be other options as well and there might be bugfixes .
If we change methods without being careful , we might break backwards compatibility – and if we do , we might have to hack our bugfixes in if we want / need to use them .
Would n’t it be nice if we could just drop the behavior in an replace the old , buggy one ?
Turns out that hashes are a great way to do that .
If you had deployed the first version of the behavior ( the one without the showLabels option ) and then later added the new option to it ( and maybe some bugfixes ) , you could easily replace the old behavior .
Why ?
Because nothing changes for the existing code :
The behavior can still be used without a parameter and it defaults to the old behavior !
If you make sure that you ’re backwards compatible , anytime you find that you need new options or if you discover a bug , you can just go in , fix it and deploy it to all your existing projects .
Now that ’s really cool !
And by the way :
This is how most cool frameworks in pretty much every programming language handle it , so it ’s pretty much become some kind of best practice .
Think of Ajax .
Request in Prototype , for example :
It takes the URL of the request as its first parameter ( this makes sense – there absolutely needs to be a URL – otherwise there ’s not going to be a request ! ) and all its options as its second parameter .
If Sam Stephenson decided that the class needs more options , he can just add them without breaking existing installations .
Pre-defined behaviors
Writing your own behaviors is n’t actually the only option .
lowpro actually ships with a couple of useful AJAX behaviors : Remote .
Link , Remote .
Form , Remote and Observed .
You can find some additional ( partly non -AJAX ) behaviors in Dan ’s SVN repository .
Right now , only the DateSelector , Calendar and the drag&drop behaviors are implemented .
I also have to admit that I have n’t tested these yet , so I do n’t know whether they work correctly or not !
I ’d give you an example of using Remote .
Link but there ’s already a great example out there written by Matt Aimonetti :
In his article AJAX pagination in less than 5 minutes he shows how to use the great will_paginate plugin with AJAX .
Speaking of AJAX : If your application relies heavily on AJAX , you ’ll find that quite often you add or modify elements of your page .
Now imagine , you add content to the DOM that contains one or more images with class rollover .
Since lowpro adds behaviors when the dom:ready event fires , the behaviors wo n’t get attached to elements that are added afterwards .
Of course , Dan realized that and provided you with an option to ensure that behaviors are assigned properly after AJAX requests :
Event .
addBehavior .
reassignAfterAjax = true ;
This triggers an additional onComplete handler for AJAX responders that lowpro defined .
When triggered , it reloads the behaviors and reassigns them to the matching elements .
This way , the behaviors you define are applied to each and every element that shows up on the page – either right from the start or after some AJAX requests .
One more thing while we ’re talking about pre-defined behaviors .
I have n’t talked about extending existing behaviors by subclassing them .
If you take a look at the lowpro source you ’ll find the following implementation of the Remote behaviors :
Remote .
Base = { // code } Remote .
Link = Behavior .
create ( Remote .
Base , { // code } ) ; Remote .
Form = Behavior .
create ( Remote .
Base , { // code } ) ;
I ’ve left out the code for the sake of brevity .
What you can see here is that the Remote .
Link and the Remote .
Form behavior both extend the behavior of Remote .
Base .
This behaves quite similarly to Prototype ’s Class .
create – it ’s just plain old subclassing that you ’ll find in every object - oriented language .
Since I assume that you understand the basics of OOP I wo n’t go into detail here .
Resumé
lowpro gives you the ability to easily define and apply behaviors for given elements on the page .
Compared to the approach of the first article , this gives you not only a clear separation of concerns ( i.e. HTML for structure , CSS for design , JavaScript for functionality – without them cluttering up each other ) but also clearly encapsulates functionality and makes it reusable and easily maintainable .
If you discover a bug or a browser incompatibility ( mind you , IE8 is under way … ) you can just go in an fix the bug in one place ( i.e. the behavior class ) and deploy the new behaviors for all your projects .
Ideally , you do n’t even have to modify anything else – now that ’s great , is n’t it ?!
Finally , here are a few suggestions about using lowpro :
The first rule is easy :
Whenever you ’re defining how an element should react to certain events , use lowpro .
It makes your code more maintainable and gives you a clear separation of concerns .
If you feel that you ’re defining a behavior that you might in future projects , externalize it in a behavior class .
After that , it ’s best to put it in an extra JavaScript file ( e.g. behaviors.js ) to make it easier to use for other projects .
When defining behaviors , try to be as general as possible .
It ’s absolutely okay to make a few assumptions about page structure and CSS ( remember : Convention over Configuration ) but general applicability is what sets a really good behavior apart .
( remember : Convention over Configuration ) but general applicability is what sets a really good behavior apart .
If you need to configure your behavior objects , use parameters .
If there ’s one or two arguments that your behavior absolutely needs ( like Ajax .
Request needs a URL ) , use scalars – otherwise use an options hash .
If you want to ensure backwards compatibility , do n’t ever change the method signature – only add new parameters at the end and make them optional .

SINCE we 're studying the Chicago economist at present , I could n't help but pass along this from Megan McArdle .
Apparently , some faculty members at the University of Chicago have written a letter :
Many colleagues are distressed by the notoriety of the Chicago School of Economics , especially throughout much of the global south , where they have often to defend the University ’s reputation in the face of its negative image .
The effects of the neoliberal global order that has been put in place in recent decades , strongly buttressed by the Chicago School of Economics , have by no means been unequivocally positive .
Many would argue that they have been negative for much of the world 's population , leading to the weakening of a number of struggling local economies in the service of globalized capital , and many would question the substitution of monetization for democratization under the banner of “ market democracy . ”
Oh , goodness .
Ms McArdle fumes :
The last paragraph makes these eminent professors seem , to put it charitably , not quite bright .
Otherwise , how does one find a statement like this inflammatory ?
Following Friedman ’s lead , the design and evaluation of economic policy requires analyses that respect the incentives of individuals and the essential role of markets in allocating goods and services .
As Friedman and others continually demonstrated , design of public policy without regard to market alternatives has adverse social consequences .
Do they think that we should do analyses that does n't pay attention to individual incentives or the role of markets in allocating goods and services ?
Are they under the impression that there is still a debate on this ?
I thought the fall of the Soviet Union had rather spectacularly demonstrated that it's hard to allocate goods and services without markets .
Indeed , one wonders where all these professors get their groceries .
Perhaps these professors should take advantage of the proximity of the Milton Friedman Institute and sit in on a few courses .
Hopefully , the next president , whoever he is , will have sense enough to realize that an anti-missile site in Eastern Europe is not worth rekindling the Cold War with Russia .
Though the press pays little attention to it , the Bush administration has already practically wrecked relations with Russia by insisting on adding the Eastern European countries to NATO and siting his anti-missile system in the Czech Republic and in Poland .
The Russians are right that it represents a threat to their security .
President Bush ’s lame excuse that the system is designed to protect Europe from Iranian missiles is no doubt another deliberate lie .
I ca n’t think of any reason whatsoever for Iran to attack Europe , and I ’m sure the Iranians can ’t , either .
Iran has n’t attacked anybody for more than 100 years .
They would have absolutely nothing to gain by firing a few missiles at Europe .
It does n’t make any sense at all .
Nor does it make any sense to add the small countries of Eastern Europe to NATO .
This was a war - fighting alliance set up at the end of World War II specifically to deter and , if necessary , go to war with the Red Army .
The Soviet Union set up its own alliance , the Warsaw Pact .
When the Soviet Union collapsed , Russia withdrew its army from Eastern Europe and dissolved the Warsaw Pact .
The United States should have dissolved NATO .
Its sole purpose vanished with the Soviet Union .
It has no enemy , unless fools in the U.S. create one .
The American politicians have used it in the Yugoslavian Civil War , and now has it involved in the Afghanistan insurgency .
Why the Europeans put up with this nonsense is beyond me .
As for including little countries , that ’s a strategic blunder .
Do you think that if the Russians one day launched nuclear missiles at the United States that Poland and Lithuania would go to war against their large neighbor ?
Will France become a nation of teetotalers ?
In fact , including small countries in military alliances is worthless posturing .
All you do is allow the little country to get you into trouble by its bad behavior .
The little country is confident that its big ally will rescue it if it goes too far in antagonizing its larger neighbors .
It ’s like a spoiled brat with a bodyguard .
Sixty years after its founding , Israel is still at war with most of its neighbors precisely because it has no incentive to make a sensible peace .
Why should it ?
It has its American attack dog .
The only peace treaties it has signed are with Egypt and Jordan , both of which the U.S. bribed to make peace .
Bribe or not , in both cases it ’s a cold peace .
Believe it or not , we are not at war with any nation at the present .
We made war on Iraq , but that has long since become nothing but an occupation .
We are occupying or trying to occupy Afghanistan , but other than that , we are not at war .
Why then do we need military alliances ?
Why do we need troops in Korea , Japan and Germany ?
Or , I hasten to add , Iraq and the Persian Gulf ?
President Bush ’s war on terror is a false metaphor , and a dangerous one at that .
There is no terrorist army or air force .
There are some gangs of criminals .
What the president did when he adopted this specious metaphor about a war on terror was to commit the United States to perpetual war .
Ask your local warmonger how he defines victory in the war on terror .
Ask why when Iraq was very violent we could n’t leave , and now that it ’s less violent , we ca n’t leave .
Ask him how he defines victory in Iraq or in Afghanistan .
We really have neither a republic nor a democracy .
We have a war state and an empire .
We should pull the plug on both .

( CNN ) --
Two airmen were found dead in the Pacific Ocean and rescuers were trying to find four others after a U.S. Air Force B - 52 crashed off the island of Guam on Monday , the Air Force said .
The B - 52H Stratofortress , like this one , was in Guam as part of a four - month rotation .
Rescuers found the bodies about 30 miles northwest of Guam , not far from where the bomber was believed to have crashed at about 9:45 a.m. local time , the Air Force said .
One of the dead airmen was identified , but the identity was withheld pending family notification , the Air Force said .
Search crews have found no survivors , but they are still looking , said Lt. Elizabeth Buendia , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Coast Guard in Guam , which is a U.S. territory .
The B - 52H Stratofortress had six airmen aboard and was on a training mission when it crashed , the Air Force said .
It was scheduled to fly over crowds celebrating Liberation Day , which commemorates the U.S. capture of Guam from Japan in 1944 , the Air Force said .
The bomber was based at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana but was at Guam 's Andersen Air Force Base as part of a four - month rotation , said Capt .
Joel Stark , an Andersen Air Force Base spokesman .
No weapons or munitions were aboard the aircraft and information on what led to the crash was n't available , the Air Force said .
In February , a B - 2 stealth bomber crashed shortly after takeoff from Andersen Air Force Base .
Two crew members ejected and were in good condition afterward .

Although state lotteries , on average , return just 53 cents for every dollar spent on a ticket , people continue to pour money into them — especially low - income people , who spend a larger percentage of their incomes on lottery tickets than do the wealthier segments of society .
A new Carnegie Mellon University study sheds light on the reasons why low - income lottery players eagerly invest in a product that provides poor returns .
In the study , published in the July issue of the Journal of Behavioral Decision Making , participants who were made to feel subjectively poor bought nearly twice as many lottery tickets as a comparison group that was made to feel subjectively more affluent .
The Carnegie Mellon findings point to poverty 's central role in people 's decisions to buy lottery tickets .
" Some poor people see playing the lottery as their best opportunity for improving their financial situations , albeit wrongly so , " said the study 's lead author Emily Haisley , a doctoral student in the Department of Organizational Behavior and Theory at Carnegie Mellon 's Tepper School of Business .
" The hope of getting out of poverty encourages people to continue to buy tickets , even though their chances of stumbling upon a life - changing windfall are nearly impossibly slim and buying lottery tickets in fact exacerbates the very poverty that purchasers are hoping to escape . "
The researchers influenced participants ' perceptions of their relative wealth — or lack thereof — by having them complete a survey on their opinions of the city of Pittsburgh that included an item on annual income .
The group made to feel poor was asked to provide its income on a scale that began at " less than $ 100,000 " and went upward from there in $ 100,000 increments , ensuring that most respondents would be in the lowest income category .
The group made to feel subjectively wealthier was asked to report income on a scale that began with " less than $ 10,000 " and increased in $ 10,000 increments , leading most respondents to be in a middle or upper tier .
Participants , who were recruited at Pittsburgh 's Greyhound Bus terminal , were paid $ 5 for completing the survey and given the opportunity to buy as many as five scratch - off lottery tickets .
The experimental group purchased an average of 1.27 lottery tickets , compared with 0.67 tickets bought by the members of the control group .
A second experiment reported in the paper found that indirectly reminding participants that , while different income groups face unequal outcomes in education , jobs and housing , everyone has equal chances of winning the lottery induced an increase in the number of lottery tickets purchased .
The group given this reminder purchased 1.31 tickets , compared with 0.54 for the group not given such a reminder .
In the study , the researchers note that lotteries set off a vicious cycle that not only exploits low - income individuals ' desires to escape poverty but also directly prevents them from improving upon their financial situations .
They recommend that state lottery administrators explore strategies that balance the economic burdens faced by low - income households with the need to maintain important funding streams for state governments .
" State lotteries are popular revenue sources that are unlikely to go away anytime soon , " said George Loewenstein , a study co-author and Herbert A. Simon professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon .
" However , it is possible to implement measures that can actually benefit low - income lottery players and lead to fairer outcomes . "
Loewenstein noted that one such potential method for addressing income inequality , which has shown promise in other countries , is tying lottery tickets to savings accounts .

If there ’s one problem that plagues most business meetings it ’s that a few participants are doing most of the talking .
If you ’re one of those people who tend to talk a lot , here are 5 tips to help you shut up and listen when you need to .
1 : Put your hand over your mouth
You can put one hand over the lower part of your face and your mouth .
To an outside observer you will look thoughtful and observant .
In reality your holding your mouth forcibly shut .
It ’s a simple physical reminder to yourself to not speak right now .
2 : Ask some great questions
People find you very intelligent and persuasive when you let them talk .
For instance , the most successful sales meetings are the ones where the customer does almost all the talking .
A great way to get them talking , and still feel that you ’re contributing , is to ask great questions .
3 : Keep track
Have a piece of paper in front of you and make a mark on it every time you speak .
Notice how many marks you get up to during a meeting .
4 : Notice how you feel when you ’re quiet
In my case , I get real antsy when there ’s something I ’m itching to say .
My body tenses up , I tend to hold my breath and I feel generally very uncomfortable .
This pressure eventually forces me to speak up .
How about you – how do you feel when there ’s something you really want to say ?
5 : Ask yourself a simple question
Before you speak , ask yourself this : “ Is what I ’m about to say something I need to say or something the other participants need to hear ? ”
Those are often not the same .
The upshot
Remember : good meetings are not characterized by the amount of talking but by the amount of listening going on .
If you ’re a habitual talker like me , I ’m sure that you will find that learning to say less and listen more will be a huge boon .
People will find you more sympathetic , they will respect you more and even though you may end up saying less , what you do say will be received more appreciatively and have much more of an impact .

By Thomas Sowell - July 22 , 2008
In one of those front - page editorials disguised as " news " stories , the New York Times blames " the lucrative lending practices " of banks and other financial institutions for helping create the current financial crisis of millions of borrowers and of the financial system in general .
It must take either a willful determination to believe whatever they want to believe or a cynical desire to propagandize their readers for the New York Times to call " lucrative " the lending practices that have caused many lenders to lose millions of dollars , some to lose billions and some to go bankrupt themselves .
Blaming the lenders is the party line of Congressional Democrats as well .
What we need is more government regulation of lenders , they say , to protect the innocent borrowers from " predatory " lending practices .
Before going further down that road , it may be useful to look back at what got us into this mess in the first place .
It was not that many years ago when there was moral outrage ringing throughout the media because lenders were reluctant to lend in certain neighborhoods and because banks did not approve mortgage loan applications from blacks as often as they approved mortgage loan applications from whites .
All this was an opening salvo in a campaign to get Congress to pass laws forcing lenders to lend to people they would not otherwise lend to and in places where they would not otherwise put their money .
The practice of not lending in some neighborhoods was demonized as " redlining " and the fact that minority applicants were approved for mortgages only 72 percent of the time , while whites were approved 89 percent , was called " overwhelming " evidence of discrimination by the Washington Post .
Some people are more easily overwhelmed than others , especially when they find statistics that seem to fit their preconceptions .
But if we do what politicians and the media seldom bother to do -- stop and think -- an entirely different picture emerges .
In our own personal lives , common sense leads us to avoid some neighborhoods .
If you want to call that " redlining , " so be it .
But places where it is dangerous to go are often also places where it is dangerous to send your money .
As for racial differences in mortgage loan application approval rates , that does not tell you much if you are comparing apples and oranges .
Income , credit history and net worth are just some of the things that are very different from one group to another .
More important , in the same ways that blacks differ from whites , whites differ from Asian Americans .
The fact that whites are turned down for conventional mortgage loans , and resort to subprime loans , more often than Asian Americans do is seldom reported in " news " stories about lending practices , even though such data are readily available .
Shocking as it may be to some , lenders are in the business of making money , and they do n't much care whose money it is , so long as they get paid .
Politicians , on the other hand , are in the business of getting votes , and they do n't much care whose votes it is -- or what they have to say or do in order to get those votes .
It was government intervention in the financial markets , which is now supposed to save the situation , that created the problem in the first place .
Laws and regulations pressured lending institutions to lend to people that they were not lending to , given the economic realities .
The Community Reinvestment
Act forced them to lend in places where they did not want to send their money , and where neither they nor the politicians wanted to walk .
Now that this whole situation has blown up in everybody 's face , the government intervention that brought on this disaster in is supposed to save the day .
Politics is largely the process of taking credit and putting the blame on others -- regardless of what the facts may be .
Politicians get away with this to the extent that we gullibly accept their words and look to them as political messiahs .
" Everybody is asking him to disown me .
You understand if he disowns me he will give terrorists a chance to kill me .
" He loves me as a son and he believes that what I 've done was something I believed in , but at the same time it 's very difficult for him to understand and he wo n't be able to understand . "
What began as a simple movement online to resist the addition of Flickr 's new video feature has spiraled into a day designated as a global feast of doughnuts .
After Flickr rolled out a feature that introduced video to the popular photo sharing site , thousands of Flickr members protested the service by signing petitions and joining groups like No Video On Flickr .
A facetious group called We Demand Doughnuts Group , emerged calling for free doughnuts as a way to mock the demands of the anti-video crusaders .
The group mockingly stated " If we get 20,000 people to join the group Flickr will be forced to give us free donuts ! "
And oddly enough , Flickr has conceded on the doughnuts , though just over 2,500 members have joined the group .
" We at FlickrHQ have heard of your noble efforts and seek to answer your cries for justice , " said Matthew Rothenberg , a Flickr employee , in the group 's discussion board .
Rothenberg has promised to buy treats for Flickr members who meet at a pre-designated shop in San Francisco on April 16 .
Though Flickr is only planning on giving away free doughnuts in San Francisco , Flickr users around the world from Washington , DC to the United Kindgom are organizing meet - ups to gather and partake in the sugary snack .

Minorities set to be US majority
Population projections are subject to a variety of factors
White people of European descent will no longer make up a majority of the US population by the year 2042 - eight years sooner than previous estimates .
The big change is among Hispanics and Asians whose share of the population is set to double to 30 % and 9 % .
The population is also ageing : by 2050 one in five residents will be aged 65 or over , up from one in nine today .
The US Census Bureau 's latest projections are based on birth , death and current immigration rates .
The projections show that the US population is expected to rise from 305 million people to 439 million by 2050 , but it will be a population that looks quite different both in age , race and ethnicity .
According to the census bureau 's statistics , people who regard themselves as Hispanic , African - American , Asian , American Indian , Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander will become the majority by 2042 .
Officials had previously projected that this change would happen in 2050 .
The new projections suggestion that by 2050 , minorities will account for 54 % of the population and non-Hispanic whites 46 % , down from their current 64.7 % share .
Immigration and higher birth rates among US minorities , especially Hispanics , are accelerating the demographic changes .
Hispanics will see their population nearly triple from 47 million to 133 million , causing their share of the population to increase from 15 % to 30 % .
Asians will also see a big increase , with their numbers growing from 16 million to 41 million .
Single - race Asians will account for 8 % of the population and 9 % including those of mixed race .
The black population , including those of mixed race , will show a slight increase from 14 % to 15 % of the total .
' Ageing baby boomers '
It is likely that the demographic changes will be experienced right across the country - and no longer confined to urban areas as in the past .
The population will also be ageing , with some 88 million people , predominantly white , being aged 65 and over .
The number of people over 85 years old will more than triple in the next 40 years , reaching 19 million .
" The white population is older and very much centred around the ageing baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years , " William Frey , a demographer at the Brookings Institution think tank , told the Associated Press .
" The future of America is epitomised by the young people today .
They are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future . "
The Census Bureau points out that its projections are subject to big revisions , depending on immigration policy , natural or man-made disasters .
The projections are also subject to changing cultural definitions and the way people see themselves .
The New York Times notes that in earlier eras Irish , Italian and Eastern European Jewish immigrants were not universally considered as whites .
Until the 1960s , Hispanics were not counted separately by the census and Asian Indians were classified as whites , the paper reports .

What are these ?
Watching the news is a dangerous enterprise for those of us trying to maintain a clear picture of this election season ’s most important issues .
Despite all the chatter , it seems relatively obvious that our most fundamental problem is American energy policy , or more specifically : oil prices and our dependence on cheap energy .
If you buy that premise , which I ’m prepared to debate elsewhere , then this election should really only be decided by one evaluation criterion : which candidate has a better plan to reduce our oil consumption , replace it with viable alternatives , and spur innovation and commercial development of new technologies ( and a new green - collar economy ) ?
A quick survey of both candidate ’s websites makes it fairly obvious ( see the official stance of Obama and McCain ) .
I ’ll be comparing each candidate ’s plan in more detail later on , but for now I ’ve republished some of the main points from Obama ’s campaign website , in order to highlight how he intends on dealing with oil prices and our dependence on them .
To assist in this evaluation , here are three important criteria .
If we ’re serious about transitioning away from petroleum as our primary transportation fuel , we ’re going to have to hit it from multiple angles .
It does n’t seem totally unreasonable to estimate that each of these could account for 1/3 of our total fuel usage :
Decrease consumption and improve efficiency ( #8 & 9 ) .
Develop and rapidly commercialize alternative fuels and infrastructure ( # 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ) .
Develop and rapidly implement new technology ( # 1 , 2 , 3 ) .
Key elements of Obama ’s plan :
1. Invest $ 150 Billion over 10 Years in Clean Energy with a focus on technology developed in the US :
This includes next generation biofuels and fuel infrastructure , commercialization of plug - in hybrids , development of commercial - scale renewable energy , low - emissions coal plants , and beginning the transition to a new digital electricity grid .
2. Double Energy Research and Development Funding :
Obama will double science and research funding for clean energy projects including those that make use of our biomass , solar power and wind resources .
3. Require 25 Percent of Renewable Electricity by 2025 :
Establishing a 25 percent federal Renewable Portfolio Standard ( RPS ) to require that 25 percent of electricity consumed in the U.S. is derived from clean , sustainable energy sources , like solar , wind and geothermal by 2025 .
4. Deploy Cellulosic Ethanol :
Obama will invest federal resources , including tax incentives , cash prizes and government contracts into developing the most promising technologies with the goal of getting the first two billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol into the system by 2013 .
5. Expand Locally - Owned Biofuel Refineries :
Less than 10 percent of new ethanol production today is from farmer - owned refineries .
New ethanol refineries help jumpstart rural economies .
Obama will create a number of incentives for local communities to invest in their biofuels refineries .
6. Establish a National Low Carbon Fuel Standard :
Obama will establish a National Low Carbon Fuel Standard to speed the introduction of low - carbon non-petroleum fuels .
The standard requires fuels suppliers to reduce the carbon their fuel emits by ten percent by 2020 .
7. Increase Renewable Fuel Standard :
Obama will require 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels to be included in the fuel supply by 2022 and will increase that to at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels like cellulosic ethanol by 2030 .
8. Set America on Path to Oil Independence :
Obama ’s plan will reduce oil consumption by at least 35 percent , or 10 million barrels per day , by 2030 .
This will more than offset the equivalent of the oil we would import from OPEC nations in 2030 .
9. Increase Fuel Economy Standards :
Obama will double fuel economy standards within 18 years .
His plan will provide retooling tax credits and loan guarantees for domestic auto plants and parts manufacturers , so that they can build new fuel - efficient cars rather than overseas companies .
Obama will also invest in advanced vehicle technology such as advanced lightweight materials and new engines .

I 've always wondered what our culture would be like if we obsessed about the private lives and accomplishments of scientists , researchers and great thinkers the same way we obsess over celebrities .
Would we follow closely the scandals of scientific study the same way we follow the scandals ofor ?
Would certain appealing scientists be given their own reality shows ?
Perhaps Scientific America would become an easy - to - read weekly and Maxim would include a bevy of young female astronomers and genetic researchers in their annual Maxim Hot 100 List
Scientists are n't known for their style and fashion sense , so they'd be easy targets for the snippy quips of Star magazine 's " Star Style Stalkers " .
Fashion designers would quickly seize the chance to start creating more fashionable lab coats and safety glasses and we'd see them featured as product placements in major motion pictures .
Waiting lists would begin for the most sought after designer lab coats and prices would skyrocket once Chanel and Versace got into the game .
Soon , Joan Rivers would show up on the red carpet to pick apart those heading to the Dirac Prize awards show and the E !
Channel would run all day coverage .
Us Weekly 's infamous Just Like
Us feature would show us pictures of scientists living their lives in ordinary ways we can identify with .
They really are just like us !
would likely make up goofy nicknames for leading scientists and then scrawl over their photographs .
Of course Perez would also let you know about Perez 's fabulous new haircut and Perez 's hot new diet body and Perez 's stylish clothing line at Hot Topic .
Yay !
Nearly 10,000 of the biggest donors to Republican candidates and causes across the country will probably receive a foreboding “ warning ” letter in the mail next week .
The letter is an opening shot across the bow from an unusual new outside political group on the left that is poised to engage in hardball tactics to prevent similar groups on the right from getting off the ground this fall .
Led by Tom Matzzie , a liberal political operative who has been involved with some prominent left - wing efforts in recent years , the newly formed nonprofit group , Accountable America , is planning to confront donors to conservative groups , hoping to create a chilling effect that will dry up contributions .
“ We want to stop the Swift Boating before it gets off the ground , ” said Mr. Matzzie , who described his effort as “ going for the jugular . ”

It opens with a scene from this past May when an uneasy Bush and McCain met for " 14 seconds of ritual " on a tarmac for a press photo op .
" That was May , " Baker writes . "
As of late this month , the president and the would - be successor from his own party have not spoken since . "
Later Baker reveals : " McCain has not called the president for advice . "
Baker describes this as a " relationship fraught with bitter resentment , grudging respect and mutual dependence . "
After his appearance next Monday at the GOP convention , Bush " will be ushered out of the spotlight as quickly as possible - if not in 14 seconds , then not all that much longer . "
Bush aides " seethed " when McCain called conditions in post - Katrina New Orleans " disgraceful " this past April and " grievances nursed by both sides have only grown from there , " Baker observes .
He describes Bush as feeling he needs McCain to win to validate his legacy , while McCain finds himself " saddled " with Bush baggage .
John Weaver , McCain 's former chief strategist , tells Baker , " I 'm sure McCain is thinking , Is Bush going to beat me twice ? "
Baker also reveals : " One former Bush aide who spends his days publicly bashing Barack Obama sat down for lunch with me recently and before the appetizers even arrived lamented that the Democrat will probably crush McCain .
He ruefully called Obama one of the three three most talented political figures of his lifetime , " along with JFK and Reagan .
Karl Rove this summer told friends of his " exasperation " with the McCain team 's " dysfunctional organization and sclerotic message , " as Baker puts it .
" And the president himself , according to friends and prominent Republicans , privately rails about what he considers McCain 's undisciplined approach to the campaign and grouses about McCain 's efforts to distance himself from the administration . "
Why would he need to ?
He 's followed his lead by rote .
Besides , twins have their own language .
They often do n't have to utter a word to each other in order to communicate .
Why , that 's nearly the same relationship one would have with , say , the bottle or perhaps , cocaine , when they have a chemical dependence .
What a coinkydink .
Ooo , look , here comes another tasty little morsel :
Oh , yummy .
Me wants more .
Slurp .
Gimme another .
Dee-lish !
Oh , goody !
Just desserts , by way of none other than the fat( tening ) Karl Rove : Good , good eats .
Time for a nap .
Boy Bashing
By Rod Van Mechelen
Boy - bashing : good , clean fun , damaging to self - esteem , or does it promote violence ?
Get a life !
2004 Olympia , Wash . -
How times have changed .
Just a few years ago , programs to sensitize boys to the plight of girls were making big headlines .
Not that long ago , there was a story about a six - year - old boy who was labeled a lecherous harasser for kissing one of the girls -- on the cheek .
He was suspended and sent home for that .
Last year , however , we began to see T - shirts urging girls to attack boys .
Yes , it 's true .
The latest trend in fashion apparel for teenage girls is a direct jab at their male counterparts : T - shirts that carry slogans like " Boys are stupid -- throw rocks at them , " " Boys are goobers -- drop anvils on their heads " and " Boys lie -- make them cry . " - Jane Ganahl , Chronicle Staff Writer ,

Yet , had the shoe been on the other foot , or , in this case , the shirt on the other gender , we can only imagine the screeching from feminists as they sallied forth to quash yet another example of patriarchal badness .
And that , as Warren Farrell , author of several books , including Father and Child Reunion , has long taught , is the measure of sexism : if it 's funny about one sex but unacceptable about the opposite sex , then it 's sexist .
Equalitarians attacked
With this view in mind , equalitarians , such as Glenn Sacks , started to campaign against the " Boys are Stupid " products .
" As parents , we suffer along with our children , " wrote Sacks .
" Perhaps this explains why the campaign has struck such a chord -- in the past week over 300 newspapers and television and radio stations have carried stories about it . "
Ironically , some of the harshest critics of Sacks ' campaign have been men :
Other critics , mostly men , deride me as unmanly .
I confess this attitude puzzles me .
These men often grumble about TV commercials in which men are portrayed as idiots and clowns , and they read their kids bedtime stories from children 's books where fathers -- the few left in modern children 's literature -- are similarly depicted .
Yet many of these men seem to be struck by cultural amnesia the moment somebody finally decides to do something about male - bashing .
- Glenn Sacks ,
Why I Launched the Campaign Against ' Boys are Stupid ' Products , February 4 , 2004 Reasonably , some may question the fuss .
As the old chant goes , " sticks and stones may break my bones , but words can never hurt me -- unless I 'm a feminist . "
Since boys are not victim feminists , what should a few humorous slogans matter ?
Perhaps because violent words can beget violence .
Will they matter when girls start throwing rocks ?
Will they matter when these girls grow up to become batterers ?
No parenting expert interviewed suggests that mean - spirited slogans on clothing will destroy a young man 's sense of self - worth .
They do worry , however , that derogatory and sexist messages contribute to creating a hostile atmosphere .
" If we said that about blacks or Jews or Norwegians even , you'd be stoned immediately , " ( Armin Brott , author and " Ask Mr. Dad " columnist ) says .
- Monique Beeler , Boy bashing :
Some say girl power movement may have gone too far , Alameda - Times Star , January 21 , 2004 " Well , so what ? "
Feminists might retort .
" Men have battered women for millennia , a little payback wo n't hurt them ! "
Feminists did write and say such things 10 years ago , but they were eventually silenced by the mounting resistance to their sexist remarks .
But despite this they still snarl comments like that in unguarded moments of anger , and amongst themselves .
And we might respond by pointing out that , while women are far more likely to be injured from domestic violence , because , in general , men are physically capable of far greater violence than women , women are slightly more likely to initiate domestic violence , so , sadly , there is already parity .
Of course , the feminist retort to this is that this is sexist nonsense based on a relatively few studies , while the government and law enforcement statistics prove that , by a wide margin , women are overwhelmingly the victims , and men are overwhelmingly the perpetrators , of domestic violence :
Exact statistics shift from study to study , but results over three decades of investigation by governmental agencies , social service organizations , and women 's health researchers consistently confirm that women are the overwhelming majority of victims of domestic violence -- and that men who are victimized are most often assaulted not by women but by other men .
- Jennifer L. Pozner , Not All Domestic Violence Studies Are Created Equal , Extra ! , November / December 1999
What Pozner and other feminists ignore is that the government and law enforcement studies are based on crime statistics , where most of the victims are women , because , to this day , men are still far less likely to report themselves as victims of domestic violence , as the stigma from doing so would be roughly equivalent to a woman in the 1960s reporting that she had been raped .
Violent Grrlz
What if the violence begins before puberty ?
Children can be cruel .
Are n't these T - shirts encouraging girls to do more than taunt the boys ?
Is n't it a call to commit acts of violence ?
Ridiculous , says Ganahl , who sees it as a liberating joke celebrating that " today 's high school girls have come into their ' power ' . "
It might not be great manners , but this is the kind of crowing that comes with knowing you 've gained ground .
Cut these young women a little slack , and have a sense of humor .
And I swear , no one will hit you with a rock .
- Jane Ganahl , Chronicle Staff Writer ,

Assuming even half of the complaints modern feminists have leveled against the American male were true , she might have a point .
But the uncomfortable truth today 's feminists refuse to acknowledge is that , from the right to vote to the birth control pill to equal rights in virtually every bastion of society , all women 's victories have been handed to them by men .
And what men have given , the sexism of feminists may persuade them to take away .

Despite some positive talk on the Bear merger , the executives were quick to point out that business conditions on Wall Street remain glum .
JPMorgan has withstood the impact of sub - prime collapse better than most firms , but like its Wall Street counterparts , profits have been hammered so far this year in the investment banking business .
( See Charles Gasparino 's exclusive CNBC report in the accompanying video . )
JPMorgan has cut its investment banking staff so far this year by about 15 percent , and Winters suggested that additional layoffs at JPMorgan could be in cards given the market environment .
" A lot of you had some of friends go , and that 's hard for everybody , but it 's the right thing to do for the company , " he said , adding : " The revenue base available in this economy must be matched with appropriate cost structure . "
He also said both the revenue potential from the current economic environment and revenue being generated by JPMorgan 's investment banking business continue to decline .
Dimon is notorious for cost - cutting ; last year when the subprime meltdown began , analysts in one of JPMorgan 's buildings say , they received a memo stating that milk would no longer be available at coffee pantries .
After an uproar , the firm began serving milk again .
During the call , Dimon said " wasting money is a sin , " and then quipped that " It is not true that I ordered smaller hamburgers for the café , but if I [ had ] thought about it , I would have done it . "
Later , Dimon was asked by an employee if he could have " access to the Bear cafeteria , because they serve bigger hamburgers there . "
Dimon did not answer the question .
None of the executives mentioned the fate of Alan Schwartz , the former CEO of Bear Stearns , who is weighing whether to join JPMorgan as a senior investment banker .
If Schwartz remains at JPMorgan , he is sure to stir controversy , since he was in charge when the firm was sold at the depressed price ( Bear once traded at around $ 170 a share ) and he would get a deal in which he earns tens of millions of dollars since he ’s considered one of the best investment bankers on Wall Street .
A JPMorgan spokeswoman had no comment .
RawStory —
In a secret report last year , the Red Cross found evidence of the CIA using torture on prisoners that would make the Bush administration guilty of war crimes , The New York Times reported Friday .
The Red Cross determined the culpability of the Bush administration after interviewing prisoners at Guantanamo Bay , according to the article .
Prisoner Abu Zubaydahwho said he had been waterboarded , “ slammed against the walls ” and confined in boxes “ so small he said he had to double up his limbs in the fetal position . ”
The information comes from a new book written by Jane Meyer , who has frequently published articles concerning counter - terrorism in The New Yorker .
The book is titled “ The Dark Side : The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals , ” and will be released next week .
Mayer cited “ sources familiar with the report ” to explain the confidential document as a warning “ that the abuse constituted war crimes , placing the highest officials in the U.S. government in jeopardy of being prosecuted . ”
The report was submitted to CIA last year and concluded that American interrogation methods are “ categorically ” torture that violates both domestic and international law , MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow reported Friday .
Although the CIA had already admitted to the use of waterboarding , Meyer says in the book that several CIA officers confirm the findings of the Red Cross , including the other forms of torture mentioned .
Maddow called George W. Bush a “ torture - approver - in - chief who has yet to be held to account for anything ” and said that congressman Dennis Kucinich had reintroduced his articles of impeachment against the president .
Maddow questioned constitutional law expert Johnathan Turley about the development .
“ The problem for the bush admin is that they perfected plausible deniability techniques , ” Turley said .
“ They bring out one or two people that are willing to debate on cable shows whether waterboarding is torture and it leaves the impression that its a closed question .
“ It ’s not .
It ’s just like the domestic surveillance program that the federal court said just a week ago was also not just a closed question . ”
When asked by Maddow if the chances are now greater that Bush will be prosecuted now or after leaving office by the international community , Turley compared the situation to Serbia in the early 90s .
“ I ’d never thought I would say this , but I think it might in fact be time for the United States to be held internationally to a tribunal .
I never thought in my lifetime I would say that . ”

Fiery journeys to the center of the Earth occur only in the sci - fi realm , but now scientists have laid out a way to pinpoint our planet ’s center of mass , providing a more accurate map of that core destination .
The results will lead to critical information for studying earthquakes , volcanoes , global sea - level rise and warming , and a post - glacial rise in some surface areas related to the melting of ice sheets .
Until now , scientists have defined Earth ’s center of mass in two ways — either as the mass center of Earth as a single object or as the mass - center of Earth ’s system , including ice sheets , oceans and our atmosphere in the equation .
Jell - O planet
It 's tricky finding the center of a giant , squishy object , scientists say .
" By its very nature , Earth 's reference frame is moderately uncertain no matter how it is defined , " said Donald Argus of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California .
“ The problem is very much akin to measuring the center of mass of a glob of Jell - O , because Earth is constantly changing shape due to tectonic and climatic forces . "
If Earth were a completely solid , perfectly round object , finding its center of mass would be sweet and simple .
However , as first proposed by Isaac Newton , our planet is not perfectly round .
Now scientists know Earth is somewhat of a “ buckled ” sphere in which the midsection bulges outward .
And because mass is distributed unevenly across its surface ( more mass means more gravitational tug ) , the point around which the planet is balanced is offset from the actual center of Earth .
Plus , mass does n’t stay put , but instead changes over time as glaciers melt , tectonic plates move and volcanoes empty out to lay massive lava on Earth ’s surface .
These changes in mass atop and beneath Earth ’s surface cause the center of mass to shift slightly over time .
Accurate measure
Argus developed the new center - finding technique to find the mass center of Earth as a single object , which can estimate Earth ’s center of mass to within 0.04 inches a year .
The center of mass is calculated as a relative measurement , and so the measurement is given as a velocity .
Past estimates calculated the center of the whole Earth system , resulting in the 2000 and 2005 estimates differing by about 0.07 inches a year .
Argus believes the mass center of solid Earth is a more accurate reference frame , because it does n’t change from year to year .
The new technique , described in the June issue of the Geophysical Journal International , relies on data collected from a string of instruments .
These include a network of global positioning system ( GPS ) receivers , a network of satellites called Laser Geodynamics Satellites ( LAGEOS ) , radio telescopes and satellite - tracking instruments .
The Earth - only reference frame will improve estimates of sea - level rise made by satellite altimeters , which rely on measurements of the location and motion of the center of mass of Earth ’s system .
Sea - level rise is a gauge of global warming , and so the results will boost scientists ’ understanding of the increase in our planet ’s average temperature .
The rising seas are thought to be the result of melting ice sheets in areas such as Greenland and Antarctica .
“ If you changed the velocity of the Earth ’s center a millimeter ( 0.04 inches ) per year , you would change the estimate of sea level by less than one millimeter , ” Argus told LiveScience , “ but even half a millimeter would be important . ”
On the rebound
In addition , how Earth will respond physically to past and future glacial melting has been shrouded in uncertainty .
When frozen , the mammoth weight of miles - high sheets of ice causes tiny deformations of Earth ’s crust .
And when this ice melts , the land rebounds a bit .
Earth is still on the rebound from the close of the last ice age .
“ For scientists studying post - glacial rebound , this new reference frame helps them better understand how viscous Earth 's solid mantle is , ” Argus said , “ which affects how fast Earth 's crust rises in response to the retreat of the massive ice sheets that covered areas such as Canada 20,000 years ago . ”
He is working on post - glacial - rebound models .
One possibility is that these updated models will shed light on the mysterious dip in the gravity field over parts of North America .
Solar energy is touted by some as the solution to the world 's energy woes .
But the process of making the various components requires fossil fuels , both for power and for the components themselves , some of which are based on petroleum .
A new company , BioSolar , aims to kick petroleum to the curb , at least in the realm of building solar photovoltaics , cells of crystalline silicon that turn sunlight into electricity .
Such photovoltaic cells rely on conventional plastic polymers to provide a protective backing , also known as backsheets .
Those plastics are made from — you guessed it — petroleum .
" It 's renewable and you do n't use any petroleum , " says electrical engineer David Lee , president and CEO of the California - based company about the new product .
" The real merit is that we can actually reduce the cost of the backsheet compared to conventional petroleum - based backsheet . "
Lee claims their backsheets will cost 25 percent less than conventional backsheets , which cost between $ 0.70 and $ 1 per square foot .
Already , such backsheets are rising in price , thanks to the recent run-up in world oil costs , at a time when the solar industry is trying to bring down costs to make their technology more competitive with other forms of power generation , such as cheap , plentiful and extremely polluting coal .
BioSolar starts with used cotton rags and turns them into a film of cellulose , a natural fiber .
They then blend this film with a type of nylon made from castor beans by Philadephia - based Arkema , Inc. to make the so - called BioBacksheet .
Initial testing by the company at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows that this flexible plastic backsheet lasts as long or longer than conventional ones , and keeps out just as much moisture .
In addition to keeping away from petroleum plastics , BioSolar also claims not to be using any genetically modified crops in its product — a further boost to its green credibility .
But nearly 90 percent of the U.S. cotton crop is so altered , either to resist insects , herbicides or both , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
And cotton cultivation still requires tons of pesticides and fertilizers , both of which are derived , in part , from petroleum .
Regardless , if the cotton and castor - based backsheet proves cheaper than the petroleum version it may help remove a bit more fossil sunshine from the new solar energy .
" Our goal is to replace all the petroleum plastic out of the solar cells with this bio - based one , " Lee says .
Produced as part of the Bell Laboratory 's series of educational science films , " The Unchained Goddess " is certainly campy ... but spookily prophetic too , considering it was made in 1958 .
In it , a narrator dubbed " Dr. Research " issues a warning that could be cribbed from an Al Gore powerpoint presentation :
" Even now , man may be unwittingly changing the world 's climate through the waste products of his civilization .
Due to our release through factories and automobiles every year , of more than 6 billion tons of carbon dioxide " ¦ our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer . " 
Just twenty years later , even more folks were worried about the ways we power our country , this time because of the 1970s oil crisis .
This educational film , called When the Circuit Breaks , looks at how demand for traditional sources of power was even then outstripping supply , examines alternative power sources like solar and wind , and envisions a 1985 in which the U.S. would be energy independent .
Reaching way back into the vault , here 's a clip from the 1939 Jimmy Stewart flick You Ca n't Take it With You , in which Stewart 's character dreams of being able to harness the power of the sun ; the " secret of all those millions of little engines " which turn sunlight into energy : plants and trees .

THOSE WHO KNOW HER BEST ….
There ’s never been a politician from Alaska on the national stage before , so I kind of expected Alaskans and the Alaskan media to have a decidedly positive attitude about Sarah Palin joining the Republican ticket .
It ’s not exactly turning out that way .
* The Daily News - Miner in Fairbanks : ” She has never publicly demonstrated the kind of interest , much less expertise , in federal issues and foreign affairs that should mark a candidate for the second - highest office in the land … .
Most people would acknowledge that , regardless of her charm and good intentions , Palin is not ready for the top job .
McCain seems to have put his political interests ahead of the nation ’s when he created the possibility that she might fill it . ”
* State Senate President Lyda Green , a Republican from Palin ’s hometown of Wasilla : “ She ’s not prepared to be governor .
How can she be prepared to be vice president or president ? ”
* Dermot Cole , a longtime columnist for Alaska ’s second largest newspaper , The Daily News - Miner , called McCain ’s choice of Palin “ reckless ” and questioned her credentials .
* Mike Doogan , a former columnist now serving as a Democrat in the state legislature : “ John McCain looked all over the United States to find the single Republican who is qualified to be , as the saying goes , a heartbeat away from the presidency , and he came up with Sarah Palin .
Really ? …
[ L ] et ’s be honest here .
Her resume is as thin as the meat in a vending machine sandwich … .
The long and short of it is this :
We ’re not sure she ’s a competent governor of Alaska .
And yet McCain , who is no spring chicken , has decided she ’s the best choice to replace him as president if he should win and then fall afoul of the Grim Reaper .
Sarah Palin ?
Really ? ”
* The Anchorage Daily News ’ Gregg Erickson : “ [ Palin ] tends to oversimplify complex issues , has had difficulty delegating authority , and clearly has some difficulty distinguishing the line between her public responsibilities and private wishes … .
It is clear that she has not paid much attention to the nitty - gritty unglamorous work of government , of gaining consensus , and making difficult compromises .
She seems to be of the view that politics should be all rather simple .
That often appeals to the wider public , but frustrates those who see themselves as laboring in the less glamorous parts of the vineyard . ”
Erickson ’s description kind of makes Palin sound like George W. Bush , does n’t it ?

Thank God , then , that Channel 4 are on hand to give it the helping hand it so desperately requires in the form of Make Me A Christian ( Sun , 7 pm , C4 ) , a spiritual makeover show in which four hardcore Goddites attempt to convert a rag - tag band of sinners into full - blown Jesus freaks in just three weeks .
In true oversimplified TV - conflict tradition , it 's a clash of absurd extremities .
The Christians , for instance , consist of an evangelical preacher , a lady vicar , a Catholic priest and - very much heading up the pack - the Reverend George Hargreaves , founder of Operation Christian Vote , and the Christian Party , and the Scottish Christian Party , and the Welsh Christian Party .
If it 's Christian and a Party , chances are George is its figurehead .
He scatters Christian joy like a muckspreader flings shit : indiscriminately and everywhere .
Said Christians are pitted against a group of volunteers containing the following widely representative social types : a lesbian schoolteacher , a tattooed militant atheist biker , a white Muslim convert , a boozing fannyhound who claims to have slept with over 150 women , and a lapdancing witch .
Nice work , C4 .
I 'm sure we can all learn from this .
Let battle commence .
Following a trip to York Minster , George hands each of the volunteers a Bible .
The word " Bible " , he tells them , stands for " Basic Instruction Before Leaving Earth " .
He instructs them to read it every day .
This makes the atheist biker kick off , so George graciously talks over him until he walks out .
The group seems pleased to see biker boy go .
After all , what 's the point of participating if you 're not prepared to learn ?
As William ( the Muslim convert ) says , " Step one to learning is silence , and step two is listening . "
Step three , presumably , is absolute cocksucking obedience - or it would be if cocksucking was n't a sin .
Almost any form of sex is a sin .
Take Fay , the occult lapdancer .
George takes one look at her lifestyle ( spangly bras and tarot cards ) and announces she 's " on a trajectory to hell " .
Sobbing , Fay slinks away to her boyfriend 's house for a few days of comforting .
When she emerges later , George bollocks her for having sex outside marriage .
" While the world might call it ' making love ' , " he says , " the Bible calls it fornication . "
Fay 's clearly unhappy and wracked with issues about her appearance , but you can't help wondering if introducing her to Gok Wan might 've been a tad kinder .
Not that George and co would approve of Gok .
After all , we get to see what they make of exuberant gayness when Pastor Wally ( the evangelical preacher ) commands Laura ( the lesbian teacher ) to remove all evidence of same - sex activity from her home .
Her saucy party snaps , her books of Sapphic erotica - they have to go .
George agrees .
His Christian Party takes a notably dim view on homosexuality .
He says things like , " The ancient city of Sodom could have been saved , if only righteous people could be found , " in its election broadcasts .
And in 2006 he personally pledged £ 50,000 to assist the nine Scottish firefighters disciplined for refusing to hand out fire - safety leaflets at a gay parade .
Given that George also wrote and co-produced Sinitta 's 1986 gay disco anthem So Macho ( sample lyric : " I 'm after a hunk of a guy , an experienced man of the world ...
He 's got to be so macho / He 's got to be big and strong , enough to turn me on " ) , this is surprising .
Still , he 's a surprising guy .
In 2007 he campaigned to have the iconic red dragon removed from the Welsh flag as it was " nothing less than the sign of Satan " .
With his polarising views and divisive political campaigning , George is just the man to be fronting a makeover show , and the broadcast will doubtless be accompanied by the percussive sound of thousands of Christians enthusiastically smashing their foreheads against the wall with delight at the way they 're represented .
Still , let 's not blame Channel 4 .
Let 's forgive them .
Just like Jesus 'n stuff , yeah ?
McCain's ' Painful ' ad against Obama uses ' widely debunked ' material Associated Press
Published : Friday August 8 , 2008
Print This Email This TITLE : " Painful . " LENGTH : 30 seconds .
AIRING : In 11 key states where McCain ads already are on the air .
SCRIPT : Announcer : " Life in the spotlight must be grand , but for the rest of us times are tough .
Obama voted to raise taxes on people making just $ 42,000 .
He promises more taxes on small business , seniors , your life savings , your family .
Painful taxes , hard choices for your budget .
Not ready to lead .
That 's the real Obama . "
John McCain : " I 'm John McCain and I approved this message . "
KEY IMAGES :
The spot opens with a montage of cheering crowds , flashing cameras , Obama waving to supporters , Obama 's picture on covers of magazines like GQ , US Weekly and Vanity Fair .
It is followed by images of a woman and two children with the words , " Obama : Raise taxes on middle class " ; of two women in a floral shop , " On small business " ; of an elderly woman , " On seniors " ; and of a woman and child , " Your family . "
A smiling Obama appears with the words " Painful taxes , hard choices for your budget , not ready to lead . "
The final image is one of McCain .
ANALYSIS : The McCain campaign's oft - repeated assessment of Obama 's tax proposals is based , in several instances , on outdated material that has been widely debunked .
Obama has said his plan would raise taxes on single people making more than $ 200,000 and couples making more than $ 250,000 , which by all measures does n't add up to middle class .
The ad's most specific assertion - Obama voted to raise taxes on people making $ 42,000 - is based on a nonbinding Senate budget resolution early this year that the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 be allowed to expire in 2011 as scheduled .
Obama has criticized the Bush tax cuts and called for ending them for the wealthiest taxpayers .
McCain did n't support
Bush 's tax cuts when they were passed but has said he supports them now .
He contends that to allow the cuts to expire would be tantamount to a tax increase .
The broader charge that Obama promised more taxes on small businesses , the elderly , " life savings " and families - what the McCain campaign called " painful taxes " resulting in " hard choices for your budget " - is based on an overly broad reading of the Obama budget plan .
" Even though a host of independent , nonpartisan organizations have said this attack is n't true , Sen. McCain continues to lie about Sen. Obama 's plan . "
Obama campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan .
The ad continues the McCain campaign argument that Obama is a celebrity .
By showing no men , the ad makes its appeal directly to women , a group polls show leans toward Obama .
By saying Obama is not like " the rest of us , " the spot also adds to what Obama contends is part of the GOP effort to make voters fearful of him personally .
In support of its ad , the McCain campaign cites the nonpartisan Web site Factcheck.org , which has been critical at times of McCain 's spots , contending they contain false or misleading information .
For example , the site says McCain 's charge that Obama would raise taxes on small businesses is false , contending that the vast majority of small - business owners would see no change and that many others would see their taxes fall .
When a reporter on Aug. 1 asked McCain about Factcheck 's criticism , McCain said he did n't respond to Web sites but added that " I have no idea what they 're talking about . "
Factcheck also points out misstatements and overstatements in ads supporting Obama 's candidacy .

OK for a waitress maybe , but the beer will get warm and flat while you drink your way around your waist ( which is where the beer will end up anyway ) .
Zak -n- Wheezie is a two - headed Bearded Dragon lizard that lives on the Wittes family farm in Fowler , California .
They ( it? he ? ) just turned one .
From McClatchy Newspapers :
When Zak - n - Wheezie were younger , the Wittes laid low to make sure no one searching for an oddity would find their one - in - a- million ( actually , statistically speaking , two - in - a - million ) pet .
" There were numerous circus - sideshow people looking for me , " Barbara Witte says .
" But I 'm not looking to get them in the sideshow world . "
Frank 's brother did some research and told the Wittes not to sell Zak - n - Wheezie for anything less than a million dollars – that there were people out there who would pay that much to eat the Wittes ' pet .
" There are people who will pay large amounts to eat a two - headed critter .
They think it will give them eternal life , " says Frank Witte , shaking his head .
A greener , less expensive method to produce hydrogen for fuel may eventually be possible with the help of water , solar energy and nanotube diodes that use the entire spectrum of the sun 's energy , according to Penn State researchers .
" Other researchers have developed ways to produce hydrogen with mind - boggling efficiency , but their approaches are very high cost , " says Craig A. Grimes , professor of electrical engineering .
" We are working toward something that is cost effective . "
Currently , the steam reforming of natural gas produces most of our hydrogen .
As a fuel source , this produces two problems .
The process uses natural gas and so does not reduce reliance on fossil fuels ; and , because one byproduct is carbon dioxide , the process contributes to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , the carbon footprint .
Grimes ' process splits water into its two components , hydrogen and oxygen , and collects the products separately using commonly available titanium and copper .
Splitting water for hydrogen production is an old and proven method , but in its conventional form , it requires previously generated electricity .
Photolysis of water solar splitting of water has also been explored , but is not a commercial method yet .
Grimes and his team produce hydrogen from solar energy , using two different groups of nanotubes in a photoelectrochemical diode .
They report in the July issue of Nano Letters that using incident sunlight , " such photocorrosion - stable diodes generate a photocurrent of approximately 0.25 milliampere per centimeter square , at a photoconversion efficiency of 0.30 percent . "
" It seems that nanotube geometry is the best geometry for production of hydrogen from photolysis of water , " says Grimes
In Grimes ' photoelectrochemical diode , one side is a nanotube array of electron donor material – n- type material – titanium dioxide , and the other is a nanotube array that has holes that accept electrons - p- type material – cuprous oxide titanium dioxide mixture .
P and n- type materials are common in the semiconductor industry .
Grimes has been making n- type nanotube arrays from titanium by sputtering titanium onto a surface , anodizing the titanium with electricity to form titanium dioxide and then annealing the material to form the nanotubes used in other solar applications .
He makes the cuprous oxide titanium dioxide nanotube array in the same way and can alter the proportions of each metal .
While titanium dioxide is very absorbing in the ultraviolet portion of the sun 's spectrum , many p-type materials are unstable in sunlight and damaged by ultraviolet light , they photo - corrode .
To solve this problem , the researchers made the titanium dioxide side of the diode transparent to visible light by adding iron and exposed this side of the diode to natural sunlight .
The titanium dioxide nanotubes soak up the ultraviolet between 300 and 400 nanometers .
The light then passes to the copper titanium side of the diode where visible light from 400 to 885 nanometers is used , covering the light spectrum .
The photoelectrochemical diodes function the same way that green leaves do , only not quite as well .
They convert the energy from the sun into electrical energy that then breaks up water molecules .
The titanium dioxide side of the diode produces oxygen and the copper titanium side produces hydrogen .
Although 0.30 percent efficiency is low , Grimes notes that this is just a first go and that the device can be readily optimized .
" These devices are inexpensive and because they are photo - stable could last for years , " says Grimes .
" I believe that efficiencies of 5 to 10 percent are reasonable . "
Grimes is now working with an electroplating method of manufacturing the nanotubes , which will be faster and easier .

This was sent to me by Linda Branagan -- Convex doc. writer and Connie Dobbs look - alike .
I think its an excellent illustration of why " Bob " began his mission in Dallas .
The following is a true story .
Last week I walked into a local " home style cookin ' restaurant / watering hole " to pick up a take out order .
I spoke briefly to the waitress behind the counter , who told me my order would be done in a few minutes .
So , while I was busy gazing at the farm implements hanging on the walls , I was approached by two , uh , um ... well , let 's call them " natives . "
These guys might just be the original Texas rednecks -- complete with ten - gallon hats , snakeskin boots and the pervasive odor of cheap beer and whiskey .
" Pardon us , ma'am .
Mind of we ask you a question ? "
Well , people keep telling me that Texans are real friendly , so I nodded .
" Are you a Satanist ? "
Well , at least they did n't ask me if I liked to party .
" Uh , no , I ca n't say that I am . "
" Gee ma'am .
Are you sure about that ? " they asked .
I put on my biggest , brightest Dallas Cowboys cheerleader smile and said , " No , I 'm positive .
The closest I 've ever come to Satanism is watching Geraldo . "
" Hmm. Interesting .
See , we was just wondering why it is you have the lord of darkness on your chest there . "
I was this close to slapping one of them and causing a scene -- then I stopped and noticed the T - shirt I happened to be wearing that day .
Sure enough , it had a picture of a small , devilish looking creature that has for quite some time now been associated with a certain operating system .
In this particular representation , the creature was wearing sneakers .
They continued : " See , ma'am , we do n't exactly appreciate it when people show off pictures of the devil .
Especially when he 's lookin ' so friendly . "
These idiots sounded terrifyingly serious .
Me : " Oh , well , see , this is n't really the devil , it 's just , well , it 's sort of a mascot . "
Native : " And what kind of football team has the devil as a mascot ? "
Me : " Oh , it 's not a team .
It 's an operating -- uh , a kind of computer . "
I figured that an ATM machine was about as much technology as these guys could handle , and I knew that if I so much as uttered the word " unix " I would only make things worse .
Native : " Where does this satanical computer come from ? "
Me : " California .
And there 's nothing satanical about it really . "
Somewhere along the line here , the waitress has noticed my predicament -- but these guys probably outweighed her by 600 pounds , so all she did was look at me sympathetically and run off into the kitchen .
Native : " Ma'am , I think you 're lying .
And we 'd appreciate it if you 'd leave the premises now . "
Fortunately , the waitress returned that very instant with my order , and they agreed that it would be okay for me to actually pay for my food before I left .
While I was at the cash register , they amused themselves by talking to each other .
Native # 1 : " Do you think the police know about these devil computers ? "
Native # 2 : " If they come from California , then the FBI oughta know about 'em . "
They escorted me to the door .
I tried one last time : " You 're really blowing this all out of proportion .
A lot of people use this `kind of computers . '
Universities , researchers , businesses .
They 're actually very useful . "
Big , big , BIG mistake .
I should have guessed at what came next .
Native : " Does the government use these devil computers ? "
Me : " Yes . "
Another BIG boo-boo .
Native : " And does the government pay for 'em ?
With our tax dollars ? "
I decided that it was time to jump ship .
Me : " No. Nope .
Not at all .
You 're tax dollars never entered the picture at all .
I promise .
No sir , not a penny .
Our good Christian congressmen would never let something like that happen .
Nope . Never. Bye . "

What a country .
KUWAIT ( Reuters ) - The United States and other Western countries are dealing in a provocative way with Iran over its nuclear programme and should respect its sovereignty , Kuwait ’s parliament speaker said .
The United States has refused to rule out military action if Iran continues with attempts to enrich uranium , which Washington suspects is aimed at making an atomic bomb but the Islamic Republic says is peaceful .
Jassem al - Kharafi said the West was using double standards in the dispute by trying to stop Iran ’s nuclear programme while saying nothing about Israel , which is widely believed to posses the Middle East ’s only nuclear arsenal .
The Jewish state neither confirms nor denies possessing nuclear weapons .
“ I think what is happening with regard to the Iranian nuclear file involves a lot of exaggeration ... and the method was provocative , ” state news agency KUNA quoted Kharafi as saying late on Sunday .
“ The country has its status and strategy in the region and should not be threatened in the way which we saw , ” he added .
Sunni Muslim - ruled Kuwait , a staunch U.S. ally , is home to thousands of U.S. troops .
Kuwaiti officials rarely criticise the United States , which led a multi-national coalition to end the 1990 - 91 Iraqi occupation of the Gulf Arab oil exporter .
“ Such a sensitive issue requires the language of dialogue , not escalation ...
It is necessary to respect Iran ’s sovereignty because a resolution will not be reached by treating it like a U.S. state , ” he said .

On one day in mid-August , Taliban forces in Afghanistan carried out their most serious attack in six years , mounting an all - night strike on a U.S. military base in the eastern province of Khost and a fierce assault on French forces east of the capital .
The Khost offensive targeted one of the largest foreign military bases in the country and was eventually repulsed , but the attack on French forces by 100 Taliban insurgents killed 10 French soldiers and wounded 21 more .
Together , the attacks are the latest expression of the growing confidence and competence of the Taliban and the growing ferocity of the fighting in America ’s “ other war . ”
Since the beginning of July , 70 coalition troops have been killed in Afghanistan , compared to just 31 U.S. troops killed in Iraq during the same period .
Already this year , 192 NATO troops have been killed in Afghanistan , compared to 232 killed in all of last year , which itself was the deadliest for NATO troops since the war began in 2001 .
At the same time , other developments in and around the region –the resignation of Pakistan ’s ex-president Gen. Pervez Musharraf and the Russian thrashing of Georgia ’s U.S. - backed military –have illustrated starkly that a new balance of power is taking shape , dealing a setback to U.S. ambitions .
This makes the stakes for the U.S. in Afghanistan higher than ever–and simultaneously places new demands on the U.S. antiwar movement .
Since 2003 , the antiwar movement has anchored itself in opposition to the U.S. war on Iraq , which was generally understood as a “ war of choice ” undertaken by the Bush administration .
But the movement has been at best muted in its criticism–and at worst actually supportive –of the U.S. war on Afghanistan as a “ legitimate ” targeting of al - Qaeda ’s Osama bin Laden following the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
But in fact , the U.S. did n’t invade Afghanistan to “ bring the perpetrators of 9/11 to justice ” or to “ liberate Afghan women from the Taliban . ”
In truth , the U.S. had long sought an accommodation with the Taliban .
As one U.S. diplomat put it in 1997 , “ The Taliban will probably develop like the Saudis .
There will be Aramco [ the oil consortium ] , pipelines , an emir , no parliament and lots of Sharia law .
We can live with that . ”
From the time that it took office , the Bush administration had been negotiating with the Taliban to enlist it as a regime friendly to U.S. interests and able to provide a bulwark against Russian and Chinese influence .
At one point in negotiations , U.S. representatives tired of the slow pace and threatened Taliban officials , saying “ either you accept our offer of a carpet of gold , or we bury you under a carpet of bombs , ” according to a book by Jean - Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie .
When the 9/11 attacks happened , it became the perfect rationale for imperial aggression that the U.S. had already contemplated .
The material and geopolitical interests that underpinned the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan are the subject of increasingly blunt discussions within the foreign policy establishment .
As Richard Holbrooke , U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations from 1999 to 2001 , wrote in the most recent issue of Foreign Affairs :
As the war enters its eighth year , Americans should be told the truth : it will last a long time –longer than the United States ’ longest war to date , the 14 - year conflict ( 1961 - 75 ) in Vietnam .
Success will require new policies with regard to four major problem areas : the tribal areas in Pakistan , the drug lords who dominate the Afghan system , the national police , and the incompetence and corruption of the Afghan government .
An August 21 New York Times editorial makes the case even more plainly :
More American ground troops will have to be sent to Afghanistan .
The Pentagon ’s over - reliance on air strikes– which have led to high levels of civilian casualties –has dangerously antagonized the Afghan population .
This may require an accelerated timetable for shifting American forces from Iraq , where the security situation has grown somewhat less desperate .
NATO also needs to step up its military effort .
With Russia threatening to redraw the post - Soviet map of Europe , this is not time for NATO to forfeit its military credibility by losing a war .
Europe does not have a lot of available ground troops either .
But it needs to send its best ones to Afghanistan and let them fight .
Afghanistan ’s war is not a sideshow … Washington , NATO and the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan must stop fighting it like a holding action and develop a strategy to win .
Otherwise , we will all lose .
Presidential candidate Barack Obama is already promising to implement precisely this plan , calling himself a “ strong supporter of the war in Afghanistan ” and pledging to withdraw forces from Iraq in order to send at least two additional combat brigades to Afghanistan .
Those forces in the antiwar movement that do n’t include opposition to the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan are at risk of being made irrelevant by the dedication of increasing amounts of U.S. military firepower and personnel to the “ good war . ”
The movement needs to create a political consciousness about the occupation of Afghanistan so that it will be possible to mobilize the social forces –communities , neighborhoods , students , workers and U.S. troops–necessary to force the U.S. to withdraw .
Failure to do so will mean that the further the occupation of Iraq fades in the media and from American political discussion , the more difficult it will get to mobilize sufficient numbers to compel the U.S. to exit both Iraq and Afghanistan .
The case is straightforward .
U.S. disregard for civilian life , human rights , democracy and the lives of Afghan women has been shocking .
Marina , a member of the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan , ca n’t use her last name for fear of assassination , but she recently told journalist John Pilger :
We , the women of Afghanistan , only became a cause in the West following September 11 , 2001 , when the Taliban suddenly became the official enemy of America .
Yes , they persecuted women , but they were not unique , and we have resented the silence in the West over the atrocious nature of the Western - backed warlords , who are no different .
They rape and kidnap and terrorize , yet they hold seats in [ U.S. - backed Hamid ] Karzai ’s government .
What the U.S. really wants , says Tariq Ali , is “ to construct an army able to suppress its own population but incapable of defending the nation from outside powers ; a civil administration with no control over planning or social infrastructure , which is in the hands of Western NGOs ; and a government whose foreign policy marches in step with Washington’s . ”
It ’s an encouraging sign that the leadership of United for Peace and Justice ( UFPJ ) sent an August 14 e-mail to its members organizations to encourage discussion about the issue of Afghanistan , given its growing importance for U.S. war aims .
In it , UFPJ quoted from its own national assembly resolution passed last summer stating that “ our movement has been too silent on Afghanistan , and UFPJ must take leadership to expose the horrors and costs of this engagement . ”
But during the last year , UFPJ has done very little to rectify this “ silence , ” and the August 14 e-mail does n’t show any sign of exercising “ leadership to expose the horrors and costs ” of the occupation of Afghanistan .
Instead , the e-mail poses a series of questions without making any case whatsoever .
And some of the questions are framed in a way that leaves the door open to continued support for U.S. intervention in Afghanistan , such as “ Should the peace movement support U.S. military forces in a policing role , rather than counter - insurgency role ? ” and “ Was a military invasion of Afghanistan an appropriate reaction to the September 11 attacks ? ”
In addition , UFPJ continues to orient its efforts on influencing Congress rather than exposing Congress ’ commitment to pursuing U.S. global hegemony .
As disastrous as this strategy has been in ending the U.S. war on Iraq , it will be that much worse in the case of Afghanistan , considering that support for the war in Afghanistan is an article of faith within the Democratic Party .
GI organizations such as Iraq Veterans Against the War ( IVAW ) face a similar set of challenges .
To date , IVAW has not taken an official position on the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan .
Indeed , it appears that one current within IVAW feels that adding opposition to the U.S. war on Afghanistan to its mission would hurt its ability to recruit among active - duty troops –because , the argument goes , there is more support within the military for the war on Afghanistan than the war on Iraq .
But with increasing numbers of troops being sent to face fierce fighting in Afghanistan , the opposite is true .
If IVAW does n’t address the despair , anger and disillusionment of U.S. soldiers deployed to Afghanistan , vets and active - duty troops will go elsewhere for a way to express their antiwar views .
For soldiers gripped by the senselessness of their mission and a desperate drive for self - preservation , Afghanistan presents a situation at least as harrowing as Iraq .
As an article earlier this year in the New York Times Magazine reported :
As hard as Iraq was , [ Capt. Dan Kearney ] said , nothing was as tough as the Korengal [ a valley in Afghanistan ] .
Unlike in Iraq , where the captains and lieutenants could let down their guard in a relatively safe , fortified operating base , swapping stories and ideas , here they had no one to talk to and were almost as vulnerable to enemy fire inside the wire as out …
So what exactly was [ Kearney ’s ] job out here ?
To subdue the valley .
It ’s a task the Marines had tried , and then the soldiers of the Army ’s 10th Mountain Division–a task so bloody it seemed to drive the 10th Mountain ’s soldiers to a kind of madness .
Kearney ’s soldiers told me they ’d been spooked by the weird behavior of their predecessors last May : near the end of their tour , many would sit alone on the fire base talking to themselves .
Privates disobeyed their sergeants , and squad leaders refused to step outside the wire to show the new boys the terrain .
No one wanted to be shot in the last days of his tour .
Facing hostility from civilians weary of being killed by errant U.S. airpower and the constant anxiety of waiting for the next insurgent assault , the conditions breed the perfect atmosphere for both war crimes and paralyzing post - traumatic stress disorder–both of which are vividly described in the Times magazine article .
In the months after the 2008 election , the ability of the antiwar movement to respond clearly to the growing focus of U.S. military might on this region will be of critical importance .
In 1991 , the political establishment declared a “ new world order ” in the wake of the collapse of the USSR .
But today , U.S. economic weakness and military blunders in Iraq and Afghanistan mean that the U.S. faces a “ newer world order , ” marked by increased instability , new crises and new strategic competitors , especially in Asia .
Our movement must develop the political understanding to analyze these developments and respond with a loud and clear opposition to the foreign policy of a government that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. aptly characterized as the “ greatest purveyor of violence in the world . ”

bitpim - devel mailing list
This list is for discussions about and people making technical contributions to BitPim .
If you would like to have another phone supported , you need to find someone with some developer skills .
In particular they will need to have the target phone , and will need to be able to figure out information on the phone ( usually by browsing the filesystem view and analysing protocol traces ) .
Most importantly they will need to have time to dedicate to this .
If you are such a developer , please consult the developer information .
I would welcome BitPim working with other phones , and the code and design intent is to allow this .

I cannot praise TurnKey Internet enough .
They help keep my small business running .
They take the stress of managing the server off of me so I can worry about my clients .
If you are looking for a dedicated hosting provider , you can stop looking now and choose TurnKey .

It looks like John McCain 's people are at it again .
They just released an attack ad against Obama trying to make him the anti-Christ and calling Obama : The One .
As they did with their " Celebrity " attack ad scrubbing on their website --- it seems that they have scrubbed away John McCain saying that he is in fact :
The One .
John McCain's Experience Sets Him Apart In The Presidential Field John McCain : " The difference between me and Mayor Giuliani and Governor Romney [ is that ]
I fought against the failed Rumsfeld - Casey strategy and advocated for the policy that is succeeding .
I 'm the one that did that .
I 'm the only one .
And I said it in the summer of 2003 , and I said it and I predicted that that strategy would fail because it was a terribly flawed strategy and I advocated the one that is succeeding now .
That 's based [ on my ] military experience from service for many years on the Armed Services Committee as well as in the military . "
( WKXL Concord , 9/4/07 )
This is the first time I 've seen the blogger " mithridates "
I decided to see if there are any references on McCain 's site to himself as " the one " , and lo and behold there 's one page , but it 's been deleted .
Google has the cache though .
If it was no big deal to McCain --- why the scrub ?
I may have to start a new category called McCain scrubbing .
UPDATE : ( Nicole ) Wow .
McCain really does think he 's the One .
Thursday , McCain called Debra Bartoshevich , the Racine County resident who lost her delegate seat at the Democratic National Convention for endorsing McCain instead of Obama , a " person of great courage " for endorsing him .
" Perhaps your reward will be in heaven - not here on Earth , " McCain told Bartoshevich as he addressed the Civic Centre crowd .
So he thinks God is tallying up the delegate count and will reward those who vote for him ?
Speed – speed and more speed !
The USB 3.0 will be faster than the speed of light !
You will be able to upload an entire hard drive in just over a minute ( Depending on storage size ) .
You can download more than 100 MP3 ’s to any player in a matter of seconds , yes I said seconds .
Developers will release the USB 3.0 specifications in the forth quarter of this year .
USB ( Universal Serial Bus ) – also dubbed as SuperSpeed USB is a major revamp from USB 2.0 .
Last week , Intel released the larger part of the specification for the Extensible Host Controller Interface ( xHCI ) for USB 3.0 .
That ’s 90 percent of what ’s needed to build silicon that will work with the USB 3.0 protocol currently being finished by the USB Implementers Forum , a group of technical giants including HP , Intel , Microsoft , and Texas Instruments that have banded together to create the protocols that will enable manufacturers and software companies to produce cameras , smartphones , music players , and other stuff that can talk to computers .
“ It ’s going to have over ten times the performance , ” claims Jeff Ravencraft , president and chair of the USB - IF and a technology strategist at Intel .
USB 3.0 will have dedicated lines going in and out , however , so that communications between host and device can happen at the same time .
The other major improvement is in the data - transfer rate , which will be close to 5 gigabits per second ( Gbps ) in each direction ( officially targeting 4.7 Gbps ) , compared with the 480 megabits per second ( Mbps ) , one - way , that USB 2.0 offers .
“ It can all happen at the same time , ” Ravencraft said .
“ The turnaround time has been minimized .
We have these dedicated lanes and they can operate simultaneously . ”
Ravencraft also said that USB 3.0 will be backward compatible both ways , so that consumers who get a nifty new digital camera with USB 3.0 will still be able to download their pictures to their older desktop with its USB 2.0 ports .
And new computers with 3.0 will still be able to communicate with 2.0 devices .
The advantage , of course , is that the much faster speed of USB 3.0 will enable the transfer of much larger files , including such behemoths as high - definition video .
“ We need faster data transfer , so we ’re not sitting there watching things download , ” said an AMD spokesperson .
“ It wo n’t be too long before you ’re looking at YouTube videos in HD format .
Certainly , AMD ’s products are moving in that direction . ”

Dick Cheney ’s life depends on a device that can be accessed remotely and commanded arbitrarily with readily available hardware and software .
In 2001 , Cheney received a Medtronic implantable cardioverter - defibrillator .
See : Device in Cheney ’s Chest Helps Veep ’s Ticker Keep Time :
July 2 , 2001 — Small technology is at the heart of an advanced pacemaker implanted in Vice President Dick Cheney ’s chest on Saturday .
The Medtronic GEM III DR , a pacemaker and implantable cardioverter - defibrillator ( ICD ) , now constantly records Cheney ’s heart activity and can speed up or slow down an irregular rhythm .
And it ’s all in a package the size of a small pager .
MEMS accelerometer , which monitors the heart ’s activity level , works alongside a microprocessor to detect the level and deliver more electricity to keep the heart in rhythm .
In the case of the ICD , the device delivers a high - energy electrical shock to bring the ventricles back to normal rhythm .
“ It ’s an emergency room in your chest , ” said Bob Hanvik , a spokesman for Medtronic Inc. , the Minneapolis - based market leader in pacemaker and ICD sales .
“ It actually recognizes when a potentially life - threatening arrhythmia might occur , and gives you a shock before it can escalate to life - threatening .
“ That ’s why Cheney described it as an ‘ insurance policy . ’ …
Ultimately , the hope is it would never have to deliver therapy , but it ’s nice to know it ’s there . ”
After reading the recently released paper , Pacemakers and Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators : Software Radio Attacks and Zero-Power Defenses , it would appear that the U.S. Secret Service will want to review Cheney ’s , “ insurance policy . ”
Maybe they can wheel him around in a Faraday cage in the meantime ???
Note : I ’ve disabled comments on this post because they could easily result in problems with the U.S. Secret Service .
Via : Venture Beat :
The Defcon conference is the wild and woolly version of Black Hat for the unwashed masses of hackers .
It always has its share of unusual hacks .
The oddest so far is a collaborative academic effort where medical device security researchers have figured out how to turn off someone ’s pacemaker via remote control .
They previously disclosed the paper at a conference in May .
But the larger point of the vulnerability of all wirelessly - controlled medical devices remains a hot topic here at the show in Las Vegas .
Let ’s not have a collective heart attack , at least not yet .
The people on the right side of the security fence are the ones who have figured this out so far .
But this has very serious implications for the 2.6 million people who had pacemakers installed from 1990 to 2002 ( the stats available from the researchers ) .
It also presents product liability problems for the five companies that make pace makers .
…
Fu and Halperin said they used a cheap $ 1,000 system to mimic the control mechanism .
It included a software radio , GNU radio software , and other electronics .
They could use that to eavesdrop on private data such as the identity of the patient , the doctor , the diagnosis , and the pacemaker instructions .
They figured out how to control the pacemaker with their device .
“ You can induce the test mode , drain the device battery , and turn off therapies , ” Halperin said .
Translation : you can kill the patient .
Central vacuum system – the most reliable , go - to cleaning partner for all - round and convenient vacuuming .
While the main unit may take even decades to wear out , accessories such as the hose and attachments need to be replaced once in a while .
Today , we point you towards the best central vacuum accessory kit that you can buy .
Well , there are many options in the market , but only a few can fully satisfy your needs .
Besides , you need to find one that can actually fit into your existing inlets .
Otherwise , you ’ll have the headache of returning the item and going back to square one .
While most of these options are universal , Vacuflo ’s proprietary inlet valve may pose a challenge with some .
So , if you have a Vacuflo unit , you may need to be extra vigilant before buying a replacement kit .

What to Check Before Buying a Central Vacuum Accessory Kit
Well , there are many options to pick from .
And most of them present excellent value for money .
But you need to be careful not to buy something that will end up causing a lot of frustration , time - wasting , and disappointment .
Below , we point out some of the key things to consider when shopping for the best replacement central vacuum accessory kit .
Measure your inlets
Most standard inlets measure 1.5 inches in internal diameter .
Similarly , most replacement central vacuum hoses measure the same at the hose - end .
However , depending on the manufacturer or when you bought your unit , there could be a difference .
Though highly unlikely , your inlets could be smaller or bigger .
So , ensure that the product you like will fit into your inlets to avoid unnecessary headaches .
Simply measure one inlet using a ruler , a Vernier caliper , or a tape measure to know the exact size .
Connection options
Hoses that use Air Driven floor heads use low - voltage metal contacts to create a connection between the hose and the central vacuum unit at the wall inlets .
On the other hand , hoses that work with electric powerheads use either Direct Connect or Pigtail connection .
So , it ’s good to check your inlets to confirm which kind of connection is ideal .
Direct Connect vs Pigtail
Direct Connect means that the hose - end has an integrated 2 - pin plug .
As you insert the plug into the inlet , the two prongs seamlessly enter two holes in the wall inlet to complete the circuit .
On the other hand , a Pigtail hose means that as you insert the hose - end into the inlet , you plug in the cord ( pigtail ) into a separate power outlet .
How long is the hose ?
Another thing that you need to consider is the length of the hose .
This is dictated by how big your house or rooms are .
The bigger the rooms are , the longer the hose should be .
Also , longer hoses are ideal for garage vacuums .
There is a wide range of options , but the shortest central vacuum hose measures about 30 feet .
However , you can find a hose as long as 50 feet .
Other options include 35 and 40 - foot hoses .
Do you need attachments ?
Most central vacuum accessory kits have full sets of components – hose , floor nozzles , and attachments .
However , if yours are not worn out , you can simply buy a hose .
This will save you some money
On the other hand , if your hose is still intact and you just need attachments , we recommend Cen - Tec Systems 93796 as the best central vacuum attachment kit .
It has all the other components except a hose .
So , it will also help you save some money for other things .
Flooring type
If you have bare floors , a floor brush or an air - driven nozzle will do the trick .
You can go ahead and confirm if the floor head uses rubber wheels .
These soft wheels will ensure that no scratch - marks are left on delicate floors .
On the other hand , if you have carpet flooring and lots of rugs , you may want to get an electric powerhead .
A nozzle that has a beater bar will ensure that all kinds of dirt and dust are dislodged from deep within the carpet fibers .
If you have mixed floors , a floor head that can adjust its height will make transitioning from carpets to hard floors and vice versa seamless .
Adjustable suction and brushroll on / off switch will also be a huge plus in such a scenario .
Conclusion
There are many accessory or attachment kits on the market .
Finding the right one for your central vacuum , however , can be a real pain .
We have carefully considered many options to come up with this list .
Without a doubt , Cen-Tec Systems 92938 Central Vacuum Kit CT20DXQD stands out as the best universal central vacuum accessory kit .
It has a long , crushproof hose and a wide range of attachments to help you with above - floor cleaning .
Also , it fits most standard inlets such as Beam , NuTone , Electrolux , MD , Eureka , VacuMaid , and so on .
Besides , it is powerful enough to ensure that your carpets , as well as bare floors and rugs , are left spotlessly clean .
As a recap , these are the best central vacuum accessory kits :

There is too much poison broadcast on American media .
It 's an election year and emotions are running high .
I prefer the approach of those who , like Stephen Colbert , can lighten the mood .

IF we had a functioning Justice Department , Subpoenas would already be at " Townhall " 's door , and the originator thereof would be being interviewed by battallions of FBI agents .
Since we do n't , it is up to the Secret Service to stiffen protection around Obama .
( I once knew the son of a T - MAN who said his dad maintained that the FBI was too hungry for publicity , and rarely actually DID anything ! )
I think that this episode actually shows where the real crazies in our so - called Society are .
I cannot remember anyone actually issuing a death threat against " W " - even though he has definitely done some things that might have earned him dozens , were the " Liberals " in our Society quite as nutty as the " Conservatives . "
I certainly hope that the nutcase who posted on Townhall is a big enough coward so that he ( or she ) does n't actually attempt to carry out the threat .
Finally , if Rupert Murdoch were any kind of an American , he 'd FIRE O'REALLY tomorrow !

Not to defend the posts , or websites in question .
but ...
That 's nothing , read a few rawstory comments .
Since FISA / NSA / and whoever are all snooping on us now , the powers that be must not have seen any of this nonsense as more than a " baseless threat . "
Something that should be covered under their ISP's TOS / AUP .
These people ain't going to do what they say .
Think about it .
Secret Service ai n't going to let that happen .
You can't even have a protest anymore that is n't in a free - speech zone .
And if they were organized enough and planning on doing it , they sure the hell would n't say it publicly on a server documenting every IP address in / var / log / messages .
I bet the people posting that crap , got no plan to do any of the crap they say , they are just angry , frustrated and drunk , liquid courage .
Drunken Buddhas typing at the keyboard , venting anger .
Trying to stir the pot in essence to get others pissed off .
It 's all shock value .
What we do n't need is a giant witch hunt , making criminals out of citizens who have done nothing wrong .
Citizens would n't be pissed off if the real criminals destroying the US Constitution did n't make it this way .
The websites in question should have moderated that crap out , defusing it early on .
Anybody could do post that kind of crap with a proxy / zombie / tor connection .
Furthermore they can make it look like it was someone else .
If anything the Oath Of Office breakers have made the situation so that , citizens can not protest , or get meaningful feedback and accountability from government .
Citizens seeing it this way , having been ignored by their representatives might feel the only thing left is to make idle threats .
Our oath breaking officials have made it this way by placing government in an isolated bubble .
Open up the path to make government accountable , and oath breakers removed from office , elections honest , and all this nonsense will stop .
Instead what 's more likely is that some new law will be passed making criminals out of angry citizens ( of all parties ) , who elevate the matter in what is currently " an unacceptable manner . "
Of course this is just my opinion ...

Those are some sick puppies .
I disagree with the previous poster ; those threats are menacing and real and should be investigated .
If we have people in our military who intend to take national political matters into their own hands , they need to be routed out and isolated where they can do no harm .
It would only take a few examples to take the bluster out of them .
And I simply LOVE the irony of Miss Carpenter 's site being the host of this vicious and probably illegal hate speech .

This also comes down to the question of the Oath that active duty military took .
Where does exactly their oath stop ?
When you say it does ?
This question is a lot more deep than than appear on the surface , the military is not stupid , each soldier knows right from wrong , but they do n't know how to stop domestic attacks on the US Constitution .
The oath they took does n't clearly draw lines .
Enlisted folks ( I can't speak for officers ) were not trained on what to do .
An officer can refuse an illegal order .
( I learned this from BlackBoxVoting .
Org )
An enlisted soldier can't enforce an unconstitutional FISA law .
--- so there 's your problem .
I ain't saying that the crap posted was legal or illegal , I am saying that we do n't need a witch hunt ruining lives , with new laws written on the fly to make expressing your thoughts have a chilling effect .
I am saying that this needs to be thought out better than just passing some new crap ass quickly unread law to make criminals out of people who are pissed off .
The FOCUS is wrong , why are the people pissed off ?
What we need is for Oath Breakers to be held accountable .
A soldier knows when the US Government has gone completely wacked and needs power needs to be removed .
( As per the US Constitution ) That 's called a mutany , from my understanding .
This whole thing is a psyop mindfuck .
It 's dividing people , when the website in question should have moderated the situation .
I ain't saying it 's right to threaten anyone .
I am saying think about what is going on around you .
The United States is n't at that point yet .
You 'll know when it is .
And it ai n't yet .
Think beyond the posts on that website for a moment .
Think about what the ramifications of suddenly cracking down on cyberspace are .
You probably do n't even understand what I am saying unless your a system administrator .
My money is that your not one .
Some of my posts on Bradblog could make you cringe , does that mean you need to wreak my fucking life ?
( I never gave any specifics )
Cause you re-word shit in such a way or I typed it in such a way that you think it could be considered a threat .
I ain't the crazy person here .
I am fucking trying to tell you THINK ABOUT WHY THIS SHIT IS HAPPENING .
I ain't going after Obama or some other target .
( Kinda pissed off at Pelosi right now ) but I ain't going after some fucking target .
I ain't wacked out .
I do n't have a history of attacking countries for no reason .
But with your logic you 'll make me a criminal .
And that 's not right .
The REAL FUCKING CRIMINALS are BREAKING THEIR OATH OF OFFICE !!!
Please .
Get that in your head .
Not some fucking drunk who is pissed off .
I ai n't planning on doing NOTHING .
It 's unfortunate that the current administration is so fucked up that it makes honest citizens ( like myself ) so pissed off that sometimes we say things we should n't .
And then later on , hold it to fuck them up .
But what can be worse is taking it out of context , and making criminals out of people that simply are pointing shit out and venting their thoughts .
If you can't express your thoughts , and be kept in check by common sense then what does that say ?
The moderators on O Reily suck .
Good luck trying to post something like that shit on my website .
It wo n't happen .
I personally would delete it .
Should we really be making criminals out of people that say things like IF , THEN
ELSE , THEN
So really , what your saying to me is that even though all your communications are being snooped on , and you can be investigated for the fuck of it , when it 's proven your just a shit fuck nobody , drunk posting at the keyboards your still guilty of a crime ?
Furthermore , What if the United States of America becomes a dictatorship ?
What if there is no recourse to hold anyone accountable because so much corruption has festered , that so many buffers and insulators have been put in place via technology and law that it really does look like our government is rogue ?
Is it illegal to fucking talk about what to do ?
If you really think the guy posting that shit on the blog in question is a threat , then go knock on his door , ask him how he 's doing , check if he even has the resources to do what he said .
This whole thing is nothing but nonsense .
Maybe I am off somewhat as your saying a target was named while I am saying DEFEND THE US CONSTITUTION .
That do n't mean you can threaten the POTUS .
As much as I fucking HATE Bush , I would by my oath have to protect him .
As the same time there seems to be no way for someone who swore an oath to stop this unconstitutional shit .
So I will just bloat my belly on fast food , suck down another 6 - pack , and watch the war .
Cause there 's fucking nothing I can do until we get these RAT - fuckers out of our government .

Phil -
You may want to go back and read the article again .
It 's as much about the hypocrisy of singling out only " far - left " sites in order to smear them , when rightwing sites feature same and often worse .
As I noted in the article , when it 's a pseudonymous commenter posting , it 's not the same as someone actually sponsored by the site itself , and could , in fact , simply be someone trying to make the site look bad .
That said , the threats posted from " Akennas " a the site of the woman who was complaining about such posting from " vicious far - left " sites , seems damned serious to me .
And whether the poster intends to do anything or not ( and yes , he / she does have their own blog over at Townhall ) clearly they are fomenting others to do so , if you read those comments in full .
Given the rash of recent , yet under - reported attacks on perceive " liberals " ( see Unitarian church shooter in TN , see the AK Dem Chair gunned down , see the attacks on Dem Senators by the ' Anthrax Killer ' , see the DoJ 's own hiring practices , allowing applicants to be illegally turned down simply because they are believed to be " liberals " or Democrats . )
Open season on ' liberals ' is upon us .
And that O'Reilly has so mislead his viewers is astounding , if hardly surprising by now .

These threats need to be reported to the Secret Service .
You can safely bet if those threats were against McCain and were found on a liberal website , not only would the secret service get involved , it would be all over the MSM .
BTW , who assigns the Secret Service ?
If I were Obama , I would want to hire some of my own help for guard duty .
I wonder if he trusts the Secret Service individuals who have been assigned to him .

@TEDEGAR Rupert Murdoch is not only no kind of American , he is n't even a Canadian .
He 's an Australian .
Perhaps I missed the irony tags .
Rupert is uniformly disliked throughout the english speaking world ( although in England disliked is an understatement , despised is more correct ) , not because he's an Australian , but because he's an arrogant prick asshole ( my opinion ) .
Rupert and Bill O'Reilly have a lot in common , particularly their overinflated opinions of themselves and their worth to society .

Without firing a shot is how my grandmother said this country would eventually fall [ or be sold ] to foreign interests .
Seeds of division , distrust and discord are being sown at the highest positions in politics , the media and at blog sites .
The liberal - biased comments O'Really noted are unnecessary and destructive as are those posted at conservative sites .
If it were possible , he would do well to consistently practice what he preaches , ( if Blooper Blurdock would allow it . )
For right - wing Biblical scholars and anyone else interested , the wisdom for today is something like this , " A nation divided against itself falls . "
Truth ?
If American veteran soldiers went to Iraq to gather truth , why would any conscientious American be opposed to that ?
A little truth serum in Washington DC 's public water system might liberate the entire planet , or surely provide scripts for a delightful comedy –– or harsh , dramatic reality .

It was always the Treasury Department in charge of the Secret Service , but now it 's Department of Homeland Security .
If you go to the DHS webpage , you will see that they have taken over a bunch of agencies , or duplicated their function , and all these little arms are armed .
This has created radical interagency strife , and no small amount of distrust .
Also the Secret Service has called off security checks at Obama events early more than once .
So , yeah , I 'd hire my own as supplement if I were Obama .

Brad , respectfully .
I have had a death threat against me .
I had to call a specific number to request my own line be tapped .
The whole process what highly uncooperative .
( albeit this was pre-PatriotAct ) I am simply saying that it's not a reason to roll out yet another poorly thought out piece of crap legislation which makes criminals out of citizens that may have had a little too much to drink and talked shit .
" Given the rash of recent , yet under - reported attacks on perceive " liberals " " Agreed there are hell of recent attacks on liberals .
I wo n't deny that .
Frankly we can't stop it without specific tools .
" AK Dem Chair gunned down " Was n't premeditated , or posted on any website / blog as a threat .
( correct me if I am wrong ) " clearly they are fomenting others to do so , if you read those comments in full . "
I do n't disagree , as I said above , it 's stirring the pot , attempting to get others to become pissed off , pure shock value .
...
However , other people do n't HAVE TO get pissed off .
They are only compelled to .
" Dem Senators by the ' Anthrax Killer ' "
I still do n't know the truth behind that .
Do you ?
I 'll give you that it 's interesting that suddenly it 's recently been dusted off and brought to the front of the news agenda again .
" the DoJ 's own hiring practices "
Corruption .
Broken Oath Of Office .
Elections are not invalid .
That 's why that 's allowed to fester .
-- IMO " Open season on ' liberals ' is upon us .
And that O'Reilly has so mislead his viewers is astounding , if hardly surprising by now . "
And like I said ( in another post ) , use the , " " Advanced Bonewits Cult Evaluation Frame . " " and put your favorite corporate media name in each of the fields .
You 'll quickly find that corporate media is a dangerous cult .
Meanwhile why do n't the enlisted have the authority to defend the US Constitution when they swear an oath to protect it ?
Nobody will answer that .
Will you ?
It seems that we have a trust authority problem in the United States , and it's not like I have n't brought that up OVER AND OVER here on the Bradblog .
e.g .
Why are n't security clearances yanked , pending an investigation ?
Answer : because enough agencies have been corrupted that actions like this will never be carried out .
IMO - it 's called subversion .
Which is supposed to be illegal .
I am not defending , the posts .
Should n't out time be better spent getting the Network 's public file made publicly available when such blatant attacks on anyone are made ?
Should n't the ISP 's TOS / AUP ( already legal ) be used instead of raising the whole thing to a higher level ?
( adding a poorly thought out law )
Or would it be better to make all communications so insecure and un-trustable that not even the most basic commerce can continue .
( Given FISA , and other nastiness by the shills and other rogues control over the spying . )
Or we can just say fine I read the shit and I do n't get it .
I am a fuck up .
Chilling effect on my future communications .
Since I do n't want to be the next target .
Maybe I should shut the fuck up now while I have n't been targeted ?

Dear Editor ,
The real danger here is there are many people who do n't do their home work who listen to O'Reilly for news .
One of my closes friends listens to him .
When I question him on the facts and what has been done to our constitution he is truly unaware .
I think he gets his news from almost exclusively from O'Reilly , along with it his self righteous anger .
This friend was a left wing person as long as I knew him .
But now he has shocked me and the power of the media has shocked me .

On the other hand , a website scrubbed the offensive shit , why do we need to half - ass mirror it without the logs or even knowing if the server has a rootkit installed ?

This is the problem when rightwing thinking is taken seriously ... it leds to the weakminded fool to lash out against those that try to understand while defending those that convince them to spread hate as their surrogates .
Is it any suprise that books by Savage , BillO and Hannity were found at that guys house in Tennessee that shot up that ' liberal ' church ?
I will not be scared off by those that have a few to many screws loose , with my Obama bumper stickers on my car , my Obama 08 sign on my front lawn , and the money I happily give his campaign , if I 'm to die at the hands of a rightwing lunatic , my family will use my death to help save this country by exposing the rightwing hate that did me in !

Listen up : I know what has happened .
There was a time when political discourse , even of the most vitriolic and combative kind , was directed at POLITICICANS , be they Conservative or Liberal , and the remedy was to NOT VOTE FOR THEM .
But of late , especially in the Bush years , the Right Wing Hate Media have changed the discussion to attacks on Liberal CITIZENS , and either saying or implying that the remedy is to KILL THEM .
And it is absurd to talk at all about Left Wing Hate Media ... there 's no such thing ; I 've seen lots of strenuous criticism of Wingnuts , but almost never actual threats or calls to violence against Conservative CITIZENS .
I AM ABSOLUTELY SURE that the recent killings of Liberals and Democrats are a DIRECT RESULT of this change in rhetoric , and Hannity , Coulter , Limbaugh , etc. ARE COMPLETELY TO BLAME for their deaths .

I went to Ball State University with Amanda Carpenter , where she attempted to make a name for herself by cheaply attacking professors who did n't share her ideological delusions .
She put posters of a professor up everywhere , photoshopped to look like a terrorist , in mock - up of a WANTED poster .
The prof had been arrested for " trespassing " on a slaughterhouse farm , which he was eventually fined 1 dollar .
She tried her untalented little heart out to make a case of this .
She was also heard making racist , anti-black jokes at some little get - together of her and her 8 or so misfit friends of right - wing losers .
Everyone else on campus hated her .
When David Schlosser , author of FAST FOOD NATION came to campus , she and her goons stood outside the event handing out McDonalds coupons .
She is an untalented hack trying to be Ann Coulter .
Her writing style is not worth a bucket of warm spit .
She ended up in the very Hellhole she deserves with the Fox " News " crowd .
Her karma is catching up to her .

They killed my pets , my son and my Dad , Phil , and locked me up more than once , then threw it out of court when I called their dirty bluffs .
In fact they stalk you 'til ya die after they ' git ya in " the system . "
My dad sold law books to some prominent Virginians and died young at 39 during the Missile Crisis , active for the USN , 1962 , then my uncles all died mysteriously young––so who did he piss off ?
If you believe the Fascists will ever confess to the truth , then you 're a gullible insane person trapped in this " crazy " world they 've created .
You cross a fascist criminal and they will make the proper arrangements to absolutely destroy your entire life and the lives of your family and children if need be .
I come from the kind of old , Virginia , and colonial family that my grandparents would turn over in their graves to know I 'd ever seen handcuffs , much less have been shackled or brutalized by salaried police paid with American tax dollars .
That 's the way it works .
These people will absolutely destroy your life and I and my family are not the first they 've done it to , and wo n't be the last .
Like Porter Goss says , " just another one of those mysteries ... "
And you can bet it will never happen to him , or to any member of his family .
But he 's one who could tell the truth , because he knows what 's going on .
But lawyers wo n't sue lawyers , and fascists do n't rat out fascists .
There is no policing system for fascist organizations or fraternities .
In Virginia we called it " old blood money , " because those were the ones who had the means and power to keep their crimes covered , generation to generation .
Eventually , before you know it , they 've wiped out your whole family - and , this is n't half of it : http://theloonusa.googlepages.com
These people are like Ever Ready Bunnies – –they just keep going and going .
You wo n't cross a state line , that they can't pull a string to destroy your life .
That 's how they work .
When you 've got a guy boarding up directorships for private prison facilities , banks , license tag facilities , steel manufacturing , and healthcare too , he 's pretty powerful .
When the " Dixie Mafia " is reputed to be ex-cons on leashes for the " Big Boys , " then you have to ask , " who 's working for whom ? "
There 's a private army out there ?
Maybe my political cartoons in Jesse Helms country pissed off some of their mob friends .
If they did n't have mafia as friends , they woud n't have any friends at all , so ?
The way all of that works ?
They use the same lawyers !
" ER , I have this little problem , I need to take care of ? " ( enough said )
Right now I 'm watching " The Facility Group " story to see how far it reaches from Cobb County , Georgia to Mississippi and then on into Carlson / Minnesota territory , Greenville , NC , Wilmington and Massachusetts .
Looks like the beef people plotted a restaurant plan somewhere in there ?
The other interesting one is whether they 're going to uncover the Florida mafias , laundered money lining the beaches in condos , and how they 're all connected to politicians who will accommodate them all by passing needed casino laws to appease the buddy - boy developers .
And then I 'm really interested in the Siegelman , Health South case and whether it's connected to the Lexington , Kentucky Comair Crash and CCA ( see below . )
Another interest is the Judge Vance bombing , because I 'm inclined to disbelieve most reporting when it comes to the " lone idiot - nutcase " theories .
It 's usually more like some spoiled , twisted affluent people just do n't like the way things are going and covertly figure a " mysterious " way to make things change .
I 'm also inclined to investigate casinos , gambling , lotteries and find out how military officers and retirees are involved .
In the echoes of my mind gambling was placed in some of the active duty headquarters for the overseas stationed soldiers .
And as I recall , being a Nam generation baby , I 'll never forget how afraid my boyfriend was his number was next up on the " birthday lottery , " which is as insane as Bush 's game of placing a picture of Bin Laden & Co , on playing cards .
Was Alexander Haig on the Board of MGM Mirage when the building caught on fire ?
And if Governor Sonny Perdue had n't tempted the Lord by prayin ' for rain would his friends have died in the plane crash ?
Seems to me , the Abramoff Crowd is , was and has been a bunch of gambling fools ; he and his orthodox friends are going to get the Religious Right Christians to justify with the Lord investing in casinos and turn the USA into the Gambling destination for Global Fascists and NWO Elites .
Where will they house the camel jockeys ?
In Denver 's 5 X 5 yard dog kennels––AFTER the Democrat convention is finished with them ?
But then , I'm " crazy , " so , why be curious ........?
And if you want to know how the brainwashing is accomplished , I can tell you that , too , from personal experience and observation .
For " JUSTICE , " there was one guy in the Cobb County , Georgia Kangaroo Court who said , " It 's easier just to plead guilty and pay the fine .
I 've been here THIRTY - TWO TIMES . "
" Plead guilty and pay ? "
THIRTY - TWO TIMES ?
When you realize the Justice system is an industry , referred to as the " compliance industry , " then you 'll understand more of exactly what 's happening in American courts with the cooperation of folks like O'Really , Blooper Blurdock , and Rusty Limberger .
This past ten years has been quite an American journey and eye opening experience for a crazed , " alcoholic , " female , " mentally ill " political cartoonist like myself .....
Next Post : Trashing and Terrorland , how it works ...
----------------
So , here 's the rest of my original post , that I initially tried to tame !
Thoughts are with victim families of the Knoxville area " liberal " Unitarian church – who unexpectedly hosted violence , murder and hatred , surely the result of social , religious , and / or political programming .
On this fascist planet , spreading hate and increasing crime can often enhance business , profit and personal success with some of our most noteworthy political criminals having earned millions in the publishing industry alone .
Particularly white collar crime is often rewarded with fame and fortune , while white collar , military - based prisons are comparable to resorts for comrades with similar interests to make acquaintance .
Consequently , it 's a national tragedy that with all of the waged , planned wars , trillions in national debt , 45 million without healthcare ; Americans have corporate accountants and executives happy with the profits gained from social and political division , disputes often solved in expensive courts with expensive attorneys .
Surely these talk show hosts , liberal and conservative , Democrat and Republican , male and female , would enjoy coffee with John D. Ferguson , to discuss profits and pitfalls .
Perhaps they could invite Akennas , Wolfy and associates for cocktails .

Bill O'Reilly has no idea how to deal with bulletin boards , blogs , or even political chat rooms .
So , he makes a big yelling segment to bolster his false paradigm of " right / left " or " liberal / conserrvative " labeling .
All of that is a joke .
The parties are all run by the same people .
The MSM is owned by corporate interests .
Honestly , this BillO Reilly is one of the meanest humans alive , in all ways .
And , the poster this other side has , is also one of the paid hacks that attempts to control message boards , chats , and discussions , at all sites .
If you ever visit these modes of discussion , you will notice the " trolls " in the room .
These guys are always there , always talking , and always mad .
They hate " LEFT " or " RIGHT " , when there is no such thing .
There are selfish mean people , and then there are normal loving caring people .
But , this " Left / Right ? Liberal / Conserative ? " dichotomy does not exist .
It boils down to :
Do you believe the law should be enforced equally , or do you believe that some people should get away with screwing the rest of us ?
We are all in this boat , together .
Looks like we are sinking fast , too .
No doubt , some will blindly blame everyone else .

It just takes one wealthy and harmed individual to sue and set the record straight .
No one denies free speach but self censorship is not only encouraged it is necessary for free speach to continue .
When Faux " News " takes the position that they can spew lies and treachery over the airwaves and calls for the death of individuals then you know that free speach is in trouble .
No culture can stand and continue when death threats are made daily against prominent figures in society .
This is nothing more than outright barbarism and chaotic wickedness .

In the last few months , there appears to be a frenzy building within the hate - mongering right - wing radio and TV hosts who call for violence and are not challenged by the FCC or any segment of our law enforcement apparatus .
Violence is rising , and I believe it 's just the tip of the iceberg .
I have been following the change of attitudes and the sharp rise of police brutality that is manifesting itself across our nation - and only by disseminating the truth do we have a chance of bringing about change - and there will be causalities .
As a writer that has constantly shouted - down violence in my Blog and when I was a moderator of a Liberal / Progressive discussion forum , I am dismayed that the hate - mongers appear to be gaining in momentum .
Too many of those that believe in violence have been affected by propaganda and lies , brought to us daily by the likes of O'LIEry , Coulter , and a host of right - wing instigators .
They play the hate card to take the public 's eye off of the real issues that are plaguing our society and the ill - informed and zealots eat it up like candy and somehow believe they are the true " patriots " of our era , when in fact they are nothing more than enablers of a criminal and fascist regime .
The irony of the situation is they are also losing their homes and are having a hard time feeding their families , but right - wing hate - mongers blame it all on the Liberal / Progressive movement - when in reality it 's caused by Bush 's failed economic and foreign policies .
They desperately need a scapegoat , and unfortunately , it 's us that attempt to wake - up our fellow Americans that bear the brunt of the blame and hostility .
Speaking from personal experience , I have been threatened , someone tried to break into our home while all were sleeping , and I am often followed unmercifully by elements that I have n't been able to identify .
We have moved and now are transferring our domain name (s ) to an anonymous registration system that will not allow the public to be privy to our whereabouts by performing a " whois " search .
Those of you who post comments using pseudonyms rather than your real names are in less danger , at least for the time being , but those of us who choose to write using our real names are becoming the targets for the right - wing 's hate machine which is exploding upon the Blogosphere at a frightening pace .
Retreat will do nothing more than embolden those who use hate and violence as their tactics to intimidate and hope that we remain silent and afraid - believing that their actions will make us cower in fear and quit writing for freedom .
Exactly the opposite must happen in order to counter the hate and propaganda - and it has to be a concerted effort by all of us that truly believe in liberty and freedom .
Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter - Right - Wing ’s Hate Purveyors Police Brutality Is Rising - How Can
We Stop It ?
Updated
We are fighting a battle for the hearts and minds of America and are desperately attempting to move our government back to its constitutional beliefs and the rule of law .
As the threats increase , we need to act accordingly and intensify our efforts to wake - up the general population so that more Americans are aware of how our nation is embracing fascism rather than the democratic principles our military once fought and died to protect and preserve - which is the duty of anyone that is truly patriotic that believes in the American way of life .
All we can do is try not to be a victim , and remember that self - defense is guaranteed to us by the rule of law - so when danger knocks at your door , at least be prepared to defend your life and family ; complacency could cost you your life , and as unbelievable as it may sound , these nut - jobs feel no remorse in killing women and children too as evidenced by the recent attack on a Libertarian Church .
The true terrorists that pose a real danger to liberals / Progressives exist in these United States , and until we return to sanity , being a writer that supports our constitution and the rule of law may be hazardous to your health and standing in a country that has lost its way .
Only we can guarantee change , and as it was during the civil rights movement , we are faced with bigotry and an effort by those that would rather live under authoritarian rule and fascism - which makes them the real traitors that are attempting to destroy everything our forefathers fought and died for during the past two - hundred years .
We must not allow their ultimate sacrifice to have been in vain .

This guy get 's it .
And it also a way to take out a legitimate website , maybe their security is lax , or maybe they do n't have dedicated moderators , it all leads to a chilling effect in MY opinion because you can't express your thoughts when your thoughts are re-spun and used against your own TOS / AUP or worse .
( All is needed to get these type of website shut down a site is a wireless connection and a tor link .
And furthermore to destroy someone on a personal level . )
Next time you 'll shut up and not comment .
It really does n't matter where the threats come from , when they have already interfered , the damage is done .
I am about at that point where you say , quit writing .
It 's so much less of a hassle to promote cool shit ( bands Music , Products ! ! ) than to point out the bad shit .
It 's a happier world when one is talking about cool new stuff as opposed to old crusty bad stuff .
But also there are the shock jocks that are stirring up the pot to make folks ( again their own choice ) to post ideas that they would n't normally post .
I fell in that fucking trap .
Brainwashed by the likes of Michael Savage ( I have several of his fucking books , no I wo n't give them to ya , I destroyed them . )
But I dumped the asshole , when I realized that he did n't give a fuck about the electronic voting threat .
And I have since , put distance between his ideas on gays , and liberals .
I now know it 's CORPORATE not ( d. ) vs. ( r. )
I now know it 's okay to be gay , I now know that the dude was totally full of shit .
I did n't at the time .
But I did follow him like a brainwashed fucking lamb for a few years , it 's because the only thing ON THE AIR , was the fascist corporate crap was ON THE AIR .
" We are fighting a battle for the hearts and minds of America and are desperately attempting to move our government back to its constitutional beliefs and the rule of law .

"
Yep , exactly .
We 're fighting against an adept dangerous cult by definition .
I 'll hang around on the Bradblog , as long as I do n't feel like I am getting framed as a nutjob .
But the moment that happens .
I 'm out .
I am human , I get pissed off , I cool of , I talk shit .
I do a lot of things , but my only purpose is to restore the US Constitution .
Again , as an enlisted puke , I was n't trained on how the fuck to do that .
And still to this day nobody will answer this .

Mr. Cormier ,
With proper understanding it 's possible the " right " could be reached .
Having been born , bred , sworn to the South in the Bible Belt , it 's well recognized far - right and extremist ideas often originate from these areas , and from farmland areas in the west .
What I personally found incredible is the number of people in these areas who are illiterate " Baby - Boomers . "
In explaining to my elder brother I 'd met several folks nearly my age who could not read or write , he was astonished , finding it incredible such a thing could be possible so near the 21st century and ––in the U.S.A .
I even had a private conversation with a Pentecostal Holiness elder advising him his church should set up reading classes to help adults improve their quality of life .
What happened in many of these situations is in order for the families to maintain their family farms , the elder children dropped out of school to help with the farm work , chores , and caring for the younger children .
There also appears to be high levels of dyslexia and / or attention deficit disorders in some areas .
The Southern family 's social life and culture was church and family .
Growing up in even a smaller city , few families were inclined to participate in cultural events , and even now small towns struggle to have local " opera houses , " or events for hosting less religious activities .
One New Yorker commented , " There 's no culture down here . "
And the truth was , except for larger cities he was pretty much on target .
Another observation , after moving around to different areas , is that " word of mouth , " or gossip is very powerful in these areas .
People can't or wo n't read and will tend to follow - the - leader , who , if that person happens to be a preacher or lawyer , judge or businessman ; his word and opinion is trusted until proven otherwise .
And in some areas where crime , corruption or drugs is prevalent , there 's some accompanying fear and / or intimidation .
The extremist , and " far - right " definition clouds the fact that these are good , genuine Americans , in fact , the best people in the world when it comes to honesty and good intentions .
If there could be a way to reach out to them in other ways , I believe these are the people who could help incredibly to return this country to the compassionate and good natured homeland it used to be .
It 's disheartening to see Republicans exploit religious people to further their personal and political agendas .
It was n't enough that Mr. Abramoff violated Native Americans to place Republicans in power , or Ralph Reed 's involvement with the Christian Coalition , in trickery to encourage Republican votes .
The sickening part of it is after they patronized these religious people for gaining personal power , then they turned coat to ridicule , betray and belittle them .
The Tennessee religious winds blew the words " Obama is a Muslim " around small midwest churches and frightened the little people like you could n't imagine .
The Republicans have America 's religious so afraid of Muslims , they 're sure it 's the end of the world .
And sadly , it 's probably part of another Abramoff engineered scheme , to have American might on the side of Israel while a chosen few profit from more war .
Now as McCain 's crew utilizes religion and money once again to so deceptively influence these innocent people , there are those of us who recognize the deviousness of those designs .
Whether he or Obama will be the best leader for this country is yet to be known , but why bring Moses into this ?
Why bring Judeo Christian belief into this at all ?
Why throw more coals on an already hot fire ?
Why fan the flames ?
Obama has two things to his disfavor among certain right - wing circles : his color and his name .
Otherwise he's an American , while Republicans cast his image as being a demon and follower of Muslims and as the Anti-Christ , even Satan himself .
This is incredible trickery on the part of the Far - Right , but sadder still is the fact that we have Americans gullible enough to fall into the trap .
Republicans creating these religious ads are preying on an American innocence , creating fear and distrust and what they are doing is pure evil , and it 's evil to the very core .
Conservative , liberal , republican , democrat , right and left have no meaning when it comes honesty , truth and what 's good for this country .
The truth is many of these " far right " religious folks might find they 're closer to the " left " than ever imagined if they really considered the definitions .
Having grown up in the " Christian " environment , I never would have thought I 'd see 70 % of Christian people condoning the death penalty and condemning abortion in the same breath .
I never would have thought I 'd see a " Christian " write that " God Hates " anything at all .
It 's frightening to know that things have changed so dramatically since the 1960's in this country .
There are many things that have changed in the " Christian " environment , although the extreme sectors still " damn " those judged as " bad people , " which is one of the reasons little girls " in trouble " ran away for illegal abortions , or went to homes for unwed mothers secretly in the South .
More forgiving than most , " Christians " are quick to forgive the " non-perfect , " but often fall short in avoiding cruel , unnecessary and sometimes dangerous judgement of others .
I truly enjoyed your comments , and am so sorry you 've suffered .
But for it all , ever thankful for the information highway of the internet , things will eventually change for the better .
It 's never good to be alone , but to stand firm for a just cause for all American people while confronted with threats , adversity , stalking , and terror , even in your own home is a sign of enduring courage and commitment to building a better future .
I have bookmarked your site , find it very encouraging , and wish your family peace for the future .
We have to believe " Good " will prevail .

To take it yet another step , add in technology , add in the lack of understanding it .
Add in lack of php , mysql , or plain html skill .
Then add on top of that specifically coded scripts that do not allow for a re-edit , or for pgp signatures , or spell checking .
Add into that anger , confusion , and just like you said , drugs and alcohol , and what you end up with is what we now have .
" This is incredible trickery on the part of the Far - Right , but sadder still is the fact that we have Americans gullible enough to fall into the trap . "
They fall into the trap because the only news they hear is from the same corporate source , if that be on their radio , tv , or the only half - ass literate person in their click .
I once worked at a nursery ( plants ) , and there were probably fifty different languages spoken there , different religions , different viewpoints .

Without a Fairness Doctrine , I guess hate speech is now legal , but only for the GOP .
The veiled death threats are not there just to give an idea to a deranged mind , but also serves to put a chill into liberals who dare exercise free speech .
That scare tactic wo n't work for most of us in the land of the brave .
Americans have always been willing to fight and die to keep our country free .
Still , some Americans will fall silent rather than run the risk of stating an opinion and for that ( and many other acts ) the necons are shameful .

" The system " needs a very close examination , and one as Thomas Jefferson would have which clearly defines the separation of church and state .
When money is exchanged , non taxed trinkets sold , when taxes are levied , religious causes are funded with tax dollars , and when politicians utilize religion to achieve certain goals , or religions utilize politics for the same , then , certain aspects of Constitutional Law should come into immediate question .
For many years these issues have stagnated , although there have been news items regarding them from time to time .
The overhaul should be not only of the examination of religion vs. the state but also of the American System of Justice to establish a policing system outside those educated by the Bar Association , if the Bar associations are not capable of enforcing rules defining limits of abuse and neglect allowed by their membership .
In these affluent private sectors there has to be a way to protect the population at - large , the heartbeat of this country , from abuse , malpractice , and fraud .
If institutions or bodies of legislators , of medicine , law , industry or finance cannot enforce strict rules to prevent negative , even illegal occurrences then Congress should appoint committees to oversee these " industries . "
( Yet as it is , Congress appears to be an ineffective group of self - centered , yet well paid and insured Americans who move at slower paces , and appear to care little to nothing for gathering truth or eradicating injustice as long as they win elections . )
And then as privatization enhances the bank accounts of a few , the issue of prisons for profit should be examined closely .
How can " the law , " " government , " or " the state " try and convict a person , and then fairly allow private individuals to imprison him and profit by it ?
If there is profit to be made should n't that money go back to those tax payers or victims the " criminal " offended ?
How can a newspaper splatter the mug shot picture of an accused person across a community or state , when that person has yet to stand trial or be found guilty or innocent ?
How can ACS or other private companies fairly profit by placing cameras at stoplights or collect private , personal data for the courts and monitoring traffic with their industry ?
Can we define what is the responsibility of the government and what can be farmed out to a chosen few politically invested businessmen ?
It 's because the " JUSTICE " system has become a " Compliance Industry " where a few people are raking in dollars while others are coping to survive it .
We 're losing sight of right vs. wrong in this country in more ways than one .
In response to Mr. Cormier 's statements regarding lawyers and the law handling breaches , it often does not happen the way stories and books say it should .
Many times people facing avalanches of misdeeds and illegalities have their cases shelved in the back of filing cabinets , or simply ignored , postponed , or prolonged by courts and judges .
The issue then becomes whether the plaintiff can endure the time lapse and stress incurred during the postponements .
The other issue is when an attorney violates a client , it 's the client 's word against his with or without documentation .
Thousands of dollars are handed to attorneys daily for lost causes , and the money is not refunded , much like a doctor 's fee for treatment of an incurable illness .
Phil you 've been in situations with differing languages and people , they worked together .
But did you know that if you work for Walmart they have speech police ?
If you speak of religion and are reported , then you will be fired .
So you see , " Constitutionality " is just another argument , and depends on the situation , and whether a challenging type of person has the stamina , good health , scholarly and good - willed attorneys , and financial backing for support .
It is not supposed to be variable or selective , but the contemporary design for Justice and Human Rights in reference to Constitutionality , today is exactly what elected politicians have allowed it to become .
And as some lawmakers will speak of " crafting " laws , you can be sure they have friends who will prosper from the designs and make plans far in advance of the rest of us having an inkling of what is happening .
Remember the Stealth was kept a secret for 20 years .
So did your grandparents have opportunity or knowledge to purchase stock in those companies ?
Or were they private , afterall ?
Think about it .
There are tons of things Americans need to be thinking about , and MSM is not going to alert them to it .
Industry is not going to shoot itself in the foot or curb its own profits .
It 's up to us lowly bloggers and internet news hounds to " craft " new horizons , unravel mysteries , and discover truths , so people will finally have something good to hope for .
It 's time for CHANGE ... change .... change !
There are n't many old songs as hopeful or inspiring as Wind of Change , by the Scorpions , a German rock group .

Phil : Keep posting .
You almost fell in the drink trying to step on the boat but it happens to the best of us .
You still made some very valid points .
Frankly i do n't care for the New Order 's A or B choice .
The problem in this country is that the plan to control the media and just plain mislead and misinform the American people has been so succesful that people can't the big picture that up is down and right is left .
The Bush Administration are greedy , self serving , destructive loser criminals that define an impeachable rogue ( republi - dem ) regime .
In 2008 , they are simply perpetuating their rule as an Impirialistic Federal governing body after years of manipulating the system although many still do n't get it .
To help , that 's why they have a : 1 . Corporate monopoly on the US mass media 2 .
Refuse to fix a broken system of elections and abolish a rigged system of electronic computer voting machines and tabulators 3 .
Two candidates that have already accepted millions and millions of dollars from corporate interests and who talk more and more alike although they supposedly started out diametrically opposed .
Get a clue !
The rights you lost are gone and they are not coming back WITHOUT A FIGHT .
The stranglehold of the invisable investment bankers and oil barons using their system of debt that 's been in place since 1934 has been a complete success FOR THEM .
That is our problem .
As long as the people who print US currency at their private bank ( although called the Federal Reserve ) will continue to rape our country and our world until their destructive system implodes , mother nature rebels , or some dumbace human final lets the nukes fly , we are dead in the water .
Go ahead and take death threats seriously .
That 's a good thing .
Considering the history of this country , i think a black man with an arabic sounding name should consider the thickest private security possible .
Once the US government takes back control of printing currency and makes a return to the gold standard to back the US dollar , we can start to slow our chaotic spin .
Then value will return to the US dollar as well as our form of government .

" A " candidate will win the Presidency .
Yet , the shadow government has tested the waters and found assassinations come and go , and details can stay comfortably concealed for generations .
If I were a brown person with a Muslim name , I 'd be very watchful , lest my face appear on a Las Vegas playing card generated by investing retired military officers , and industrial war machine manufacturers .
Maybe good Americans , on a mass scale , will finally wake up and demand the truth .

Every day is a new day .
( found a nice bad 512MB ram chip yesterday , 64 k eRRoRs were causing random crashes in all applications .
chip removed , op 's check good . )
First 99 .
There 's a left arrow at sick look for sp ( like in spelling ) that 's where it munged out .
Cause it thought I was doing an a href=
Perhaps it 's better to leave it snipped off at this point since I did ramble .... o; )
Oh and thank you for looking .
And thank you for working eight times as hard , at triple your current pay .
[ Ed Note : No , really .
There was bubkes after " sick " on the admin page too , yer left arrow included .
Thin air .
Gone .
Poof .
And , yer welcome , and , yes , rambling gets out of hand around here sometimes .... -- 99 ]
Second , G.B. Dancer .
I do n't even know what my point is anymore .
maybe it's that I do n't want to be the next example by people who jump to conclusions and do n't think things out .
They just make everything illegal and make criminals out of everyone -- seems to be easier for them instead of actually working to figure out what the proper course of action should be .
This voting thing needs to be fixed ( not rigged . )
Kind of like getting a fixed loan you know what your getting , as opposed to a rigged loan .
these people that got power right now are into so much , it 's impossible to be coherent even when I am stone cold sober .
they will happily remix words to their ends .
third to stay on topic , I am saying look at the comments at rawstory .
I see crazy death threats in there on a daily basis , it 's not rawstory owners that are the problem .
Chilling effect freaking legislation is NOT THE FUCKING ANSWER .
finally , if saying that if you / they / them / oathbreakers ( hypothetically ) take a shot at me , and I threaten to take many a shot back at you , is some kind of death threat , then YOU are crazy not me .
I have always had a god given right to self defense .
But also the responsibility to NOT GO THERE unless the fucking worlds coming to an end .
And again , we ain't there yet .
Now let 's get rid of these fucking rigged voting machines and get our country back .
One legal step at a time .
Power to the people !

If you read my entire entries , you will see I was reporting what my military friends were contemplating , not saying what I would do .
The final line on re-read can well be interpreted as a threat to Senator Obama , and I truly regret that - it is actually a paraphrase of a scriptural reference .
However , I do not apologize for saying I have never seen things so clearly , or that the Copperheads in our midst must be opposed with every fiber of our beings , by force if necessary .
That , however , would ONLY be if all legal recourse has disappeared .
As long as we can vote and speak and educate , that powder will remain dry .
I pray every day that the ballot will always be sufficient .
You may find it surprising that in that regard , I find electronic voting an abomination .
There is SO much room for mischief .
Why are we in such a freaking hurry to get the results ?
It 's not like any of these officials is going to be inaugurated in the next 24 hours .
Take your time , use verifiable paper ballots , insist on voter ID , and get it done in order and as transparently as possible without revealing the identity of the voter .

NANCY PELOSI IS AN ADHERENT TO SAUL ALINSKY !
AS ARE OTHERS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY !
THIS IS NOT YOUR PARENTS DEMOCRATIC PARTY !
IT HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER BY THE COMMUNIST PARTY !
I AM NO LONGER A DEMOCRAT FOR THIS REASON !
LOL , NOPE IM NOT A STINKING REPUBLICAN EITHER !
ALL ANYONE HAS TO DO IS READ " RULES FOR RADICALS " AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THESE TACTICS HAVE BEEN USED BY RADICAL DEMOCRATS AGAINST OTHER US CITIZENS FOR FUCKING YEARS !
ITS TIME TO STAND UP TO THESE PEOPLE AND NOT BACK DOWN !

Siberia feels the heat
It 's a frozen peat bog the size of France and Germany combined , contains billions of tonnes of greenhouse gas and , for the first time since the ice age , it is melting
A vast expanse of western Sibera is undergoing an unprecedented thaw that could dramatically increase the rate of global warming , climate scientists warn today .
Researchers who have recently returned from the region found that an area of permafrost spanning a million square kilometres - the size of France and Germany combined - has started to melt for the first time since it formed 11,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age .
The area , which covers the entire sub-Arctic region of western Siberia , is the world 's largest frozen peat bog and scientists fear that as it thaws , it will release billions of tonnes of methane , a greenhouse gas 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere .
It is a scenario climate scientists have feared since first identifying " tipping points " - delicate thresholds where a slight rise in the Earth 's temperature can cause a dramatic change in the environment that itself triggers a far greater increase in global temperatures .
The discovery was made by Sergei Kirpotin at Tomsk State University in western Siberia and Judith Marquand at Oxford University and is reported in New Scientist today .
The researchers found that what was until recently a barren expanse of frozen peat is turning into a broken landscape of mud and lakes , some more than a kilometre across .
Dr Kirpotin told the magazine the situation was an " ecological landslide that is probably irreversible and is undoubtedly connected to climatic warming " .
He added that the thaw had probably begun in the past three or four years .
Climate scientists yesterday reacted with alarm to the finding , and warned that predictions of future global temperatures would have to be revised upwards .
" When you start messing around with these natural systems , you can end up in situations where it 's unstoppable .
There are no brakes you can apply , " said David Viner , a senior scientist at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia .
" This is a big deal because you can't put the permafrost back once it 's gone .
The causal effect is human activity and it will ramp up temperatures even more than our emissions are doing . "
In its last major report in 2001 , the intergovernmental panel on climate change predicted a rise in global temperatures of 1.4C - 5.8C between 1990 and 2100 , but the estimate only takes account of global warming driven by known greenhouse gas emissions .
" These positive feedbacks with landmasses were n't known about then .
They had no idea how much they would add to global warming , " said Dr Viner .
Western Siberia is heating up faster than anywhere else in the world , having experienced a rise of some 3C in the past 40 years .
Scientists are particularly concerned about the permafrost , because as it thaws , it reveals bare ground which warms up more quickly than ice and snow , and so accelerates the rate at which the permafrost thaws .
Siberia 's peat bogs have been producing methane since they formed at the end of the last ice age , but most of the gas had been trapped in the permafrost .
According to Larry Smith , a hydrologist at the University of California , Los Angeles , the west Siberian peat bog could hold some 70bn tonnes of methane , a quarter of all of the methane stored in the ground around the world .
The permafrost is likely to take many decades at least to thaw , so the methane locked within it will not be released into the atmosphere in one burst , said Stephen Sitch , a climate scientist at the Met Office 's Hadley Centre in Exeter .
But calculations by Dr Sitch and his colleagues show that even if methane seeped from the permafrost over the next 100 years , it would add around 700 m tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere each year , roughly the same amount that is released annually from the world 's wetlands and agriculture .
It would effectively double atmospheric levels of the gas , leading to a 10 % to 25 % increase in global warming , he said .
Tony Juniper , director of Friends of the Earth , said the finding was a stark message to politicians to take concerted action on climate change .
" We knew at some point we'd get these feedbacks happening that exacerbate global warming , but this could lead to a massive injection of greenhouse gases .
" If we do n't take action very soon , we could unleash runaway global warming that will be beyond our control and it will lead to social , economic and environmental devastation worldwide , " he said .
" There 's still time to take action , but not much .
" The assumption has been that we would n't see these kinds of changes until the world is a little warmer , but this suggests we 're running out of time . "
In May this year , another group of researchers reported signs that global warming was damaging the permafrost .
Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , Fairbanks , told a meeting of the Arctic Research Consortium of the US that her team had found methane hotspots in eastern Siberia .
At the hotspots , methane was bubbling to the surface of the permafrost so quickly that it was preventing the surface from freezing over .
Last month , some of the world 's worst air polluters , including the US and Australia , announced a partnership to cut greenhouse gas emissions through the use of new technologies .
The deal came after Tony Blair struggled at the G8 summit to get the US president , George Bush , to commit to any concerted action on climate change and has been heavily criticised for setting no targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions .
