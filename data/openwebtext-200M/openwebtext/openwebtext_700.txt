Immigrants will have to wait 10 years to claim council housing in massive benefits clampdown
Phil Woolas : ' Immigrants have to earn their right to live here '
Immigrants will have wait up to 10 years for the right to claim UK benefits and council housing in the toughest crackdown seen for decades , it emerged last night .
All legal migrants will have to serve a five year ' probationary citzienship ' before being considered for a passport , immigration minister Phil Woolas said .
Those who work hard , are law - abiding and do voluntary work will be eligible for benefits one or two years afterwards .
But others will have to wait another five years before they can claim any benefits at all , in order to deter migrants who see Britain as a soft touch for benefit claimants .
Mr Woolas said : ' Entitlement to benefits should be for citizens of our country , not other people .
If you are a citizen you have earned the right to benefits .
People must show they are here to work . '
The measures which will help to safeguard jobs for British workers during the recession , will be unveiled in a new Borders , Immigration and Citizenship bill to be published in January .
It follows the news that Afghan mother - of - seven Toorpakai Saeidi was living in a £ 1.2 million mansion in West London and claiminig £ 175,000 per year in benefits at the taxpayer 's expense .
' We only need foreign workers if there is a clear skills shortage ' , Mr Woolas told The Sun .

This is the £ 1.2 million mansion in West London that Afghan mother - of - seven Toorpakai Saeidi ( below ) was living in
Unemployed : Toorpakai Saiedi was claiminig £ 175,000 per year in benefits
The minister also conceded that the Government was partly to blame for lax immigration rules .
Last October Home Secretary Jacqui Smith was forced to make the embarrassing admission that the number of foreign workers entering Britain since 1997 was 1.1 million - a staggering 300,000 more than official figures recorded .
Mr Woolas said : ' It has been too easy for illegal immigrants to stay in this country .
We have not counted them in and out . '
In his previous role as communities minister , Mr Woolas revealed he had received death threats .
He added that the Government was to blame for letting ethnic communities become ghettos where no one had to learn English .
He said : ' Why is it my little boy 's school has ' Welcome ' in 20 different languages ?
Immigrants must learn English .'
The minister pledged to keep Britain 's population which is currently 61 million , at below 70 million , and to stand up to the Prime Minister on immigration issues .
' If I lose my job , I lose my job ' , he said .
He has courted controversy for his direct approach since he being appointed to the immigration post just three months ago .
Last month Mr Woolas told reporters that most asylum seekers were economic migrants rather than refugees and accused lawyers and charities working for asylum seekers of ' playing the system ' .
Remember when Apple customers felt hip ?
There was a time when a glowing Apple logo symbolized radical nonconformity .
Being part of a miniature customer base was , to Mac users , like being a member of a holier - than - thou , secret society — a " Cult of Mac , " if you will .
But when Apple 's ecosystem grew beyond notebooks and desktops to phones and internet services , that era came to an end .
Apple 's ubiquitous presence in pop culture , news headlines and even politics prove that it's no longer special to be a member of the Mac cult .
Here 's a list of examples showing just how mainstream Apple products have become .
As you read along , take a look to your left and to your right and get the attention of the Apple customers around you .
Now , raise a glass of Steve
Jobs ' favorite nonalcoholic grape juice and drink a toast to being the same as everyone else .
Repeat after me :
We are all individuals !
Macs are big in Hollywood
It seems practically every computer used in a movie is a Mac .
It 's a little sickening , but it makes sense :
The damn things are just so pretty , and if Hollywood stars have to be good - looking , their gadgets should , too .
The new Pixar film Wall - E took Mac product placement to new heights :
Whenever the miniature robot booted up , he played the Mac start - up chime .
And his robot lover EVE even had a white , utilitarian design that epitomizes the Apple aesthetic .
( Then again , it 's no coincidence that Jobs used to be CEO of Pixar . )
Apple is skipping Macworld
__
Apple last week said that after 2009 , the corporation wo n't be attending
Macworld Expo , the trade show that revolves around all things Apple .
The message was essentially , " We 're so big and popular that we do n't need a trade show full of Apple - worshiping losers to advertise our products . "
That comes off as a little cocky , but hey — it 's true .
Apple 's secret product campaign generates so much buzz , the corporation might as well slice Macworld from its budget .
Heck , a Harvard professor estimated bloggers drummed up $ 400 million worth of free advertising on the iPhone .
Yeesh .

Some guy with a mullet is Apple 's public face
Steve Jobs wo n't be throwing on his artsy turtleneck and delivering his famous Macworld keynote in January .
Instead , some guy named Phil Schiller , who looks like the star of King of Queens
with a Swayze - esque mullet , is emceeing Macworld .
Sure , mullets were hip — in the 1990s .
Apple is abandoning FireWire
Mac loyalists are still pissed about Apple 's omission of FireWire on the latest MacBooks .
The corporation invented
FireWire ; devices were made with FireWire ports just to connect to Mac machines .
How could Apple do such a thing ?
Answer : Apple is more interested in appealing to the mainstream than its loyal fan base , and ditching FireWire in favor of slimmer , sexy aluminum MacBooks ( and the more ubiquitous USB standard ) seemed like a good idea .
And Apple loves consistency , so do n't be surprised if future Macs leave out that connection port , too .
* The Simpsons * mocks Apple
Appearing in an episode of The Simpsons is like passing a cultural litmus test that screams , " You 've broken into the mainstream ! "
A recent Simpsons episode hurled prickly jokes at the cult of Apple — everything from iPhones to overpriced Mac computers .
Heck ,
Bart even goes as far as to tease Steve Jobs , saying he pees on every iPod .
How dare he insult our fearless leader ?
Walmart is selling the iPhone
You know the iPhone 's pretty damn trendy if you can pick one up along with a bag of socks , a box of rifle bullets and some discounted Halloween candy — at none other than
Walmart , one of the world 's largest retail arms .
And Walmart is even selling the iPhone at a special low price of $ 197 — a whopping $ 2 less than the normal price tag .
The President - elect uses a Mac
Windows PC owners always pull the
" Macs are n't compatible with any decent software " card when bashing Apple .
But that insult is clearly outdated if Barack Obama was able to win the U.S .
presidency with a Mac as his computing weapon ( while using iChat to stay in touch with his family , no less ) .
And wait — there 's one more thing : Obama has his own official iPhone application !
Can we all " think different " if we 're all using the same trendy gadgets ?

The Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon want you to know they will soon be searching the internet in near real time for terrorists .
Of course , since there are so few real terrorists posing a threat — that is to say , terrorists not run out of the Pentagon and the intelligence apparatus — we can assume they will not be looking for the cave - dwelling sort of terrorist .
Former AT&T technician Mark Klein and internet expert Brian Reid explain how the NSA and government employ high - tech means to snoop on internet communication .
“ The Homeland Security Department may soon start scouring the Internet to find blogs and message boards that terrorists use to plan attacks , ” reports USA Today .
“ The effort comes as researchers are seeing terrorists increasingly use the Internet to plan bombings , recruit members and spread propaganda .
‘ Blogging and message boards have played a substantial role in allowing communication among those who would do the United States harm , ’ the department said in a recent notice . ”
Blogging and message boards also play a substantial role in allowing communication among diverse groups , organizations , and individuals opposed to the government .
It is an exhaustively documented fact that the FBI , the CIA ( in violation of its charter ) , the NSA , the Department of Homeland Security , and the Pentagon primarily monitor antiwar and other activists groups , not al - Qaeda .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The Pentagon ’s Threat and Local Observation Notice ( TALON ) was created to spy on antiwar groups and others , a fact revealed by the ACLU of Northern California in 2006 .
The Department of Defense and the CIA have been sending so - called National Security Letters to credit card and banking companies asking that they release personal information on Americans for years now .
The NSA has collected and databased the phone call records of tens of millions of Americans , using data provided by AT&T , Verizon and BellSouth .
The NSA ’s massive operation , according to Dana Perino , is “ lawful , necessary and required for the pursuit of al - Qaeda and affiliated terrorists ” or Quakers opposed to the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
In fact , the government has closely monitored and sabotaged activists for decades — from Black Chamber and the NSA ’s Operation Shamrock in the late 40s and 50s to the CIA ’s Operation Chaos and the FBI ’s COINTELPRO in the 60s and 70s — so all of this is nothing new , just business as usual , albeit utilizing the latest technology .
In order to more effectively monitor your antiwar blog or one in defense of the Constitution and the Second Amendment , “ Homeland Security officials are looking for companies to search the Internet for postings ‘ in near to real - time which precede ’ an attack , ” or posting opposed to government policies or malfeasance .
In order to impart a sense of urgency and create even more fear , Homeland Security officials want us to believe “ terrorists can easily get materials and make an improvised - explosive device ( IED ) . ”
Homeland Security and the Pentagon are likely already searching blogs and internet sites in near real time and the Mockingbird corporate media is simply telling the American people about it now .
It is simply another way to ramp up the paranoia and characterize the internet as a nefarious terrorist tool in need of regulation and outright censorship .

Of course it 's not your fault .
So , why take the punishment ?
Every police force in the UK is to be equipped with mobile fingerprint scanners - handheld devices that allow police to carry out identity checks on people in the street .
The new technology , which ultimately may be able to receive pictures of suspects , is likely to be in widespread use within 18 months .
Tens of thousands of sets - as compact as BlackBerry smartphones - are expected to be distributed .
The police claim the scheme , called Project Midas , will transform the speed of criminal investigations .
A similar , heavier machine has been tested during limited trials with motorway patrols .
To address fears about mass surveillance and random searches , the police insist fingerprints taken by the scanners will not be stored or added to databases .
Liberty , the civil rights group , cautioned that the law required fingerprints taken in such circumstances to be deleted after use .
Gareth Crossman , Liberty 's policy director , said : " Saving time with new technology could help police performance but officers must make absolutely certain that they take fingerprints only when they suspect an individual of an offence and can't establish his identity . "
Details of the type of equipment and the scope of its use have been revealed in a presentation by the National Policing Improvement Agency ( NPIA ) .
The initial phase of the Mobile Identification At Scene ( Midas ) project , costed at £ 30 m - £ 40 m , will enable officers to perform rapid checks on the fingerprints of people arrested or detained .
The marks will be compared against records on Ident1 , the national police database which holds information on 7.5 million individuals .
Geoff
Whitaker , a senior technology officer with the NPIA , told the Biometrics 2008 conference that Project Midas would save enormous amounts of police time and reduce the number of wrongful arrests .
At present , officers have to take suspects to custody suites if they need to check fingerprints .
On average , the agency 's research shows , the procedure takes 67 minutes .
" If we scaled this [ saving ] up to the national level that would equate to 366 additional police officers on the beat , " Whitaker said .
" One of the benefits is that it will reduce the number of errors - and we can reduce the number of arrests significantly .
" There 's a huge range of opportunities [ for ] mobile ID .
It could be used on the deceased at the scene of a crime , on suspects for intelligence in the early part of an investigation , [ or even ] in a mortuary . "
Policing of big public occasions , sporting events , festivals , political conferences - as a well as immigration and border controls - could benefit from the equipment , he suggested .
" Another use is for prisoners in transit ; it 's not uncommon for prisoners to swap identities on the way to prison , " he said .
Project Midas , he said , would give the police " a full , mobile national capability " to check identities .
The system is being designed to have the capacity to beam images of suspects back to officers on the streets to help confirm identifications .
Some US police forces are already using the technology .
" The return of mugshots [ to officers ] , " Whitaker added , " is something we would like to do . "
The tender document for Midas states : " Bidders ' solutions ... should include , but may not be limited to , fingerprint identification capability . "
Plans for a police Facial Images National Database ( Find ) were suspended last year but are being reviewed .
One of the companies bidding for the Midas contract , Northrop Grumman , told the Guardian : " A lot of the hand - held [ devices ] we are considering have cameras so they can support fingerprint and facial images " .
A limited trial of mobile police fingerprint devices , called Project Lantern , started in 2006 .
About 200 have been distributed and 30,000 checks performed .
They were deployed in police cars using automatic number plate recognition technology - stopping vehicles that were logged as stolen , having no insurance , no MOT or simply unknown .
" The aim was to deny criminals the use of the roads , " said Whitaker .
" Around 60 % of drivers stopped gave false identification details . "
Fingerprint checks often showed they were carrying falsified documents .
The electronic searches , encrypted and sent over public networks , were usually returned to the mobile devices within two minutes ; 97 % of searches were completed in five minutes .
Responses are graded as " high " or " medium " .
If high , it shows the system is confident of a match ; if medium , it could display up to three potential identities .
The returned data includes the name , age and gender of the suspect if there is a match .
A spokeswoman for the NPIA added : " It will be up to each police authority to assess the benefits and see how many they want .
Early indications are that the benefits will be huge . "
Thomas Smith , an officer from the Los Angeles police department , also briefed the Biometrics 2008 conference on the success of his force 's mobile ID devices which send images and fingerprint matches back to officers on the street .
He said they had become so powerful that once the machines were produced some suspects admitted they were lying about their identity .
" Our next thing will be facial recognition [ computerised matching of suspects from their faces ] in the field , " he said .
( CNN ) -- Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich is in federal custody on corruption charges , a law enforcement official said Tuesday .
Rod Blagojevich is currently serving his second term as governor of Illinois .
Blagojevich and his chief of staff , John Harris , are charged with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and solicitation of bribery , according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney 's office for the Northern District of Illinois .
Both men are expected in U.S. District Court in Chicago later Tuesday .
A news conference is expected at noon ET .
Federal prosecutors say Blagojevich , Harris and others conspired to gain financial benefits in appointing President - elect Barack Obama 's Senate replacement , according to the statement .
" The breadth of corruption laid out in these charges is staggering , " U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said in a statement .
" They allege that Blagojevich put a ' for sale ' sign on the naming of a United States Senator ; involved himself personally in pay - to - play schemes with the urgency of a salesman meeting his annual sales target ; and corruptly used his office in an effort to trample editorial voices of criticism . "
According to the statement , Blagojevich is alleged to have discussed obtaining :
a substantial salary for himself at either a non-profit foundation or an organization affiliated with labor unions ;
a spot for his wife on paid corporate boards , where he speculated she might garner as much as $ 150,000 a year ;
promises of campaign funds -- including cash up front ;
a Cabinet post or ambassadorship for himself .
The Obama transition team is aware that Blagojevich is in federal custody , but has no comment , according to a senior Democratic source .

The statement also alleges that Blagojevich and others tried to illegally obtain campaign contributions .
Blagojevich , Harris and others are also alleged to have withheld state assistance to the Tribune Company in connection with the sale of Wrigley Field .
The statement says this was done to induce the firing of Chicago Tribune editorial board members who were critical of Blagojevich .
Blagojevich , who turns 52 on Wednesday , is in his second four - year term as Illinois governor .
His term ends in January 2011 .
Before being elected governor , he served as a U.S. congressman for Illinois ' 5th district from 1997 until 2003 , according to his online biography .
He and his wife , Patti , have two daughters .
Blagojevich announced last month that he was forming a panel to review candidates to fill Obama 's Senate seat .
Several Illinois Democrats -- including Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and Iraq war veteran Tammy Duckworth , a former congressional candidate who now serves in Blagojevich 's administration -- have been mentioned as possible Senate replacements for Obama .

It ’s that time of the year again .
As we noted earlier in the week , nothing is more fun for tech bloggers than looking ahead to next year and trying to predict the future .
Prediction posts are an annual tradition in the blogosphere , and we enjoy doing them .
So below are eight prognostications for the new year in web tech .
Of course , if you saw our list of 2008 ’s top stories , you ’ll know that reality is often too wacky to predict — and that A LOT happens in a single year .
Remember to check out how we did with last year ’s predictions , as well .
And let us know in the comments what you think 2009 has in store for the web .
Note : I use the corporate “ we ” in this post , but these predictions are really just my own and not those of anyone else at SitePoint .
So , do n’t blame them for the terrible lack of foresight !
1. Twitter gets a business model .
Twitter has a bunch of different options when it comes to monetization .
Targeted ads in the Twitter stream based on what you tweet about , built in micro payments , charging high volume users , charging developers to use the API , etc .
Twitter may try some or all of these options , but we think the most likely path to monetization is in corporate accounts .
When SitePoint ran our highly successful and well publicized book giveaway via Twitter , it was only really made possible because we were able to get on Twitter ’s white list and send a large number of direct messages without being blocked .
Prior to getting on that list , things did n’t go nearly as smoothly .
That ’s the sort of added functionality that only corporate accounts would likely need , and that Twitter could charge for .
2. Lifestreaming gets big , but not via FriendFeed .
FriendFeed made a huge impact over the past year among the early adopter crowd , but lifestreaming has n’t quite made its way into the mainstream .
People are just now beginning to regularly use enough social services at once — YouTube , Flickr , Twitter , Digg , blogging — that aggregation will start to make sense .
In 2009 , it will be commonplace to publish your online life in a single stream , but it will be done via Facebook .
3 . The Web OS will really start to become a reality .
The Web OS race is on .
In 2009 we ’ll start to see the vision really begin to coalesce from major players like Adobe ( Flash , Flex , AIR ) , Google ( Chrome , Gears , Native Client ) , and Microsoft ( Silverlight , Live Mesh ) , among others .
4 . Some really great stuff will come out of Yahoo ! , but it wo n’t be enough to save them .
Yahoo !
has been doing some awesome stuff by opening up their search results and most popular pages and applications by making them more social and giving developers more hooks .
That ’s the sort of thing that will ultimately make the web a better place , but unfortunately it wo n’t be enough to save Yahoo ! on Wall Street .
Their stock will continue to slide , unless they sign a big search deal with Microsoft or sell their search business outright to focus on the content / platform side .
5 . Chrome will take at least 5 % but not more than 10 % of the browser market by year ’s end .
Google ’s browser , now out of beta and being actively promoted by Google , will take at least 5 % of the browser market by year ’s end and as much as 10 % .
IE will continue to decline with both Chrome and Mozilla Firefox on the scene , but Chrome will actually cause Mozilla ’s growth to stall , and will probably even steal some market share from Firefox once it supports extensions .
6. Microsoft Office will make people comfortable with web applications .
When Microsoft pushes out a web - based version of Office , users in the mainstream will finally start to become comfortable will web apps .
Google ’s Docs and Spreadsheets apps have certainly already pushed a fair number of people in that direction , but Microsoft will have a vastly bigger impact on the adoption of web applications by mainstream users .
Their software + services vision will emerge in 2009 as the clear future of software .
7. Facebook takes over the web .
Well , not literally .
But Facebook will continue to grow in size worldwide , and will finally over take MySpace as the biggest social network in the US .
A lot of the cool web applications that early adopters love , such as FriendFeed , will reach the mainstream as features of Facebook , and Facebook Connect will help spread the Facebook brand by entangling it with other popular sites on the web that people know and trust .
The company will also expand their search deal with Microsoft and make web search integration more prominent and more powerful .
For many users , Facebook will become their default search engine in 2009 , and this will pave the way for an IPO in 2010 .
8. Palm will surprise everyone at CES …
Nova will be good .
Palm ’s new entry into the smartphone market will be very impressive .
The Nova operating system will look like something that could challenge Android , Blackberry , and the iPhone in the mobile market , but success will depend on the hardware .
What are your predictions for the year 2009 ?

Green Gas Algeria 's Experiment in Carbon Capture
A venture by Algeria 's Sonatrach , the United Kingdom 's BP , and Norway 's Statoil to strip CO2 out of natural gas and store it underground could help cut emissions .
Von Stanley Reed
Iran 's army last Wednesday said US helicopters had been seen flying close to Iran 's border and that it would respond to any violation , a message analysts said seemed directed at US President - Elect Barack Obama more than at American troops in Iraq .
The US government has scrapped the central plank of its $ 700 bn financial rescue strategy by abandoning plans to buy toxic mortgage - related assets which have weighed down the balance sheets of troubled banks and Wall Street institutions .
In a sharp about - turn , treasury secretary Henry Paulson announced yesterday he no longer believed that purchasing assets would be the most effective use of the administration 's bail - out fund .
" The facts changed and the situation worsened , " said Paulson , who added that he would " never apologise " for amending his approach in the light of changing circumstances .
Instead , Paulson intends to use the bail - out fund for further injections of capital into banks in return for equity .
This programme is likely to be broadened to non-bank financial institutions .
The decision is a stark admission by the treasury that its original policy has proven inadequate .
It is likely to raise hackles in Congress , which only reluctantly approved the $ 700 bn ( £ 470 bn ) fund after a titanic battle last month , on the understanding that it would be used for asset purchases .
" Our assessment at this time is that this is not the most effective way to use TARP [ troubled asset relief programme ] funds , but we will continue to examine whether targeted forms of asset purchase can play a useful role , " Paulson said .
Paulson 's shift came on the eve of the G20 summit in Washington intended to develop coordinated approaches to tackling the global financial crisis .
It means that the US has fallen wholeheartedly in line with a strategy promoted by Gordon Brown , who pressed hard for capital injections in leading British banks .
The Bush administration was initially eager to avoid any sniff of nationalisation , citing negative precedents in Japan and fearing objections from free market advocates in the Republican party .
But picking off assets has proven to be difficult , largely because of a lack of agreement on how to arrive at a fair value for bombed - out financial instruments bereft of a market .
A Paulson acolyte , fellow former Goldman Sachs banker Neel Kashkari , was put in charge of the initiative at the treasury .
Last month , it announced an initial $ 125bn of investments in nine leading banks , including Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , Bank of America , and Citigroup .
Smaller institutions have clamoured for funds .
American Express has become the latest , reportedly asking for $ 2.5 bn after converting itself into a bank to qualify .
The world 's second - richest man , Mexican telecoms magnate Carlos Slim , recently urged the treasury to help regional banks , saying that it was essential for these institutions to get credit moving to small and medium - sized companies .
Critics have questioned whether the funds will really be used to unblock lending .
Some fear that firms will simply hoard the money - or that they will use it to take over weaker rivals .
Paulson 's changing solutions have attracted scepticism .
The treasury secretary is increasingly seen as a lame duck , to be replaced in January when Barack Obama takes office .
" He is catering to the political whim , " said Robert Andres , chief investment strategist at Portfolio Management Consultants in Philadelphia .
" Every time he opened his mouth this summer he said we need to fix the housing market and buy mortgage - backed securities .
This whole process got politicised . "
Where the money 's gone
Of the US treasury 's $ 700 bn rescue fund , some $ 250bn of the $ 350bn allocated by Congress has been earmarked for capital injections into banks .
Of this , $ 115 bn has gone out of the door .
Paulson had planned to spend the rest buying " toxic assets " from banks ' balance sheets .
But instead , it will go towards further capital injections , securing non-bank institutions and averting repossession for struggling homeowners .
Another $ 40bn has been given to stricken insurer AIG , leaving $ 60 bn to dole out before the treasury has to ask Congress for the final $ 350 bn .
This year , 19 high street banks have collapsed in the US - more than in the previous four years combined .
The online bookseller has branched out into digital music sales Online retail website Amazon has launched a UK music download service .
Amazon MP3 will sell tracks from 59 p and albums from £ 3 .
The new music store will offer more than 3 million songs that will work on any digital music player , including Apple 's iPod .
The move puts Amazon in direct competition with Apple for a stake in the growing market of online music sales , which in Britain alone was worth an estimated £ 163 m in 2007 .
Sony BMG Music Entertainment 's UK chairman , Ged Doherty , said the launch could only be good news for the music industry .
" Amazon 's music services in the US have attracted new digital music consumers and helped grow the digital market .
We have high hopes that it will have the same impact in the UK . "
Unlike many files from Apple 's iTunes store , which can only be played through its iTunes interface or on an iPod , the music available from Amazon will be free from the constraints of digital rights management ( DRM ) .
This will be a very positive development for digital music buyers in Britain
Matthew Crosswaite , EMI
As such , once users download a track , they are free to load and play it on any device : personal computers , mobile phones , and portable media players , including the iPod .
The issue of DRM has been a hot topic of late .
Advocates say it is an essential tool to combat piracy , but critics say it restricts user choice .
In April 2007 , EMI took the DRM off most of its digital music sold via download sites such as iTunes , saying that the best way to combat illegal traffic was to make legal content available at a decent price .
" We 're excited about their DRM - free store coming to the UK and we believe that this will be a very positive development for digital music buyers in Britain , " said Matthew Crosswaite , EMI 's vice president of music sales and commercial development .
Amazon MP3 is n't the first DRM - free music site to be launched in the UK .
Play.com launched its music service in Feb 2008 , selling tracks for 65 p and albums from £ 4.99 .
Audiophiles ' audio files Amazon say that DRM free music is the way of the future Amazon have also opted for a high - end bit rate encoding for its files - a measure of the degree of compression used when converting files into an MP3 format .
While iTunes tracks protected by DRM use a bit rate of 128 kbit/s , Amazon have gone for double that at 256 kbit /s .
However , doubling the bit rate does not double the quality .
Files from Play.com are encoded at the MP3s maximum of 320 kbit/s .
By comparison , an uncompressed audio file on a compact disc has a bit rate of 1,411.2 kbit/s Computer Music Magazines multimedia editor , Tim Cant , said it was hard to make a direct comparison between Apple 's and MP3 compression .
" Amazon use 256 kbit / s which on paper may look better , but if you were listening to it on , say , a set of iPod headphones you probably would n't be able to tell them apart .
" However , if you played the same file on a pair of good quality speakers then you may well notice a difference . "

John McCain himself has admitted that he is not the best student of the economy , but tonight the Republican nominee for president missed the official mark by a fairly long - shot with his discussion of unemployment during the Great Depression .
The question came up in those “ presidential questions ” that CBS News has been asking of the candidates .
The series aired tonight included the candidates ’ views of the best thing and the worst thing that ever happened to this nation .
Both McCain and Democratic rival Barack Obama agreed that the best thing was the founding of the nation , the drafting of a Constitution that has served Americans through the centuries .
But the Depression was the worst thing , in McCain ’s view , and slavery was the worst thing , in Obama ’s view .
“ Maybe the worst thing that happened to America , in modern times is the Great Depression , ” McCain told CBS Evening News ’ Katie Couric .
“ It affected probably more , a greater percentage of our population than any other economic or other impact that we experienced .
And literally , half the population , or 40 percent .
Whatever it was , huge numbers that are incomprehensible were out of work .
And people literally starved in America .
And that , we ca n’t ever repeat . ”
It was big , all right .
But , “ whatever it was , ” it was n’t 40 or 50 percent .
At the height , or nadir , of the Great Depression , unemployment reached 24.9 percent .
The World from Berlin A Terrorist Gets the Judicial Middle Finger
A German court convicted the would - be terrorist behind the failed 2006 Cologne suitcase bomb attack to life imprisonment on Tuesday .
Editorialists say the conviction sends an important message : that democracies have the right tools to fight terrorists .
Come tutti sapete già , è morto Carlo Caracciolo , nume tutelare del settimanale L’Espresso e padre fondatore assieme a Eugenio Scalfari del quotidiano la Repubblica .
Nonché , di conseguenza , del piccolo impero editoriale di carta stampata della annessa catena di quotidiani .
NON desidero unirmi al coro delle prefiche , dei beneficiati , degli adottivi , degli adottati e dei becchini che pare siano in procinto di bastonarsi a sangue per spartirsi le spoglie , ricche non solo del 10 % di azioni del gruppo editoriale .
Di fatto , e certo molto ma molto meno che per altri , Caracciolo è stato parte della mia vita professionale .
Perciò , nel mio piccolo , anche della mia vita tout court .
Cosa di cui gli sono e sempre gli sarò grato .
Non ricordo esattamente quando l’ho conosciuto .
Ricordo bene che all ’inizio del 1979 , quando ero già collaboratore fisso de L’Espresso e corrispondente di Repubblica , dopo avere contribuito a far nascere il quotidiano Il Mattino di Padova per conto di Giorgio Mondadori gli telefonai per dirgli che ero stato contattato da Rino Serri , dirigente del Partito comunista veneziano , che con un gruppetto di veneziani influenti voleva anche per Venezia un quotidiano concorrente del Gazzettino .
Volevano però lo facesse lui , Caracciolo , e non Mondadori .
Rimasi d’accordo con Caracciolo che avrei portato a casa sua a Roma Serri , ma poche settimane dopo arrivò la mia disavventura giudiziaria del 7 aprile di quell ’ anno : accuse di rapimento e uccisione di Aldo Moro , direzione strategica delle Brigate Rosse , Prima linea , Autonomia e non ricordo più quanti ammazzamenti , anzi non riuscii neppure a contarli tutti .
La botta fece saltare i piani con Serri&C.
Caracciolo però non si lasciò impressionare dalla valanga di accuse demenziali piovutemi , tutte prive anche della sola ombra di uno straccio di prova , e d’accordo con il direttore de L’Espresso , Livio Zanetti , e con Eugenio Scalfari , non solo mi fece difendere dal miglior penalista italiano di allora , cioè dall ’avvocato Adolfo Gatti che era anche il legale del gruppo editoriale , ma lasciò che io continuassi a figurare nel tamburino dei collaboratori fissi de L’Espresso .
Che mi pubblicò due articoli da me scritti in carcere : una tavola rotonda con i miei coimputati e una intervista a Valerio Morucci , arrestato nel frattempo e vero autore delle telefonate a me addebitate da un magistrato delirante .
Il 7 luglio dello stesso ‘ 79 , uscito dal carcere , Caracciolo mi consigliò di mollare Padova : “ Ti mando nella redazione de L’Espresso a Milano , a fare lo Scialoja del Nord ” .
Mario Scialoja era forse la firma più famosa del settimanale , scatenato com ’era sulle “ piste nere ” che avevano portato alla strage di piazza Fontana del 12 dicembre ’ 69 a Milano .
Ed era il mio scopritore e mentore , diventato l’amico fraterno al quale devo poco meno di tutto .
Saputo che sarei andato in vacanza alle Eolie sulla barca di Mario , Caracciolo mi disse divertito : “ Vai a Lipari e guarda com’è bella e strana la miniera di pietra pomice che ha sventrato il monte Pilato ” .
Ci andai .
E gli portai in regalo un pezzo di pietra pomice che lui tenne a lungo sul cruscotto o nel porta oggetti della sua auto .
Un piccolo legame quindi un po ’ abrasivo …
Alle Eolie ci andai subito , ma a Milano solo a marzo dell ’anno dopo .
Se dovevo andar via da Padova , città cui ero molto legato , preferivo andare a Roma , dove c’erano Mario , Paolo Mieli e altri de L’Espresso con i quali avevo legato , anziché a Milano dove non conoscevo nessuno .
Ma Caracciolo e Zanetti erano perché andassi a Milano , dove uno come me serviva di più che a Roma .
A dicembre saltai il fosso .
Mi dimisi da caposervizio del Mattino di Padova fidandomi della parola di Zanetti e Caracciolo , ai quali si era unito Scalfari , lui però più che altro perché desiderava sbolognarmi da Repubblica , dove senza mai licenziarmi non mi fece più scrivere perché non avevo seguito il suo “ disinteressato consiglio ” (! ) di non impicciarmi del 7 aprile .
Scoprii così che perfino i miei tre idoli – Eugenio , Livio e Carlo – potevano essere bugiardi e tirare bidoni .
Tutti e tre !
A Milano ci andai sì , ma come collaboratore fisso , quale già ero , però mi piazzarono in redazione : via Cino del Duca 5 , sul bordo di piazza S. Babila .
A Roma c’erano “ i ragazzi di via Po 12 ” , a Milano quelli di via Cino del Duca 5 .
Dopo tre anni Caracciolo mi scodellò finalmente il contratto di redattore , contro il parere di Scalfari , che s’era legato al dito il mio “ gran rifiuto ” ( Beh , non esageriamo ) , ma con l’appoggio di tutta la redazione , con in testa Scialoja e Mieli , pronta a dichiarare sciopero a oltranza se Scalfari non desisteva dal desiderio di trasferirmi-punirmi in Sardegna , nel quotidiano locale del gruppo . .
Che Caracciolo fosse un signore , oltre che un editore di giornali come in Italia non ce ne saranno più , non c’è bisogno che lo dica io .
Ma non ho mai capito la sua amicizia con Federico Umberto D’Amato , l’ex capo dell ’ Ufficio Affari Riservati del ministero dell ’
Interno che lo stesso L’Espresso non aveva esitato a indicare come coinvolto in storiacce molto poco chiare , strage di piazza della Loggia a Brescia compresa e depistaggi della strage di piazza Fontana non esclusi .
Caracciolo diede a D’Amato , che si piccava d’essere un gran gourmet , la rubrica d’arte culinaria de L’Espresso e la direzione della sua guida dei ristoranti italiani .
Mah .
A me , nel mio piccolo , la cosa pareva imbarazzante .
I casi della vita , di cui anche Caracciolo era ovviamente ingordo .
Da qualche parte ho letto che una volta qualcuno chiamò la polizia o i vigili del fuoco perché dalle finestre della propria abitazione aveva visto uscire del fumo da un appartamento di fronte e subito dopo schizzarne fuori , in terrazza , una allegra combriccola di donne e uomini non propriamente molto vestiti , tra i quali vennero individuati dai soccorritori D’Amato e “ un noto editore ” .
Mi piaceva di più l’amicizia di Caracciolo con Cavallo Pazzo , al secolo Mario Appignani , di professione “ indiano metropolitano ” , imbucato presenzialista ubiquitario , materializzatosi perfino sul palco del festival di San Remo , e fornitore di coca alla Roma vitaiola “ de sinistra ” .
Molto diverso da un altro noto fornitore anche di ragazze dall ’approfondimento dell ’amicizia non molto difficile , il finanziere sardo Flavio Carboni invischiato perfino nello scandalo del “ suicidio ” londinese di Roberto Calvi .
Mentre i suoi ospiti si sollazzavano , Carboni scattava di nascosto foto diciamo imbarazzanti .
Ma ricattare o anche solo fare pressioni su Caracciolo era impossibile : non era il tipo chi si abbassava a tanto .
Con un Carboni ci poteva fare al massimo il falò di qualche nottata brava , senza per questo farsi invischiare dai rimasugli della cenere .
Di Caracciolo non ho mai capito il suo far figli un po ’ qua e un po ’ là , ne conosco almeno tre , due donne e un uomo , tutte persone tra loro diversissime anche per carattere , più , leggo in questi giorni , altri due di cui non sapevo nulla .
In totale , cinque : tre maschi e due femmine .
Nessuno riconosciuto da lui come suo e tutti rimasti con le rispettive madri , delle quali nessuna era o diventava sua moglie .
Umberto Eco ha scritto in questi giorni che Caracciolo amava più divertirsi che essere felice .
Come che sia , qui siamo nel campo degli affari suoi privati , e quindi è bene non entrarci .
Del resto , che l’alta borghesia , nobile o meno , abbia metro di giudizio e di vita molto diversi da quelli dei comuni mortali è cosa nota .
Caracciolo amava molto gli scacchi , cosa che fece la fortuna di Gianluigi Melega , collega simpatico e intelligente rimastogli sempre nelle grazie se non altro perché lo allietava a quel gioco di re e regine .
E lui aveva anche un titolo di un principe e uno di duca : principe di Castagneto e duca di Melito .
La sua signorilità era aliena da passioni troppo evidenti , tanto da poter parere , a chi degli esseri umani capisce poco , distaccato e freddo .
Giampaolo Pansa , forse geloso perché a scacchi non ci sapeva fare , di lui su Il Riformista ha scritto : “ A volte anche i principi democratici e di sinistra possono comportarsi da gelidi padroni .
Accadde così quando Carlo Caracciolo , scomparso ieri a 83 anni , decise di licenziare il direttore dell ’ Espresso , Giulio Anselmi .
Lavoravo in via
Po con Giulio e avevo potuto apprezzare quanto fosse bravo .
Il settimanale funzionava , tutto sembrava andare per il meglio .
Poi una sera il Principe invitò a cena Anselmi , nella propria casa romana , davanti all ’Isola Tiberina .
E un attimo prima di sedersi a tavola , gli disse : « Da domani non sarai più il direttore dell ’ Espresso » .
Non volle rivelargli chi avrebbe preso il suo posto .
Soltanto il giorno dopo , Giulio seppe che era Daniela Hamaui , la prima donna a guidare il settimanale ” .
A parte la penultima virgola che non c’entra niente , e la p iniziale di principe ora minuscola ora maiuscola come un palloncino che si gonfia , il prodissimo Pansa , quello del sangue dei vinti “ forse ” perché sono i vincitori di oggi , così prosegue : “ Era il 20 febbraio 2002 , un giorno palindromo .
Con una data che può essere letta al contrario senza cambiare .
Pare sia rarissimo , così giurano gli esperti .
Ma fu altrettanto raro il gesto di Caracciolo .
La mattina successiva , quando Anselmi m’informò del licenziamento , rimasi stupefatto .
Lavoravo per il Principe dal 1° novembre 1977 , data della mia assunzione a Repubblica , ossia da quasi venticinque anni .
E non lo avevo mai visto comportarsi da padrone delle ferriere ” .
Nel mio piccolo , neppure io .
Anzi , quando passò la mano , o meglio le azioni a un altro Carlo , l’ingegner De Benedetti , tutti capimmo che era finita un ’era .
Accade .
Ancor più lo capimmo quando le redazioni passarono a Milano da via Del Duca , a ridosso di S. Babila e delle sue febbri , a via De Alessandri , a ridosso del nulla , e poi a Roma dalla storica via Po all ’anomia e catastale via Colombo .
Accade .
Quando vennero fatti fuori i dirigenti amministrativi e del personale come Milvia Fiorani e Roberto Paris , rimasti sempre semplici e disponibili nonostante la bella carriera , in molti cominciammo a sentirci ancor più pesci fuor d’acqua .
E’ accaduto .
Ho avuto la fortuna sfacciata di vivere tutta la mia vita professionale in un giornale dove lavoravano e vivevano signori di grande levatura anche professionale , il direttore , i colleghi tutti , i dirigenti amministrativi e l’editore .
Una fortuna , ma anche un po ’ una sfortuna .
Le rare volte che mi è stato proposto di cambiare giornale non sono stato capace di farlo perché mi pareva sconveniente .
A parte che per nulla al mondo mi sarei separato da alcuni colleghi amici fraterni , pur se magari nel corso della vita possono essere stati loro a spiccare il volo e ad allontanarsi , in qualunque altra redazione , compresa quella open space e alluminio e vetro di Repubblica , mi sarei sentito a disagio .
Privo di calore umano .
A L’Espresso mi sono sempre sentito a casa mia , nella ma famiglia .
A un certo punto , della “ mia famiglia ” ero però rimasto l’unico .
Accade .
La vita ti supera .
Da L’Espresso si passa a L’espresso .
Carlo Caracciolo è sempre stato la garanzia , discreta e per nulla invadente , che l’ambiente , lo stile e la professionalità de L’Espresso , e credo anche dell ’intero gruppo editoriale , non scendessero mai sotto un certo livello .
Ne derivava per tutti noi che ci lavoravamo un senso di responsabilità non solo professionale .
Per tutto questo gli devo dire grazie .
Ora purtroppo è andato via .
Succede .

Advertisement President Robert Mugabe has said Zimbabwe has contained cholera - as the UN and a UK charity warned the deadly outbreak was getting worse .
Save the Children said : " If anything is certain in the chaos of Zimbabwe today it is that the cholera outbreak is not under control . "
Mr Mugabe also said Western powers were plotting to use cholera as an excuse to invade and overthrow him .
" Now that there is no cholera there is no cause for war , " he said .
See detailed map of cholera - affected areas Mr Mugabe spoke as a district in neighbouring South Africa was declared a disaster area because of the spreading disease , which has killed hundreds in Zimbabwe .
In a nationally televised speech , he said : " I am happy to say our doctors are being assisted by others and the WHO [ World Health Organization ] have now arrested cholera . "
Shall we also say that [ because ] there is mad cow disease , there must be war , Britain must be invaded
President Mugabe
Cholera is ' S African disaster ' South Africa fears cholera spread Failing Zimbabwe : Special report
He went on to denounce former colonial power Britain , as well as French President Nicolas Sarkozy and US President George W Bush , who both called earlier this week for the 84 - year - old to resign .
" Because of cholera , Mr Brown , Mr Sarkozy and Mr Bush want military intervention , " Mr Mugabe said .
He added : " Let 's tell them that the cholera cause does n't exist any more . "
He was speaking in the capital , Harare , at a state funeral for senior ruling party official Elliot Manyika , who died in a car crash over the weekend .
Shortly after Mr Mugabe spoke , the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the toll from the disease had risen slightly overnight to 783 and that 16,403 were believed to have been infected .
But Save the Children in Harare said these figures were an underestimate and the epidemic was almost certainly worsening .
The agency 's Rachel Pounds said on Thursday : " Reliable figures are hard to come by , but there is much evidence out there that this crisis is growing , not diminishing . "
She added : " With even the most basic healthcare on hand , you would expect to see a death rate of only one or two per cent .
In some areas of Zimbabwe a third of those who have contracted the infection are dying . "

The WHO has warned that the total number of cases could reach 60,000 unless the epidemic was stopped .
Hundreds of Zimbabweans have crossed into South Africa to seek medical treatment because Zimbabwe 's health service and water supply infrastructure have virtually collapsed .
At least eight people have died in Limpopo Province , prompting the authorities to declared the Vhembe district which includes the border town of Musina a disaster area .
President Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) have been deadlocked in power - sharing negotiations for several months .
Mr Mugabe also said in Thursday 's speech : " Shall we also say that [ because ] there is mad cow disease , there must be war , Britain must be invaded .
Mr Brown , your head must go for some medical correction . "
" We are not a threat to international peace , not a threat to our region , " he added .
International pressure
There has been growing international pressure recently for Mr Mugabe to step down .
Cholera has spread because of Zimbabwe 's failing health system The UK has led calls for Mr Mugabe to go .
African countries like Botswana and Kenya have also said he should step down , but South Africa has refused to call on Mr Mugabe to quit .
And the 53 - member African Union said on Tuesday the only solution to Zimbabwe 's crisis was the power - sharing talks .
On Monday , European Union nations ramped up the diplomatic pressure on Zimbabwe 's government , broadening sanctions on President Mugabe and his inner circle .
Mr Mugabe and MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai signed a power - sharing deal in September but talks on forming a unity government have stalled as both sides bicker over how to divide control of key ministries .
South Africa , led by former President Thabo Mbeki , has been mediating the negotiations but the MDC has accused him of not putting enough pressure on Mr Mugabe to share power .
The MDC seized a majority in parliament in March elections , when the opposition leader defeated Mr Mugabe in a first round presidential vote .
Mr Tsvangirai pulled out of a June run-off , accusing Mr Mugabe 's party of orchestrating a wave of political violence .

A month ago or so one of the most exciting new feaures of the upcoming Mono 2.2 was introduced : the C# Evaluator .
( Although now , with the new Mono .
SIMD , static compilation and so on , I 'm not sure which one is the most exciting piece anymore ? )
Since then I wanted to blog about it to share my thoughts about the possibilities of this new piece of software .
For the folks being around for a while C# Evaluator probably reminded them the old Windows Scripting Host which allowed us programmers to embed powerful scripting in our applications .
Now , having C# as a scripting language for your own customization purposes opens new paths for innovation and great ideas .
I 'm really eager to include some powerful C# scripting inside Plastic , probably in order to create more powerful workspace selector rules or something like that .
But first I 'll try to tell a little bit about how to play with the C# eval in order to learn how it works .
First thing is to build and set up the latest mono , so let 's start there .
Once Mono 2.0 was releases I set up a OpenSuse 11 box to play around with it .
I was having some trouble building 2.0 on Solaris and OpenSolaris , so having the chance to download and build on Linux was a real pleasure .
So , first I installed OpenSuse 11 with the development tools that can be configured during the installation process .
Then I set up 2.0 downloading it from the official Mono repository ( check the mono website and go to downloads ) .
And then I just downloaded trunk from the mono reposAnd launch the build processNote I generated the binaries on my home dir .
I built everything under / home / pablo / monobin because I still wanted to use official mono 2.0 for regular operations and 2.2 just for testing and development purposes .
In order to use the newly compiled mono 2.2 you just have to set up your MONO_PATH env var : Miguel introduced a sample in his blog post ( http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2008/Sep-10.html) but he did n't tell how to perform an action I consider very interesting : making the script interact with your own classes .
( Of course I bet he did n't do that because it is more than obvious for most of the people out there , but I hope you still find this sample interesting ) .
So , as I said , the real beauty of introducing some scripting in your application is not running simple calculations , but making the script interact with your own internal classes or ad - hoc APIs , right ?
So , here you can find some very simple source code ( the simplest ) showing you how to interact with your own assembly .
Note I 'm adding the current assembly to the script references , and also introducing a using sentence .
How to build the code ?
Easy : And you 're done .
Remember I 've modified both PATH ( to get the new gmcs ) and MONO_PATH !
The proposed investiture of Caroline Kennedy as the replacement senator for Hillary Clinton has inspired a surprising degree of opposition – at least from other claimants to the throne , such as the Cuomos , and from those obstreperous parvenues , the Clintons .
Perhaps less obvious may be a wider disdain expressed by even liberal New Yorkers who feel Kennedy 's elevation may be one celebrity rising too many .
Although the big New York editorial boards are expected to line up , like so many obedient lap dogs , grassroots dissent seethes .
Queens Congressman Gary Ackerman , in a remarkable display of chutzpah , groused : " I do n't know what Caroline Kennedy 's qualifications are except that she has name recognition .
But so does J. Lo . "
Other liberal New Yorkers I have spoken to detest the idea of Kennedy replacing Hillary Clinton – particularly without even having to battle , as she did , through the elective process .
One reporter even spoke of a discernible " populist backlash " against this ultimate insiders ' deal among lower - level pols , reporters and grassroots Democratic activists .
Still , these yelps are not likely to stop the Kennedy juggernaut .
The forces behind Caroline – like moneybags Mayor Michael Bloomberg , Wall Street bagman - in- chief Sen. Charles Schumer – are too powerful and well - heeled to be resisted .
The word is out that dissenting on Kennedy could result in loss of the kind of largesse that can make or break political careers .
The disquiet about her appointment does offer a glimmer of hope about our battered democracy .
It could point toward a backlash against the gentrification of liberalism , the Democratic Party and much of American politics .
Gentry , of course , have been involved in American politics from the earliest time , but generally as a conservative influence tied to the protection of their moneyed interest or privileges .
Of course , some wealthy hierarchs also supported liberal politics .
Perhaps the most important examples were Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt .
Yet if the Roosevelts favored the middle class and the poor , they often did so at the expense of being labeled class traitors by their peers .
In contrast , the current gentry liberals increasingly reflect the biases of their own social class .
The upper echelons of Wall Street , academe and the media have been moving toward what passes for the " left " for over a generation .
Ironically , this movement became most evident in the early 1960s in the elite support that gathered around Caroline 's father , John , who brought with him into office " the best and brightest . "
As historian Fred Siegel has noted , the Kennedy phenomena differed greatly – in both style and substance – from the " lunch pail " liberalism epitomized by President Harry Truman and , to an extent , that of both Lyndon Johnson and his vice president , Hubert Humphrey .
Their Democratic party was sustained by appealing to the economic interests of working and middle - class Americans .
As opposed to gentry politics , whose bastions lay in fashionable urban districts and college towns , Truman - style democracy reached into the vast suburban dreamscape – even into small towns and rural areas .
Over recent years this version of the party , with its more geographically diverse middle - class base , has lost influence .
It 's been a process of both addition and subtraction .
A series of strong Republican politicians since Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan lured many middle - income voters out of the Democratic Party by appealing to their patriotism , economic self - interest and , in some cases , prejudices .
At the same time , the core of the elite liberal constituency – academics , high - tech businesspeople and media figures – has been growing steadily in wealth and influence .
By marrying this constituency to poor minority voters , gentry liberals have turned our core urban areas into a collection of electoral " ditto heads , " with so - called " progressives " winning as much as 70 or 80 % of the vote in presidential elections .
This year 's thrilling primary battle between Sens.
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama represented a clash of these two tendencies .
Although Clinton herself enjoyed strong ties to some gentry liberals , she campaigned , particularly toward the end of the marathon , as Harry Truman in a bright pantsuit .
Obama , for his part , sallied forth from a solid base of academics and well - educated professionals , as well as African Americans .
In first the primary and then the general election , Obama 's growing fundraising advantage stemmed increasingly not from his early base among students and liberal professionals , but from his strong ties to the highest echelons of the gentry .
As we now know , it was big money – hedge funds , Silicon Valley , Hollywood – not small donors who helped propel Obama 's financial juggernaut .
Then it 's not surprising that , so far , the Obama pre-presidency reflects the values of the gentry class .
His appointments in key economic posts have been very much in sync with the Schumer - Robert Rubin Wall Street wing of the party .
Contrary to the hyperventilations of some conservatives , Obama seems as unlikely to confiscate the holders of mega - wealth , inherited or otherwise , as that muddle - headed blueblood , George W. Bush .
If the president - elect looks to raise taxes , a more likely target will be the less - well - heeled small businesspeople , farmers and others who have tended to remain closer to the Republican Party .
These are the people who earn about $ 250,000 a year and may now be demonized as " rich . "
Another source of pain for the middling classes may come from carbon trading , which could boost energy prices .
Indeed , Obama 's most liberal positioning may come on environmental issues , a favorite concern of many gentry liberals .
" Green " politics appeal to these factions in part because it poses little threat to " information " industries like finance , software and entertainment .
Instead the losers will be blue - collar polluting industries – such as traditional energy production , trucking or manufacturing – which have largely remained close to the GOP .
Another arena may be found in new federal initiatives on urban and planning issues .
Many gentry liberals , starting with Al Gore , have long disdained suburban lifestyles that allow most Americans an enviable level of privacy , safety and comfort .
After all , members of the gentry do n't need supports since they can afford both spacious city digs and country retreats .
But it 's not only ideology or cultural preferences that drive the gentry agenda .
Many venture capitalists and investment bankers see a carbon - trading regime and massive subsidies for renewable energy as a potential source of windfall profits .
Yet for all of these synergies , Obama 's embrace of the gentry agenda also poses some longer - term political risks .
For one thing , there 's a growing cadre of congressional Democrats from non-gentry constituencies – the Great Plains , various suburbs and exurbs – who may find the Obama approach both not sufficiently populist and too dismissive of their basic economic concerns .
The patterns of this dissent can be seen in the early opposition among these Democrats to the initial plan for the financial bailout proposed by President Bush and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
It might be further stimulated if the administration seeks to smother fossil fuel , agricultural and industrial development as well as steer the stimulus away from financing the roads and bridges critical to the suburban and rural economies .
For right now , the drive for the Kennedy nomination suggests how powerful , pervasive and even cocky the gentry class has become .
But if the economy worsens and grassroots anger grows , the new president may want to avoid emulating JFK and instead follow another playbook , one oriented toward the middle class and epitomized by Harry Truman – the very same approach that almost helped elect his primary rival and new secretary of State .

Kerry Howley points out that people who treat “ libertarian ” and “ feminist ” as antonyms are , by and large , really fucking dumb :
For some reason , various libertarian - leaning men are only capable of acknowledging the limiting nature of social norms when those norms result from recent political action .
We all worry that universal surveillance breeds passive adults with no expectation of privacy .
We all worry that smoking bans will encourage people to accept the diminution of their choices uncomplainingly .
We all realize that the more the state does , the broader most people think its natural scope to be .
No thinking libertarian is only concerned with coercion ; most of us worry just as much about conformity and passivity in the form of president - worship and war - lust .
It is extremely weird to recognize this sort of social pressure –the ability of government to create limiting expectations and norms of behavior–and then to immediately dismiss claims about the social construction of gender .
States and patriarchies both engender certain patterns of behavior .
Humans with female bodies have been dumped into a particular social category with various limiting assumptions , and they ’re right to struggle against them .
If Todd wants to argue that women are n’t oppressed because they accept their assigned roles , he ’d better be willing to accept the idea that governmental authority is not oppressive because most people do n’t complain .
Libertarians spend an enormous amount of time telling people that they are , in fact , oppressed .
We do n’t call it “ consciousness raising ” when we explain why you ought to be able to shoot up while selling your kidney to a sex worker , but that ’s what it is .
Marco Mayeux , 42 , the bartender of Le Relais , a Paris cafe in the 18th Arrondissement , said the ban alone had cut his coffee and bar business by 20 percent .
Image Nathalie Guérin opened her cafe in Saulieu two years ago , but this summer business started to droop .
 It s been in free fall ,  she said .

“ A place like mine does n’t appeal to everyone ; it ’s very working - stiff , ” he said .
“ There is a coffee - at - the - counter feel that is n’t attractive anymore . ”
Before , clients would go inside a cafe , have a coffee , a cigarette and another coffee .
But now they go out to smoke , and sometimes they do not come back , many cafe owners said .
Gérard Renaud , 57 , owner of the Restaurant de L’Église in Marsannay - la - Côte , said that business was down at least 30 percent .
“ Now people do n’t eat , ” he said .
“ They come in for a coffee or a little aperitif and that is it .
We are used to being busy , but now we feel lazy , and it is depressing . ”
Ms. Guérin is trying to sell her cafe , but has had only one nibble in this lovely town of some 3,000 people , much visited by tourists , where the renowned hotel - restaurant Relais Bernard Loiseau is just down the street .
Jean - Louis Humbert is the district director of the Federation of Cafes , Brasseries and Discotheques , and he is blunt about Ms. Guérin ’s chances .
“ It ’s finished for her , ” he said .
“ No one wants to buy it .
The banks do n’t want to lend her any more money , and it will end up in liquidation . ”
Daniel Perrey , 57 , owner of the Café du Crucifix in Crimolois , blamed social change , saying : “ Sadly , it is the end to a way of life .
The culture is changing , and we feel it . ”
Three dimensional drawing nothing new – the concept itself dates back to the Greeks in the 5th Century BC – but employing perspectival techniques on such a huge scale and with such a broad scope is a much more recent innovation .
Some 3D street art takes up dozens of feet of sidewalk to create illusions of depth and three - dimensionality while other mural works cover the entire sides of twelve - story buildings .
More than just a change in scale there has been a shift in how a third dimension is applied .
Today it is used for everything from architectural illusions to street graffiti tags .

ABC News has an article about a sociologist at Rutgers University who questioned 157 scientists about “ their work at the crux of a 2003 political clash between several members of Congress , a Christian lobbyist group called the Traditional Values Coalition and the National Institutes of Health ” and found , not surprisingly , that TVC ’s rabble - rousing put enough pressure on them that “ nearly a quarter of respondents said they either modified their studies to seem less controversial or abandoned controversial grant proposals . ”
I was particularly impressed by this statement by Andrea Lafferty , executive director of Traditional Values Coalition , who admits that she sees no “ abuses of science ” but plans to continue her crusade against science nonetheless :
Andrea Lafferty , executive director of Traditional Values Coalition ( TVC ) in Washington , D.C. , sees no “ abuses of science ” but agrees that with the new administration , the content of grant proposals is likely to expand .
“ My main idea is the NIH ATM machine is going to re-open in 09 , ” said Lafferty .
“ It ’s some guys in their jammies at universities drinking beer asking , ‘ hey , how can we study how prostitutes spread disease ? ’
Then they take it to the NIH ” … “ NIH has always been treated like a sacred cow … scientists overall do n’t believe in God , and they do n’t want to be questioned , ” she said .
“ These people want to say it ’s just TVC but you take what we find is being studied , go to any grocery store and ask people what they think .
Taxpayers would be outraged . ”
So the NIH is primarily just a slush fund for drunken , PJ - clad atheists looking for a way to consort with prostitutes ?
How come I did n’t know about this ?
More importantly , how do I apply for a grant ?
MUSIC NEWS - FALL OUT BOY members PETE WENTZ and PATRICK STUMP were nearly arrested on Monday , Dec 15 in NYC after they attempted an improptu acoustic concert to promote FOB 's new Folie a Deux album .
They set up gear in Greenwich Village 's Washington Square Park in NYC and thrilled passers - by with an unplugged set of FALL OUT BOY hits .
But their performing was n't received well by the NYPD ; they were told to stop by police , and were threatened with arrest if they continued to play without first obtaining a street performance permit .
According to NYC column PageSix , Wentz considered ignoring the threat , but was advised by his advisors to obey the cops .
The publication reports , " They improvised and did one song with Patrick singing a cappella and Pete Wentz doing air guitar .
The crowd was into it .
" After they sang the a cappella song , Pete went over to his guitar case like he was going to say ' Screw it ' and just get out his guitar and start playing , but his manager , or his security , or some man on his team told him , ' No , Pete , do n't do it - you can't !
The guys were allowed to sing without instruments ( guess that 's still legal to do in NYC ) , so the publicity stunt show went on , briefly though , as planned .
Folie a Deux was released this week , to mixed reviews ( LA Times , 2 1/2 stars ) and is available from MNN .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The man dubbed the " Taliban American " is asking the president to commute the remaining years of his federal prison sentence , according to a statement released by his attorneys Wednesday .
John Walker Lindh is hoping that President Bush will commute the rest of his 20 - year sentence .
John Walker Lindh , a 27 - year - old Californian , has served seven years of a 20 - year sentence after being captured in Afghanistan in 2001 .
He joined the Taliban to fight in the country 's civil war one month before the U.S. - led invasion of Afghanistan , according to the statement .
He originally was indicted on 10 charges , including conspiring to kill American citizens , but the U.S. Justice Department dismissed terrorism - related charges in 2002 .
Lindh pleaded guilty to serving in the Taliban army and carrying weapons while fighting the U.S. - backed Northern Alliance .
Along with the plea , he signed a gag order that prevented him from doing interviews .
His lawyers say Lindh never fought against American forces and received a harsher sentence because sentencing occurred after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks in New York , Washington and rural Pennsylvania .
Lindh 's attorneys say he arrived in Afghanistan on September 6 , 2001 .
At a news conference Wednesday in San Francisco , California , Lindh 's parents called on President Bush to show mercy for their son .
Watch Lindh 's parents ask for mercy on their son »
" This is the Christmas season , and it's a time for mercy , " said Lindh 's mother , Marilyn Walker .
His father , Frank Lindh , said his son , who grew up in California and converted to Islam as a teenager , " is a Muslim .
He will always , I think , be a Muslim . "
His parents repeated their contention that Lindh went abroad to study Islam , found himself in Afghanistan in a civil war and joined the Taliban with no intent to support terrorism or fight against his homeland .
They believe that the post - September 11 charges of terrorism , which were subsequently dismissed , spurred public reaction against Lindh that resulted in the 20 - year sentence .
" Our son never fought against American forces , " his mother said .
" He did not participate in terrorist activities of any kind .
...
John made a mistake in joining the Afghan army at a time when their government was controlled by the Taliban .
He has admitted that this was a mistake . "
Lindh 's attorneys said he is at a medium - security prison in Terre Haute , Indiana .
The elder Lindh said his son has been treated " very humanely " in the federal prison system .
" Quietly and in a good way , he has served his seven years , " Frank Lindh said .
" No matter what your perspective on this case , we think everyone should agree that seven years is enough . "
Lindh 's attorneys said that previous commutation appeals to the Bush administration have gone unanswered , but his father said Lindh 's family holds out hope that Bush will act before leaving office .
" All of these events occurred while President Bush was in office , " Frank Lindh said .
" This is on his plate .
I 'd like to think we 'll get a response from President Bush this time . "
Appearing before a U.S. district judge in 2002 , Lindh said he " made a mistake by joining the Taliban " and " had I realized then what I know now about the Taliban , I would never have joined them . "
" Life is making choices and living with the consequences , " U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis told Lindh during the sentencing .
" You made a bad choice to join the Taliban . "

At issue in the S.E.C. ’s lawsuit is Mr. Cuban ’s sale in June 2004 of shares in Mamma.com , a small Internet search engine based in Canada , whose corporate name is now Copernic .
Mr. Cuban had purchased 600,000 shares , or a 6.3 percent stake , just three months earlier as the stock was soaring .
The share price tripled over a two - day period in early March on volume that totaled more than 12 times the number of outstanding shares .
That prompted an S.E.C. investigation that ended without charges being filed .
Scott W. Friestad , the S.E.C. ’s deputy director of enforcement , said the investigation of Mr. Cuban ’s trading began in early 2007 , but declined to say what had set off the inquiry .
On June 28 , 2004 , Mr. Cuban called Mamma.com ’s chief executive after receiving an e-mail message from the executive , who told him of a planned stock offering and asked if he would like to invest .
Such offerings often depress share prices , at least temporarily .
According to the complaint , Mr. Cuban was told the information was confidential .
After the conversation , the chief executive wrote to the company ’s chairman in an e-mail message : “ As anticipated , he initially ‘ flew off the handle ’ and said he would sell his shares ( recognizing that he was not able to do anything until we announce the equity ) . ”
But within minutes of the call Mr. Cuban began selling his shares , and completed the sales on June 29 , according to the lawsuit , fetching an average of $ 13.24 a share .
The next day , after the offering was announced , Mamma.com stock opened at $ 11.89 , sparing him a $ 750,000 loss .
By July 8 , the shares had plummeted to $ 8 .
On Monday , the stock closed at 28 cents .
“ Mamma.com entrusted Mr. Cuban with nonpublic information after he promised to keep the information confidential , ” Mr. Friestad said .
“ Less than four hours later , Mr. Cuban betrayed that trust by placing an order to sell all of his shares .
It is fundamentally unfair for someone to use access to nonpublic information to improperly gain an edge on the market . ”

I have all these cool things I want to write about , but I broke my thumbnail .
Can you tell that 's a long story ?
See , this summer I got excited about playing guitar again .
I usually switch between all - guitar and all - piano every other year or so .
This summer I dusted off the guitars and learned a bunch of pieces , and even composed one .
I was prepping for — among other things — a multimedia blog entry .
It was going to have a YouTube video , and a detailed discussion of a wacky yet powerful music programming language you 've probably heard of but never used , and generally just be really cool .
And then it all came crashing down when I busted my thumbnail off .
And I mean off — it broke off at least a quarter inch below where the nail and skin meet .
Ick .
I just accidentally jabbed my steering wheel , and that was that .
I remember reading an interview with some dude who said he had punched a shark in the nose .
He said it was like punching a steering wheel .
So now I know more or less what it 's like to punch a shark in the nose , I guess .
There 's always an upside !
Anyway , that was going to be my magnum opus ( literally : Op. 1 ) for the year , but it fell through for now .
I 'll have to revisit the idea next year .
My thumbnail 's back , but it 's been at least 2 months since I touched my guitar , so I 'll have to start over again .
Work has been extraordinarily busy , what with having to collect all these Nuka - Cola Quantum bottles and so on .
I 'm sure you can imagine .
So I have n't had much time to blog lately .
But I do like to publish at least once a month , whether or not anyone actually cares .
It 's been about a month , or it feels that way anyway , and all I have to show for it is this box of Blamco Mac and Cheese .
So I 'm cheating this month .
You know how on Halloween how you walk around in your costume holding your little bag and you say " trick or treat " , and every once in a while some asshole does a trick instead of dumping half a pound of candy into your bag ?
And then he has to explain to all the dumbfounded and unhappy kids that " Trick or Treat " means that a trick is perfectly legal according to the semantics of logical - OR , and the kids remember that a -hole for the rest of their childhoods and avoid his house next year ?
Yeah .
So I 'm doing a trick this time .
Hee .
It 's actually kind of fun when you 're on the giving end .
My trick is this : in lieu of saying anything meaningful or contemporarily relevant , I 'm writing about something I did over a year ago .
And there is n't much to say , so this really will be short .
Around a year ago , I wrote a blog called Stevey 's Boring Status Update , mostly in response to wild rumors that I 'd been fired from Google .
Not so .
Not yet , anyway .
In that blog I mentioned I was working nights part - time ( among other things ) on a JavaScript interpreter for Emacs , written entirely in Emacs Lisp .
I also said I did n't have a name for it .
A commenter named Andrew Barry suggested that I shouldcall it Ejacs , and the name stuck .
Ejacs is a port of Narcissus .
Narcissus is a JavaScript interpreter written in JavaScript , by Brendan Eich , who by pure unexpected coincidence is also the inventor of JavaScript .
Narcissus is fairly small , so I thought it would be fun to port it to Emacs Lisp .
It turns out Narcissus is fundamentally incomplete .
It cheats .
It 's that trick guy on Halloween .
Narcissus has a working parser and evaluator , but for its runtime it calls JavaScript .
So it 's kind of like saying you 're building a car by starting from scratch , using absolutely nothing except for a working car .
This meant I wound up having to write my own Ecma - 262 runtime , so that the evaluator would have something to chew on .
In particular , the Ecma -262 runtime consists of all the built - in properties , functions and objects : Object , Function , Array , String , Math , Date , RegExp , Boolean , Infinity , NaN , parseInt , encodeURIComponent , etc .
A whole bunch of stuff .
I basically did this by reading the ECMA - 262 specification and translating their algorithms into Emacs - Lisp .
That spec is lousy for learning JavaScript , but it 's absolutely indispensable if you 're trying to implement JavaScript .
I did n't know Emacs - Lisp all that well before I started , but boy howdy , I know it now .
Emacs actually has a pretty huge runtime of its own — bigger than you would ever , ever expect given its mundane title of " text editor " .
Emacs has arbitrary - precision mathematics , deep Unicode support , rich Date and Calendar support , and an extensive , fairly complete operating system interface .
So a lot of the porting time was just digging through Emacs documentation ( also extensive ) looking for the Emacs version of whatever it was I was porting .
That was nice .
I had big plans for Ejacs .
I was going to make it a full - featured , high - performance JavaScript interpreter , with all the Emacs internals surfaced as JavaScript native host objects , so you could write Emacs customizations using object - oriented programming .
It was totally going to be the " meow " part of the cat .
And then I broke my thumbnail .
Actually , what happened was js2 - mode .
After I got the interpreter working , I was at this crossroads .
There were two big use cases : a JavaScript editing mode , or a JavaScript Emacs development mode .
Both were going to be a lot of work .
It turns out you really want the editing mode first , if possible , so that when you 're doing all your JavaScript programming you have a decent environment for it .
So I picked the editing mode .
Unfortunately I found the Ejacs parser was n't full - featured enough for my editing needs , since at the time I was working on my Rhino - based Rails clone and writing tons of JavaScript 1.7 code on the JVM .
I spent a little time trying to beef up the parser , then realized it would be a lot faster to just rewrite it by porting Mozilla Rhino 's parser , which is ( only ) about 2500 lines of Java code .
Ejacs is something like 12,000 lines of Emacs - Lisp code , all told , so that did n't seem like a big deal .
So I jumped in , only to find that while the parser is 2500 lines of code , the scanner is another 2000 lines of code , and there 's another 500 or so lines of support code in other files .
So I was really looking at porting 5000 lines of Java code .
Moreover , the parse tree Rhino builds is basically completely incompatible with the Ejacs parse tree .
It was richer and more complex , and needed more complicated structures to represent it .
So after I 'd ported the Rhino parse tree , what I really had was a different code base .
I went ahead and finished up the editing mode , or at least enough to make it barely workable ( another 5000 lines of code ) , and launched it .
It was a surprisingly big effort .
And it left poor Ejacs lying unused in the basement .
So today , faced with nothing to write about , I figured I 'd dust off Ejacs , launch it with lots of fanfare , and then you 'd hardly notice that I cheated you .
Right ?
You 're not coming to my house next year .
I can tell already .
Anyway , here 's the code : http://code.google.com/p/ejacs/
There 's a README and a Wiki and installation instructions and stuff .
I can't remember how to put the code in SVN , and I 'm having trouble finding it on the code.google.com site .
As soon as I figure it out I 'll also make it available via SVN .
In the interests of having something resembling original worthwhile content today , I 'll do a little comparison of Emacs Lisp and JavaScript .
I know a lot about both languages now , and a few folks mentioned that a comparison would be potentially interesting .
Especially since I think JavaScript is a better language .
So ... the best way to compare programming languages is by analogy to cars .
Lisp is a whole family of languages , and can be broken down approximately as follows :
This succinct yet completely accurate synopsis shows that all Lisps have their attractions , and yet each also has a niche .
You can choose a Lisp for the busy person , a Lisp for someone without much time , or a Lisp for the dedicated hobbyist , and you 'll find that no matter which one you choose , it 's missing the library you need .
Emacs Lisp can get the job done .
No question .
It 's a car , and it moves .
It 's better than walking .
But it pretty much combines the elegance of Common Lisp with the industrial strength of Scheme , without hitting either of them , if you catch my drift .
Anyway , here 's the comparison .
Here 's why I think JavaScript is a better language than Emacs Lisp .
A recurring theme is that Elisp and JavaScript both will both exhibit a particular problem , and there are specific near - term plans to fix it in JavaScript , but no long - term plans to fix it in Elisp .
It 's easier to resign yourself to a workaround when you know it 's temporary .
If you know the language is going to be enhanced , you can even design your code to accommodate the enhancements more easily when they appear .
People are working on improving JavaScript .
It 's not happening quite as fast as I 'd hoped earlier this year , but it 's still happening .
As far as I know , Emacs Lisp is " finished " in the sense that no further evolution to the language is deemed necessary by the Emacs development team .
Every symbol in Emacs - Lisp is in the global namespace .
There is rudimentary support for hand - rolled namespaces using obarrays , but there 's no equivalent to Common Lisp 's , making obarrays effectively useless as a tool for code isolation .
The only effective workaround for this problem is to prefix every symbol with the package name .
This practice has become so entrenched in Emacs - Lisp programming that many packages ( e.g. and theelisp profiler ) rely on the convention for proper operation .
The main adverse consequence of this problem in practice is program verbosity ; it makes Emacs - Lisp more difficult to read and write than Common Lisp or Scheme .
It can also have a non-negligible impact on performance , especially of interpreted code , as the prefix characters can approach 5 % to 10 % of total program size in some cases .
The problems run slightly deeper than simple verbosity .
Without namespaces you have no real encapsulation facility : there is no convenient way to make a " package - private " variable or function .
In practice there 's little problem with program integrity ; it 's hard for an external package to change a " private " variable inadvertently in the presence of symbol prefixes .
However , it makes it annoyingly difficult for users of the package to discern the " important " top - level configuration variables and program entry points from the unimportant ones .
Elisp attempts a few conventions here , but it 's a far cry from real encapsulation support .
JavaScript also lacks namespaces .
They 're being added in ES / Harmony , but in the meantime , browser JavaScript code typically uses the same name - prefixing practice as Emacs - Lisp .
However , JavaScript has lexical closures , which provide a mechanism for creating private names .
One common encapsulation idiom in browser JavaScript is to wrap a code unit in an anonymous lambda , so that all the functions in the code unit become nested functions that close lexically over the top - level names in the anonymous lambda .
This trick is nowhere near as effective in Emacs - Lisp , for several reasons : Some elisp code ( e.g. much of the code in cc- engine ) prefers to work around the namespace problem by using enormous functions that can be thousands of lines long , since let - bound variables are slightly better encapsulated .
Even this is broken by elisp 's dynamic scope :
So let - bound variables in elisp can still be destroyed by your callee : a dangerous situation at best .
Emacs is basically one big program soup .
There 's almost no encapsulation to speak of , and it hurts .
One of the big advantages to object - oriented programming is that there is both syntactic support and runtime support for automatic delegation to a " supertype " .
You can specialize a type and delegate some of the functionality to the base type .
Call it virtual methods or prototype inheritance or whatever you like ; most successful languages support some notion of automatic delegation .
Emacs Lisp is a lot like ANSI C : it gives you arrays , structs and functions .
You do n't get pointers , but you do get garbage collection and good support for linked lists , so it 's roughly a wash .
For any sufficiently large program , you need delegation .
In Ejacs I wound up having to implement my own virtual method tables , because JavaScript objects inherit from ( and in some cases , , which inherits from ) .
Writing your own virtual method dispatch is just not something you should have to do in 2008 .
I wrote about this at length in a recent blog post , The Universal Design Pattern .
JavaScript is fundamentally a properties - based language , and it 's really nice to be able to just slap named properties on things when you need a place to store data .
Emacs
Lisp only offers properties in the form of simple plists – linked lists where the odd entries are names and the even entries are values .
Symbols have plists , and symbols operate a little bit like very lightweight Java classes ( in that they 're in the global namespace ) , but that only gets you so far .
If you want the full JavaScript implementation of the Properties Pattern , you 'll have to write a lot of code .
And so I did .
Your implementation choice for object property lists has a huge impact on runtime performance .
Emacs has hashtables , but they 're heavyweight : if you try to instantiate thousands of them it slows Emacs to a crawl .
So they 're no good for the defaultproperty list .
Emacs also has associative arrays ( alists ) , but their performance is O ( n ) , making them no good for objects with more than maybe 30 or 40 properties .
I wound up writing a hybrid model , where the storage starts with lightweight alists , and as you add properties to an object instance , it crosses a threshold ( I set it to 50 , which seemed to be about right from profiling ) , it copies the properties into a hashtable .
This had a dramatic increase in performance , but it was a lot of work .
I experimented with using a splay tree .
I implemented Sleater and Tarjan 's splay tree algorithm in elisp ; Ejacs comes with a standalonethat you can use in your programs if you like .
I was hoping that its LRU cache - like properties would help , but I never found a use case where it was faster than my alist / hashtable hybrid , so it 's not currently used for anything .
And then in the end , after I was done with my implementation , it was a library ( at least from the Emacs - Lisp side of the house ) .
It was n't an object system for Lisp .
It 's only really usable inside the JavaScript interpreter , where it has syntactic support .
You really want syntactic support .
Sure , people have ported subsets of CLOS to Emacs Lisp , but I 've always found them a bit clunky .
And even in CLOS it 's hard to implement the Properties Pattern .
You do n't get it by default .
CLOS has lots of support for compile - time slots and virtual dispatch , but very little support for dynamic properties .
It 's not terribly hard to build in , but that 's my point : for something that fundamental , you do n't want to have to build it .
One of the great strengths of JavaScript is theextension .
I do n't know if they support it over in IE - land ; I have n't been a tourist there in a very long time .
But in real versions of JavaScript , every object can serialize itself to source , which can then be eval 'ed back to construct the original object .
This is even true for functions !
A function in JavaScript can print its own source code .
This is an amazingly powerful feature .
In Emacs Lisp , some objects have first - class print representations .
Lists and vectors do , for instance : But in Emacs Lisp , many built - in types ( notably hashtables and functions ) do NOT have a way to serialize back as source code .
This is a serious omission .
Also , trying to print a sufficiently large tree made entirely ofs will crash Emacs , which caused me a lot of grief until I migrated my parse tree to use a mixture of defstructs and lists .
Note that simply typing the name of a defstruct , or passing over it ephemerally in the debugger , will cause Emacs to try to print it , and crash .
Fun .
The problem of polymorphic debug - printing ( or text - serialization ) is , I think , a byproduct of Emacs not being object - oriented .
If you want a debug dump of a data structure , you write a function to do it .
But Emacs provides a half - assed solution : it debug - prints lists very nicely , even detecting cycles and using the #-syntax for representing graph structures ( as does SpiderMonkey / JavaScript ) .
But it has no useful debugging representation for hashtables , functions , buffers or other built - in structures , and there 's no way to install your own custom printer so that the debugger and other subsystems will use it .
So it sucks .
Printing data structures in Emacs just sucks .
The situation in Ecma - 262 - compliant JavaScript really is n't that much better , although you can at least install your ownon the built-ins .
But any competent " server - side " JavaScript implementation ( i.e. one designed for writing real apps , rather than securely scripting browser pages ) has a way to define your own non-enumerable properties , so you can usually override the default behavior for things likeandAnd all else being equal , at least JavaScript functions print themselves .
Pound for pound , Emacs Lisp seems roughly as expressive as JavaScript or Java for writing everyday code .
It should n't be that way .
Emacs
Lisp ought to be more succinct because it 's Lisp , but it 's incredibly verbose because of the namespace problem , and it's also verbose to the extent that you want to use the properties pattern without worrying about alist or hashtable performance .
Elisp does have a few places where it shines , though .
One of them is the ( Common Lisp emulation ) package , which provides a whole bunch of goodies that make Elisp actually usable for real work .
Defstruct and the loop macro are especially noteworthy standouts .
Some programmers are still operating under the ( ancient ? legacy ? ) assumption that thepackage is somehow deprecated or distasteful or something .
They 're just being silly ; do n't listen to them .
Practicality should be the ONLY consideration .
Thepackage would n't have been possible without macros .
JavaScript has no macros , so even though it has better support for lambdas , closures , and even ( in some versions ) continuations , there are still copy / paste compression problems you can't solve in JavaScript .
Emacs Lisp has , which makes up for a LOT of its deficiencies .
However , it really only has one flavor .
Ideally , at the very least , it should support reader macros .
The Emacs documentation says they were left out because they felt it was n't worth it .
Who are they to make the call ?
It 's the users who need them .
Implementer convenience is a pretty lame metric for deciding whether to support a feature , especially after 20 years of people asking for it .
Elisp is s-expression based , which is a mixed bag .
It has some advantages , no question .
However , it fares poorly in two very common domains : object property access , and algebraic expressions .
JavaScript is NOT s-expression based ( or it would n't be a successful language , many would argue ) , but it does offer some of the benefits of s-expressions .
JSON is one such benefit .
JavaScript 's declarative object literals ( or as a Lisp person would say , " syntax for hashes " ) and arrays provide a powerful mechanism for designing and walking your own declarative data structures .
JavaScript also has all the usual ( which is to say , expected ) support for algebraic operators .
And unlike Java , JavaScript even got the precedence right , so it 's not full of redundant parentheses .
In the end , it comes down to personal choice .
I 've now written at least 30,000 lines of serious code in both Emacs Lisp and JavaScript , which pales next to the 750,000 or so lines of Java I 've crapped out , and does n't even compare to the amount of C , Python , assembly language or other stuff I 've written .
But 30,000 lines is a pretty good hunk of code for getting to know a language .
Especially if you 're writing an interpreter for one language in another language : you wind up knowing both better than you ever wanted to know them .
And I prefer JavaScript over Emacs Lisp .
That said , I suspect I would probably prefer Clojure over Rhino , if I ever get a chance to sit down with the durn thing and use it , so it 's not so much " JavaScript vs. Lisp " as it is vs. Emacs Lisp .
I would love to see Emacs Lisp get reader macros , closures , some namespace support , and the ability to install your own print functions .
This reasonably small set of features would be a huge step in usability .
However , for the nonce I 'm focusing on JavaScript .
I 've found that JavaScript is a language that smart people like .
It 's weird , but I keep meeting really really smart people , folks who ( unlike me ) are actually intelligent , and they like JavaScript .
They 're always a little defensive about it , and almost a little embarrassed to admit it .
But they think of it as an elegant , powerful , slightly flawed but quite enjoyable little language .
I tell ya : if you 're a programming language , it 's a very good thing to have smart people liking you .
It does n't make me smart , but I kinda like it too .
Even though there 's ( still ) a lot of hype these days about Java , and people tootling on about how Java 's going to be the next big Web language ...
I just do n't see it happening .
There are too many smart people out there who like JavaScript .
So enjoy the interpreter .
Ejacs is just a toy , but I think it also shows a kind of promise .
Scripting Emacs using JavaScript ( if anyone ever actually implements it ) could be really interesting .
It could open up the world 's most powerful , advanced editing environment to millions of people .
Neat .
In the meantime , it does n't actually do squat except interpret EcmaScript in a little isolated console , so do n't get your hopes up .
Reminder — here 's the Ejacs URL : http://code.google.com/p/ejacs - enjoy !
And with that , I 'm off to find some Nuka - Cola Quantum .
I just wish those bastards had n't capped me at level 20 .
According to bankrate , the 10 features listed below add a lot of value to your home .
Based on my recent purchase of a new construction single - family home , I have added my comments for each of these features .
1 . An updated kitchen
When we visited the model home , we really liked the granite counter tops , new appliances ( that got me excited too ! ) , lot of cabinets for storage , and an island in the center of the kitchen .
The island is can be used for more counter top space as well as a small eat - in area .
For my wife , this was the biggest selling point of the home .
2. Modern bathrooms
This is an important one .
The master bathroom must have double bathroomsandmore .
co.uk Painted Oak Units .
That means , you and your partner each have their own space with a sink to get ready .
Modern bathrooms also have a separate jetted bath tub and shower area .
Modern light fixtures are a plus .
3 . A well - appointed master suite
For me , the master suite was the selling point .
A master suite must , at least , have enough space for a king size bed , dresser and 2 night stands .
Separate space for a sitting area , tray ceiling , crown molding at to the value .
4. Natural materials
In floor coverings , especially bathrooms or kitchens , look for ceramic tile or wood rather than linoleum .
If you have carpet , it should be a good product and well - maintained .
5. Curb appeal
Again very important .
When you come home from work , your home ’s appearance should be a welcome sight .
Nicely trimmed lawn area and uncluttered driveway go a long way in achieving good appeal .
6 . A light , airy spacious feel
There should be enough light and cross air ventilation coming into the house .
Being of Indian origin , we always consider a home where the front door faces the southwest direction .
7. Good windows
The house should have a lot windows .
All windows must be properly insulated .
Personally I prefer to have blinds on all the windows .
Well - placed skylights are also a good touch to add value .
Unfortunately , I do n’t have any in my house .
8. Landscaping
Always have a well manicured lawn .
A few plants wont hurt either .
We are planning to have our back yard fenced for added privacy .
I would n’t mind having a swing , but that means less play area for my daughter .
9 . Lots of storage
You could n’t go wrong with an over sized garage , some attic space and plenty of closets .
We have a good sized 2 car garage , but we currently just have one car .
So more storage space for us .
10 . Basement
Having a finished basement adds even more value .
Basements add a lot to your resale value .
Unfortunately , we do n’t have a basement .

Be an angel , dear , and fix my bra .
December 15 , 2008 By Peter
Scott Dutton ’s wife complained that the semi-circular struts would slip out from under the cups of her bra .
Instead of mumbling , “ Oh , really ? ” and continuing to focus on whatever guy - thing he was doing at the time , Scott came up with a permanent fix for his wife and scored a gold medal for Invention of the Year at the British Invention Show .
The Bra Angel bra repair kit was also selected from more than 200 other inventions to be included in the GMTV show and the BBC’s The One Show .
So much for the applause .
If Scott wants to make a success of his invention , he ’ll have to support his creative brilliance with cool , marketing smarts .
From all the descriptions I could find , the world ’s first underwire bra repair kit seems to work like this :
You remove the offending underwire , slip on a cap that is barbed like a fishhook , and slip the capped wire back into its channel .
It ca n’t slip out now , because the barbs hold it in place .
I wonder if Barry Dutton is a fisherman , because his invention reminds me of something that popped up a few years ago called the Wunder Boner .
Look carefully at its commercial and you ’ll see that both inventions involve pushing a hooked device through an opening .
The Duttons of Barry , South Wales , will be able to sell their Bra Angel repair kit for only a limited time .
If it catches on , smart bra-makers will incorporate a version of it into all their bras , or at least into their “ no - slip underwire ” versions .
So to make the most of their brief window of opportunity , the Duttons need an unforgettable TV commercial .
The Wunder Boner spot has all the necessary elements of marketing success :
1. a slice of life
2. a clear product demonstration
3. just the right amount of adolescent humor
There ’s gold in life ’s little annoyances , when you get up and do something about them .
But you have to stick with it .
Invention is only the first half of the deal .
Luckily we have benchmark work like the Wunder Boner to point us in the right direction .

Waging protracted IW depends on building global capability and capacity .
IW will not be won by the United States alone but rather through combined efforts with multinational partners .
Combined IW [ Irregular Warfare , euphemism for TERRORISM ] will require the joint force to establish a long - term sustained presence in numerous countries to build partner capability and capacity .
This capability and capacity extends U.S. operational reach , multiplies forces available , and provides increased options for defeating adversaries .
The constituent activities of IW are : Insurgency .
COIN .
. UW .
Terrorism
CT .
FID .
Stability , security , transition , and reconstruction ( SSTR ) operations .
Strategic communication ( SC ) .
PSYOP .
. Civil - military operations ( CMO ) .
Information operations ( IO ) .
Intelligence and counterintelligence ( CI ) activities .
Transnational criminal activities , including narco - trafficking , illicit arms dealing , and illegal financial transactions that support or sustain IW .
Law enforcement activities focused on countering irregular adversaries .
1 - 22 .
The above list of operations and activities can be conducted within IW ; … – Headquarters , Department of the Army , Army Special Operations Forces Unconventional Warfare , September 2008 [ PDF ]
In a ‘ manual ’ which is officially to be released only to ‘ students from foreign countries on a case - by - case basis only ’ , the US Army outlines a program of what it now calls ‘ irregular warfare ’ , in fact US state sponsored terrorism , insurgency , and PSYOPS .
Ignoring 1 ) the mountainous body of evidence that US policy and the CIA , specifically , is the root - cause of the vast majority of the what is commonly called ‘ world terrorism ’ ; and 2 ) the equally impressive body of hard evidence that 911 was an inside job , the Army cites 911 as the pretext by which the US should embark above the policy as outlined above .
[ See : Terrorism is Worse Under GOP Regimes ]
1 -18 .
The 9/11 terrorist attack on the United States highlighted the increased danger of warfare conducted by other - than - state enemies .
Recognizing that such irregular threats by nonstate actors would be a likely and even dominant pattern throughout the 21st century , national policy makers dictated that planners must analyze and prepare for such irregular threats .
It was clear that previous assumptions about the terms “ conventional , ” “ traditional , ” or “ regular ” warfare , and reliance solely on a “ regular ” or “ conventional warfare ” doctrine were inadequate .
IW was a significant theme in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review Report .
In April 2006 , the Pentagon drafted the execution roadmap for IW as a means of combating this growing threat from actions beyond conventional state - to - state military conflict .
– Headquarters , Department of the Army , Army Special Operations Forces Unconventional Warfare , September 2008 [ PDF ]
Elsewhere , the document cites the threat posed to the US by “ WMD — such as nuclear , chemical , or biological weapons .
But I have yet to find a single word , phrase , sentence or paragraph in which the manual mentioned the threat posed the rest of the world by some forty years or more of US meddling , threats , covert operations , US sponsored assassinations , and overt threats of bombing and / or war and invasion .
Instead , we get platitudes that are made absolutely meaningless by the remainder of this arrogant , imperialistic document .
A - 64 .
Democracy and the protection of fundamental liberties were the basis for the creation of the United States more than 200 years ago .
Since then , a central goal of U.S. foreign policy has been to promote respect for democracy and human rights throughout the world .
The DOS — ..
Promotes democracy as a way to achieve security , stability , and prosperity for the entire world .
..
Helps establish and assist newly formed democracies .
op cit
It is odd that as the US is said to be ‘ defending ’
Democracy , it is subverting it .
It is said that the United States must be concerned about the possibility that terrorists may acquire WMD , ignoring the fact that the US leads the world in the manufacture , sale and distribution of WMD .
Let ’s put this another way : the US military spending is greater than that spent by the rest of the world ’s nations combined .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
If terrorists should ever obtain WMD , the chances are good that they will get them from the US , perhaps with monies raised selling cocaine to the one of the largest drug dealers on the planet Earth : the CIA !
During the 40s and 50s , most of the public was unaware of what the CIA was doing .
Those who knew thought they were fighting the good fight against communism , like James Bond .
However , they could not keep their actions secret forever , and by the 60s and 70s , Americans began learning about the agency ’s crimes and atrocities .
( 3 ) It turns out the CIA has : Corrupted democratic elections in Greece , Italy and dozens of other nations ;
Been involved to varying degrees in at least 35 assassination plots against foreign heads of state or prominent political leaders .
Successful assassinations include democratically elected leaders like Salvador Allende ( Chile ) and Patrice Lumumba ( Belgian Congo ) ; also CIA - created dictators like Rafael Trujillo ( Dominican Republic ) and Ngo Dinh Diem ( South Vietnam ) ; and popular political leaders like Che Guevara .
Unsuccessful attempts range from Fidel Castro to Charles De Gaulle .
Helped launch military coups that toppled democratic governments , replacing them with brutal dictatorships or juntas .
The list of overthrown democratic leaders includes Mossadegh ( Iran , 1953 ) , Arbenz ( Guatemala , 1954 ) , Velasco and Arosemena ( Ecuador , 1961 , 1963 ) , Bosch ( Dominican Republic , 1963 ) , Goulart ( Brazil , 1964 ) , Sukarno ( Indonesia , 1965 ) , Papandreou ( Greece , 1965 - 67 ) , Allende ( Chile , 1973 ) , and dozens of others .
Undermined the governments of Australia , Guyana , Cambodia , Jamaica and more ;
Supported murderous dictators like General Pinochet ( Chile ) , the Shah of Iran , Ferdinand Marcos ( Phillipines ) , “ Papa Doc ” and “ Baby Doc ” Duvalier ( Haiti ) , General Noriega ( Panama ) , Mobutu Sese Seko ( Ziare ) , the “ reign of the colonels ” ( Greece ) , and more ;
Created , trained and supported death squads and secret police forces that tortured and murdered hundreds of thousands of civilians , leftists and political opponents , in Guatemala , Honduras , El Salvador , Haiti , Bolivia , Cuba , Mexico , Uruguay , Brazil , Chile , Vietnam , Cambodia , Thailand , Iran , Turkey , Angola and others ;
Helped run the “ School of the Americas ” at Fort Benning , Georgia , which trains Latin American military officers how to overthrow democratic governments .
Subjects include the use of torture , interrogation and murder ;
Used Michigan State “ professors ” to train Diem ’s secret police in torture ;
Conducted economic sabotage , including ruining crops , disrupting industry , sinking ships and creating food shortages ;
Paved the way for the massacre of 200,000 in East Timor , 500,000 in Indonesia and one to two million in Cambodia ;
Launched secret or illegal military actions or wars in Nicaragua , Angola , Cuba , Laos and Indochina ;
Planted false stories in the local media ;
Framed political opponents for crimes , atrocities , political statements and embarrassments that they did not commit ;
Spied on thousands of American citizens , in defiance of Congressional law ;
Smuggled Nazi war criminals and weapon scientists into the U.S. , unpunished , for their use in the Cold War ;
Created organizations like the World Anti-Communist League , which became filled with ex-Nazis , Nazi sympathizers , Italian terrorists , Japanese fascists , racist Afrikaaners , Latin American death squad leaders , CIA agents and other extreme right - wing militants ;
Conducted Operation MK - ULTRA , a mind - control experiment that gave LSD and other drugs to Americans against their will or without their knowledge , causing some to commit suicide ;
Penetrated and disrupted student antiwar organizations ;
Kept friendly and extensive working relations with the Mafia ;
Actively traded in drugs around the world since the 1950s to fund its operations .
The Contra / crack scandal is only the tip of the iceberg –- other notorious examples include Southeast Asia ’s Golden Triangle and Noreiga ’s Panama .
Had their fingerprints all over the assassinations of John F. Kennedy , Robert F. Kennedy , Martin Luther King , Jr. , and Malcom X . Even if the CIA is not responsible for these killings , the sheer amount of CIA involvement in these cases demands answers ; [ editor ’s note , see : Evidence That the CIA Murdered RFK
: And then routinely lied to Congress about all of the above .
The Association for Responsible Dissent estimates that by 1987 , 6 million people had died as a result of CIA covert operations .

— Steve Kangas : The Origins of the Overclass
The US Army document , cited above , is an arrogant , imperialistic and ill - considered response to a growing ‘ threat ’ –but a threat that is posed only to US monopolists and death merchants , i.e. , the Military / Industrial Complex , a fancy name for Murder , Inc .
The US has , in fact , squandered the limitless goodwill that had been extended our nation at the end of World War II .
The US has failed to make positive use of the world support for allied efforts to codify war crimes , to hold Nazi War Criminals responsibility for heinous crimes .
But now –we have a recent US military document that the US Army would prefer to keep secret no doubt because it reveals to the world that those principles espoused at Nuremberg are either no longer operative or they were a fraud , the US did n’t really mean it .
Or perhaps they forgot to tell the world that the laws applied to everyone but themselves .
The Army has now revealed to the world that no nation is safe from US terrorism , US attack , US subversion of indigenous cultures and governments , US bullying or the US use of WMD against them .
That is because the US believes itself to be a world - wide empire , in fact , a single nation that presumes to rule the world .
The well - informed countries –western Europe – know perfectly well what our game is .
General de Gaulle took France out of NATO because he suspected that we were in the empire–building business , and he did n’t want to go along with it yet , simultaneously , France remained an ally in case there was a major war with the Soviets .
I do n’t think we should take too seriously those eastern European countries .
In due course , they will wake up , as Turkey did , that we are dangerous .
– Gore Vidal , The Erosion of the American Dream
I have repeatedly stated that the US regime of George W. Bush was not legitimate .
How can I make it any clearer ?
“ Illegitimate ” means that the regime of George W. Bush was no more legitimate than the crooked regimes of tin horn dictators in banana republics .
The Bush regime differed little in terms of competence or statesmanship .
Now , in a cynical document that the US Army had never intended be disseminated publicly , we have confirmation that the position of the US vis a vis the rest of the world is based not upon Democracy or legitimacy .
It is , rather based entirely upon force , aggression and US terrorism .
Addendum :
Is the United States going to put dictatorship into effect under the guise of the anti-terrorist struggle ?
What may trigger another major transformation in 2009 ?
The answer is obvious : another 9/11 in the USA .
Terrible and bloody events are in store for the world in the beginning of 2009 .
Most likely , the world will witness a reality show with a nuclear blast , which will be used as a reason for the US administration to change the world order again and leave the new Great Depression behind .
There is every reason to believe that the Russian Federation may suffer as a result of this possible initiative too .
Joe Biden made a sensational statement on October 19 , 2008 .
He said that Barack Obama would have to undergo an ordeal during the first six months of his stay in the White House .
It will be the time of a very serious international crisis , when Obama would have to make tough and possibly unpopular decisions both in home and foreign politics .
Biden said that there were four or five scenarios for the development of the international crisis .
Afghanistan , North Korea or the Russian Federation may become the source of one of them .
When Obama learned of Biden ’s speech , he tried to explain everything with rhetorical exaggerations .
However , Biden ’s remarks gave food for thought , taking into consideration the fact that former secretary of state Madeleine Albright described his remarks as statement of fact .
— USA needs nuclear explosion to turn the world into dictatorship
Addendum :
A comment amond several found on Buzzflash re this article :
But we already knew the US under sociopathic Bush is a terrorist nation .. Bush , Rumsfeld , Rice , Hannity , Limbaugh , Cheney , Bolton , et al are all implicators in this world terrorism by threatening Iraq and Iran .
It is certainly a terror to the Iraqui / Iranian people by the US .
My response is that it will be argued in ‘ defense ’ of the GOP that Bush , Rice et al were just an ‘ aberration ’ .
But the SIGNIFICANCE of the Army document is that they were NOT an aberration .
It ’s the MIC S.O.P .
As I have said numerous times : the Bush administration is illegitimate .
Secondly , the MIC is a polite euphemism for a Murder Inc on an international , industrial scale .
Death and destruction are the US ’s chief exports .
Our currency is all but worthless and , like Rome when it invaded Dacia for its gold , the US invades other nations for its resources , primarily oil .
At last , The US resembles Rome in that Rome subverted ‘ fair wages ’ with ‘ slavery ’ , in effect , putting working people out of work for good !
It became a permanent ‘ underclass ’ .
The US has accomplished the same thing by enriching ONLY the uppper one percent of the population –a disparity of both wealth and income that clearly parallels that of Rome in its last throes .

ATHENS , Greece ( CNN ) --
The Greek government was struggling to bring violent protests under control Wednesday , five days after they were sparked by the police killing of a teenager .
Riot police face protesters in Athens Wednesday as debris burns in the streets .

Athens announced aid for small businesses but demonstrators continued to stage standoffs and riots in the Greek capital , while workers held a long - planned strike in one of the city 's main squares .
Greek police confronted protesters outside the parliament building after days of rioting that have brought the city to a standstill and threatened the government 's hold on power .
A lawyer for the officers accused of killing the teenager said Wednesday that a ballistics test showed the policeman had not fired directly at the 15 - year - old .
The bullet ricocheted off another object before hitting Alexandros Grigoropoulos in the chest , attorney Alex Kougias said .
The family of the boy , who was buried Tuesday , has called in its own investigators to verify state findings , the Athens coroner told CNN .
Watch crowds gather for the funeral »
The shooting happened in a restive Athens neighborhood after six young protesters pelted a police patrol car with stones .
Grigoropoulos was shot as he tried to throw a fuel - filled bomb at the officers , police said .
Striking union members condemned what they called " the cold - blooded murder of the young Alexander , " as they demanded higher wages , a ban on mass layoffs by companies receiving government assistance , and the doubling of government funding for education , health and welfare programs .
Meanwhile , the mayor of Athens appealed for calm along with help in returning the city to normal , while the government released a statement saying everyone bears responsibility for restoring order .
So far , however , the Greek leadership has appeared unable to quell the violence and there is growing pressure on the government to resign .
Watch how the unrest could cause a crisis »
Saturday 's shooting , which sparked the riots , was only one reason for the days of unrest .
Many
Greeks were already angry over how the government was run , allegations of corruption , the state of the economy and a lack of jobs .
Protesters outside parliament hurled stones and projectiles , some of them on fire , at a line of police dressed in green uniforms , white helmets , and armed with shields .
The police occasionally advanced but did not respond .
But the violence then spread to other areas , with students responsible for much of the disorder , according to Achilles Popas , a reporter for Greek station Skai TV .
The students hurled petrol bombs and caused a lot of damage in the city center , where shattered glass covered the ground , Popas told CNN .
Police responded by using tear gas , Popas said .
They appeared to be trying to keep their distance from the protesters but the clashes continued , he added .
Wednesday 's strike went ahead despite a plea from Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis to hold off amid the violence .
Banks , schools , and hospitals were closed and transportation was at a halt with urban buses and the Athens subway shut .
Many local and international flights were canceled .
Karamanlis condemned the " destructive fury and brutal violence " of the protesters .
" The rioters , with their acts , once again , demonstrated that the only thing that inspires them is the destruction , " the prime minister said in a statement .
" They have targeted social peace , the rule of law , and democracy itself .
That is why they are isolated . "
Karamanlis said the violence has affected businesses , especially small ones already suffering from the economic downturn .
He announced a series of measures to help merchants recover , including reimbursement for losses , direct financial assistance , 15 - year loans , and suspended debts .
Athens Mayor Nikita Kaklamani asked all Athens residents to buy something from the shops as a symbolic show of support .
" The city wants a smile , it wants hope .
We will provide it , because this must be Athens ' fate , " the mayor said in a statement .
" We will defend its history , its cultural heritage , the fortunes of our fellow citizens and , above all , human lives . "
In his statement , Karamanlis said the government was acting responsibly and he called on all political parties to work together .
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakogiannis tried to spread the blame for the broad dissatisfaction .
" The central responsibility of managing a difficult crisis undoubtedly remains with the elected government of a land , " Bakogiannis said in a statement issued Wednesday .
" However , I would like to stress no one is without responsibility , ( including ) political parties and institutions .
A share of the responsibility for order , the city 's economic life , remains with us all . "
Opposition leaders have blasted the government amid the unrest .
The leader of the left - wing opposition party SYRIZA has called for protesters to topple the government , but Karamanlis ruled out early elections .

Did Alcohol Prohibition Reduce Alcohol Consumption and Crime ?
It is commonly alleged that alcohol prohibition during the 1920s greatly reduced alcohol consumption and also reduced the crime related to alcohol .
See for example , the description given in Chapter 6 - Role of Tobacco and Alcohol in the Drug Legalization Debate from " Drug Legalization : Myths and Misconceptions " by the U.S. Department of Justice Drug Enforcement Administration .
It is a question that comes up so often that it has become necessary to create a guide which examines these assertions .
Judge for yourself from some of the most prominent studies and original documents from that time .
Table of Contents
Alcohol Use Decreased Back to Table of Contents
1 ) " First , use of alcohol decreased significantly during Prohibition .
104
This decrease in turn lead to a marked decrease in the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver .
105 Finally , the suicide rate also decreased by 50 % . 107 "
That statement is , at best , misleading .
In truth , nobody really knows exactly how much alcohol consumption increased or decreased during Prohibition .
The reason was simple enough -- people like Al Capone did n't pay taxes on their product and thereby report their production to the government .
Licensed saloons became illegal speakeasies , and many common citizens took advantage of the high sales price of illegal booze by secretly manufacturing booze in their own bathtubs .
That 's one of the major problems with all drug prohibitions -- they greatly reduce the ability to make accurate judgments about the problem .
There is no good way to count the number of illegal dealers , or the people who are secretly making gin in their own bathroom .
Therefore , to make such a judgment , we have to rely on a number of indirect indicators .
By the greatest majority of indicators , the biggest drops in alcohol consumption and alcohol problems actually came before national prohibition went into effect .
Those drops continued for about the first two years of Prohibition and then alcohol consumption began to rise .
By 1926 , most of the problems were worse than they had been before Prohibition went into effect and there were a number of new problems -- such as a drinking epidemic among children -- that had not been there before .
The statement of Andrew Furuseth before Congress in 1926 describes what happened in the opening years of Prohibition :
When the prohibition amendment was passed and the Volstead Act was enacted , about three months after that I came through Portland , Oreg .
Now there is a certain district in Portland Oreg .
where there is the so - called employment district --- it is usually amongst the working people , called the " slave market " --- and I was the most astonished man you ever saw .
Before that I had seen drunkenness there , dilapidated men , helpless , and in any condition that you do not want to see human beings .
This time , three months after this act was passed there was an entire change .
The men walked around from one place to another looking for employment , seamen and others .
And they were sober .
And they looked at the conditions , and they said , " No , we will wait a little . "
There was more independence amongst them than I had ever seen before .
That very class which is the worst and lowest class that we know of amongst the seamen and workingmen .
And I became an ardent advocate of the Volstead Act .
Two years afterwards I came through the same identical place , staying in Portland for about three days , and went to the very same place for the purpose of looking at the situation , and the condition was worse than it had been prior to the passage of the law .
As long as the prohibition legislation was enforced , could be enforced , as long as the bootlegging element had not been organized , and not get the stuff , everything looked well .
But the moment that they could get it they got it .
And they will find it when nobody else can .
They will find it somewhere .
If it is to be bought in the vicinity any where they will find it .
And the condition is worse than it ever was , because the stuff that they drink is worse than ever .
Testimony of Andrew Furuseth , President of the International Seamen 's Union of America , The National Prohibition Law , Hearings before the Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary , United States Senate , Sixty - Ninth Congress , April 5 to 24 , 1926 "
Charts and Graphs
Deaths due to Alcohol , Cook County 1910 - 1926 shows alcohol - related deaths in Cook County before and during the first few years of Prohibition .
It is evident that , taking the country as a whole , people of wealth , businessmen and professional men , and their families , and , perhaps , the higher paid workingmen and their families , are drinking in large numbers in quite frank disregard of the declared policy of the National Prohibition Act .
The Present Condition as to Observance and Enforcement from Report on the Enforcement of the Prohibition Laws of the United States by the National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement ( Wickersham Commission Report on Alcohol Prohibition )
The figures published by the Department of Commerce in the Statistical Abstract of the United States reflect a different picture .
The average annual per capita consumption of hard liquor from 1910 - 1914 , inclusive , was 1.46 proof gallons .
" This 5 - year period was before the rise of abnormal conditions coincident to the World War and may be taken as fairly indicative of the normal rate of drinking that prevailed in the Pre- Prohibition era " ( Rosenbloom , 1935 : 51 ) .
The per capita rate for the Prohibition years is computed to be 1.63 proof gallons .
This is 11.64 % higher than the Pre-Prohibition rate ( Tillitt , 1932 : 35 ) .
Based on these figures one observer concluded : " And so the drinking which was , in theory , to have been decreased to the vanishing point by Prohibition has , in fact , increased " ( Tillitt , 1932 : 36 ) . . . . .
Deaths from Alcoholism .
In New York City , from 1900 through 1909 , there was an average of 526 deaths annually attributable to alcoholism .
From 1910 through 1917 , the average number was 619 .
It plummeted to 183 for the years 1918 through 1922 .
Thereafter , the figure rose , averaging a new high of 639 for the years 1923 through 1927 ( Rice , ed. , 1930 : 122 ) .
Total deaths from alcoholism in the United States show a comparable trend , with the gradual increase resuming somewhat earlier , about 1922 ( Brown , 1932 : 61 , 77 ; Feldman , 1927 : 397 ; U.S. Department of Commerce , 1924 : 55 ) .
Year Deaths from all causes rate per 100,000 Deaths from alcoholism rate per 100,000 1910 1,496.1 5.4 1911 1,418.1 4.9 1912 1,388.8 5.3 1913 1,409.6 5.9 1914 1,364.6 4.9 1915 1,355.0 4.4 1916 1,404.3 5.8 1917 1,425.5 5.2 1918 1,809.1 2.7 1919 1,287.4 1.6 1920 1,306.0 1.0 1921 1,163.9 1.8 1922 1,181.7 2.6 1923 1,230.1 3.2 1924 1,183.5 3.2 1925 1,182.3 3.6 1926 1,222.7 3.9 1927 1,141.9 4.0 1928 1,204.1 4.0 1929 1,192.3 3.7
The highest death rates from alcoholism occurred during the decade prior to Prohibition as did the highest death rates from cirrhosis of the liver .
These statistics should be qualified by the observations of Dr. Charles Morris , Chief Medical Examiner for New York City : " In making out death certificates ( which are basic to Census Reports ) private or family physicians commonly avoid entry of alcoholism as a cause of death whenever possible .
This practice was more prevalent under the National Dry Law than it was in preprohibition time " ( Tillitt , 1932 : 114-115 ) .
. . .
The law could not quell the continuing demand for alcoholic products .
Thus , where legal enterprises could no longer supply the demand , an illicit traffic developed , from the point of manufacture to consumption .
The institution of the speakeasy replaced the institution of the saloon .
Estimates of the number of speakeasies throughout the United States ranged from 200,000 to 500,000 ( Lee , 1963 : 68 ) .

Nixon , March , 1972 Now , I say that the prohibition law , the Volstead Act , is not in effect , simply because you can procure , if you have got the price , almost anything you want to drink at almost any place , in the better , hotels , in the clubs , in saloons––– not so called to - day .
Only within a couple of weeks I was in one of the larger cities––– in fact , the largest city of our country––– and I was invited to go to a club with some gentlemen , and I went there , and there was everything that represented the old - time barroom , with its bar , with its rail for your feet and a man mixing drinks , and everything going in first - class shape .
I recite this because it may interest some of the old timers .
Not a very long - distance walk from that place was another place where they were not so particular who came in .
And as one who has observed things generally , a close student of human affairs , it struck me that the whole thing was a farce––– that something had to be done .

You will find that the workingmen of this country , 90 per cent of them , are either making wines , beer or whisky out of every known vegetable and fruit that exists .
Everyone has his own special concoction .
They even make wine out of parsnips and such stuff .

Everywhere we , went there was plenty of distilled liquor , but seldom real beer .
We found that the homes of the people had been turned into breweries and distilleries which turned out dangerous decoctions that if drunk to any extent would ruin the health of those who drank them .
When asked why they drank such stuff they said there was nothing else to be obtained , and they invariably asked when were Members of Congress going to realize that the manufacture and sale of beer would make for true temperance .
Women as well as men were , interested in such questioning .

Drinking by Children Increased
Drinking at an earlier age was also noted , particularly during the first few years of Prohibition .
The superintendents of eight state mental hospitals reported a larger percentage of young patients during Prohibition ( 1919 - 1926 ) than formerly .
One of the hospitals noted : " During the past year ( 1926 ) , an unusually large group of patients who are of high school age were admitted for alcoholic psychosis " ( Brown , 1932:176 ) .
In determining the age at which an alcoholic forms his drinking habit , it was noted : " The 1920 - 1923 group were younger than the other groups when the drink habit was formed " ( Pollock , 1942 : 113 ) .

I have been told that before prohibition we had a saloon at every corner ; since prohibition we have a distillery in practically every home , and only lately , in one of the exclusive suburban towns near Newark they have discovered the so - called community distillery , where all of the people living on one block club together and contribute to the making of synthetic gin , which is then distributed pro rata among those that were contributors to that weekly .
I want to say that in my duties as secretary I come in contact with people of classes all walks of life , but particularly among the workers in different sections of the State .
Thousands of them that I have been personally acquainted with , that I knew have never touched hard liquor before prohibition , drink it now and make it in their own home , and in consequence they not alone pollute their own home but contaminate their wives and children in that respect .

" Inability of the prohibition law to enforce prohibition is causing an increase in the number of young boys and girls who become intoxicated , " declared Judge H. C. Spicer of the juvenile court at Akron , Ohio , a short time ago when two boys , aged 15 and 16 years , respectively , were arraigned before him .
" During the past two years , " he added " there have been more intoxicated children brought into court than ever before . "

Pauline Sabin 's concern over prohibition grew slowly .
Initially she favored the Eighteenth Amendment , explaining later , " I felt I should approve of it because it would help my two sons .
The word - pictures of the agitators carried me away .
I thought a world without liquor would be a beautiful world . " "
Gradually , however , intertwined motherly and political concerns caused her to change her mind .
Her first cautious public criticism of prohibition came in 1926 when she defended Wadsworth 's opposition to the law .
By 1928 she had become more outspoken .
The hypocrisy of politicians who would support resolutions for stricter enforcement and half an hour later be drinking cocktails disturbed her .
The ineffectiveness of the law , the apparent decline of temperate drinking , and the growing prestige of bootleggers troubled her even more .
Mothers , she explained , had believed that prohibition would eliminate the temptation of drinking from their children 's lives , but found instead that " children are growing up with a total lack of respect for the Constitution and for the law . " "
In later statements , she elaborated further on her objections to prohibition .
With settlement workers reporting increasing drunkenness , she worried , " The young see the law broken at home and upon the street .
Can we expect them to be lawful ? " "
Mrs. Sabin complained to the House Judiciary Committee : " In preprohibition days , mothers had little fear in regard to the saloon as far as their children were concerned .
A saloon - keeper 's license was revoked if he were caught selling liquor to minors .
Today in any speakeasy in the United States you can find boys and girls in their teens drinking liquor , and this situation has become so acute that the mothers of the country feel something must be done to protect their children . " "
Chapter 7 - Hard Times , Hopeful Times from Repealing National Prohibition by David Kyvig
Organized labor has ever been engaged in promoting temperate drinking and was making great p rogress until the enactment of the Volstead law .
The continuation of such laudable activities now constitute a national crime .
Millions of homes , in the majority of which liquor was never seen , have been turned into breweries and distilleries .
The youth of the land is being reared in the atmosphere of disregard for law and lack of confidence in government .
Former law - abiding citizens see nothing wrong in drinking and even in distilling liquor or making home - brew .
Men and women who never drank before now seek it openly .
The pocket flask may be found in almost every store and is never absent from any meeting , dinner , or dancing party .
Young and old alike do not regard the Volstead law as of sane legislative expression under the eighteenth amendment but as an impression of fanaticism clothed in the form of law . . .
Beer drinking has been forced to give way to whisky and near whisky and other poisonous concoctions .
The observance of the Volstead law is in its breach and its virtue in disregard for law .
Bribery of officials in so far as the enforcement law is concerned is no longer looked upon as a detestable criminal offense .
. . .
Private morals and personal conduct can not he controlled , much less advanced , by fiat of law .
Appeal for a higher morality and improved conduct must be directed to the mind and conscience of the people , not to the fear of government .

I think it has resulted in the death of hundreds of men who would be good , valuable citizens to - day if they had not put poisonous hard liquor into their systems . "

( T) he membership of the New York State Federation of Labor are of opinion that nothing that has ever transpired has so set back true temperance in America as the eighteenth amendment and the Volstead Act .
I have had occasion to travel quite extensively , not alone in the State of New York but throughout the United States , and I have seen things in that time that , if they had been seen prior to prohibition the people of this country would have been dumbfounded .
In New York City , and in the several cities of the State of New York , I have had occasion to attend parties such as banquets , dinners , and social gatherings .
And I have been invited to practically all of them , I might say , and I have never seen one yet that you could call dry .
. . .
But before I come to the unorganized question , I want to state one thing :
In the meetings of our local unions , if a man appeared before prohibition , if a man dared to appear under the influence of liquor prior to this legislation , why , he would be ostracized .
He would be a man they would not care to associate with .
But what is the situation now ?
He is a hero if he comes in .
It is nothing new now to see them passing the flask around at union meetings , something that was never done before , and something that would never have been tolerated before prohibition .
But now the question is asked " Where did you get it ? "
And they will say " How good is it ? "
And so forth and so on .
. . .
I have been to places where it was not an unusual occurrence at all to see a young girl take out her pocketbook flask of whisky and hand it around to her chums and associates .
I have seen this on more than one occasion .
And I belong to an institution in New York that we organized , and we were in a first - class hotel at a gathering , and I had occasion to go to the lavatory , the gentlemen 's lavatory and I was astounded to see there three young girls with three men , and they were drinking out of a flask and handing it around .

I am informed that Mrs. White , who is the manager of the Elizabeth Peabody Settlement House , situated in Boston , can testify as to the injurious effect which has been brought about by prohibition upon the poor people of the district in which the Elizabeth Peabody House is situated .
That she has had 15 years ' experience in the district --- 9 years before prohibition and 6 years since .
That she will state that neighborhood dances have had to be abandoned on account of the hip - pocket flasks filled with liquor brought by boys to these dances and disseminated by them .
She can also testify to the fact that many families previously in very poor circumstances have become fairly well to do as the result of having gone into the bootlegging business on a small scale .
That conditions throughout the settlement are worse from the point of view of morals than at any time before prohibition .
. . .
I am informed that she will testify that women who used to suffer from the evils of drinking in pre-Volstead days are now suffering worse evils as the result of prohibition .
That liquor formerly sold in saloons is now sold direct from the homes in which it is made .
That children who never were curious about alcohol are now familiar with it and the form of moral looseness that its use leads to .
That a number of high schools have discontinued holding their dances as they have so much trouble with liquor carried by the boys in hip - pocket flasks that parents and neighbors complain that the well - behaved pupils are being corrupted And last I request you to subpoena M. B. Wellborn , governor , Federal Reserve Bank , Atlanta , Ga. , requiring his appearance this week before this committee .
I am informed that Mr. Wellborn , in a letter requested by Congressman Upshaw on March 3 , states that when he came to Atlanta 11 years ago with the Federal reserve bank that he found there many saloons that sold beer exclusively .
That these saloons were well - conducted and that no drunkenness or excessive drinking resulted from them .
That he had been in Atlanta for 11 years and is satisfied from his own observations that drinking is now almost universal , not only in Atlanta but in every town in Georgia .
That his observations are not confined strictly to the rich and well - to - do , but that nearly every family has whisky in their home .

Prohibition did not increase crime Back to Table of Contents
3 ) " A second reason why Prohibition was a successful program is due to the fact that it did not -- contrary to popular myth -- cause an increase in the crime rate .
It is true that there was an increase in the homicide rate during Prohibition , but this is not the same as an increase in the overall crime rate .
Furthermore , the increase in homicide occurred predominantly in the African - American community , and African - Americans at that time were not the people responsible for alcohol trafficking .
108 The drama of Elliot Ness and Al Capone largely was just that , drama sensationalized by the media of the time . "
The references above have already shown that common people who had never been involved in crime before engaged in criminal activity after alcohol prohibition started .
But there is far more evidence of a Prohibition crime wave than just those references .
This chart shows that there were steep increases in both homicides and prisoners in custody during Prohibition .
Homicide Rate and Receipt of Prisoners 1910 - 1987 shows the number of people sent to prisons also rose during Prohibition .
While a good deal of that rise was due to alcohol prohibition ( see the charts linked below ) a good deal of it was also due to prohibition of opiates and cocaine which had occurred just before alcohol prohibition .
For example see this NY Times article from 1920 .
The following charts show elements of increased crime that were the direct result of alcohol prohibition :

Prohibition was the most lawful period in US history Back to Table of Contents
4 ) " It was the most lawful period in US history , " says Watters of Australia , but prohibition did n't work because , unlike heroin , alcohol was an integral part of the social fabric .
He stresses his views are his own and not shared by all ANCD members .
But at age 67 , as the son of an alcoholic and after a lifetime of helping addicts , he figures he knows what he 's talking about .
This quote comes directly from Miranda Devine 's op - ed piece , " It Pays To Be Tough on Drugs " .
First , let me point out that Watters statement contradicts itself .
If Prohibition was " the most lawful period in US history " how is it that it did n't work ?
Alcohol as integral part of the social fabric
I also find it interesting when someone argues that " prohibition did n't work because , unlike heroin , alcohol was an integral part of the social fabric . "
Just to give this issue some perspective , let 's consider that , in the US , alcohol typically kills around 100,000 people per year , while heroin kills only a couple of thousand .
On any scale of measurement of problems to society , alcohol wins hands down over heroin -- always has , always will .
If heroin was killing 100,000 people per year , would Brian Watters then consider that heroin was an integral part of the social fabric and , therefore , worthy of legalization ?
But , in making such a statement , Mr. Watters inadvertently reveals the true historical reasons for drug prohibitions .
What are those reasons ?
It is obvious that protecting public health and safety really is n't the purpose of drug prohibition laws .
If it was , then the toughest penalties would be on alcohol and tobacco which , combined , kill more people in the US every year than all the people killed by all the illegal drugs combined in about the last century .
If prohibition laws were really to protect public health and safety then a good cigar should get you five years in prison .
It really is n't about morality , either .
The prohibitionists talk about the degradation that comes to the lives of those addicted to illegal drugs .
Heroin addiction is not pretty but in truth , it is n't any more degrading to be a heroin addict than an alcohol addict .
Both addictions are a disgusting way to live and likely to cause massive problems in your life .
Again , if morality was really the issue , then there would have to be tough penalties against alcohol .
So what 's the issue ?
The issue really comes down to racism and prejudice .
The drugs that are legal have always been the preferred drugs of the ruling class -- usually composed of Anglo - Saxon white males .
It does n't really have anything to do with which drugs are more dangerous -- the exemption of alcohol and tobacco from all the drug laws make that point obvious .
It is because some people we do n't like use those other drugs to get the same intoxication the ruling class gets from alcohol .
Professor Charles Whitebread relates that idea in a most humorous and effective manner in his short history of the marijuana laws .
My interest is in criminal prohibitions and , for my purposes , as a criminal law scholar , we could have used any prohibition -- alcohol prohibition , the prohibition against gambling that exists still in many states .
How about the prohibition in England from 1840 to 1880 against the drinking of gin ?
Not drinking , just gin -- got it ?
We could have used any of these prohibitions .
We did n't .
We chose the marijuana prohibition because the story had never been told -- and it is an amazing story .
We could have used any of these prohibitions .
We could have used the alcohol prohibition .
The reason we did n't is because so much good stuff has been written about it .
And are you aware of this ?
That every single -- you know how fashionable it is to think that scholars can never agree ? --
Do n't you believe that --
Every single person who has ever written seriously about the national alcohol prohibition agrees on why it collapsed .
Why ?
Because it violated that iron law of Prohibitions .
What is the iron law of Prohibitions ?
Prohibitions are always enacted by US , to govern the conduct of THEM .
Do you have me ?
Take the alcohol prohibition .
Every single person who has ever written about it agrees on why it collapsed .
Large numbers of people supported the idea of prohibition who were not themselves , opposed to drinking .
Do you have me ?
What ?
The right answer to that one is Huh ?
Want to hear it again ?
Large numbers of people supported the idea of prohibition who were not themselves , opposed to drinking .
Want to see it ?
Let me give you an example , 1919 .
You are a Republican in upstate New York .
Whether you drink , or you do n't , you are for the alcohol prohibition because it will close the licensed saloons in the City of New York which you view to be the corrupt patronage and power base of the Democratic Party in New York .
So almost every Republican in New York was in favor of national alcohol prohibition .
And , as soon as it passed , what do you think they said ?
" Well , what do you know ?
Success .
Let 's have a drink . "
That 's what they thought , " let 's have a drink . "
" Let 's drink to this . "
A great success , you see .
Do you understand me ?
Huge numbers of people in this country were in favor of national alcohol prohibition who were not themselves opposed to drinking .
I just want to go back to the prohibition against the drinking of gin .
How could a country prohibit just the drinking of gin , not the drinking of anything else for forty years ?
Answer :
The rich people drank whiskey and the poor people drank what ? -- gin .
Do you see it ?
Let 's try the gambling prohibition .
You know when I came to Virginia , this was a very lively issue , the gambling prohibition .
By the way , I think it 's a lively issue in California .
Are you ready for it ?
Have you ever seen the rhetoric that goes around the gambling prohibition ?
You know what it is .
Look , we have had a good time .
We have been together yesterday , we have been together today , I have known a lot of you guys for ages .
How about after the talk , we have a minute or two , let 's go on up to your room and we will play a little nickel , dime , quarter poker .
Want to play some poker this afternoon ?
Why not ?
It 's a nice thing to do .
Would we be outraged if the California State Police came barreling through the door and arrested us for violation of California 's prohibition on gambling ?
Of course we would .
Because , who is not supposed to gamble ?
Oh , you know who is not supposed to gamble -- them poor people , that 's who .
My God , they will spend the milk money .
They do n't know how to control it .
They can't handle it .
But us ?
We know what we are doing .
That 's it .
Every criminal prohibition has that same touch to it , does n't it ?
It is enacted by US and it always regulates the conduct of THEM .
And so , if you understand that is the name of the game , you do n't have to ask me , or any of the other people which prohibitions will be abolished and which ones wo n't because you will always know .
The iron law of prohibitions -- all of them -- is that they are passed by an identifiable US to control the conduct of an identifiable THEM .
We can see this issue over and over in the reasons for the original passage of these laws .
For example , the first laws against opium in the US were really attempts to discriminate against Chinese immigrants who smoked opium .
( Chapter 6 - Opium smoking is outlawed , Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs , 1972 ) Cocaine was outlawed largely because of fears that superhuman Negro Cocaine Fiends would go on a violent rampage and rape white women and shoot white men .
( " Negro Cocaine Fiends , New Southern Menace " , NY Times , Feb. 8 , 1914 ) Marijuana was outlawed because " All Mexicans are crazy and marijuana is what makes them crazy . "
History of the Non-Medical Use of Drugs in the US , by Professor Charles Whitebread .
For a good summary of that history , I always recommend The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs
We have already seen above that homicides , prisoners , Volstead Act prosecutions , illegal production of alcohol by ordinary citizens , arrests for drunkenness , and a host of other crimes increased dramatically during Prohibition .
But that is far from the end of the story .
Here are just a few more of the references already in the online library that address the subject .
You be the judge .
Widespread Disregard
It should first be noted that by 1923 , authors were already noting that Prohibition was treated with " widespread disregard " .
" Chapter XXXVII - Prohibition " from The American Government By Frederic J. Haskin , 1923 .
If the prohibition law itself was treated with widespread disregard , then it is unlikely that it had any beneficial effect on other crime .

Women 's Organization for National Prohibition Reform was founded , stating in its declaration of principles that Prohibition was " wrong in principle " and " disastrous in consequences in the hypocrisy , the corruption , the tragic loss of life and the appalling increase of crime which has attended the abortive attempt to enforce it "

Police Corruption
" As to corruption it is sufficient to refer to the reported decisions of the courts during the past decade in all parts of the country , which reveal a succession of prosecutions for conspiracies , sometimes involving the police , prosecuting and administrative organizations of whole communities ; to the flagrant corruption disclosed in connection with diversions of industrial alcohol and unlawful production of beer ; to the record of federal prohibition administration as to which cases of corruption have been continuous and corruption has appeared in services which in the past had been above suspicion ; to the records of state police organizations ; to the revelations as to police corruption in every type of municipality , large and small , throughout the decade ; to the conditions as to prosecution revealed in surveys of criminal justice in many parts of the land ; to the evidence of connection between corrupt local politics and gangs and the organized unlawful liquor traffic , and of systematic collection of tribute from that traffic for corrupt political purposes .
There have been other eras of corruption .
Indeed , such eras are likely to follow wars .
Also there was much corruption in connection with the regulation of the liquor traffic before prohibition .
But the present regime of corruption in connection with the liquor traffic is operating in a new and larger field and is more extensive .
. . .
But of even more significance is the margin of profit in smuggling liquor , in diversion of industrial alcohol , in illicit distilling and brewing , in bootlegging , and in the manufacture and sale of products of which the bulk goes into illicit or doubtfully lawful making of liquor .
This profit makes possible systematic and organized violation of the National Prohibition
Act on a large scale and offers rewards on a par with the most important legitimate industries .
It makes lavish expenditure in corruption possible .
It puts heavy temptation in the way of everyone engaged in enforcement or administration of the law .
It affords a financial basis for organized crime .
The operation of the National Prohibition Act has also thrown a greatly increased burden upon the federal penal institutions which seems bound to increase with any effective increase in enforcement .
The reports of the Department of Justice show that the total federal long term prison population , i. e. , prisoners serving sentences of more than a year , has risen from not more than 5,268 on June 30 , 1921 to 14,115 on June 30 , 1930 .
The number of long term prisoners confined in the five leading federal institutions on June 30 , 1930 for violation of the National Prohibition Act and other national liquor laws was 4,296 out of a total of 12,332 .
The percentage of long term violators of the National Prohibition Act and other national liquor laws to total federal prisoners confined in the five leading federal institutions on June 30 , 1930 was therefore something over one - third .
This constituted by far the largest class of long term federal prisoners so confined , the next largest classes being made up of those sentenced for violation of the Dyer Act ( the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act ) and the Narcotic Acts , the percentage of whom on June 30 , 1930 were , respectively , 13.2 % and 22 % of the total .
Bad Features of the Present Situation and Difficulties in the Way of Enforcement from Report on the Enforcement of the Prohibition Laws of the United States by the National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement ( Wickersham Commission Report on Alcohol Prohibition )
The early experience of the Prohibition era gave the government a taste of what was to come .
In the three months before the 18th Amendment became effective , liquor worth half a million dollars was stolen from Government warehouses .
By midsummer of 1920 , federal courts in Chicago were overwhelmed with some 600 pending liquor violation trials ( Sinclair , 1962 : 176-177 ) .
Within three years , 30 prohibition agents were killed in service .
Other statistics demonstrated the increasing volume of the bootleg trade .
In 1921 , 95,933 illicit distilleries , stills , still works and fermentors were seized .
in 1925 , the total jumped to 172,537 and up to 282,122 in 1930 .
In connection with these seizures , 34,175 persons were arrested in 1921 ; by 1925 , the number had risen to 62,747 and to a high in 1928 of 75,307 ( Internal Revenue , Service , 1921 , 1966 , 1970 : 95 , 6 , 73 ) .
Concurrently , convictions for liquor offenses in federal courts rose from 35,000 in 1923 to 61,383 in 1932 .
" The History of Alcohol Prohibition " from Marihuana : A Signal of Misunderstanding , The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse , Commissioned by President Richard M. Nixon , March , 1972
One of the most imposing promises made by the friends of prohibition before the eighteenth amendment was that by abolishing drink crime would be decreased to a minimum .
That promise has not been fulfilled .
Crime has increased in such amazing proportion that it has become the dominant consideration of most of the State and municipal governments of the Nation .
A national crime commission of distinguished men from every section of the country , has been formed , and a bill is now pending in the New York Legislature which has to do with the appointment of a joint committee , to be joined by citizens to determine the came and possible remedies to reduce the tremendous wave of crime that is sweeping not only the country but New York as well .
I need not quote statistics to this committee , I am sure , to demonstrate that this is the most lawless country on the face of the earth .
I go a step further .
I assert that prohibition is one of the largest contributing factors to that disgraceful condition , by reason of the conceded , failure or inability of Federal and State authorities to enforce the law ; it has created a disrespect for law which , starting with prohibition , has gone all along the line .
Statement of Judge Alfred J. Talley , Judge of the Court of General Sessions of the State of New York , The National Prohibition Law , Hearings before the Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary , United States Senate , Sixty - Ninth Congress , April 5 to 24 , 1926 "
" Federal judges have told me , and their names I can supply if required , that the whole atmosphere of the Federal Building was one of pollution , that the air of corruption had even descended into the civil parts of the court , and reports were made to the senior United States judge of attempts to bribe jurymen even in the toilets of the building . "
Testimony of Hon. Emory R. Buckner , United States Attorney , Southern District of New York , " The National Prohibition Law , Hearings before the Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary , United States Senate , Sixty - Ninth Congress , April 5 to 24 , 1926 "
The corrupt prohibition agent or policeman is just as much a part of the bootleg industry as the bootlegger himself .
Last year it took two Pullman cars to transfer to Atlanta the convicted policemen and prohibition agents corralled in a single round - up in Ohio .
In May , 1925 , a special grand jury in Morris County , N. J. , was reported in the press as returning at one time 28 indictments against county officers and others for violations of the Volstead Act .
About the same time , the Rev. Marna S. Poulson , superintendent of the New Jersey Anti - Saloon League , was reported in the New York Times as saying , in an address at a prohibition rally at Atlantic City , " I do n't know of anyone who can make a dollar go further than policemen and dry agents .
By frugality , after a year in the service , they acquire automobiles and diamonds . "
Since the organization of the prohibition service to February 1 , 1926 , 875 persons have been separated from the Prohibition Unit mostly for official faithlessness or downright rascality .
Nor does the total that I have given include delinquents not dismissed but only allowed to resign .
Neither has the Coast Guard , that nursing mother of brave and devoted men , military as its discipline is , by any means escaped the contamination of prohibition .
Since the duty was assigned to it of preventing the smuggling of liquor from the sea into the United States , 7 temporary warrant officers , 11 permanent enlisted men , and 25 temporary enlisted men have been convicted of yielding , in one form or another , to the seductions of money or liquor in connection with prohibition work .
I am unable to say how many members of the force have been arrested but not convicted .
On December 10 , 1925 , a United Press dispatch reported that the entire crews of two Coast Guard patrol boats which had been assigned to patrol duty off the coast of Florida had been court - martialed for conniving with bootleggers .
On March 8 , 1926 , a dispatch to the New York Times from Providence , R. I. , announced that Capt .
Eli Sprague , who had been for 12 years the commander of the New Shoreham ( Block Island ) Coast Guard station , and had shared in the rescue of more than 500 persons , had been held for trial on two secret conspiracy indictments .
On or about February 18 , 1926 , the Washington Daily News reported that Boatswain 's Mate Joseph Libby , who had walked barefoot through ice and snow to obtain succor for his comrades whom he had left unconscious from extreme cold on patrol boat 126 , had been dishonorably discharged from the Coast Guard for bootlegging .
In view of what I have said , it is not surprising that Dr. Horace Taft , head master of the Taft School at Watertown and brother of Chief Justice Taft , should have said a few days ago at a law - enforcement meeting at Yale , " The United States is threatened with the rotting of her moral foundations and of her political and social structure as a direct result of prohibition . "
" Statement by Hon. William Cabell Bruce , The National Prohibition Law , Hearings before the Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary , United States Senate , Sixty - Ninth Congress , April 5 to 24 , 1926 "
That the law is unenforceable ; that it has created more crime than there ever was prior to prohibition ; that the morals of our Nation are worse by far than prior to prohibition ; that it has forcibly illustrated that you can not change habits of centuries by laws without creating contempt for that particular law and also for all laws in general ; that the average working man feels that the Volstead Act only benefits two classes––– 1 .
The fanatic who wants to reform and regulate everything by law .
2 . The second beneficiary is the bootlegger .
. . .
The Volstead Act has been the direct result of creating more crime in the State of New Jersey than there ever has been before .
It has endangered the life and limb of those using the public streets , through autos being operated by drunken drivers ; it may be that there were just as many auto drivers that drank before prohibition , but what they drank did not affect their ability to run an automobile with safety .
To - day one or two drinks create a menace to life and limb to those who use our streets and highways .
Statistics have shown that drivers of automobiles arrested for drunkenness have increased 100 per cent in the last few years .
Some one may ask where do they get it ?
If some one would ask the question :
Where can't you get it ?
It would be more difficult to answer .
Testimony of Henry Hilfers , President , New Jersey State Federation of Labor , The National Prohibition Law , Hearings before the Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary , United States Senate , Sixty - Ninth Congress , April 5 to 24 , 1926 "
Nothing is and nothing could be more certain , from all the evidence , than that prohibition is an unqualified failure and a colossal calamity to the Nation .
Whatever promotes drunkenness and drug addiction and all forms of intemperance also promotes crime of every kind .
We have the unimpeachable evidence of our senses that certainly more than half the crimes and misdemeanors perpetrated throughout the land and sensationally featured and headlined in the newspapers are crimes which are the result of prohibition .
Prohibition is a double - headed hydra of lawlessness , for we have on the one hand the crimes that infract the law of prohibition , and crimes that result from alcohol and drug intemperance that follow in the wake
Of prohibition ; and on the other hand we have the crimes of attempted enforcement of prohibition and the crimes of punishment , which are no less crimes because they have the sanction of expediency of prohibition law enforcement .

Finally , let 's examine the assertion that " it pays to be tough on drugs . "
Just looking at the information compiled above , we can readily see that it did not pay to be tough on alcohol .
Quite the contrary , in fact .
But how about the other drugs ?
Surely , the laws against those make more sense than trying to prohibit alcohol -- do n't they ?
Not really .
You could get a quick answer if you just went to the Rand Corporation 's analysis of the cost - effectiveness of various strategies to control drugs .
They found that interdiction and law enforcement were the least cost - effective of all the available strategies .
But that 's on a different web site , so let 's not even count that one .
One of the best places to start such a discussion is with what I consider to be probably the best single overall review of the subject ever written , the Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs .
It gives a good overview of what happened before and after the drug prohibition laws were passed in the United States .
Prior to 1906 , there were n't any national drug laws in the US .
There were some local laws that were motivated by racism rather than any real concern for public health and safety .
For example , opium smoking was outlawed in San Francisco in 1875 .
They did n't outlaw all forms of opium , just smoking opium , because that custom was peculiar to the Chinese .
It was an attempt to punish the Chinese immigrants who were competing with whites for jobs .
( Chapter 6 - Opium smoking is outlawed , The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs )
There were no laws on drug quality , no age restrictions on buyers , and no licensing of sellers .
There were n't even any laws requiring drug makers to list the contents on the label .
Many people were taking concoctions of perhaps fifty percent morphine with no real knowledge of what it was .
It was , as one historian noted , " a dope fiend 's paradise . "
However , even under those extreme conditions , it was not considered a major social problem .
Nevertheless , there was very little popular support for a law banning these substances .
" Powerful organizations for the suppression ... of alcoholic stimulants exist throughout the land , " 25 the 1881 article in the Catholic World noted , but there were no similar anti-opiate organizations .
The reason for this lack of demand for opiate prohibition was quite simple : the drugs were not viewed as a menace to society and , as we shall demonstrate in subsequent chapters , they were not in fact a menace .
Chapter 1 - Nineteenth Century America - " a dope fiends paradise " from The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs , by Edward M. Brecher and the Editors of Consumer Reports Magazine , 1972
But it obviously was n't a good idea for these drugs to be sold even without any labeling of the contents or controls on purity so the Pure Food and Drugs Act was passed in 1906 .
This was a regulatory law , not a criminal prohibition of drugs .
It established the Food and Drug Administration and gave it the power to regulate foods and drugs .
In addition :
The 1906 act required that medicines containing opiates and certain other drugs must say so on their labels .
2
Later amendments to the act also required that the quantity of each drug be truly stated on the label , and that the drugs meet official standards of identity and purity .
Thus , for a time the act actually served to safeguard addicts .
The efforts leading to the 1906 act , the act itself and subsequent amendments , and educational campaigns urging families not to use patent medicines containing opiates , no doubt helped curb the making of new addicts .
Indeed , there is evidence of a modest decline in opiate addiction from the peak in the 1890s until 1914 .
3
Chapter 7 - The Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906 , The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs ,
The opiates and cocaine were not prohibited on a national level until 1914 with the passage of the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act .
The purpose of the proponents of the bill was to institute a national prohibition on these drugs .
But they knew that an outright national prohibition law would be considered unconstitutional , so they did n't prohibit it , they just taxed it and worked the prohibition through the tax system .
( see Whitebread 's History of the Non-Medical Use of Drugs in the United States )
On its face , moreover , the Harrison bill did not appear to be a prohibition law at all .
. . . 4
The law specifically provided that manufacturers , importers , pharmacists , and physicians prescribing narcotics should be licensed to do so , at a moderate fee .
. . .
Far from appearing to be a prohibition law , the Harrison Narcotic
Act on its face was merely a law for the orderly marketing of opium , morphine , heroin , and other drugs .
. . it is unlikely that a single legislator realized in 1914 that the law Congress was passing would later be decreed a prohibition law .
. . .
The effects of this policy were almost immediately visible .
On May 15 , 1915 , just six weeks after the effective date of the Harrison Act , an editorial in the New York Medical Journal declared :
As was expected ... the immediate effects of the Harrison antinarcotic law were seen in the flocking of drug habitues to hospitals and sanatoriums .
Sporadic crimes of violence were reported too , due usual1y to desperate efforts by addicts to obtain drugs , but occasionally to a delirious state induced by sudden withdrawal ....
The really serious results of this legislation , however , will only appear gradually and will not always be recognized as such .
These will be the failures of promising careers , the disrupting of happy families , the commission of crimes which will never be traced to their real cause , and the influx into hospitals to the mentally disordered of many who would otherwise live socially competent lives .
8
Six months later an editorial in American Medicine reported : Narcotic drug addiction is one of the gravest and most important questions confronting the medical profession today .
Instead of improving conditions the laws recently passed have made the problem more complex .
Honest medical men have found such handicaps and dangers to themselves and their reputations in these laws . . . that they have simply decided to have as little to do as possible with drug addicts or their needs .
. . .
The druggists are in the same position and for similar reasons many of them have discontinued entirely the sale of narcotic drugs .
[ The addict ] is denied the medical care he urgently needs , open , above - board sources from which he formerly obtained his drug supply are closed to him , and he is driven to the underworld where lie can get his drug , but of course , surreptitiously and in violation of the law ....
Abuses in the sale of narcotic drugs are increasing .
. . .
A particular sinister sequence . . . is the character of the places to which [ addicts ] are forced to go to get their drugs and the type of people with whom they are obliged to mix .
The most depraved criminals are often the dispensers of these habit - forming drugs .
The moral dangers , as well as the effect on the self - respect of the addict , call for no comment .
One has only to think of the stress under which the addict lives , and to recall his lack of funds , to realize the extent to which these . . . afflicted individuals are under the control of the worst elements of society .
In respect to female habitues the conditions are worse , if possible .
Houses of ill fame are usually their sources of supply , and one has only to think of what repeated visitations to such places mean to countless good women and girls unblemished in most instances except for an unfortunate addiction to some narcotic drug - to appreciate the terrible menace .
9
In 1918 , after three years of the Harrison Act and its devastating effects , the secretary of the treasury appointed a committee to look into the problem .
. . .
Among its findings 10 were the following : Opium and other narcotic drugs ( including cocaine , which Congress had erroneously labeled as a narcotic in 1914 ) were being used by about a million people .
( This was almost certainly an overestimate ; see Chapter 9 . )
The " underground " traffic in narcotic drugs was about equal to the legitimate medical traffic .
The " dope peddlers " appeared to have established a national organization , smuggling the drugs in through seaports or across the Canadian or Mexican borders - especially the Canadian border .
The wrongful use of narcotic drugs had increased since passage of the Harrison Act .
Twenty cities , including New York and San Francisco , had reported such increases .
( The increase no doubt resulted from the migration of addicts into cities where black markets flourished . )
To stem this apparently rising tide , the 1918 committee , like countless committees since , called for sterner law enforcement .
it also recommended more state laws patterned after the Harrison Act. 11 Congress responded by tightening up the Harrison Act .
In 1924 , for example , a law was enacted prohibiting the importation of heroin altogether , even for medicinal use .
. . .
In 1925 , Dr. Lawrence Kolb reported on a study of both morphine and heroin addiction : " If there is any difference in the deteriorating effects of morphine and heroin on addicts , it is too slight to be determined clinically . "
12 President Johnson 's Committee on Law Enforcement and Administration of justice came to the same conclusion in 1967 : " While it is somewhat more rapid in its action , heroin does not differ in any significant pharmacological effect from morphine . "
13 The 1924 ban on heroin did not deter the conversion of morphine addicts to heroin .
On the contrary , heroin ousted morphine almost completely from the black market after the law was passed .
An editorial in the Illinois Medical Journal for June 1926 , after eleven years of federal law enforcement , concluded : The Harrison Narcotic law should never have been placed upon the Statute books of the United States .
It is to be granted that the well - meaning blunderers who put it there had in mind only the idea of making it impossible for addicts to secure their supply of " dope " and to prevent unprincipled people from making fortunes , and fattening upon the infirmities of their fellow men .
As is the case with most prohibitive laws , however , this one fell far short of the mark .
So far , in fact , that instead of stopping the traffic , those who deal in dope now make double their money from the poor unfortunates upon whom they prey .
. . .
The doctor who needs narcotics used in reason to cure and allay human misery finds himself in a pit of trouble .
The lawbreaker is in clover .
. . .
It is costing the United States more to support bootleggers of both narcotics and alcoholics than there is good coming from the farcical laws now on the statute books .
As to the Harrison Narcotic law , it is as with prohibition [ of alcohol ] legislation .
People are beginning to ask , " Who did that , anyway ? "
14 Chapter 8 - The Harrison Narcotic Act ( 1914 ) , The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs
I could certainly go on with references that show that the drug laws never did make any sense , and it is doubtful if they have ever produced any measurable benefits .
Certainly , the overwhelming weight of the evidence is that the prohibition laws do more harm than good .
A good place to start reading the evidence is at Major Studies of Drugs and Drug Policy .
Start with The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs .
What kinds of bad effects does this policy produce ?
One major bad effect is that it makes it easier for kids to get drugs , and even encourages their use .
Historically speaking , the biggest single cause of drug epidemics among US children is anti-drug campaigns .
See , for example , the references above on the problems with children drinking during alcohol prohibition .

David Davis :
So let them charge Damian , put him before a jury , and see him subpoena the whole damn lot of them
Heavy - handed : MP Damian Green was questioned for nine hours and his office and home were searched
The arrest on Thursday of MP Damian Green for disclosing to the public a series of New Labour fiascos was not just a blow to freedom of speech , it was the culmination of this arrogant Government ’s 11 - year assault on British liberal democracy .
It was 1.30 pm on Thursday that he was arrested by three counter - terrorism officers in a car park in Kent .
At the same time , his constituency office and , incredibly , his office in the House of Commons were being ransacked , nine counter - terrorism officers searched his London home .
He was kept for nine hours , even though he was questioned for only one .
All his computers , his mobile phone and his home telephone system were confiscated , his email account was shut down and many files were removed , crippling his ability to serve his constituents – not to mention invading their privacy as well .
This week of all weeks , with Mumbai the victim of a horrific terrorist attack , we are left all too aware of the risk of terrorism .
Since 1997 , this Labour Government has tried to hoodwink the British people into giving up our precious – hard - fought – freedoms , on the flimsy pretext that it can make us safer .
The truth is that we ca n’t defend our freedoms by sacrificing them – and Damian Green has shown us why .
What was the purpose of this heavy - handed police action against Damian ?
A huge breach of national security ?
No .
Had he posed a threat to our national security that justified diverting our counter - terrorism police from their other jobs ?
Appalled : David Davis says he thought he had seen it all from Labour - until Damian Green was arrested
No , just the reverse .
That is why there is no suggestion of a charge under the Official Secrets
Act – because it does not apply .
It is the duty of Her Majesty ’s Opposition to scrutinise the Government , highlight its mistakes and hold it to account .
If the widespread reports are true , Damian is being pursued by the police , following a referral from the Home Office , for passing on leaked documents to the newspapers in four cases .
Two of those cases involved attempts by the Government to hide serious security failings .
In one case in 2007 , the Home Secretary tried to conceal the fact that 5,000 illegal immigrants had been licensed by the Security Industry Authority to work in sensitive security posts – including with the Metropolitan Police and guarding the Prime Minister ’s car .
If Damian Green enabled newspapers to shine a light on this systemic failure , it is an example of free speech guarding our nation ’s security .
For that , he should be applauded , not punished .
The second case reported was the then Immigration Minister Liam Byrne ’s attempt earlier this year to conceal the fact that an illegal immigrant had been working at Parliament .
This was a disturbing security failure at the heart of our democracy .
Again , if Damian helped expose this security breach – so it could be addressed – free speech was defending our democracy .
None of this is new .
Down the ages , liberty – and freedom of speech in particular – has been the best defence against sloppy security .
Sometimes that will involve breaching the employer ’s duty of confidentiality – as recognised by our law .
When , in the Thirties , Churchill warned against the growing military might of the Luftwaffe , he did n’t rely on stirring speeches alone .
He put into the public domain information leaked to him from Government officials that demonstrated the weakness in our air defences .
Witch - hunt ?
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith 's department ordered an investigation
Given the tragic legacy of appeasement , does anyone today suggest that British national security would have been served by gagging Churchill ?
Would anyone have dared to prosecute him ?
Of course not .
Churchill ’s brave stance saved us from disaster .
Damian Green was elected to Parliament to uphold the truth , serve the country and hold the Government to account .
His responsibility is to defend the public interest , not save Ministerial blushes .
If presented with leaked information that exposes Government failures , lies or cover-ups , his duty is to shop the Government – not the whistleblower .
None of the disclosures put the country at risk , compromised intelligence or jeopardised security .
They just humiliated incompetent Ministers .
Of course , employees owe a duty of confidentiality to their employer .
But , except from in exceptional circumstances , that is a disciplinary matter , not a criminal one – let alone a criminal offence under an obscure law that dates back to a court case in the 18th Century .
That is why the response by the Home Office and the Metropolitan Police has been appalling – and shows how instinctively authoritarian this Government has become .
Jacqui Smith ’s department launched a witch - hunt , ordering counter - terrorist police to mount an investigation that had them arresting a young Home Office official at his home at 5.50 am .
This appears to have led them to Damian Green – who got similar treatment two weeks later .
Damian was arrested in what is the most unprecedented attack by government and the police on our democracy in recent history – while the Speaker of the House of Commons stood idly by .
But they picked the wrong person to try to intimidate .
Damian is one of the steadiest men I have ever had the privilege to serve with .
Yet I thought then that he must have faced one of the most difficult days of his life .
Only hardened criminals find being arrested anything other than wearing .
Nevertheless , after nine hours of interrogation , Damian emerged unbowed , shortly after midnight , vowing to continue to discharge his ‘ duty to hold the Government to account ’ .
The inquest into how such a repressive response could happen in this country has just begun .
Did Jacqui Smith give the green light for the police swoop on her fellow Member of Parliament ?
Were counter - terrorism officers operating against an MP without her knowing about it ?
Kafka-esque : What did Gordon Brown know prior to Damian Green 's arrest ?
What role did Gordon Brown play in this Kafka - esque parody of justice ?
The claim that no Ministers had any prior knowledge of the arrest stretches credibility to breaking point .
It will face intense scrutiny , and if any Minister is found to have been less than entirely straightforward it will certainly be fatal for their career .
It is almost six months since I resigned in protest at Gordon Brown ’s contemptible corruption of the democratic process – amid widespread reports of the Government bribing and bullying its way to securing the vote on 42 days ’ detention without charge .
For me that was the last straw after 11 years of relentless assault on our fundamental freedoms .
We have seen the growth in the database state , outpaced only by the number of cases of the Government losing sensitive personal information .
We have seen crackdowns on freedom of speech and peaceful protest on the most trivial of grounds – including fining the sellers of ‘ B******s to Blair ’ T - shirts , detaining an 82 - year - old heckler at the Labour conference and prosecuting peace activists for reading out the names of the brave British soldiers killed in Iraq .
I thought I ’d seen it all .
But even I had not expected to see a friend and colleague arrested for the heinous crime of being a good parliamentarian .
But last week ’s attack on our democracy will cast in stone Gordon Brown ’s long - overdue epitaph as the most authoritarian Prime Minister in post - war history .
Damian is among the most straightforward and honourable of people .
I trust him totally .
He worked for me when I was Shadow Home Secretary .
Everything he did as Shadow Immigration Minister he did with my implicit or explicit support .
He is guilty of nothing that anyone would recognise as a crime .
And our best defence ?
Ironically , justice can probably only now be properly served if Damian is formally charged under this obscure criminal law that dates back to the 1700s .
He could then elect for that ancient British bulwark against despotism , the right to trial by jury , place his trust in 12 members of the British public and subpoena the whole damn lot of them – from Blair through to Brown .
David Davis is MP for Haltemprice and Howden – a seat he regained after a by - election .
If you ’ve ever worked on a game before ( and if you code , you probably have , at least on your own ) , you ’ve seen the venerable game loop .
It ’s the core loop in the executable that iterates as long as the game is running .
In GUI apps , an event loop accomplishes the same goal of keeping the executable running indefinitely .
A simple game loop looks like :
void GameLoop ( ) { while ( m Playing ) { HandleUserInput ( ) ; UpdateGameState ( ) ; Render ( ) ; } }
Pretty straightforward , and it ’s endearing to know that even the most advanced blockbuster game on the market has some code quite similar to this in it somewhere .
Separating out the UI
However , my game project is a turn - based roguelike .
This means HandleUserInput ( ) blocks indefinitely until the user has chosen a move .
Also , I ’m a design purist , so I want to not have engine code ( which is where the game loop lives ) directly call into UI - land code ( HandleUserInput ( ) ) .
Right now the game is ASCII , but if I ever add graphics I do n’t want to change the engine .
So what I did was move the loop back into UI - land ( i.e. the normal event loop GUIs have ) .
GameLoop ( ) in the engine now updates one step of the game and returns .
Likewise , instead of explicitly calling Render ( ) , I let the engine raise events when things happen ( monsters move , items are used , etc . )
The UI can hook into those and render the parts it needs to .
So … hand - waving … do n’t worry about rendering .
void ProcessGame ( UserInput input ) { HandleUserInput ( input ) ; UpdateGameState ( ) ; }
Still pretty dumb .
Let ’s delve into updating the game state .
Monsters !
The game has a dungeon with a bunch of monsters and the player - controlled hero .
Something like :
void UpdateGameState () { Hero .
Move ( ) ; foreach ( Monster monster in Monsters ) { monster .
Move ( ) ; } }
This works for games like checkers where everyone takes exactly one turn .
Here ’s where it gets a bit more complex .
In my game , each entity moves at its own speed so some may get more than one turn before others go .
In addition , the hero is basically the same thing as a monster except the player controls him instead of AI doing it .
Like this :
void UpdateGameState () { //
Entities has the hero in it too foreach ( Entity entity in Entities ) { entity .
Move ( ) ; } }
The tricky bit is because of speed , the UI may need to call ProcessGame ( ) multiple times before the hero actually needs user input .
If the hero is slower than monsters , some monsters will take multiple steps before the hero takes one .
This means there is no longer a 1 - 1 correspondence between ProcessGame ( ) calls and HandleUserInput ( ) .
In fact , the UI has to ask the engine if it ’s time to provide user input .
So ProcessGame ( ) really become “ process the game in a loop until we need user input to continue ” :
void ProcessGame ( ) { while ( true ) { Entity entity = Entities [ mCurrentEntity ] ; if ( entity .
NeedsUserInput ) { return ; } else { entity .
Move ( ) ; mCurrentEntity = ( mCurrentEntity + 1 ) % Entities .
Count ; } } }
Fairly simple .
We loop through the entities , wrapping around and keep going until we reach the hero who needs a move .
But you ’ll notice we had to create a field , mCurrentEntity , where we were just using a local foreach loop before .
That lets us pick up where we left off the last time we called the function .
It Gets Worse
That is n’t so bad , but I also added processing for items ( if you lay a burning torch on the ground , it needs to process so it can eventually burn out ) :
void ProcessGame ( ) { while ( true ) { if ( mInEntities ) { Entity entity = Entities [ mCurrentEntity ] ; if ( entity .
NeedsUserInput ) { return ; } else { entity .
Move ( ) ; mCurrentEntity ++ ; if ( mCurrentEntity >= Entities .
Count ) { mCurrentEntity = 0 ; mInEntities = false ; } } } else { Item item = Items [ mCurrentItem ] ; item .
Move ( ) ; mCurrentItem ++ ; if ( mCurrentItem >= Items .
Count ) { mCurrentItem = 0 ; mInEntities = true ; } } } }
Yeesh .
Now we ’ve got another field to track the current item , and another one just to track which of the two loops we ’re in .
It ’s getting hairy and this still is n’t as complex as my actual game ’s process function , which includes single moves which are multiple steps and some other shenanigans .
But , there ’s hope .
Remember when I said , “ lets up pick up where we left off the last time we called it ” .
Those member variables exist basically to get us to jump back to the last place we were in the function .
Sound familiar ?
Enter Iterators
Here ’s an iterator :
IEnumerable < int > Fibonacci ( ) { int a = 0 ; int b = 1 ; while ( true ) { yield return a ; int swap = a ; a = b ; b = swap + b ; } }
yield return lets us pick up where we left off , and we did n’t have to create any members to keep track of a and b because the IEnumerable < int > created automatically by the compiler encapsulates that .
A perfect fit !
Let ’s turn the game processing into the same thing :
IEnumerable < bool > ProcessGame ( ) { while ( true ) { foreach ( Entity entity in Entities ) { if ( entity .
NeedsUserInput ) { yield return true ; } else { entity .
Move ( ) ; } } foreach ( Item item in Items ) { item .
Move ( ) ; } } }
Much simpler , and we let the language take care of encapsulating the state needed to return for us .
Less code for us to monkey with .
The Final Bit
The only annoying bit left now is that the UI actually needs to call ProcessGame ( ) once and then iterate through the returned iterator afterwards .
To make things nicer , we can let the game handle that so that ProcessGame ( ) works exactly like it used to :
void ProcessGame ( ) { if ( mIterator == null ) { mIterator = CreateProcessIterator ( ) . GetEnumerator ( ) ; } mIterator .
MoveNext ( ) ; bool dummy = mIterator .
Current ; } IEnumerable < bool > CreateProcessIterator ( ) { while ( true ) { foreach ( Entity entity in Entities ) { if ( entity .
NeedsUserInput ) { yield return true ; } else { entity .
Move ( ) ; } } foreach ( Item item in Items ) { item .
Move ( ) ; } } }

The single , blinding release of pure energy over Hiroshima , Japan , on August 6 , 1945 , marked a startling and permanent break with our prior understandings of the visible world .
Yet for more than sixty years the technology behind the explosion has remained a state secret .
The United States government has never divulged the engineering specifications of the first atomic bombs , not even after other countries have produced generations of ever more powerful nuclear weapons .
In the decades since the Second World War , dozens of historians have attempted to divine the precise mechanics of the Hiroshima bomb , nicknamed Little Boy , and of the bomb that fell three days later on Nagasaki , known as Fat Man .
The most prominent is Richard Rhodes , who won a Pulitzer Prize , in 1988 , for his dazzling and meticulous book “ The Making of the Atomic Bomb . ”
But the most accurate account of the bomb ’s inner workings — an unnervingly detailed reconstruction , based on old photographs and documents — has been written by a sixty - one - year - old truck driver from Waukesha , Wisconsin , named John Coster - Mullen , who was once a commercial photographer , and has never received a college degree .
John Coster - Mullen conducted a decade of research to build the first accurate replica of the Hiroshima bomb .
Illustration by John Ritter
I first came across Coster - Mullen ’s name in January of 2004 , after I attended an exhibit by the artist Jim Sanborn , at the Corcoran Gallery of Art , in Washington , D.C.
The show , called “ Critical Assembly , ” included what appeared to be spookily exact replicas of the interior mechanism of the first atomic bomb , which Sanborn had manufactured according to Coster - Mullen ’s specifications .
A year later , I read an article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that mentioned a six - hundred - mile trip Coster - Mullen had taken across the Midwest with a full - scale model of the Hiroshima bomb in the back of a Penske rental truck .
He had built the replica with the help of his son , Jason , in his garage , basing it , in part , on his analysis of sixty - year - old screws , bolts , and fragments of machined steel that had been stored in rural basements and attics .
The mention of Coster - Mullen ’s journey led me back to the November / December , 2004 , issue of the Bulletin , which included a review of a book by Coster - Mullen titled “ Atom Bombs : The Top Secret Inside Story of Little Boy and Fat Man . ”
The review , written by the eminent atomic historian Robert S. Norris , began , “ For many years , Coster - Mullen has been printing his manuscript at Kinko ’s ( adding to and revising it along the way ) and selling spiral - bound copies at conferences or over the Internet . ”
Norris clearly considered Coster - Mullen ’s understanding of the bomb superior to his own .
It was known that Little Boy and Fat Man brought together two masses of fissile material inside a bomb casing , forming a critical mass that set off a nuclear explosion .
Little
Boy shot one mass of highly enriched uranium into the other with a gunlike mechanism ; Fat Man used explosives to squeeze together two hemispheres of plutonium .
But the exact details of how these devices worked were unknown .
Norris said of Coster - Mullen ’s work , “ Nothing else in the Manhattan Project literature comes close to his exacting breakdown of the bomb ’s parts .
Coster - Mullen describes the size , weight , and composition of many of Little Boy ’s components , including the nose section and its target case ; the uranium - 235 target rings and tamper ; the arming and fuzing system ; the forged steel 6.5 - inch - in - diameter gun barrel through which the uranium - 235 projectile was fired at the target rings ; and the tail section — to cite just a few . ”
My own copy of “ Atom Bombs ” soon arrived in the mail , along with a sheet of testimonials from Harold Agnew , the former director of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory , who was aboard the Enola Gay when it annihilated Hiroshima ( a “ most amazing document ” ) ; Philip Morrison , one of the physicists who helped invent the bomb ( “ You have done a remarkable job ” ) ; and Paul Tibbets , the commander and pilot of the Enola Gay ( “ I was very much impressed ” ) .
“ Atom Bombs ” consists of densely interlocking sentences , nearly all of which contain dimensional information that contradicts the assertions of previous authorities .
“ A circular steel plate was positioned inside the 17.0 " - diameter tail cylinder at the front of the tail tube and another towards the rear of the tube , ” Coster - Mullen writes .
“ These allowed the tail to be slid over the 10.5 " - diameter gun tube during assembly .
The forward plate was positioned 26.5 " in front of the aft plate and was welded to the front of the tail tube . ”
Though the book ’s specificity about dimensions , shapes , and materials was mind - numbing , the accumulation of detail was strangely seductive .
As Coster - Mullen described how the different parts of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs fit together , I felt that I could practically assemble an atomic weapon myself .
The text was followed by more than a hundred pages of declassified photographs extracted from half a dozen government archives , which showed the weapons at various stages of completion — surrounded by scientists in New Mexico or by tanned , shirtless crew members on Tinian Island , in the Western Pacific , just before the bombs were dropped .
Coster - Mullen ’s book concluded with thirty - five pages of end notes , including a hilariously involved discussion of the textural differences in the gold foil used to separate the plutonium hemispheres for the first atomic bomb , Trinity ( dimpled ) , and the Nagasaki bomb ( flat ) .
Coster - Mullen sees his project as a diverting mental challenge — not unlike a crossword puzzle — whose goal is simply to present readers with accurate information about the past .
“ This is nuclear archeology , ” he told me , in a late - night phone call .
“ It ’s like any other kind of archeology . ”
Though the government does not make a practice of providing Coster - Mullen with timely responses to his technical inquiries , no official has actively discouraged him from pursuing his research .
After a period of mild equivocation , he decided to publish all the details he had uncovered about the mechanics and production of the bomb , even though the subject remains classified .
“ I was acting like a classification officer , ” he recalls .
“ ‘ I can have the truth and you can ’t . ’
Who am I to say that ? ”
Among other things , Coster - Mullen ’s book makes clear that our belief in the secrecy of the bomb is a theological construct , adopted in no small part to shield ourselves from the idea that someone might use an atomic bomb against us .
Surely , hostile powers could easily obtain the kind of information that Coster - Mullen has acquired , however painstakingly , in his spare time .
Any nation that can master the challenges of the atomic - fuel cycle and produce a critical mass of uranium or plutonium , as Iran is reported to be on the verge of doing , would have little difficulty in producing a workable bomb .
Given a sufficient quantity of highly enriched uranium , a small number of engineers working for a terrorist group like Al Qaeda or Hezbollah could easily assemble a homemade nuclear device .
I recently wrote to Coster - Mullen and suggested that we take a trip across the country to visit his Little Boy replica , which is currently housed at Wendover , a decommissioned Air Force base in Utah .
After some negotiation , we agreed to ride together on his late - night delivery route between Waukesha and Chicago .
We would then drive to Wendover .
Along the way , he would explain the inner workings of the first atomic bombs , and I would learn how he got it right and the experts got it wrong .
Coster - Mullen and I met in the darkened parking lot of a regional distribution center for a big - box retailer , some ten miles outside Waukesha .
Dressed in Lee jeans and a tan shirt with the J. B .
Hunt logo , he had titanium - frame glasses , blue - gray eyes , and a full head of silvery hair .
The distribution center was the size of seven or eight football fields ; fans roaring overhead and an enormous conveyor belt drowned out the beeps of cabs backing up to trailers .
Coster - Mullen picked up his sheet for the night , which involved stops at Store 1950 , in Streamwood , Illinois , and Store 1889 , in downtown Chicago .
He was to drop off a container filled with lawn furniture in Streamwood , and haul back “ sweep ” merchandise — cardboard boxes , defective items , coat hangers — from Chicago .
We walked outside and hooked up Coster - Mullen ’s truck to trailer No. 537427 , with a solid click .
It was seven o’clock on a Sunday night .
He calmly recited a safety checklist ( “ My lights are on , my flashers are on ” ) and we set off .
Over the years , Coster - Mullen told me , he had held nearly a dozen jobs , including working at camera stores in and around Milwaukee ; doing inventory control for the Beloit Corporation , which manufactured paper - making equipment ; taking photographs of industrial equipment for Trane , the heating and air - conditioning company , and then for Mercury Marine , which makes high - quality engines for boats ; working as a studio photographer for Pohlman Studios , in Milwaukee ; and running his own photography business .
These jobs had provided him with the skills , he says , that helped him solve the puzzle of the bomb .
I asked him how he wound up driving a truck .
“ They are always hiring , ” he said .
“ I figured if people with the brains of a squirrel could drive a truck , maybe I could drive a truck . ”
The highway cut through scrubland , and by nightfall Coster - Mullen was driving past Old World Wisconsin , a tourist attraction that features restorations of prairie homesteads .
Making long cross-country drives , Coster - Mullen said , had given him plenty of time to reëxamine the three - dimensional diagram of the bomb that he keeps in his head , like a Buddhist monk contemplating the Karmic wheel .
His truck routes also made it easy for him to maintain connections with sources .
Twelve years ago , Coster - Mullen pulled into a Wal - Mart parking lot in North Carolina and got into the car of a retired machinist in his late seventies , who showed him photographs of metal pieces that he had fashioned for the Trinity bomb , which was set off in the desert outside Alamogordo , New Mexico , in July , 1945 .
Coster - Mullen said that machinists often hid the fragments in their shoes and pants cuffs , in order to have something to show their grandchildren .
Two years after meeting the machinist , in 1998 , Coster - Mullen , while driving through Nebraska with three cars in front of him , figured out the exact shape and weight of the pieces of uranium inside Little Boy .
“ I ’m sitting there with my pocket calculator , going , ‘ If the core had this diameter , and the length is this , what ’s the volume ? ’ ” he recalled .
“ I went , ‘ That ’s it ! ’
And then I got on the horn — urh - urh . ”
Arriving at the drop - off point in Streamwood , we unhooked the truck ’s electric and air lines , then turned the crank on the landing gear forty times .
We picked up another container , got back in the truck , and headed south , toward Chicago .
At four in the morning , we passed the Sears Tower .
Coster - Mullen gingerly navigated the pillars inside an indoor parking garage and pulled up to the loading dock .
The trailer , which contained thirty - one thousand pounds of FAK — “ freight of all kinds ” — was n’t ready yet , so we checked out the bales of sweep merchandise : crushed boxes of cookies , dented cans , ripped jeans .
Finally , we hooked up the trailer and hit the road .
As we headed north , Coster - Mullen explained to me the likely blast effects of a Hiroshima - size nuclear device exploding in a container truck in downtown Chicago .
He said , “ All you need to do is take two subcritical masses of uranium and smash them into each other to form a critical mass .
Neutrons strike the heavy uranium nucleus , which splits , releasing a tremendous jolt of energy along with two or more neutrons , which split more nuclei , setting off a chain reaction that grows and grows and finally manifests itself as a huge fireball over a populated area , blinding , asphyxiating , incinerating , or crushing every living being within a five - mile radius . ”
As he elaborated on the scenario , the sun began to rise , and I fell asleep with my face against the window .
We arrived at Coster - Mullen ’s home , in Waukesha , around eight o’clock that morning .
He lives in a ranch house on a cul - de-sac in a pleasant subdivision .
His wife , Mary , is a retired social worker who spends most of her time reading and knitting .
They have two children together , and Coster - Mullen has a third from a previous marriage .
Asters , black - eyed Susans , and coral bells blossomed beneath the trees in the back yard .
Coster - Mullen , in anticipation of my visit , had arrayed his kitchen with some of his atom - bomb memorabilia , including a roof tile from the hypocenter of the Hiroshima blast , which he purchased for eighty - nine dollars from a former member of the U.S. radiation - survey team .
He also owns a brick of graphite from Enrico Fermi ’s lab at the University of Chicago — the site of the first reactor pile — which he was given by two physicists who were fans of his book ; a small marine fossil that was underneath the Trinity bomb when it exploded in the New Mexico desert , which Coster - Mullen dug out of the ground himself during a visit to the site ; silicone molds of the detonator for the Trinity bomb ; a chunk of uranium ; and a sphere of beryllium , a component of modern atomic bombs .
He handed me a leaflet that had been dropped over Japan by B - 29 bombers in late July , 1945 .
“ Attention Japanese People , ” the leaflet says .
“ In the next few days , four ( or more ) of the cities named on the reverse side will be destroyed by American bombs .
These cities contain military installations and workshops or factories that produce military goods .
We are determined to destroy all of the tools of the military clique . ”
On the kitchen counter sat something seemingly unconnected to atomic weapons : a hobbyist ’s model of the Joan of Arc chapel , on the campus of Marquette University , in Milwaukee .
In fact , Coster - Mullen told me , the model , which he completed in 1993 , had helped spark his obsession with building his own bomb .
He had built the model in the hope of launching a business .
Marquette alumni and other visitors , he had figured , would eagerly buy replicas of the chapel and display them in their homes .
Constructing the model was difficult , he recalled : “ I was using dental picks and surgical 3 - D glasses and I learned how to carve little eyes in the wood benches . ”
Like most of his business ideas , before and since , the project showed both a fanatical devotion to detail and a hazy grasp of what ordinary consumers might pay for .
He placed the chapel models in local gift shops on consignment , but few sold .
After this failure , Coster - Mullen decided to make replicas of something with wider commercial appeal .
In December , 1993 , he persuaded his son , Jason , who was then seventeen , to accompany him on a road trip to the National Atomic Museum , in Albuquerque , where Coster - Mullen could examine the empty ballistic casing of an atomic bomb at first hand and make sketches that he could use to build an accurate scale model .
After driving two thousand miles to the museum , he was distressed to find that the atomic - weapons area was closed for renovation .
He protested until his contact at the museum finally appeared and let them in .
He and Jason spent hours measuring the bomb casings on display .
( In the early nineties , after the fall of the Soviet Union , no one was particularly disturbed by the sight of a father and son poking measuring tape inside the casings of fifty - year - old bombs . )
The Coster - Mullens were soon measuring weapons casings around the country , including at the Wright - Patterson base , in Ohio ; the West Point Museum , in the Hudson Valley ; and the Smithsonian , in Washington , D.C.
They also saw the Fat Man display at the Bradbury Science Museum , in Los Alamos .
During these and other excursions , Coster - Mullen discovered that much of the dimensional information about the bombs in history books was wrong .
“ Rhodes and others said that Little Boy is twenty - nine inches in diameter — but it ’s not , it ’s twenty - eight , ” he said , in the friendly , matter - of - fact tone he uses to soften the force of his obsession .
Wondering what other errors the historians had made , he began to attend reunions of the 509th Composite Group , the military unit that dropped the bombs .
He went to his first reunion in 1994 , in Chicago .
Before the gathering , he wrote a draft of a pamphlet about the bomb and sent it to Frederick Ashworth , a naval commander who was in charge of the Fat Man weapon .
“ The Monday of the reunion week , I get this letter back from Admiral Ashworth , who , justifiably , took me to task , ” Coster - Mullen recalls .
“ He said , ‘ Either treat this subject with the seriousness it deserves or drop it . ’
So I chose the former . ”
Coster - Mullen spent the next ten years of his life mastering a body of recondite technical data .
He extracted photographs from government archives and scrutinized them with a magnifying glass ; he interviewed one retired machinist after another , as well as scientists and engineers .
Researching the bomb provided Coster - Mullen with an outlet for a sensibility that might have been equally at home collecting tropical butterflies or double - print stamps .
To suggest that Coster - Mullen is a garden - variety classification freak , however , is like comparing a high - school trumpet player to Miles Davis .
Driven by his desire to solve a great puzzle , he is personally affronted by recycled information and secondary sourcing , which often leads him to express contempt for people who are lazier than he is — a category that includes virtually everyone .
“ This place would be so bucolic without you . ”

The first edition of “ Atom Bombs ” was completed in 2003 .
With the publication of the book , which has since undergone several hundred revisions , Coster - Mullen became a leading member of the loosely organized scholarly fraternity dedicated to challenging the ethic of secrecy behind the atomic security state .
Its dozen or so members included Richard Rhodes ; Chuck Hansen , a computer programmer whose Freedom of Information Act requests helped him assemble “ The Swords of Armageddon , ” a twenty - nine - hundred - page , seven - volume archive of documentary information about the U.S. nuclear arsenal ; Howard Morland , who published the first detailed sketch of a thermonuclear weapon , in The Progressive , in 1979 ; and Carey Sublette , a programmer in California , who has posted a wealth of data about atomic weapons on the Internet .
“ Most of the lenders around here are in complete disarray , ” Mr. Hennenhoefer said .
“ They ’re not as aggressive about evictions .
Everyone ’s hanging around in properties hoping the government will buy all that bad paper and then they ’ll negotiate a new deal with the government .
They just live in different parts of the house and say , ‘ We ’ll stay here for as long as we can , and save our money , so we have the ability to move when and if the sheriff comes to toss us out . ’ ”
Mr. Hennenhoefer said this tactic worked only with first mortgages ; on second and third mortgages , the lenders pursue repayment even after the homeowners have lost the home .
Dee Dee Tomasko , a nursing student and mother in suburban Cleveland , expected to leave her marriage with about $ 200,000 in starter money , primarily from the marital home , which was appraised at about $ 1 million in 2006 .
By the time of her divorce last year , however , the house was appraised at $ 800,000 ; her share of the equity came to about $ 105,000 .
Though she is relieved to be out of the marriage , if she had known how little money she would get “ I might have stuck with it a little more ; I do n’t know , ” Ms. Tomasko said , adding , “ Maybe it would ’ve made me think a little harder . ”
For divorcing spouses with resources , though , there can be opportunities in the falling housing market .
Josh Kaufman and his wife bought a new 6,500 - square - foot house outside Cleveland on five and a half acres , with four bedrooms and two three - car garages , that was worth $ 1.5 million at the height of the market .
When they divorced in June , Mr. Kaufman knew his wife could not afford to carry the home .
The longer the divorce process continued , the more the house depreciated ; by the time he assumed the house , its appraised value was half what the couple had put into it ; he did not pay her anything for her share .
“ From a negotiating standpoint we knew that she could n’t afford to stay in it , ” Mr. Kaufman said .
“ It appeared as an opportunity to turn the negative situation around .
There was no emotion involved .
It was a business decision on what made most financial sense .
It was n’t an attempt to take advantage of someone . ”
Two men who crash - landed their plane in freezing waters survived 18 hours on a tiny sheet of ice " huddled together like penguins " .
The two - one Australian and the other Swedish - endured temperatures of - 20C ( - 4 F ) after their Cessna plane ran into trouble over the far north of Canada .
Their survival equipment sank with the plane and rescue aircraft responding to their Mayday call failed to find them .
They were eventually rescued by a trawler and airlifted to hospital .
Australian Oliver Edwards - Neil , 25 , and his Swedish flying partner Troels Hansen , 45 , had been flying a Cessna Skymaster from the US to Sweden when both its engines failed over the Hudson Strait , just south of the Arctic Circle .
Equipment lost
They sent out a Mayday call before landing minutes later in water surrounded by tiny sheets of ice .
As the cockpit quickly filled with freezing water , they managed to scramble through a window and on to an ice sheet about 5 m ( 16ft ) wide and 10 m long before the plane sank , with all their equipment on board .
Mr Edwards - Neil , who lives in Sweden , told the Sydney Morning Herald website that it was already dark and after two hours on the ice they heard rescue planes and helicopters circling .
We tried to keep each other warm and sheltered each other from the wind ... like penguins
Oliver Edwards - Neil
But without flares or even a torch the men had no way of attracting attention and the aircraft eventually flew away .
Mr Edwards - Neil said that their survival suits saved their lives .
" But I never thought I could freeze that much .
I was shivering non-stop , " he said .
" I was sure that I was not going to make it but my mate said ' You 're going to get there . '
" We kept each other going and supported each other , and we tried to keep each other warm and sheltered each other from the wind ... like penguins . "
When daylight came , the men could see land in the distance and started to jump from one ice sheet to another to try to reach it .
It was then that they were found by a fishing boat that had also heard their Mayday call and headed to the scene .
The captain , Bo Mortensen , said the men were " weeping with joy " when the crew brought them aboard 7 km ( 4.3 miles ) from Baffin Island , in Canada 's Nunavut territory .
He said the men looked to be in good shape apart from frostbite to their feet , but were " lucky to be alive " .
Mr Edwards - Neil and Mr Hansen were later transferred by helicopter to a hospital in Iqaluit , Nunavut .

Hold up .
2008 ?
That was a long time ago .
For more updated information on marketing with Twitter , check out our ebook , How to Use Twitter for Business .
Taking a page from Technorati and their state of the blogosphere report that reviews survey data from a few hundred bloggers , we 're publishing the " State of the Twittersphere " report .
This is our first report , for Q4 2008 .
One thing that is different about this report though is that it is not based on surveys of a few hundred people .
It is based on real data pulled from hundreds of thousands of Twitter profiles accessed through the reports generated by Twitter Grader .
You can download the full report in PDF format and click here to tweet about the report .
Here is a glance at some of the more interesting findings .
Twitter is dominated by newer users - 70 % of Twitter users joined in 2008
An estimated 5 - 10 thousand new accounts are opened per day
35 % of Twitter users have 10 or fewer followers
9 % of Twitter users follow no one at all
There is a strong correlation between the number of followers you have and the number of people you follow

Monday , 17 Nov , 2008 Technology
According to a new study , sponsored by Pew Research Center 's Internet & American Life Project , when dealing with breakdown of a device the levels of optimism and irritation depend on the age and gender of a person .
A representative of the company that sponsored the survey of 2,054 American adults said that young people show more optimism than older adults when facing technology breakdown .
In their report the authors of the study wrote that respondents aged between 18 and 29 were less likely to be able to repair broken gadgets on their own , but they showed more confidence regarding the fact that they were on the right track to fixing devices .
In addition , this category of people felt less discouraged or puzzled about repairing gadgets .
Additional information showed that 35 % out of 52 % of tech users were able to fix devices on their own .
In regard to gender - based distinctions , the report states that 76 percent of men showed more confidence about fixing the problem compared to 68 percent of women .
However , these men were more likely to report being puzzled or irritated while trying to fix devices .
The report showed that 33 male respondents were able to fix devices on their own compared to 22 percent of women .
It was also reported that 18 percent of women sought help from friends or family compared to 12 percent of men .
From 2,054 respondents 48 percent confessed they required help installing a new device and learning how to utilize it correctly .
As for the problems related to Internet connection , desktop , mobile phone , PDA and the like 15 % said they did n't fix the problem at all , 38 % reported getting help from customer service , 28 % said they were able to fix the gadgets by themselves , 15 % got help from family or friends and 2 % found the way to repair the device online .
Andrew Strauss was the first player to emphasise that England had an obligation to return to India after the savagery in Mumbai and he marked one of the most politically significant Tests in history by taking that sense of duty on to the field of play .
His 13th
Test century , a disciplined 123 spanning nearly six hours , is assured of its place in history .
" It is an important Test match for the game of cricket and to be able to play such a role in it was pretty special , " Strauss said .
" I did n't have much mental anguish .
I decided fairly quickly that it was important to come back if the security was right .
But to be able to concentrate on the cricket was a relief .
You are travelling back to ground you have been on before .
It made me feel refreshed and focused . "
Whether Strauss ' efforts will lead to an England victory is more dubious .
They turned up , and for that they deserve credit , but to lose four wickets after tea and close the first day at 229 for five was a waste of an excellent toss .
" It was a hard slog to get out of net mode into Test mode but this was a flat wicket , " added Strauss .
" It looks like it will break up and I think spinners will play an increasingly dominant part in the game .
If we do n't get to 400 then the likelihood is that we will have to bat well in the second innings . "
The opener proved that given a sound pitch and a determination to bat within strict parameters , it is possible to rise above the upheaval of the past fortnight .
Strauss became the first England batsman to score a Test hundred on this ground since Chris Lewis .
But this time , for all Strauss ' best efforts , England 's innings went to pot .
A controlled opening stand of 118 between Strauss and Alastair Cook encouraged visions of 500 , rare territory , but as soon as Cook was dismissed , failing to loft Harbhajan Singh 's off - spin over midwicket , uncertainty set in .
Strauss fell seven overs before the close , working a return catch to the leg - spinner Amit Mishra .
To be a spectator at the Chidambaram Stadium was in itself a commitment to cricket .
No bottles of water , no food , no mobiles , no bags .
Sun cream was acceptable only if it had already been slapped on .
The crowd on the popular side had to peer through bright blue netting .
Everybody knew that England needed a net , but few expected the Tamil Nadu authorities to turn the entire Test into one .
The pitch was sluggish and India turned to Harbhajan 's off - spin within eight overs .
But the groundsman 's insistence that the surface is a week underprepared warns that this will not turn out to be the sort of mind - numbing surface as the last Test in March when South Africa made 540 in their first innings and India responded with 627 .
Strauss and Cook made 63 on a sedate morning session , both left - handers relying heavily on nudges and sweeps down the legside , Strauss not scoring a single run on the offside before lunch .
It was Cook who initially looked the most authoritative , a flowing on - drive against Zaheer Khan identifying him , mistakenly as it turned out , as the batsman most likely to go on to three figures .
Strauss needed television replays to survive on 36 when he scraped a ball from Mishra on the half - volley to Rahul Dravid at first slip .
It was against Mishra that England began to progress , Cook lofting him confidently into the deep to reach his half - century , but that was his last scoring shot as he tried to treat Harbhajan in the same dismissive manner and skied to wide mid-on , losing his wicket to Zaheer for 52 .
From 164 - 1 at tea , England lost four wickets in the final session as the spinners begin to make the odd one bounce and Zaheer and Sharma made the ball reverse - swing .
Ian Bell 's growing number of detractors will not be appeased by his departure .
Zaheer went through his familiar stretching calf - stretching routine after tea , pulling his legs behind his back , and had Bell lbw to his second ball , a slack shot that suggested the batsman was more in need of a mental warm - up routine .
Kevin Pietersen was out of sorts throughout his half - hour stay , as disorientated as Strauss was orderly , a captain who had spoken of sleepless nights during the stress of the past two weeks .
His first sign of adventure , a botched pull agaimst Zaheer , brought his downfall for just four runs .
Someone else who looked in sore need of acclimatisation was Billy Bowden , the New Zealand umpire , a late replacement for Asad Rauf , who had to withdraw when he was unable to update his city - specific visa .
Cricket 's respect for its umpires is rightly treasured , but Bowden 's decision against Paul Collingwood , would have him banished to the second division the following week had he been a Premier League referee for some rest and resuscitation .
Collingwood virtually withdrew his bat as he allowed a delivery from Harbhajan to strike his pad .
His bat was not within inches , the ball was heading way down the legside .
Bowden gave him out .
To aggravate matters , it was a repeat of an equally bad decision against Collingwood at Lord 's five months ago , the South African slow left - armer , Paul Harris , this time benefiting from Bowden 's error as Hashim Amla held on at short leg .
England 's position of strength had been lost .
A general invitation for them to attend the annual Chennai policeman 's ball , conveniently staged in the team hotel , did not immediately promise to brighten their mood .
A Post By : Darren Rowse
“ I ’m doing some research into lenses for my DSLR and have come across lenses being referred to as Prime lenses .
What is a Prime Lens and why would I consider them instead of a Zoom lens ? ”
Thanks for the question , you ’re not alone in asking it .
As DSLRs come down in price I ’m finding more and more readers are doing the upgrade and are asking questions about what type of lenses are best .
Let me start by pointing you to introduction to DSLR Lenses post which will give you some definitions of different types of lenses .
To recap from that post :
What is a Prime Lens ?
A prime lens is a lens that has one focal length only .
They come in all focal lengths ranging from wide angle ones through to the longer telephoto ones .
What is a Zoom Lens ?
A zoom lens is a lens that has a range of focal lengths available to the photographer in the one lens .
These have become increasingly popular over the past few years as they are obviously a very convenient lens to have on your camera as they mean you can shoot at both wide and longer focal lengths without having to switch lenses mid shoot .
As you surf around different camera forums you ’ll find people who argue strongly for both prime and zoom lenses .
Each have their own fans and each will pull different arguments out about them .
Let ’s look at some of the pros and cons Zoom and Prime lenses :
Arguments for Prime Lenses
Let ’s explore some of the common arguments for Prime lenses .
Keep in mind that there are many prime lenses out there and that what follows are unashamedly generalizations .
1. Quality – while zoom lenses are improving considerably in the quality that they offer their users , prime lenses are known for being high quality and having the ability to produce clean , crisp and precise shots .
This is an argument that often comes out in the prime vs zoom lens debate but it ’s worth remembering that in every manufacturers range that there are some lenses ( both zoom and prime ) that are known for being exceptionally sharp and there are some that are known as being a little muddy .
While it might be true that in general prime lenses are pretty high quality it should n’t be an assumption you make of every prime lens .
2. Price – prime lenses are generally simpler lenses in terms of construction .
By the fact that they do n’t need to zoom they generally have less moving parts and as a result they are generally cheaper to buy .
Once again – there are many factors that determine the price of a lens ( including quality ) so not all prime lenses are ‘ cheap ’ ( in fact some can be incredibly expensive at the Pro end of the spectrum ) but do some searching around and you ’ll find some that are definitely value for money .
Renowned as usually being the cheapest lenses ( but still not bad in quality ) are ‘ nifty 50 ’ lenses – or 50 mm prime lenses , particularly from Nikon or Canon .
3 . Weight – because of their simple construction you often find that prime lenses are smaller and particularly lighter lenses than zoom lenses in similar focal lengths .
My two lightest lenses are my two 50 mm lenses ( I have the f1.8 ( pictured right ) and the f1.4 – I ’m still trying to work out which one to keep ) .
They are great for heading out to locations where it is just not practical to haul lots of gear around with me .
4 . Speed – in general prime lenses are faster ( in terms of aperture ) than zoom lenses .
This is slowly changing as zoom lens improvements continue to be made by manufacturers but in the Canon range if you want extra fast lenses you ’ll start with prime lenses ( for example the 85 mm and 50 mm lenses for example ) .
This allows you to shoot in lower light without the need for a flash .
5 . Technique – one argument that gets pulled out against zoom lenses is that they make the photographer lazy .
Instead of having to move around to find the best angle for the focal length they allow the photographer to stay in the one place and just zoom in and out .
Some believe this sucks the creativity out of the process .
I ’m not sure about this one – while I do enjoy the challenge of using a prime lens ( it definitely does mean you have to work harder and think about your shots a little more ) you can still be a creative and hard working photographer with a zoom lens on your camera if you are aware of the temptation just to shoot from the one position all the time .
Arguments for Zoom Lenses
1. Portability ( another perspective ) – when prime lens proponents pull out the ‘ weight / portability ’ argument zoom lens lovers often argue that a point in favor of the zoom is that you only need to carry one lens instead of a range of lenses to have the same focal length range .
Instead of carrying around a 14 mm , 50 mm and 85 mm lens you could carry one lens that covers the full ( or close to ) range of focal lengths .
You ’ll also never have to change your lens and risk getting dust on your image sensor .
2. Price ( another perspective ) – similarly – while zoom lenses might be more expensive than prime lenses the cost of one lens in comparison to multiple lenses can often be comparable .
3. Flexibility – perhaps the biggest argument for Zoom lenses is the flexibility that the offer a photographer .
They allow someone wanting to shoot at a variety of focal lengths the ability to quickly change perspective and add variety into their shots within a second ( or a fraction of one if you ’re a quick zoomer ) .
This is ideal for many types of photography including weddings or sports where you have to constantly be looking for random shots and may not have the time ( or ability ) to physically move closer or further away from you subject .
So are Prime or Zoom lenses best ?
Obviously there is a range of factors to consider and ultimately the decision will come down to a number of factors including the type and style of photography that you do , your budget , the need for portability , how often you ’re willing to change lenses , the quality you ’re after and the shooting conditions you ’ll be shooting in .
My own approach with lenses is to go with both .
My Prime and Zoom Lenses
I ’m lucky enough to have a budget that allows me this opportunity .
I shoot with a Canon EOS 5D so these are all canon lenses – but I have a couple of 50 mm lenses ( see above ) which are great for low light situations and those times when weight is a consideration as well as a 100 mm f/2.8
Macro lens which is obviously for macro shooting but is also quite good for portraits ( an added bonus ) .
I also have a few zoom lenses a 17 - 40 mm , a 24 - 105 mm ( pictured above ) and a 70 - 200 mm which cover the full range of focal lengths that I generally shoot in .
As I mention above – there is generally a lot of variation between lenses ( both prime and zoom ) .
I find that there is especially a lot of variation in the zoom range of Canon ( and I presume for other manufacturers too ) .
Most DSLRs come with the option for a kit zoom lens which are generally of a much lower quality than a professional grade lens ( in Canon Pro lenses are designated as being ‘ L’ series lenses ) .
My advice to those shopping for a lens is that it ’s well worth investing in quality lenses .
The camera body definitely has an impact on the quality of your shots but lens quality is where you can really take your photography to the next level .
Do some careful research before buying a lens and buy the best one you can afford ( without re-mortgaging the house ) .
What do You Use ?
What kind of lenses do you use and do you find best – prime lenses vs zoom lenses ( or a combination of both ) .
In our current iteration of improving our software development strategy , ASP .
NET WebForms simply does n't fit in with the new demands of being unit testable and flexible .
It comes as no surprise that ASP .
NET MVC has been getting all the headlines lately .
Like many others , I 've gotten the itch to try it out .
In this post I 'll talk about what I believe are the main pro's and con's of the new style for building web applications .
PRO - No ViewState or " surprise crap "
In traditional ASP.
NET WebForms , the luxury of pretending to behave like a Windows Form comes at a price .
The ViewState is a reliable way of storing all of the state information for the form .
Unfortunately , due to the limitations of the web , this data needs to be a giant string inside of a hidden form field .
This ends up adding a substantial number of bytes to the page , making it slower and requiring extra bandwidth .
Of course the ViewState is controllable , much like the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park .
Not only is the ViewState gone , but " mystery " generated HTML is also gone .
You have strict control over the HTML .
This gives you great power , but with great power comes great responsibility .
Use it wisely , and you will have elegant XHTML output with no surprises .
You need to really know your HTML , which in today 's web world is a prerequisite anyway .
PRO - Faster server-side
It 's hard to get any real performance data about MVC , but it 's been suggested that it 's potentially 8000 times faster .
Supposedly it 's due to less processing since it simply processes a " template " instead of having to build a complicated control tree .
Even if it 's twice as fast , or even marginally faster , that would be significant for popular sites , or give at least a slight boost to smaller sites .
PRO - Simplified model for multiple related views
One thing that I found much easier to do with MVC was to have multiple versions of a page that displayed the same data , but in a slightly different format .
For example , on my RSS package tracking website , you can look at your tracking information in a full - featured desktop browser , a mobile browser , or an RSS reader .
The data being displayed is always the same , but the actual rendered output was different .
If I later want to make an iPhone specific version for example , I would simply make a new view , and use an existing controller action .
PRO - Unit testable
One of the biggest challenges with WebForms was that testing was difficult .
Not only was the actual output not easy to test , but the code - behind would tend to be a place that would contain important code that would never get unit tested .
With both MVC and WebForms , it 's best to keep your logic away from the page , but it 's not always easy or ideal .
MVC makes it simple to unit test the logic that is specific to a page .
To do so , you simply test the actions in your controllers , which are regular , easy to test classes .
CON - Difficult to convert an existing site
MVC is not only a framework in this case , but a style .
It is possible to convert specific pages as needed , but the cost is high .
The problem is that MVC is radically different , so the benefit of converting probably is n't worth it for most of your existing pages .
If you decide to convert your site to MVC , you may also run into issues trying to maintain existing page addresses .
The specific issue I 've ran into is that routes cannot have a trailing slash .
If you want to maintain existing URL's that have trailing slashes , there is no way to have the built - in routing generate URL's with a trailing slash .
You may end up losing one of the big advantages that MVC has to offer .
CON - Not best for SEO out of the box
I 've mentioned some of the SEO issues before , and all but the trailing slash issue have a reasonable workaround .
The routing engine likes to allow multiple addresses to render the same page , instead of enforcing a single address for each page .
Luckily , as Scott Hanselman mentions , you can use a URL rewrite engine to bend it to your will .
I highly recommend spending some time writing intelligent rules that perform the necessary 301 redirects , because you do n't want to take chances with SEO ( Search Engine Optimization ) .
CON - Challenges if you 're not running IIS7
It 's clear that the last couple of versions of IIS have been major improvements over their predecessors .
IIS7 takes .NET integration to an entirely new level .
There is already a good page that covers the challenges you 'll face if you 're not running IIS6 .
I 'll just list them here for brevity :
. NET needs to handle all page requests to ensure that the MVC pages will be processed .
This leads to bad performance of static files .
HTTP Compression through IIS6 does n't work , because the MVC pages are dynamic .
The homepage gives a 404 when hosted on the root of a domain .
Summary
If I needed to build a new site from scratch , and was able to use IIS7 , it would be extremely likely that I would choose ASP .
NET MVC .
It 's a joy to work with ( possibly because it 's " new " ) , and just makes sense .
If I needed to work with an existing site , I would certainly have to consider the pro's and con's I mentioned above .
ASP .NET MVC gives us an amazing new tool in our huge Microsoft toolbox .
Mr Moffat said he had been offered £ 10 compensation by the bank A student from Ayrshire was left in a state of shock when his online banking statement showed him to be overdrawn by almost £ 100 bn .
Donald Moffat , 38 , from Irvine , said that on Tuesday morning his Barclays account was showing two separate withdrawals of £ 50 bn .
The bank said a " technical error " was to blame and apologised .
Mr Moffat said Barclays also offered £ 10 in compensation for the phone calls he had to make to resolve the error .
The full - time student , who is also a part - time care worker , e-mailed a copy of his bank statement to BBC Scotland .
It showed a debit balance on 30 December of just under £ 100bn .
Mr Moffat said on Tuesday morning his wife had noticed " a major discrepancy of two £ 50bn debits " being taken out of his account .
The problem was immediately identified and corrected within less than an hour , and all affected customer accounts are now showing correct balances
Barclays statement " We knew we still had quite a bit left in the account as we checked last night before we went out , " he said .
" This morning I went out to get a few things , then , when I came back , my account was overdrawn by that amount . "
Mr Moffat said he had " been passed from pillar to post " after making the error known to Barclays .
He also said he was looking for the bank to increase its offer of compensation for the level of stress he had been put under in trying to resolve the situation .
In a statement Barclays said : " Earlier today a technical error caused some customer accounts to be incorrectly debited .
" The problem was immediately identified and corrected within less than an hour , and all affected customer accounts are now showing correct balances .
" No customers will be financially impacted by this error .
We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused our customers . "

Does anyone know where George W. Bush is ?
You do n’t hear much from him anymore .
The last image most of us remember is of the president ducking a pair of size 10s that were hurled at him in Baghdad .
We ’re still at war in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Israel is thrashing the Palestinians in Gaza .
And the U.S. economy is about as vibrant as the 0 - 16 Detroit Lions .
But hardly a peep have we heard from George , the 43rd .
When Mr. Bush officially takes his leave in three weeks ( in reality , he checked out long ago ) , most Americans will be content to sigh good riddance .
I disagree .
I do n’t think he should be allowed to slip quietly out of town .
There should be a great hue and cry  a loud , collective angry howl , demonstrations with signs and bullhorns and fiery speeches  over the damage he ’s done to this country .
This is the man who gave us the war in Iraq and Guantánamo and torture and rendition ; who turned the Clinton economy and the budget surplus into fool ’s gold ; who dithered while New Orleans drowned ; who trampled our civil liberties at home and ruined our reputation abroad ; who let Dick Cheney run hog wild and thought Brownie was doing a heckuva job .
PHILADELPHIA , December 15 , 2008 — Today the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) has released its 2009 report on campus speech codes , revealing that American colleges and universities systematically violate students ’ and faculty members ’ right to freedom of expression .
Spotlight on Speech Codes 2009 : The State of Free Speech on Our Nation ’s Campuses reports on policies at 364 American colleges and universities .
FIRE found that approximately 74 percent of schools surveyed maintain policies that clearly restrict speech that , outside the borders of campus , is protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution .
“ Unfortunately , this year ’s report demonstrates that — despite decades of precedent declaring speech codes unlawful and two decisions this year alone — the majority of colleges and universities brazenly maintain policies that violate students ’ and faculty members ’ fundamental rights , ” FIRE President Greg Lukianoff said .
“ Everyone who values the free exchange of ideas should be deeply disturbed by these findings . ”
FIRE ’s report is the most comprehensive effort to date both to quantify the proportion of colleges and universities that restrict free speech and to assess the severity of those restrictions .
The report surveyed publicly available policies at institutions ranked in the 100 “ Best National Universities ” and at the 50 “ Best Liberal Arts Colleges , ” as rated in the August 27 , 2007 , “ America ’s Best Colleges ” issue of U.S. News & World Report , as well as at 207 major public universities .
The research was conducted between September 2007 and September 2008 .
All of the policies cited in the report are available online in FIRE ’s searchable speech code database , Spotlight : The Campus Freedom Resource .
People interested in drawing attention to their institution ’s policies can easily do so by adding FIRE ’s Speech Codes Widget to their blog or website .
Easy instructions for adding the widget can be found here .
The report notes only marginal improvement among such scandalous findings as these :
The percentage of institutions maintaining clearly unconstitutional speech codes declined slightly .
While the percentage of institutions with unconstitutional speech codes — 74.2 percent — is disturbingly high , it is a slight improvement over last year , when the figure was 75 percent .

Public colleges and universities are disproportionately restricting free speech .
Public universities , as governmental entities , are legally bound to respect First Amendment rights .
Yet 77 percent of them explicitly prohibit protected speech , as compared to 67 percent of private universities .

“ Bias incident reporting ” is a growing trend whereby schools encourage students to report one another ’s “ biases ” to campus authorities .
At the University of Virginia and the University of Missouri , students may report on one another anonymously .
Other highlights of FIRE ’s research from 2007 and 2008 include :
The University of the Pacific defines harassment as “ conduct ( intentional or unintentional ) that has the effect of demeaning , ridiculing , defaming , stigmatizing , intimidating , slandering or impeding the work or movement of a person or persons or conduct that supports or parodies the oppression of others . ”
Penn State University requires its students to agree that “ I will not engage in any behaviors that compromise or demean the dignity of individuals or groups , ” including any “ taunting , ” “ ridiculing , ” or “ insulting . ”
Texas Southern University prohibits causing “ emotional , mental , physical or verbal harm to another person ” by means including “ embarrassing , degrading or damaging information , assumptions , implications , [ or ] remarks . ”
Spotlight on Speech Codes 2009 : The State of Free Speech on Our Nation ’s Campuses also chronicles the rise of speech codes in the 1980s and 1990s and discusses various ways that universities curtail free speech on campus , including election - year restrictions on political expression and the institution of unduly restrictive policies on harassment , tolerance , respect , civility , and disorderly conduct .
FIRE ’s report suggests several potential solutions to the problem of speech codes .
Many of the speech codes at public universities would likely not survive legal challenge .
FIRE ’s Speech Code Litigation Project has already led to the demise of similar codes at Citrus College , San Francisco State University , Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania , the State University of New York at Brockport , and Texas Tech University .
In August , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that a Temple University harassment policy was unconstitutional — a ruling that is binding on public universities in Delaware , New Jersey , and Pennsylvania .
“ This year , the percentage of universities maintaining unconstitutional speech codes has decreased for the first time , and that is very encouraging news , ” said Samantha Harris , FIRE ’s Director of Speech Code Research .
“ But there is still a lot of work to be done .
Many universities have changed their policies in response to public exposure , and you can count on FIRE to keep the pressure on in the years to come . ”
FIRE is a nonprofit educational foundation that unites civil rights and civil liberties leaders , scholars , journalists , and public intellectuals from across the political and ideological spectrum on behalf of individual rights , due process , freedom of expression , academic freedom , and rights of conscience at our nation ’s colleges and universities .

Lenovo and Phoenix Technologies will begin adding a feature to Lenovo notebooks that allows them to be disabled , or " remotely killed , " via a text message sent from a cell phone .
The technology , called Constant Secure Remote Disable , was launched on Tuesday .
It will be embedded within the notebook 's BIOS .
This new security feature allows a user to send an SMS ( short message service ) text message from a cell phone to a Lenovo ThinkPad that has been lost or stolen .
Once the kill command is sent , the lost or stolen ThinkPad is either disabled immediately or the notebook is disabled after the PC has been turned back on , said Stacy Cannady , Lenovo 's product manager of security .

Authorities responding to a possible suicide attempt shot and killed a 70 - year - old woman late Monday after she allegedly pointed a gun at them .
When La Habra police and Orange County sheriff ’s deputies arrived at the Chestnut Street home in unincorporated La Habra , Jerry Lunceford reportedly confronted the officers and refused to lower her weapon .
Authorities said the officers opened fire after initially using a nonlethal , beanbag - type weapon .
It was unclear whether the woman ’s weapon was loaded , and the incident is being investigated by the Orange County district attorney ’s office , a standard procedure in officer - involved shootings .

“ It would be inappropriate to assume anything at this point , ” said Assistant Sheriff Michael Hillmann on Tuesday .
“ The officers were immediately confronted . ”
A neighbor described Lunceford as a nice woman who seemed generally happy .
“ She was about as vanilla as you can get , ” said Kimberley Mohanna , who said the woman had five children and grandchildren .
Mohanna said her neighbor had recently sent her a Christmas card and had handwritten a message , wishing her a “ healthy , happy new year . ”

It was not immediately clear whether Lunceford ’s husband was home at the time of the incident , but Mohanna said she saw him later in the evening .
“ I went up to him and gave him a kiss on the cheek , ” she said .
Authorities said the call about a possible suicide attempt came in at 10:15 p.m .
A pair of La Habra police officers and three sheriff ’s deputies arrived within 15 minutes .

IN 1953 a physician named Louis Sokoloff laid a 20 - year - old college student onto a gurney , attached electrodes to his scalp and inserted a syringe into his jugular vein .
For 60 minutes the volunteer lay there and solved arithmetic problems .
All the while , Sokoloff monitored his brainwaves and checked the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in his blood .
Sokoloff , a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia , was trying to find out how much energy the brain consumes during vigorous thought .
He expected his volunteer ’s brain to guzzle more oxygen as it crunched the problems , but what he saw surprised him : his subject ’s brain consumed no more oxygen while doing arithmetic than it did while he was resting with his eyes closed .
People have long envisaged the brain as being like a computer on standby , lying dormant until called upon to do a task , such as solving a Sudoku , reading a newspaper , or looking for a face in a crowd .
Sokoloff ’s experiment provided the first glimpse of a different truth : that the brain enjoys a rich private life .
This amazing organ , which accounts for only 2 per cent of our body mass but devours 20 per cent of the calories we eat , fritters away much of that energy doing , as far as we can tell , absolutely nothing .
“ There is a huge amount of activity in the [ resting ] brain that has been largely unaccounted for , ” says Marcus Raichle , a neuroscientist at Washington University in St Louis .
“ The brain is a very expensive organ , but nobody had asked deeply what this cost is all about . ”
Raichle and a handful of others …
Subway follows Taco Bell , Burger King , and McDonald ’s by pledging to pay one cent more per tomato in order to give workers a living wage .
However , the fight now turns to the growers themselves , who have objected to the campaign and refuse to pass the money on to the workers .
[ social_buttons ]
” We ’re hopeful that the growers will stop resisting this change and help us to get the money to the workers , rather than setting up barriers , ” said Julia Perkins , a Coalition of Immokalee Workers spokesperson .
“ With every new company that signs on , it provides a lot of incentive for a forward - thinking grower to be willing to pass on the penny per pound . ”
The Coalition of Immokalee Workers is a farmworker organization with over 4,000 members that seeks better working conditions for workers and promotes treatment in accordance fair labor standards .
They have sought an extra one cent charge on tomatoes for fast food chains since 2002 , winning their first victory in 2005 when Taco Bell signed on to the campaign .
” The minute the money is in the pickers hands that ’s when it ’s a good day , ” said Jan Risi , president and chief executive of Subway ’s Independent Purchasing Cooperative .
“ If it ’s truly all about the workers , then we have to be vigilant and be sure everybody signs agreements like these and everybody agrees to the same standards . ”
The growers argue that they cannot legally accept the money because the purchase price has been set by a third party .
The vice - president of the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange said they would love to give the money , but since they cannot , he hopes the coalition of groups gathering the money would come up with an alternate means of delivery .
” I just wish someone would be a little creative and find a way to get the money to the workers , ” he said .
“ We would like to see the worker paid , but we ca n’t do it . ”

The mp3s :
Here ’s my slowed down version of The Bloop .
You wo n’t be able to hear it with tiny little computer speakers .
Either find a subwoofer or some nice over the ear headphones and crank the Cthulu Bloop :
Background :
The other day there was an article on Reddit about “ The Bloop ” –A weird sound captured by underwater hydrophone arrays in the middle of the ocean .
On top of that , the sound was caught near the place from which Chtulu is rumored to emerge .
Here is the wikipedia article about The Bloop .
The sound posted there is a edited down version of The Bloop from the NOAA ’s site .
Fine so far .
But I noticed that on both wikipedia and the NOAA site they say that the sound is sped up 16 x .
So I wanted to hear what it sounded like in realtime .
I slowed it down with audacity ( which turned out to harder than it should have been ) , and reveled in the deep bass .
Today I saw another link on Reddit to someone who had done the same thing .
I checked out their real - time sound and it did n’t sound at all like mine .
I realized that they used a pitch shifting style effect to slow the sound down without changing its pitch .
When you slow something down that much it introduces a lot of artifacts , which are clearly audible in their file .
In order to attempt to fix that they have another version that ’s been run through some sort of noise reduction filter which causes even more bloopy ( so to speak ) artifacts .
If you check the original spectrogram on the NOAA ’s site it looks like this :
Notice that the top frequency there is 50 Hz .
That is low .
We ’re talking deep bass .
So I ’m pretty sure the correct way to slow it down is to actually just slow it down and let the frequency drop all the way down .
SEPTEMBER 30 --Meet Michele Allen .
The Ohio woman , 32 , was arrested Saturday night after she got liquored up and began chasing kids and blocking traffic in her Middletown neighborhood .
Allen was wearing a cow costume at the time of her arrest , as can be seen in these mug shots ( one of which includes a clear shot of Allen 's udder ) .
A police report does not indicate why she was so dressed .
Allen pleaded guilty yesterday to disorderly conduct and sentenced to a month in the local lockup .

Hotel bombing does n’t make sense unless “ Al - Qaeda ” is working to advance Neo - Con political agenda
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Monday , September 22 , 2008
Why would “ Al - Qaeda , ” a group that is supposedly the prime target of the U.S. initiated war on terror , commit a terrorist attack against a country that has recently changed its government and all but renounced its role as a U.S. ally in the war on terror ?
The mass media has already blamed the Marriott Hotel bombing , which killed at least 53 people , on “ Al - Qaeda , ” a routine reflex action despite the lack of any real investigation and no claim of responsibility .
On Saturday morning , Newly elected Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari told his parliament , “ We will not tolerate the violation of our sovereignty and territorial integrity by any power in the name of combating terrorism . ”
Hours later and hey presto !
“ Al - Qaeda ” provides the perfect pretext for the U.S. to violate Pakistan ’s territorial integrity in the name of …. you guessed it …. combating terrorism !
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
More telling than that – had the leadership of Pakistan not cancelled their plans to dine at the Marriott Hotel at the last minute , the entire command structure of the whole country would have been decapitated .
“ Pakistan ’s top leaders were to dine at the Marriott hotel that was devastated by a truck bombing over the weekend , but changed the venue at the last minute , a senior government official said Monday , ” reports the Associated Press today .
“ Perhaps the terrorists knew that the Marriott was the venue of the dinner for all the leadership where the president , prime minister , speaker and all entire leadership would be present , ” Interior Ministry chief Rehman Malik told reporters .
“ At the eleventh hour , the president and prime minister decided that the venue would be the prime minister ’s house .
It saved the entire leadership . ”
Indeed , it seemed the “ terrorists ” did know that their prime objective was to completely wipe out the most influential players in a government that has seemingly vowed to break away from the years of Pervez Musharraf - mandated lapdog subservience to U.S. imperial whims .

The timing of this weekend ’s bombing coincides with a build - up in tensions over the past month not between Pakistan and “ Al - Qaeda , ” but between Pakistan and the United States government .
Relations between Pakistan and the U.S. soured dramatically following a raid by U.S. commandos on the border town of South Waziristan earlier this month which killed 20 people , including women and children .
Pakistani troops fired on U.S. helicopters that had violated the country ’s border a week ago and a repeat of the incident in the village of Angor Adda occurred again last night .
On September 13th , Pakistan ’s army chief Gen. Ashfaq Kayani vowed to safeguard the country ’s territorial integrity against U.S. incursions and warned of a possible direct confrontation with U.S. forces if the incursions continue .
In light of all this , does it make much sense that “ Al - Qaeda ” suddenly popped up and helped out its arch enemy the U.S. , by attempting to wipe out the Pakistani leadership ?
It only makes sense if “ Al - Qaeda , ” or whoever carried out the bombing , was working to further the geopolitical agenda of the Neo -Cons in control of the White House .
“ After several weeks of international bad press because of drone planes being piloted by 19 year olds with joy - sticks in California , blowing up families in Pakistan willy - nilly , after all that , the “ terrorists ” in Pakistan decide to blow up a second rate hotel there , killing civilians , and making them the bad guys once again ?
How ’s that for the worst timing ever , huh ?
Well , the worst timing for them and the best possible timing for those troubled U.S. Military PR guys and all the politicians who had been saying just a month ago we need to step up military action in Pakistan , ” writes Scott Creighton .
“ The end result of this attack is to give the U.S. Army and the American politicians all the reason in the world that they would need to continue attacking Pakistan ’s population , and taking the international pressure off the Americans to stop bombing their country . ”
The playbook that the CIA has employed over and over again in places like Central America , Italy , Cuba , South America and the Middle East for decades to destabilize and overthrow governments is a tried and tested formula .
A strategically located country with a newly elected , populist government , vowing not to sacrifice the interests of its people for the U.S. imperial agenda , is almost immediately attacked by unknown “ terrorists , ” creating fear , chaos , and a demand from the population for “ protection ” that cannot be provided by the weakened ruling party , creating a power vacuum and an opportunity for the mighty U.S. war machine to step back into the fold , promising to chase away the evil deadly terrorists .

Unlike what 's said in highly dramatized Hollywood shockumentaries , fast food is not especially unhealthy .

Join me for a cheeseburger and a Coke as we put our feet up , get grease all over ourselves , and examine the deeply - rooted pop culture belief that fast food is bad for you .
And here 's a thing of honey - mustard sauce to drink for dessert .
The questionable nutritional value of fast food , and of McDonald 's in particular , came under its closest scrutiny when documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock released Super Size Me in 2004 .
The movie documented his own experience living exclusively on McDonald 's food for 30 days .
He averaged 5,000 calories a day , and when you consider that a Big Mac contains only 510 calories , you know that he was really packing it in .
He super - sized every meal that was offered .
Most dramatic was Spurlock 's reported health problems .
Not only did he gain 13 % of his body weight , he also developed liver problems , depression and other psychological effects , and sexual dysfunction .
Super Size
Me also contained a large amount of editorial content about how McDonald 's deliberately forces cheap , unhealthy food onto an unsuspecting public for profit .
Super Size
Me was the most popular documentary of the year , and was nominated for an academy award .
Its claims were generally accepted without critique by nearly everyone who watched it or even just heard about it .
But this result was virtually guaranteed by Spurlock 's choice of subject matter .
McDonald 's is probably the world 's easiest target .
It 's always popular to be anticorporate ; it 's always popular to bash fast foods , and audiences are generally well predisposed to welcome any information that supports these concepts .
Spurlock 's results were only presented in his movie .
No actual data was published or subjected to any scrutiny or peer review .
We have only his verbal statements to go on , plus the lines delivered onscreen by the doctor and nutritionist who performed in his movie .
This is a Hollywood entertainment , it 's not valid scientific data .
However , for the sake of argument , my inclination is to give Spurlock the benefit of the doubt and accept his claims as valid , and accept the movie dialog as actual opinions of unbiased health professionals .
From the perspective of responsible empiricism , that 's a stretch , but I 'm willing to do it .
The problem is that Spurlock 's results are highly deviant from other research on the same subject .
You see , Morgan Spurlock is not the only person to have ever tested fast - food - only diets , or even McDonald 's - only diets .
After his movie came out , many people repeated his experiment themselves , including a number of scientific institutions that applied controls and conducted the research in a scientific manner .
At least three other documentary movies were made , Bowling for Morgan , Portion Size Me , and Me and Mickey D , in which the filmmakers lived exclusively on McDonald 's food for 30 days but ( unlike Spurlock ) did not force themselves to overeat when they were not hungry .
All filmmakers lost weight during the period and suffered no ill effects ; and the subjects in Portion Size Me , which was scientifically controlled , also had improved cholesterol .
Most famously , Swedish scientist Fredrik Nyström conducted an experiment with eighteen students ; only he upped the ante — considerably .
Rather than Spurlock 's 5,000 calories per day , Nyström 's subjects were required to consume a measured 6,000 calories per day .
The food was controlled to ensure that most of the calories were from saturated fats .
The subjects were not allowed to exercise during the 30 days , also unlike Spurlock , who made sure that he walked a normal distance every day .
Considering these differences , Nyström 's subjects should have been considerably worse off than Spurlock was , but they were n't .
They did all gain 5 - 15 % extra body weight , and complained of feeling tired ; but none suffered any other negative effects .
There were no mysterious psychological problems , no strange conditions that baffled the doctors .
Nyström and his medical staff noted no dangerous changes at all .
After his experiment , Nyström was asked his opinion of Spurlock 's extreme reaction , especially his liver problems .
Having never examined Spurlock , Nyström could only guess , but among two of his perfectly reasonable hypotheses were that Spurlock may have had pre-existing undiagnosed liver problems ; or that his normally vegetarian diet may have rendered his liver poorly prepared to suddenly deal with a diet high in carbohydrates and saturated fat , a problem that anyone eating a normal diet would not experience .
Any cynic can also easily propose a third possibility , that Spurlock was simply trying to make as dramatic , engaging , and commercial a movie as he could , which is the goal of every filmmaker .
Public relations required McDonald 's to respond to Super Size Me , and their response was fairly low key .
They basically just agreed that it 's best to eat a balanced diet , and stated that any actual ill effects experienced by Spurlock were more the result of force - feeding himself 5,000 calories a day for a month , than they were indicative of anything bad about McDonald 's food .
Way too much of any food is going to be bad for you .
That response suggests the next thing to look at .
Is McDonald 's food , and other fast food in general , actually bad for you ?
Dr. Dean Edell once took a call on his radio show from a woman whose teenage daughter ate a fast food hamburger every day .
The woman was worried that her daughter would develop malnutrition .
Quite the contrary , said Dr. Edell :
She might gain weight if she ate a lot of them , but malnutrition is that last thing she should worry about .
A hamburger is actually quite a balanced meal , rich with just about every nutrient .
Add a slice of cheese and it even contains all four food groups .
Fast food hamburgers are excellent sources of protein , calcium , and iron .
McDonald 's hamburgers are not even as grossly calorific as most people probably think .
Their biggest burger , the Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese , contains 740 calories .
Three of those a day , which is more than anyone reasonably eats , still amounts to a good , healthy , slim 2,200 calorie diet for an adult .
The real offenders on fast food menus are not the hamburgers at all , but the drinks ; especially the milkshakes .
Where Spurlock gained his weight was from the milkshakes .
McDonald 's 32 - ounce Chocolate Triple Thick Shake packs 1,160 calories .
Personally , I can't even imagine drinking a 32 - ounce shake !
A more common size , the 16 - ounce , is 580 calories , or slightly more than a Big Mac.
McDonald 's biggest breakfast will also get you :
The large Deluxe Breakfast delivers 1,140 calories .
This may sound like a lot , but in fact it 's not really much more than any average balanced breakfast .
By now you 're saying " OK fine , McDonald 's food may not be as high in calories as people think , but the real reason it 's bad is that it 's chock - full of trans - fats , sodium , saturated fats , and cholesterol . "
That would be bad indeed .
The United States and Canada both use a system called the Dietary Reference Intake to establish ideal levels of nutrients .
These four compounds listed have an ideal level of " as low as possible " , except sodium .
Ideally you should take 1500mg of sodium each day , and you should not take in more than 2300 mg .
McDonald 's poster child of evil , the Big Mac , delivers 1040 mg of sodium , about 2/3 of your daily ideal .
Not a problem by itself , but do n't eat three of them .
The Big Mac delivers 10g of saturated fat , which is 10g more than you want ; but realistically it 's virtually impossible to get zero .
The Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organization recommend that you keep your saturated fat intake under 7 % of your daily caloric intake , and the Big Mac fulfills half of that .
So , in short , two Big Macs a day maxes out your recommended safe levels of saturated fat .
The Big Mac 's 75 mg of cholesterol represents 1/4 of the CDC and World Health Organization 's daily recommended maximum .
I 'm not going to eat four of them a day , so that 's not a problem .
Finally , the scariest mugshot on the CDC's Ten Most Wanted poster : trans - fats .
Beginning in 2003 with some high - profile class action lawsuits filed against major food producers , the fast food restaurant chains have all pledged to switch to cooking oils free of trans - fats .
Some have completed this , others , including McDonald 's , are still completing the switch .
But although it 's possible to eliminate the addition of trans - fats to fried foods , some foods , like meat and some vegetables , contain naturally occurring trans - fat.
2 - 5 % of the fat in livestock is trans - fat .
Whether you order a Big Mac or barbecue your own organic filet mignon , you 're getting trans - fat .
McDonald 's does n't add it , and your neighborhood butcher has no way of reducing it .
A big Mac ( or any comparable meat of the same quantity ) contains 1.5g of trans - fat , which is more than you want , but only about 8 % of the daily amount the World Health Organization says you really , really need to keep it under .
Eight percent — the Big Mac is hardly the monster it 's made out to be .
So eat up , and I 'll see you at the drive - thru .
Correction :
An earlier version of this incorrectly said the Nyström study had seven subjects .
Eighteen is correct .

And so , at this reflective time of year , we come to a task we 've been saving for you – choosing the recipient of the Independent on Sunday Most Ludicrous Briton Award .
This country is fortunate in being blessed with eccentrics , oddballs , incompetents , fools and misfits – many of whom hold public office .
To celebrate this , and the doings of others whose role in our national life is largely self - appointed , we have instituted this utterly unprestigious and , frankly , worthless , prize .
The winner receives nothing , but you can win some bubbly , of which more in a moment .
We have nominated 50 Britons ( including a few foreign chums we have deemed honorary Brits ) who have distinguished themselves this past year by being , in some profound way , ludicrous .
They range from Michael Martin , the hapless Speaker of the House of Commons , to Prince Andrew , John Humphrys and Boris Johnson , to Andrew Marr , Max Mosley , Nigella Lawson and Ronnie Wood .
They also include some generic types , such as rottweiler owners , whooping TV audiences , nannying railway station announcers and middle - aged Dr Who fans .
For each one , we have presented a totally jaundiced case for the prosecution , and a somewhat half - hearted case for the defence .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Prince Andrew
Prosecution :
By birth , a prince ; by inclination , a golf - club lothario ; and by profession , a freeloader .
While his brothers and sisters make some contribution to national life , Andrew is like the duff manager at work who can't be sacked , and so is put in charge of " special projects " , of which there turn out to be none at all .
And so , under the ludicrous pretext of drumming up business for Britain , " Air Miles " Andy is recycled around the globe on assorted planes , yachts and helicopters .
There must be a cheaper solution .
Defence : Seems a nice , clubbable bloke , even if the club some people would like to apply to him is a seven iron .
Keeps on commendably good terms with his ex-wife .
The only member of the Royal Family you 'd like to take for a drink .
Dawn French
Prosecution : ' Vicar of Dibley ' .
No other reason is needed .
In a more civilised society , this would be sufficient to warrant a long stretch in Holloway .
Defence :
She is not the first good comedian to find herself trapped by an inane character in a mystifyingly successful show .
She does n't write it – just gurnsin it .
Helped found Comic Relief , campaigns for the bigger - boned woman , and seems to be a happy old sort .
John McCririck
Prosecution : Channel 4 is mercifully restricting future on - screen appearances by this betting pundit and ' Celebrity Big Brother ' contestant , a bewhiskered buffoon who appears to buy his clothes from theatrical costumiers ' closing - down sales .
At the track he shouts aggressively at the camera and spectators alike , his arm - waving an unwelcome distraction from the racing .
Will his wife , Jenny , whom he charmingly calls " the Booby " , appreciate this serial misogynist spending more time at home ?
Long odds for that .
Defence : Never afraid to chide bookies and jockeys , he has always stood apart from the sport 's comfy establishment .
And they 've always stood as far apart from him as they can .

Prosecution : A screechingly unoriginal peddler of kitsch , smutty campery , Norton gives gay men everywhere a bad press .
His every appearance gives credence to the notion that all homosexuals are obsessed with sex , glitter and lilac upholstery to the exclusion of any other hobbies .
Defence : Oooooooh !
Amy Winehouse
Prosecution :
The nightmare reanimated corpse of a 1950s housewife whose self - promotion as a cipher for contemporary feminine degeneracy has become passé .
All beehive and bad behaviour .
Someone needs to prise the vodka from her terrible crack - stained fingers and get her back into the recording studio , sharpish .
Defence :
She can sing .
Er , that 's it .
Ant & Dec
Prosecution :
The smiling , laddish and authentically regional voices and faces of television show voting quackery .
Just as call centres like nice , down - to - earth , why - aye - man Geordie voices for cold calling , so these are TV 's aggravatingly chirpy premium - rate chappies .
Their only function for intelligent viewers is as a brainless programme alert service : letting you know that anything they front will not be worth your time .
Defence : Cheesy , but harmless , and certainly more engaging than almost any other TV duo .
They were n't responsible for the telephone line shenanigans on one of their shows , had the decency to apologise publicly , and said they would donate future profits from one of the shows to charity .
Bagpuss
Prosecution :
The first fat cat to achieve television fame .
Heavily promoted by his agent as " the most important , the most beautiful , the most magical , saggy old cloth cat in the whole wide world " , he always struggled to live up to his billing , was given few speaking parts , and soon became a rather pompous " celebrity " .
Defence :
An early victim of cosmetic surgery , when a firm giving him a makeover made a blunder and his ginger striped coat was turned pink .
It was a huge psychological blow , and , after only 13 episodes , he retired .
He now lives in the Rupert Bear Museum , Canterbury , a twilight home for recovering children 's TV stars .
Banksy
Prosecution : A talent for draughtsmanship , yes ; but an even greater one for self - promotion .
His guerrilla street art , which seemed fresh when it first appeared , has long since become one of the country 's longest - running and most tiresome publicity stunts .
The work is still pleasing to the eye , but the presentation of this " anonymous " artist as radical and chic is wearing very thin .
His message rarely gets through , either .
On London Zoo's penguin enclosure he once wrote " We 're bored of fish " , but the penguins just kept eating .
Defence :
See that bloke over there , spray - painting that wall ?
That 's vandalism , that is .
But Banksy , well , he 's better at it , see ?
So it 's art .
Cherie Blair
Prosecution :
So loathed that we yearn to find the features that will redeem her .
But then , no sooner does she write a sensible article on penal reform than up she pops in Australia taking a fat fee for a thin speech .
Then it's off to Knight , Frank and Rutley , eager to add another fancy property to the portfolio .
It 's the insecurity of a deprived Scouse childhood , we 're told .
Looks like something more pathological to us .
Defence :
Thrust by her husband 's success into a limelight she never craved .
And what PM's wife would refuse to cash in on her position ?
OK , so Sarah Brown has n't , Samantha Cameron wo n't , and others who did n't include Mary Wilson , Audrey Callaghan , Norma Major , Dorothy Macmillan , Violet Attlee , Clemmie Churchill ...
Hm .
Can I get back to you ?
Sir Ian Blair
Prosecution :
The accused has been known to police for many years as an incorrigible old management lag .
Officers have observed him on many occasions in the act of obsessing over targets , and have many recordings of him talking in management - speak to fellow - conspirators .
Such is the volume of material – on everything from the shooting of unarmed civilians to the heavy - handed pursuit of citizens who have broken what were once no more than by - laws , and milking cash from marginally over - the - speed - limit motorists – that we are asking for time to prepare a full list of charges .
Defence :
In view of the number of lawsuits between members of his management team , Sir Ian 's defence is sub judice .
Dr Ken Boston
Prosecution : Until last night Head of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority , and here to represent the test - obsessed , multi-choice , grade - degrading , demi-literate , spelling - error - tolerating , A - Level - lite decline of English and Welsh education .
Is this due to : a ) excessive government interference ; b ) an irrational fear of being " judgemental " ; c ) a nationwide scam to cover up a fall in standards ; or d ) all three ?
Answer on one side of the paper only .
Marks given for writing your name , and regurgitating the relevant National Curriculum Subject Notes .
Defence :
It is unfair to denigrate so many officials who are on the way to a 99.9 per cent rating on the government 's bureaucratic excellence scale .
Promising results were even obtained by some without parental help .
Sir Ian Botham
Prosecution : Everyone wanted to be like Botham when they were younger but , since he started doing TV commentary , everyone wants to hit him .
Slags off every England player ( apart from his mates Pietersen and Flintoff ) and then , when someone has the temerity to ask who he'd pick , says : " I 'd drop him and bring in him , him , him and him . "
All very well , if it was 14 a side .
Defence :
All possibly true , yet it is but piffling grapeshot against his immortal role in the greatest cricket match of all time .
July 1981 : England , following on , were 135 for 7 , and 92 behind .
Botham caught fire , scoring 149 not out , then helped to bowl Australia , needing only 130 to win , out for 111 .
A victory so inspiring that Englishmen spoke spontaneously in the street to each other .
Bullingdon Club
Prosecution :
It 's not the uniform ( £ 3,000 for a get - up that makes them resemble wine waiters at a Dubai hotel ) ; it 's not even the bread - roll - throwing hooray hooliganism at their dinners .
It 's those haughty public schoolboy faces sneering down their noses into the lens of any passing camera .
They are living proof that there is no relation between a natural aristocracy and those whom a series of genetic accidents has thrown up .
Defence :
There are only a few of them , and their youthful toff antics leave them with a residue of guilt that then informs their dealings with the world for the rest of their lives .
The excellent Lord Longford , for instance , or even David Dimbleby .
And , hopefully , David Cameron .
Chuggers
Prosecution : Excuse me , do you have a moment ?
I wonder if you 've ever considered how much misery is caused by formerly unemployed young people stopping honest citizens in the street and trying to get them to make a covenanted gift .
Just £ 10 a month from every one they stop today will produce a sizable income for the firm they work for .
A percentage will even go to charity .
Just give me all your bank account details , sign here , and we 'll do the rest .
Defence :
What 's the problem ?
The charity profits , lots of young , pleasantly spoken young people have a job – everyone gains .
And what 's so special about your life that you can't spare a few seconds to politely decline to give .
Cheapskate .
Giles Coren
Prosecution :
The pin-up boy of the " Do you know who I am ? " classes .
His notorious diatribe against a ' Times ' sub-editor who had the temerity to change his copy ( " I have written 350 restaurant reviews for ' The Times ' and I have never ended on an unstressed syllable .
Fuck , fuck , fuck , fuck " ) was not so much arrogant as tellingly revealing about his own ignorance of the finer points of print production .
But then , having a famous father , he did n't have to learn his craft from the ground up .
Defence : Unfair .
His work has given pleasure to scores .
His novel ' Winkler ' was widely admired , he won the 2005 Bad Sex in Fiction Award , and he has appeared with distinction in a Bird 's Eye frozen foods commercial .
Characters in ' EastEnders ' who shout all the time
Prosecution :
You just do n't get to be an ' EastEnders ' character unless you have anger management problems .
You know , real WHA'CHULOOKIN ' AT ?
issues .
Thus , 30 minutes of people turning even the most prosaic of daily exchanges into a slanging match .
First character : " Good morning . "
Second character : " WHADDYA MEAN ' GOOD MORNING '?
WOSS GOODABO'IT , YOU SLAG ! "
Defence : Calm down , it 's only a soap opera .
OK , so it lacks the humour and warmth of ' Coronation Street ' , but there 's clearly a market for a programme that presents personalities even more dysfunctional than those we meet in real life .
It 's therapy .
Huw Edwards
Prosecution :
Here as the figurehead of BBC television news and its simpering , patronising transformation into a spin - off from ' Blue Peter ' .
Not content with regarding viewers as simpletons who must have everything spelt out and illustrated in Ladybird book graphics , newscasters and reporters insist on addressing each other by their first names .
Much more of this and they 'll be wanting us to know them as " Uncle This " and " Auntie That " , and handing each other badges for covering stories .
Defence :
There are very few Welsh people at the forefront of British public life , and so we should value the few we do have .
Besides , the news is so often so brutal that , unless there was a warmth and accessibility about its presentation , we 'd all turn off .
Back to you , Huw .
Alex Ferguson & Arsène Wenger
Prosecution : Successful , wealthy , but morally suspect .
In the face of all evidence , they will cling to an absurdly myopic view of anything involving their own clubs or players .
However gross the behaviour , bestial the tackle or cheating the dive , these men will utter no words of condemnation , nor take any public action that might suggest sportsmanship was not yet dead .
How very different to the managers of old , like Sir Matt Busby , who could , would and did take action against the cheats and cloggers in his midst .
Defence :
All I know is that with 20 seconds to go , and the score 1 - 1 , all our players went down in the penalty area , and the ref pointed to the spot .
You can't argue with that .
Diarmuid Gavin
Prosecution : Professional Oirishman and horticultural paranoid who attributes his lack of medallion success at the Chelsea Flower Show to being a free - thinking outsider with radical ideas that disturb the Establishment - minded status quo .
In fact , it 's due to his gardens being either silly or impractical .
Defence :
His gardens are challenging and have shown much improved planting of late .
And heaven knows we need an antidote to the plum - in - their - mouths , floppy - haired , public schoolboy designers who are horticulture 's perennial establishment .
Golf spectators who shout ' Get in the hole ! '
Prosecution : Almost always American , they shout it on the tee of a par - 5 , from the rough , and , incessantly , from round the green , thus defining themselves as jerks who know nothing about the game .
It 's about time some leading professionals condemned these idiots .
Defence :
They pay gate money .
They get off their butts and go and support the players .
And if their enthusiasm lacks the restrained subtleties of a Scottish gallery in the gloom of an Ayrshire July , then so be it .
Alan Green
Prosecution : A strident football commentator who seems convinced that Radio 5 Live listeners would rather hear his opinions on the game in general than any meaningful description of the action unfolding in front of him .
Loves a feud – his hate figures include one of his own colleagues and Manchester United 's manager , Sir Alex Ferguson ( they have n't spoken since 1993 ) .
Many others would count it a blessing never to have to listen to him again .
Defence : Well , as attacks go , that was pretty feeble .
No penetration , a lack of width , and I really think that if this went on until the crack of doom , they would n't get through this formidable defence .
I have to say ...
Oh. 1 -0 ! That really was out of the blue .
Orla Guerin
Prosecution :
She came at dawn .
On breakfast television .
Her report using few words .
But with pauses .
In between .
She thinks .
This sounds .
More dramatic .
But it does n't .
Just clichéd .
Defence : Brave , has reported from Russia , Africa , the Middle East and the Balkans .
Won umpteen awards .
Does n't trade .
On her gender .
Oh God .
It 's catching .
Head of Service – Inclusion and Participation Strategy and Commissioning
Prosecution : Post advertised , at £ 56,268 -£ 61,392 a year , by Wigan council , and here as representative of local government bullshit .
This is a world of stakeholders , initiative - takers , outreach programmes , transgender counselling , resilience managers , cycling enablement and quality - assurance operatives .
It is a world , too , of meaningless mission statements , where all of Anytown 's literature , vehicles , posters , hoardings and hi-vis jackets must all declare an asinine motto such as ' Putting Anytown First ' .
Defence :
We are referring this to our Media Empowerment Strategy Team to prepare an appropriate response .
They will report by April .
Damien Hirst
Prosecution : Widely regarded as an artist , but really just a manufacturer of artefacts – objects that lack feeling , meaning or even originality – for the investing classes .
One day they will wake up and find they have bought the saleroom equivalents of bankers ' derivatives .
Has made a fortune from the reductionist argument that anything can be art so long as someone says it is .
To those who wonder whether his conglomerate 's work will speak to future generations , we ask : what intrinsic ( as opposed to cultural ) meaning do they convey to this one ?
That having something to sell is more important than having something to say , perhaps .
Defence : Innovative , challenging and has raised the worldwide profile of British art .
Gives to charity , and employs a lot of people .
John Humphrys
Prosecution : A hectoring saloon - bar boor whose only technique is to play devil 's advocate .
He has done this for so long that he has ceased to be able to distinguish between a minor policy disagreement and the collapse of civilisation .
Makes the ' Today ' programme unlistenable to , and ...
Defence : I must interrupt you to point out ...
Prosecution :
You 're not listening , are you ?
You have failed to answer any of these points , have n't you ?
Defence : But I was just trying to ...
Prosecution :
Well , that 's all we have time for .
Now , the weather .
Boris Johnson
Prosecution : A ludicrously successful example of the PR double - bluff .
Ah , say those " in the know " , what you see is not what you get ; for behind that bumbling , jokey , hair - and - mind - all - over - the - place exterior is a razor - sharp and ruthless intelligence .
So successful has this viral marketing of Boris been that no one considers the obvious : that behind the gags and self - deprecating humour there lurks a good old fashioned , Bullingdon - joining , old Etonian toff .
Defence : Gosh , er , well , whiff - whaff 's coming home and I think we can all be proud of that .
I should also add that my election pledge to reduce unnecessary layers of management is being carried out , albeit via a series of enforced resignations .
Kevin Keegan
Prosecution : Sometime inspirational and technically expert football manager who has built an even bigger reputation for being what the upper classes used to call a " bolter " – one who can be relied upon to leg it at the first sign of trouble .
So entrenched is this view of him that , when his name is linked to a new job , speculation immediately centres on how soon it would be before he walked out on it .
Defence :
Well , we have here , to explain his departure in person , Kevin Keegan himself .
Kevin , I 'd like to start by asking you ...
Kevin ?
Kevin ?
Oh dear , he seems to have gone .
Nigella Lawson
Prosecution :
The erotic fascination that Ms Lawson reserves for traybakes would be forgivable if she did n't earn millions making the rest of us feel inadequate .
No real person has time and inclination to lick their lips seductively while flavouring cookies with organic cardamom .
She might be nice as pecan pie in real life ; it 's the unreconstructed image we object to .
Defence :
Well , at least she can do a cookery show without effing and blinding at the drop of a spatula .
Gary Lineker
Prosecution : OK , so he was a prolific scorer for England and a masterful poacher , and his cheeky grin was endearing for a while .
But it should n't be enough to sustain a career outside football .
His Walkers crisps ads and attempts at being a lad in ' They Think It 's All Over ' became increasingly irritating .
Then he was made the BBC 's face of golf , casting aside his little - boy - lost image for an attitude of gloom and mumbling .
Golf on TV was bad enough before .
Defence :
Was that how it looked to you , Alan ?
Alan Hansen :
Well , you cannae fault the lad for effort .
But I 'm afraid for me at this level ...
Defence : Wrighty ?
Ian Wright : I think my boy done great .
Defence : Well .
Opinions divided here on an extraordinary night for British sport .
Lycra fascists
Prosecution :
They 've got the bike , the 21 gears , the tailor - made saddle , and the full day - glo Lycra kit .
What they have n't got , however , is any sense .
Instead , they have a belief that global warming has given them the moral high ground , an inalienable justification for squirting at full pelt down side streets , on pavements and up alleys , and a permanent right of way .
Wrong .
Defence :
So they can look a bit poncy in their face masks , but these are the carbon - positive vanguard of the new green world order .
Go pick on a white - van man or gas - guzzling driver instead .
Andrew Marr
Prosecution :
He 's here , he 's there , he 's every bloody where , whether it 's being all matey and Westminsterish with politicos on a Sunday morning , or as the voice - over for yet another swooping helicopter shot in a documentary series .
Lately , these have descended into the " how we live now " sort , packed with amazing facts about how effluent flows down drains , and that the electricity grid needs maintenance .
He 'll be doing the nature programmes and cricket next , mark our words .
Defence :
And now , Andrew Marr presents highlights from today 's play at Wimbledon .
And then , in an hour , it 's ' Andrew Marr 's World of Adventure ' , followed by the news , and then , at 10.30 , Graham Norton presents ' The 100 Best Andrew Marr Clips ' .
Michael Martin
Prosecution : Possibly the silliest man in British public life .
By bringing to his office all the intellectual rigour of a third - rate councillor for a rock - safe seat in Cambuslang , he has probably caused more damage to the House of Commons than any other Speaker in seven centuries .
And now , reportedly , there is talk of finagling an exit predicated on his son inheriting his parliamentary seat .
Breathtaking .
Defence :
He is always very prompt with his expenses .
Me columnists
Prosecution : Self - obsessed witterers who occupy prominent corners of the national press to tell us about their doings .
Got their jobs by relentlessly schmoozing editors , and by being photogenic ( although the byline photo is now a decade or more old ) .
What with all this party - going and preening , there 's no time for original thinking , especially when it comes to current affairs .
Defence :
Why are you picking on ditzy little me ?
It 's all very well for these people in Zimbabwe to complain , but they do n't have to make Jemima 's costume for the nativity play , do a book review , go for a manicure , meet Piers for lunch , write this bloody column , and get to our place in the country – all by Friday .
Middle - aged ' Doctor Who ' fans
Prosecution : Harmless though such an enthusiasm may appear to be , a fondness for this festival of glitzy impossibilities is a warning sign that you could develop the kind of full - blown dementia so many psychiatrists have noted in science - fiction fans .
Watch one too many episodes , and you are embarked on a slippery slope , at the bottom of which is collecting ' Star Wars ' memorabilia and building your holidays around attending SciFiComCons at provincial Holiday Inns .
Defence :
Sure , maybe anyone over 15 who 's interested in sci- fi is a bit suspect , but perhaps these are just parents who have successfully found a bonding point with their ' Who ' - obsessed kids .
Lighten up .
Charles Moore
Prosecution : Former editor of the ' Daily Telegraph ' and ' Spectator ' , now author and rural sportsman , who has turned a campaign against the TV licence collecting service into his life 's work .
When he goes to the great leather armchair in the sky , the ' Telegraph ' will record his passing not as a journalist or huntsman , but with a story headlined : " TV licence fee man dies " .
Defence : Nonsense .
He may look like P G Wodehouse 's Gussie Fink - Nottle ( he has worked hard to achieve this ) , but he is an essential antidote to the bureaucratic jobsworths now infesting public services in New Labour 's Britain .
Why should someone who does n't have a television pay a licence fee ?
Not exactly Magna Carta or habeas corpus , we grant you , but a step in the right direction .
Max Mosley
Prosecution : Gave his wife a terrible shock when his taste for being spanked surfaced on the front page of the ' News of the World ' .
Did she never suspect ?
Not even when he came home after an " extended business meeting " and declined a chair , preferring to stand for the rest of the evening ?
Defence :
Had the courage to take on the legal and financial might of the ' News of the World ' .
And , for the first time in his life , was happy not to be beaten .
Nannying railway announcers
Prosecution :
They can't tell you when the next train is , but they can tell you how to lead your life .
" At this time of increased temperatures , you may find it advisable to carry a bottle of water ... "
" Because of today 's wet weather conditions , customers are advised that conditions under foot may be slippery . "
What 's next ?
Asking if we 've blown our noses ?
Telling us to make sure we 've done Number Twos before leaving home ?
Defence :
Oh , come , come .
It 's better than it used to be .
Remember those muffled announcements of old when everyone froze as the baffling jumble of consonants and semi-syllables came out as : " Mwnnahnnn tffololition Junction , sidibnnnawewah falatedoh mmever laggaghanahh any inconvenience . "
Mark Nicholas
Prosecution : Was annoying enough when he fronted Channel 4's cricket coverage , with his pieces to camera always showing off his good side .
Not intent on desperately wanting to be the next Richie Benaud , he then followed him to Australia , where at least he has the decency to annoy the locals .
Incredibly irritating catchphrases like " Zowee " , " Wow - wee " and " Yessir " when anybody plays a good shot .
Nicknamed McKenzie , as in " Precious " .
Defence :
All possibly true , but at least the coverage he presents brings technology to bear on the proceedings .
This is more than can be said for Radio 4 , whose ' Test Match Special ' is still stuck in the era of Gentlemen and Players .
Neil Nunes
Prosecution : Radio 4 continuity announcer whose voice is so mellifluous , you want to scream .
Does he sound like that all the time ?
Even when asking for a cheap - day return to Doncaster ?
" A cheap daaay retuuurn to the towwwwn of Doncaaaaaster , pleeeeease .
Heeeeeeere is my credit caaard . "
Get some life into it , man .
Rough it up a bit .
Sound like you 're human , and not a computer simulation .
Defence :
There 's enough buzz - saw voices on radio , and Nunes offers a soothing alternative – a man who can make words sound like hot fudge sauce flowing slowly down a spoon .
Get him on tape , and you could cure all the nation 's insomniacs in one night .
Who better to listen to when you can't get to sl ... zzzzzzzzzzzz .
Personal stereo owners who broadcast to the rest of the train
Prosecution :
You know who you are .
You bought a cheapo model whose earpieces are so inefficient they give you a thumping bass , and everyone within 10 yards the tinny treble .
And it 's always the ones who have no taste in music .
Why can it never be a bit of Charles Ives or Brahms whose strains come to us uninvited ?
Defence :
Oh dear , I do n't think there is a defence here .
All one can say in mitigation is that they are people who can't afford decent cans – and are unaware they are torturing the rest of the train carriage .
Point it out and they 'll generally turn it down .
Or hit you .
Melanie Phillips
Prosecution :
One of those disturbing people who has a strong opinion about absolutely everything .
Probably only a matter of time before she unleashes a rant about , say , traffic bollards , or the way grass grows .
Started at ' The Guardian ' as a soft lefty , but has veered ever rightward , and is now the resident knocker of teachers , Muslims , gay rights advocates , Darwinists , Palestinian appeasers and anyone who disagrees with her on the ' Daily Mail ' " Why , oh why " page .
Defence :
Er , she has been known to be right – and prescient – identifying the " inclusive " disaster that is English education in a 1996 book called ' All Must Have Prizes ' .
And she 's a game old thing , undeterred by her many critics .
Harry Potter
Prosecution :
The eponymous boy - hero of J K Rowling 's books has matured into one of the most smackable characters in fiction : bland , whiny , prudish , irritatingly good at sports and surrounded by toe - sucking sycophants .
After book four , Harry 's " specialness " gets grating as he stumbles towards the privilege he was born for like any other private - school twit .
Defence :
Yes , but he 's given pleasure to nearly half a billion readers around the world .
Who else has put a book in hands that had hardly ever held one unless they were being tested on it the following day ?
Jamie Worrall - Ramsay - Blumenthal
Prosecution :
The all - purpose , interchangeable celebrity chef who has mastered the art of turning over - illustrated , content - lite books into a gold - mine .
And , as if that were not bad enough , some have become foodie missionaries , using their dropped aitches and effing and blinding as means to spread the word about torn chicken and ripped - up basil to the lower orders .
Memo to all : they 're only cooks .
Defence :
This fine body of men ( why are they so rarely women ? ) has done more to raise public awareness about the effects of what we tip down our throats than generations of nutritionists .
And remember eating at friends ' houses before they got going ?
All those prawn cocktails and chicken kievs ?
We 're making progress , and it 's down to them .
Rap - rapping , pose - striking , knife - wielding , gun-toting , homophobic urban yoof
Prosecution : Very last year .
Ever since the election of Barack Obama , the black kids can see there 's another way .
And the white ones have always been literally pale imitations of pimp - styled US rappers and their once - justified victim psychology .
As for being social rebels , they 're really just brand - obsessed kids who 've not grown up , using knives and guns as the ultimate expression of pester power .
Defence :
We are awaiting social reports , m'lud .
Tony Robinson
Prosecution : Symbolic of the dreary modern TV orthodoxy that expertise has to be moderated .
So on ' Time Team ' , as a horde of vastly knowledgable , articulate archaeologists and historians struggle to get a wise word in edgeways , every few moments up pops Robinson – and we know that the flow of intelligence has dried up until he does .
Time for a ritual burial , with or without grave goods .
Defence :
Do you think that a programme that consisted of letting university archaeologists loose in a field with only trowels and cameras to keep them company would ever get off the ground ?
Robinson , bringer of life to the classic character of Baldrick , is the price we pay for some down - and - dirty history .
And he takes the trouble to know his stuff .
Jonathan Ross
Prosecution : Television face whose act as an asker of sexually explicit questions now seems holed below the waterline by the Russell Brand - Andrew Sachs affair .
The BBC will put him on a rein so tight he will hardly be able to do more than croak and leer .
And , at rising 50 , there is a danger people will begin to see him not so much as a laddish cheeky chappy but a trainee dirty old man , more raincoat than radical .
Defence :
He 's a laugh .
He 's a caution .
He 's the geezer down the pub who everyone says should be on telly – and he actually is !
( Well , he will be after the end of January , anyway . )
Rottweiler owners
Prosecution :
It 's all right , they say , he 's only playing .
Well , yes , he may be now , but if he wanted to he could crush my child 's skull like an eggshell .
What , really , is the difference between walking down the street with an attack dog bred to kill , and doing so with a loaded and cocked shotgun ?
Answer : a human being is in control of the gun , but no one 's in charge of one of these dogs if they get it into their in - bred brains to go for you .
Defence :
He 's only playing , honest .
And he 's been to training classes .
He can sit and lie on command and everything .
He 's just high - spirited .
He 's ... Oh Christ !
Down Bullseye !
Down !
Bullseye !!
Ringo Starr
Prosecution : A few months ago , the old Beatle issued a statement to the world on video informing the planet that no more correspondence from fans would be replied to .
Was he fed up that signed photos ended up on eBay ?
Suffering from writer 's cramp ?
Or could n't afford the stamps any more ?
No one knows because he dressed up the message in Sixties babble about " peace and love " .
Cut the crap , Ringo .
Defence : I think he was being ironic .
He was a decent drummer , an engaging face and a world - class narrator for ' Thomas the Tank Engine ' .
Since when do people not even born when the Beatles broke up have a right to bombard him with requests for stuff they can flog on auction sites .
Get some heroes from your own generation , kids .
Whooping audiences
Prosecution :
It is an irrefutable law of modern media that the whooping generated by a television studio audience is in inverse proportion to the quality of the fare on screen .
Where do they get these people from ?
What drugs to they give them to make these crazy keening noises ?
And why ?
Just why ?
Defence :
They 're having a good time , they 're having a night out and they 've been working themselves up into a fever of excitement ever since the coach left Droitwich earlier that morning .
All they 're doing is playing their part , and aping , as they 've been asked to do , the lobotomised audiences of American television shows .
Ronnie Wood
Prosecution : Most 61 - year - olds who hanker after the lithe bodies of Russian teenagers wait till the family 's out and content themselves with an hour or so on the web .
Not Ronnie .
He took up with 19 - year - old Ekaterina Ivanova and made a public spectacle of himself , and a humiliated woman of his wife , Jo Wood .
Defence :
The man 's clearly got personal problems , but he 's a considerable musician , playing not just with the Stones , but Bob Dylan , Rod Stewart and David Bowie .
And he 's a good painter , praised by no lesser authority than Brian Sewell .

Back in September Shenangians reported that actor Val Kilmer was mulling a New Mexico governor 's run .
And now that Bill " Bolo Tie " Richardson is commerce - secretary - to - be , well .... there 's an opening .
Folks in Albuquerque spotted the bloated star at a basketball game last night .
The Albuquerque Journal 's caption :
What was a movie star doing at the Lobo game vs. Oral Roberts ?
Especially in the company of former GOP state rep. and lobbyist Joe Thompson , left , and Santa Fe businessman Jerry Peters , a friend of Gov. Bill Richardson , to Kilmer 's right ?

Beleaguered Citigroup is upgrading its mile - high club with a brand - new $ 50 million corporate jet – only this time , it ’s the taxpayers who are getting screwed .
Even though the bank ’s stock is as cheap as a gallon of gas and it ’s burning through a $ 45 billion taxpayer - funded rescue , the airhead execs pushed through the purchase of a new Dassault Falcon 7X , according to a source familiar with the deal .
The French - made luxury jet seats up to 12 in a plush interior with leather seats , sofas and a customizable entertainment center , according to Dassault ’s sales literature .
It can cruise 5,950 miles before refueling and has a top speed of 559 mph .
There are just nine of these top - of - the - line models in the United States , with Dassault ’s European factory churning out three to four 7Xs a month .
Citigroup decided to get its new wings two years ago , when the financial - services giant was flush with cash , but it still intends to take possession of the jet this year despite its current woes , the source said .
“ Why should I help you when what you write will be used to the detriment of our company ? ” replied Bill McNamee , head of CitiFlight Inc. , the subsidiary that manages Citigroup ’s corporate fleet , when asked to comment about the new 7X .
“ What relevance does it have but to hurt my company ? ”
It ’s not uncommon for large companies to pay a deposit on a new plane then cancel the order before delivery , according to a source in the corporate aviation business .
Citigroup execs are also quietly trying to unload two of their older Dassault 900EXs .
Those jets , nearly 10 years old , are worth an estimated $ 27 million each .
They were still listed for sale yesterday on the Web site of Citigroup ’s aviation broker , Aviation Professionals .
A company representative said she would not comment on “ brokering both sides of the deal ” when asked about the incoming Falcon 7X .
The Dassaults are part of CitiFlight ’s Gulf Sierra fleet , which includes the two Falcon 900EXs , tail numbers N399GS and N588GS , currently for sale .
FAA records show Citigroup reserved a new tail number , N488GS , possibly for the incoming 7X on Nov. 10 last year .

AMONG the significant dates in the history of Kahlúa , the Mexican coffee liqueur , surely March 6 , 1998 , rates a mention .
That was the release date of “ The Big Lebowski , ” the Coen Brothers movie about an aging slacker who calls himself the Dude , and who , after a thug urinates on his prized rug , becomes caught up in a Chandleresque mystery .
Played with slouchy brio by Jeff Bridges , the Dude ’s chief pursuits involve bowling , avoiding work and drinking White Russians , the sweet cocktail made with vodka , Kahlúa and cream or milk .
The movie was a flop when it was released , but in the decade since , “ The Big Lebowski ” has attracted a cult following , and as the film ’s renown has grown , so has the renown of the White Russian , or , as the Dude calls them , “ Caucasians . ”
The drink is the subject of experimentation at cutting - edge bars like Tailor , in SoHo , which serves a crunchy dehydrated version  a sort of White Russian cereal .
The British electro - pop band Hot Chip , meanwhile , recently invented a variation named the Black Tarantula .
Not long ago , the cocktail was considered passé and often likened , in its original formula , to an alcoholic milkshake .
To get a sense of just how bright and sunshiny the future looks to the solar - energy industry , consider The Graph :
It ’s a standard affair , projecting solar ’s share of global energy production over the coming century .
The Graph was created by a scientific organization that counsels the German government , but it has since become a prized piece of propaganda , embedded in glossy brochures and PowerPoint presentations by solar companies from California to gray - skied Saxony .
At the left - hand , present - tense end of the scale , solar power is a microscopic pencil line of gold against the thick , dark bands of oil and natural gas and coal , an accurate representation of the 0.04 % of the world ’s electricity produced by solar power as of 2006 .
The band grows slowly thicker for 20 years or so , and then around 2040 a dramatic inversion occurs .
The mountain - peak lines indicating the various fossil fuels all fall steeply away , leaving a widening maw of golden light as solar power expands to fill the space .
By 2060 , solar power is the largest single band , and by 2100 it is by far the majority share .

This has always been solar energy ’s tantalizing promise , since the first photovoltaic ( PV ) cells emerged out of Bell Labs in the 1950s to power space probes and ignite the dreams of a generation of giddy utopian dreamers .
Solar energy is as plentiful as daylight , as limitless as organic life itself , a fuel that comes free of charge and replenishes itself every time the earth rotates on its axis .
Almost all energy , after all , is ultimately stored solar power : Oil , gas , and coal were born of the ancient sunlight that fed prehistoric animals and plants , the wind is set howling by the sun ’s unequal heating of the atmosphere , and even a campfire draws its warmth from solar power trapped long ago through photosynthesis .
Enough radiation from the massive fusion reactor at the center of our solar system hits the earth every hour to fill all of its energy needs for a year .
Fifty years on , the PV cell remains the most effective engine yet devised for the conversion of sunlight into electricity .
The core of every PV cell is a semiconductor , traditionally a highly purified wafer of crystalline polysilicon , virtually identical to the “ chips ” upon which computer circuits are built .
When sunlight strikes the semiconductor , its atoms get excited ; if the light beam ’s photons pack a sufficient punch , they knock the semiconductor ’s electrons loose for collection by the PV cell ’s circuits , creating an electric current .
Assemble a handful of these cells in a glass frame and wire it to a battery or a power grid , and you have got a solar panel ( or module , as it ’s sometimes called in the industry ) .
A small , pollution - free power plant .
Compared to splitting an atom or sucking liquefied phytoplankton from 300 - million - year - old bedrock , it ’s practically child ’s play .
Solar has nevertheless been stuck for decades in the future tense .
PV cells have been too inefficient and too expensive , or too reliant on a fickle sun .
But the solar industry has recently made a dramatic leap from the feel - good margins to the mainstream .
An unprecedented production boom began around 2004 , well before the rise and current fall in crude - oil prices ; that boom continues unabated and has led to plunging costs , vastly more rational supply chains , and record - setting gains in the efficiency of traditional crystalline silicon cells ( the best now conduct electricity at efficiency rates almost 30 % better than the lab record of 2003 ) .
In the past 50 years , about 10 gigawatts of solar power — roughly the output of 10 standard nuclear reactors — have been installed worldwide .
But current estimates , which have been modified only upward in recent years , are that 10 gigawatts more will be brought online in 2010 alone .
A new global industry is taking shape before our eyes .
A journey through this energy revolution suggests that the age of truly ubiquitous solar may at last have begun .
Solar ’s emerging titans are scattered across three continents and three technological generations — from established crystalline PV manufacturers in California to newer “ thin film ” cells now reaching mass - production scale in Germany and to even third - generation compounds being developed in Australia that can be integrated into building materials to deliver power in the darkest shade .
Even in this time of enormous financial uncertainty ( not to mention a deepening concern , if not panic , about the health of the planet ) , the sense of boundless potential , the promise of The Graph , is palpable .
Erik Straser , who oversees the clean - energy portfolio at Mohr Davidow Ventures in Silicon Valley , puts it this way : “ Sometimes I ask myself , ‘ If this company was successful , would people name libraries and public high schools after it ? ’
Who made the steam engine ?
Who made the lightbulb ?
Who will those people be for the 21st century ?
Who ’s the person that made mass - market solar affordable ? ”
A global industry is taking shape , with the hottest spots in Silicon Valley , Germany , and Australia .
The age of truly ubiquitous solar may at last have begun .
Back in the present tense , in the piercing glare of a July morning in Silicon Valley , I ’m shielded by the smoked glass of a standard - issue corner office .
Tom Werner , CEO of SunPower , America ’s largest PV manufacturer by revenue , sits across from me at a glass - topped conference table , essentially making the case that he ’s that guy , the godfather of cheap solar .
One of them , anyway .
“ The hypothesis of SunPower , ” Werner tells me , his argument bottom - line blunt , “ was take a high - technology , high - efficiency solar cell and mass - produce it at low cost .
And it worked . ”
He slides a small pane of glass out of a file folder .
It ’s about the size of a household floor tile and inlaid with a blue - black hexagonal pattern .
This is SunPower ’s PV cell , which , at 22 % efficiency , holds the world record for a commercial product .
( The industry average is about 16 % . )
He holds it up for my inspection , and I notice the hexagons are identical to the ones on the tabletop between us , which turns out to be a large SunPower panel mounted on four legs .
“ As you create this market for solar , ” Werner says , “ you create the opportunity to scale .
And so what happens is , you innovate your way down the cost curve . ”
advertisement
Werner strikes me as exactly the type of hypercompetitive , profit - obsessed executive the solar industry had long been lacking .
At 48 , he ’s trim and athletically wiry , with tidy side - parted hair and a goatee .
He slurs a bit through gritted teeth as we talk because the night before , in a rec-league basketball game , he caught an elbow that drove his incisors through his lower lip .
“ I ’ll get that guy , ” he tells me .
I ’d bet on it .
Werner ’s spiel might sound like textbook , first - year MBA stuff , but the second part of it — the cost - reducing , mass - producing part — was mostly absent from the solar industry for its first half - century .
Incremental efficiency gains were the industry ’s core focus , and solar companies tended to be small and mission - driven , with a university lab ’s sense of priorities .
SunPower was , until recently , no exception : Founded in 1985 by a Stanford engineering professor , it spent its first 15 years building solar - powered aircraft prototypes for NASA and sci- fi solar concentrators shaped like satellite dishes .
“ What ’s the purpose of solar ? ”
Werner asks , switching to rhetorical mode .
“ It ’s to get energy , right ?
So then the question is , Will the cost of solar energy converge on the cost of the way you get energy otherwise ?
And in the ’ 70s , the answer was definitively no . ”
The answer was still a pretty strong no when Werner took the helm of SunPower in 2003 .
He ’d been transferred from Cypress Semiconductor , which had recently bought the company , and was given the monumental task of bringing the price down to mass - market rates .
“ Today , ” he says , “ the cost of the grid ’s gone like this . ”
He slices his hand sharply upward , indicating the skyrocketing price of conventional energy .
“ And the cost of solar is coming down .
So that crossover point is imminent . ”
Werner calls that point the “ levelized cost of energy , ” but in most of the industry the preferred term is “ grid parity ” — that magic moment , which may arrive by 2012 or even sooner in heavily subsidized energy markets such as California , Germany , Italy , and Japan , when the price of a kilowatt - hour of solar energy is about the same as one generated by any other fuel source .
Grid parity :
It obsesses solar executives like a grail , rolls off their lips like a forceful boast or a solemn promise .
Grid parity : not if , no longer if .
Only when .
Under Werner , SunPower has rapidly reinvented itself , catapulting from the lab to the center of an exploding global market .
At every turn , he and his team uncovered the weaknesses and irrationalities of an immature industry , particularly at the postproduction end , where installation costs often represent 50 % of the total price of a PV system .
In response , the company simply expanded into those markets .
SunPower is unique in the business today in that it manages essentially its entire supply chain , from silicon ingot to installation .
“ We ’ve industrialized this industry , ” says vice president Julie Blunden .

The company ’s timing has been impeccable .
Every year since Werner ’s arrival , the global solar industry has grown by at least 40 % .
It has jumped from humble residential roofs to the wide , flat expanses of big - box stores and office parks , and graduated from rooftop array to greenfield power plant .
Solar power was the planet ’s fastest growing energy source in 2007 , and in recent years , demand has outpaced supply and given rise to the industrial - scale solar business ’s enviable lament :
No company could seem to manufacture PV panels fast enough to meet demand .
Today , solar is a $ 13 billion global industry , and it ’ll hit $ 40 billion by 2012 ( unless it exceeds forecasts for the next five years as it has for the past five ) .
Gigawatt - scale “ fabs ” — that is , single production lines capable of producing enough panels every year to add 1,000 megawatts of installed capacity to the global energy mix — are in the works in Germany , China , and Japan , while several American companies are poised to soon reach similar levels of production .
SunPower ’s 2007 revenue came in at $ 775 million , triple the 2006 figure .
The company estimates it will clear $ 1 billion — with $ 90 million in profit — in 2008 .
Solar is a $ 13 billion industry today .
It will hit $ 40 billion by 2012 , unless it continues to exceed forecasts , as it has over the past five years .
Critics of crystalline PV — particularly the heads of newfangled thin - film solar companies eyeing crystalline ’s 86 % market share — continue to suggest that it might never be produced cheaply or quickly enough to compete with other power sources in the long term .
But when I present this critique to Werner , he responds with a sotto voce dismissal — “ Well , it ’s ridiculous ” — and then bullet - points me through SunPower ’s bona fides : that record 22 % efficiency ( against thin film ’s paltry 8 % to 12 % ) , its reductions in hardware and installation costs , its rapid expansion to 400 - plus megawatts of production capacity .
The thin - film startups can wave around all the jaw - dropping cost - per - watt estimates they want ( some claiming production costs as low as $ 1 per watt , versus crystalline PV ’s average of $ 3 or more per watt ) , but Werner just points to SunPower ’s completed projects .
Its recent installation at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada was the largest PV plant in North America when it was completed last April : 70,000 panels mounted on 5,300 of SunPower ’s new tracking racks , which use GPS to adjust the panels ’ positions minute by minute , improving efficiency up to 30 % all by themselves .
( At least six much larger projects , including two by SunPower , are now in the works . )
The tracking system , Werner tells me , is just one of the 185 patented technologies by which SunPower intends to stay well ahead of the thin - film arrivistes .
As for nuke , with its 10 - year - minimum lead times ?
“ One nice way to get out of a nuclear argument is to say , ‘ Well , I ’m worried about the next decade . ’ ” And what about coal , trying to reverse the tide as more than 60 proposed plants are denied permits in the United States in the last year alone ?
“ Fighting gravity . ”
Of course , there are caveats .
Disclaimers and indemnities and asterisks .
As Neal Dikeman , a partner at clean - tech investment firm Jane Capital Partners , argues , the variables built into the cost of a kilowatt - hour of electricity are so numerous and byzantine that grid parity itself may be an illusory near - term goal .
The sunniest estimates of that blessed event , Dikeman notes , are based on the cost of generating more power when the demand is highest .
But this peak - demand power — the kind required by millions of air - conditioners at midday in California — is only a single - digit percentage of the total generating capacity on most electricity grids , and the cost of producing the juice is just one of many line items on the average power bill , alongside transmission , distribution , and maintenance costs .
And in solar ’s case , there ’s also the cost of reconfiguring the grid to account for hundreds of thousands of small - scale installations .
So what does the version of grid parity touted by solar boosters amount to ?
“ A legitimate sales tactic , ” Dikeman suggests , which “ takes the best case to justify a subsidy to get down the cost curve . ”
He says true grid parity is “ still close to a decade down that curve . ”
Dikeman ’s guess is probably as good as any on that score , and he ’s certainly right that the solar industry ’s rise has depended on subsidies .
Solar ’s growth has been largely driven by legislators , goosed along by various tariffs and tax incentives .
But the energy business has long been a lonely place for free marketeers : According to British investment firm Ambrian Capital , the global renewable - energy industry receives about $ 11 billion in subsidies each year , versus $ 200 billion for fossil fuels , already a wildly profitable industry .
So what ’s a clean , limitless power source worth ?
And what scale could solar reach if there were a similar national investment behind it ?
If U.S. capacity ramped up to equal the 10 gigawatts expected to come online worldwide in 2010 , that would be enough to power 3 million homes and reduce greenhouse - gas emissions equivalent to taking 22 million cars off the road .
As BP likes to say , it ’s a start .
The global renewable - energy industry receives about $ 11 billion in subsidies each year , versus more than $ 200 billion for fossil fuels .
Oil companies might greet such numbers with an eye roll , but solar execs are quick to point out how far the industry has come .
They like to quote solar ’s emerging corollary to Moore ’s Law , that digital - age observation that a semiconductor ’s processing power doubles every two years , even as prices plummet :
The cost of solar , they ’ll tell you , drops by 20 % every time volume doubles , and the market of the past 10 years has borne this out .
The idea of industrial - scale solar power seems even less naive and futuristic when you look at California , which has become the main production hub and primary market in the United States .
True , the state is riding a $ 3.3 billion earmark package from Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s administration , but the impact of those incentives is impressive .
One installer , Solar City , has grown from nothing to $ 29 million in annual sales in just two years .
Another , Akeena Solar , has moved out of its founder ’s garage to 12 offices nationwide .
Then there ’s Applied Materials , a $ 10 billion Silicon Valley giant that built its fortune by producing manufacturing equipment for computer chips and flat - panel displays .
Back in 2004 , while it was struggling to recover from the dotcom bust , Applied went looking for new markets and quickly discovered that the cost of a solar panel was dropping with almost semiconductor quickness and that its manufacture looked quite a bit like making computer chips or giant LCD screens .
That was more than enough to spur the company to a substantial expansion into the solar market .
“ When I went to the board in 2005 , we said , ‘ This looks like it ’ll be a $ 500 million business in 2010 , ’ ” says Mark Pinto , Applied ’s chief technology officer .
“ And people said , ‘ Wow , you know , that ’s pretty good . ’
Now we ’re talking about $ 3 billion — plus . ”
A single Chinese startup , Best Solar , accounts for $ 1.9 billion of those sales ; it plans to have Applied ’s thin - film SunFab machinery driving its production line by early 2009 — and to reach 1 gigawatt of annual capacity by 2011 .
“ Thin film is more utility scale , ” says Chris Beitel , who oversees Applied ’s solar operations .
“ It ’s not about the residential rooftop .
It ’s about larger commercial rooftop areas , it ’s about office parks — those are the areas where we ’re going to succeed . ”

But try telling that to Tom Werner .
Under one recent contract , SunPower blanketed the roofs of 28 California Macy ’s stores in PV , the majority of them under a “ power purchase agreement ” that is quickly becoming the commercial - roofing standard .
Under the deal , Macy ’s leases the rooftop space to SunPower for free and agrees to buy the panels ’ output at a fixed rate for the next 10 years .
Macy ’s gets a competitive and stable electricity price in a volatile market , and SunPower simply gets a market .
( Maryland - based SunEdison , which closed a $ 131 million round of venture funding in May , has solar - tiled the big - box tops of hundreds of Staples , Kohl ’s , U - Store - It , and Whole Foods stores in California and beyond under the same kind of arrangement . )
In mid-August , SunPower announced the biggest deal in its history , a contract to supply California utility giant PG&E with 250 megawatts of PV .
This comes as part of a commitment by PG&E to construct two mammoth solar farms by 2011 , capable of generating 800 megawatts of power — significantly more than the entire existing PV capacity nationwide .
“ This pair of deals actually changes the landscape of the solar PV industry , ” says Roy Kuga , vice president of energy supply at PG&E .
SunPower ’s Blunden is even more ecstatic : “ This is historic , monumental , tectonic — those are superlatives that are fair to apply to the announcement . ”
It just might be , in other words , the solar industry ’s very own Hoover Dam — the birth of the utility - scale solar industry in the United States .
Which , by the way , is nowhere near the global industry ’s epicenter .
Solar power ’s rise has been fueled by sporadic bursts of political vision and courage .
The ascent begins in Japan , where in 1994 the government introduced an incentive package in which it agreed to pick up fully half the cost of every installed panel for 10 years , spurring a handful of old - guard electronics firms to go industrial — Sharp , in particular , still the No. 2 global producer .
The recent and much more robust solar boom , however , began with Germany ’s Renewable Energy Sources Act .
The German law , passed in 2000 ( and since copied from China to California ) , is a “ feed - in tariff ” that obliges electricity retailers to buy power from renewable sources at above - market rates .
The rates decline by a certain percentage each year for 20 years , depending on the source , at which point grid parity is presumed to carry on the work .
An overhaul in 2004 placed particular emphasis on solar : Small , rooftop installations , for example , sell electricity back to the German grid at about six times baseline prices .
The German solar business promptly went supernova , precipitating a global polysilicon shortage from which the industry has only just recovered .
( Silicon is the second - most - abundant element in the earth ’s crust and a chief ingredient in much of the world ’s sand , but silicon - processing companies were slow to realize they had an entirely new class of customer . )
More than 100 solar companies have since set up shop in Germany — more than half of them in the former East Germany ( GDR ) — and now employ 57,000 workers and generate $ 7.3 billion in annual revenues .
Seven of these firms have already vaulted onto the TecDAX 30 , the technology index on Germany ’s stock exchange , now sometimes jokingly referred to as the “ solar DAX . ”
The geographic center of the rapidly expanding German solar business is a decaying industrial belt south of Berlin , an East German reliquary that had been trapped in a seemingly terminal decline since the fall of the Berlin Wall .
The world ’s first solar heartland has emerged literally in the shadow of communism ’s ruin , a place kissed by about as much sunlight each year as southern Alaska .
A place with a name that sounds like a bad - weather curse : Bitterfeld .
Back in the days before the Wall tumbled , there was a German saying that went something like this :
If we do n’t meet in this world , we ’ll meet in Bitterfeld .
A once - proud little industrial burgh —
Agfa developed the first color photographic film in the area in the years before World War II — Bitterfeld had been buried under an industrial blight so savage it seemed otherworldly .
It had been turned into the Eastern Bloc ’s chemical and pharmaceutical workhorse after the war , dooming it to half a century of sloppy Soviet - style industrialization and a flagrant disregard for the environment .
When the Wall finally fell , 55,000 of the 60,000 jobs in Bitterfeld ’s outmoded factories promptly evaporated .

The scars are still plainly visible in the boarded windows fronting the sturdy old brick buildings downtown and the industrial detritus beneath the rail - yard overpass , but I sweep past them in a smart new Mercedes taxi , bound for the site of Bitterfeld ’s startling renaissance .
Out beyond the befouled chemical plants , on the edge of a village called Thalheim , I find a gentle hollow rapidly filling up with low warehouses ; construction cranes and wind turbines stand against the gray horizon .
This out - of - the - way industrial park has come to be known as Solar Valley , and the sprawling complex at its center houses the operations of Q - Cells , the biggest company by market cap on the TecDAX and , since mid-2007 , the world ’s largest manufacturer of crystalline PV cells .
“ We liken it to the car industry and say the status we ’re now at — the cells you see out there — that ’s kind of Tin Lizzy , ” Stefan Dietrich , the company ’s head of public relations , tells me .
“ That ’s the T - Model Ford .
That ’s where we ’re standing . ”
Dietrich means it metaphorically — that the whole industry stands at that birth - of - an - industrial - age spot — but he could just as accurately make the case that solar ’s industrial age was born here , in this cafeteria , with the stern chemical industry vets in coveralls on one side , chain - smoking through their lunch hour , and the business - casual crowd from Berlin and beyond munching salads on the other .
One of the curious things about the GDR ’s chemical business , Dietrich explains , is that it bred workers skilled at applying chemical sealants to glass , an essential step in the production of a solar cell .
So a trio of Berlin scientists and their partner , drawn by this skilled workforce and the ample subsidies available to any enterprise willing to relocate to the former GDR , began production in Thalheim in 2001 .
Having started in the cottage - scale solar business , they knew how hard it was to find a reliable supplier of PV cells , so they focused exclusively on making those .
( This is like making engines instead of cars . )
A staff of 19 , including the founders , ran that first Q - Cells production line out of a quaint little wooden building .
The company ’s payroll now numbers more than 2,000 ; annual revenue topped $ 1 billion in 2007 and will verge on $ 2 billion for 2008 .
The old wooden factory is all but smothered by the sleek , mirrored - glass facility in which Dietrich and I sit .
Dietrich mentions sort of offhandedly that Q - Cells might soon , by virtue of raw revenue alone , become the first TecDAX company ever to jump to the main stock exchange ’s DAX 30 — alongside BMW and Deutsche Bank and ThyssenKrupp .
“ That really feels a bit strange , ” he says in his lightly accented English , his tone almost self - deprecating , like it ca n’t quite be true .
After lunch , Dietrich and I don lab coats and booties to inspect the driver of this miraculous performance — one of the five industrial - scale Q - Cells production lines up and running in Thalheim ( two more are under construction ) .
Dietrich leads me to a wide space filled with labyrinthine snakes of gleaming white metal and smoked glass linked together by robotic appendages and conveyor belts .
“ It looks like some ’ 70s science - fiction movie , ” he tells me , hollering a bit over the machinery ’s hum as we watch flat squares of gray silicon cycle briskly through the system .
These wafers , Dietrich notes , are barely half as thick as the ones used in 2003 , and they come from REC , a Norwegian company that set up the first wafer plant dedicated solely to the solar industry .
We follow along as the wafers pass through furnaces and chemical baths , get smeared with silver - aluminum paste and “ printed ” with electrical contacts .
They turn deep blue and develop a mirror ’s sheen .
In the final leg of the labyrinth , they are tested for efficiency ( generally between 15 % and 16.6 % ) , stacked in cubes of 100 , and packed in logoed boxes for worldwide shipment .
The lines run three shifts a day , 24/7 , churning out about 150 million cells per year — 585 megawatts ’ worth this year , scaling up to a full gigawatt by the end of 2009 .
The foundation of a new German industrial powerhouse .

As the solar industry reaches maturity and expands into new markets , specialization has fast become the preferred business strategy .
Highly efficient but relatively expensive crystalline PV cells such as Q - Cells ’ or SunPower ’s make sense if you ’re trying to power a home with limited roof area , but their efficiency comes at a lofty price .
If you have an acre of rooftop ( or a 100 - acre field ) , then thin - film cells , which use nano - size layers of silicon or futuristic metal alloys — either cadmium telluride ( CdTe ) or copper - indium - gallium - diselenide ( CIGS ) — promise to do the job for a fraction of the cost .
The thin - film game is dominated by ambitious startups , but Q - Cells , unique among first - generation solar companies , has jumped into the fray as well , launching a spin - off CdTe producer called Calyxo .
Unfortunately for the Germans , second - generation solar already has a superstar : Arizona - based First Solar , which has developed a CdTe panel for a production cost of an astounding $ 1.14 per watt , less than half the cost of its nearest rival at its debut .
And by the end of 2009 , the company plans to manufacture its revolutionary panels at gigawatt scale .
CNBC ’s Jim Cramer has dubbed First Solar the “ Intel of solar , ” helping to inflate its stock 1,000 % over the course of 2007 , peaking at 253 times earnings .
The company ’s name now rolls off the tongues of even its most combative competitors with naked admiration .
Thanks largely to First Solar , second - generation thin - film technologies are now expected to grow even faster than the crystalline industry and to move from about a 14 % market share to as much as 28 % by 2010 .
That kind of growth attracts a crowd , of course , and already a would - be usurper claims to have bested First Solar ’s vertiginous dive down the cost curve with a rival technology .
Nanosolar , based in San Jose , produced new CIGS panels for a test project last December that it claims will sell for 99 cents per watt — 80 % below the average for crystalline PV and more than 10 % less than the production cost of First Solar ’s thin - film panels .
That ’s low enough to flirt with grid parity in many markets even without a feed - in tariff .
Nanosolar has secured $ 500 million in venture funding , $ 300 million of which it claims is still in the bank .
That includes a $ 50 million deal with EDF of France , one of the world ’s largest utility companies — just the sort of partnership that lends instant credibility to a risky new technology like CIGS .
Nanosolar ’s numbers have attracted such skepticism that its CEO , Martin Roscheisen , felt compelled to post a video clip to his blog demonstrating his company ’s new production tool in action .
The video ( which has drawn nearly 100,000 viewers since it was posted to YouTube in June ) is a minute long and completely silent , with home - movie production values .
Its sole subject is a large white chamber , which houses a machine capable of spreading Nanosolar ’s patented “ nanoparticle ink ” ( CIGS semiconductor material in liquid form ) onto a roll of flexible backing at the rate of a gigawatt per year .
According to Roscheisen ’s blog , the tool set the company back all of $ 1.65 million , which in this capital - intensive business is the equivalent of buying a license to print money .
In fact , Roscheisen ’s revolutionary PV machine has more in common with a printer than it does with anything you ’d find on the factory floor at Q - Cells .
And if all goes according to plan , by early 2009 the machine will be the centerpiece of two up - and - running production lines , including a 500 - megawatt facility located in — naturlich — a down - at - heel East German industrial town not far from Berlin .
In Nanosolar ’s repurposed beer - crate factory on the outskirts of Luckenwalde , I find Erik Oldekop , head of German operations .
Oldekop offers me a tour of the half - empty factory floor , which is quickly filling with a range of conveyor - belted equipment and white robot arms to swish the cells from stage to stage in the production process .
Oldekop points out a laminating machine that stacks 16 of the industry ’s standard laminators on top of each other — a sixteenfold amplification , in other words , of a standard production line ’s throughput .
“ There ’s no reason why you could n’t have 100 % of electricity generated by renewables , ” he tells me .
“ I ’m not saying by solar , but by renewables , and solar is going to make a large contribution . ”
advertisement
Anticipating my skepticism , Oldekop then draws an analogy between the energy business and the ’ 80s - era conventional wisdom about mainframe computers .
Nanosolar , he tells me , intends to begin by selling to Europe ’s myriad municipal utilities , small operations that can wire a 1 - to - 10 - megawatt solar farm directly into the local grid , bypassing the costly national - grid transmission apparatus entirely .
“ Is n’t the electricity company that actually uses central power plants — is n’t that the mainframe ? ” he suggests .
“ And we have very small power plants , 1 to 10 megawatts .
Is n’t that the PC ? ” Radically distributed power production .
That ’s the kind of talk that gets pulses racing , and I have to admit mine ’s doing exactly that as I follow Oldekop across the factory floor .
Is this a Gatesian figure I ’ve found here in the sleepy Saxon countryside ?
Could the solar skeptics be akin to the experts who reckoned , just 30 years ago , that computers would always be great whirring beasts that could never become more numerous than , say , power plants ?
Just 10 years ago — maybe as recently as five —
I ’m sure I could ’ve filled Nanosolar ’s conference room with energy wonks who would have sworn I would n’t be touring the nearly operational factory floor of a thin - film PV plant in eastern Germany in 2008 .
Of course , not even the Oldekops of the solar business think little sun-fueled power plants will be as ubiquitous as laptops a decade from now .
But beyond that ?
The sky ’s the limit .
As persuasive as I find Oldekop ’s analogy , I still have n’t laid eyes on a thin - film solar panel actually pumping out power by the kilowatt - hour .
Fortunately , although First Solar is headquartered in Tempe , it too has a major manufacturing facility in eastern Germany .
And so on one uncharacteristically bright morning , I take two trains and three buses out of Leipzig , then hike the last mile or so down a country road until I come , finally , to the site of First Solar ’s — and the world ’s — first industrial - scale thin - film power plant .
Maybe it ’s the Kremlinesque veil of silence around First Solar — the unanswered emails and voice mails , the word from its local installation partner that there was “ no chance ” of a tour — but as I trek up a dusty side lane , I half expect a Stasi jeep to come reeling around the corner .
I slip past a low concrete restraining wall to find a high chain - link fence stretching away in either direction to points far over the horizon .
Through the crosshatch I can see aluminum frames lined up row on row over an undulating pasture , filled to varying degrees with First Solar ’s thin - film panels .
So it exists .
And it ’s growing : I can hear tools pounding on metal in the distance , and my six - month - old press release tells me at least 12 .
7 megawatts of thin - film solar produced here is powering German homes as I watch .
When it ’s done , it will be , at 40 megawatts , Germany ’s largest solar installation , marking the commercial debut , after decades of lab - rat tinkering , of a second generation of solar power .
I have no direct experience with the wilds of Silicon Valley circa 1980 , but I wonder if it felt about the same as this desultory industrial park in suburban Canberra , Australia .
There ’s one of these , at any rate , on the outskirts of every city in the industrialized world — a bland agglomeration of welding shops and fencing suppliers and landscaping companies housed in aluminum sheds in a dozen shades of beige .
On one corner of this one , there ’s a small , single - story brick building with a couple of loading bays .
Inside , I find an engineer hunched over a standard screen - printing machine , more or less identical to the ones they use to print Your Name Here on T - shirts down at the mall .
He ’s using it to make solar cells .

The engineer ’s name is Graeme Evans , and he works for a small startup called Dyesol .
He ’s dressed in a slightly ratty golf shirt , and if not for his blue surgical gloves , he could be working the drill press in his suburban garage .
He ’s using the screen printer to spread a thin layer of yellowy goo on the surface of a rectangle of glass the size of a postcard , smearing it through a sort of stencil that divides it into six smaller strips in two rows .
The goo is titania — titanium dioxide , more precisely , a plentiful , electricity - conducting material commonly used in toothpaste and paint — and once it has dried , it leaves a porous coating of nanoparticles with an extraordinarily large surface area for such small strips .
The glass panes will then be dipped in a rust - hued dye consisting most notably of a little - known metal called ruthenium and then fused to a second piece of glass coated in electrolyte .
And that ’s how Dyesol makes its photovoltaics — “ dye solar cells ” by name , a technology based on a breakthrough that emerged from a Swiss university in the late 1980s .
The ruthenium dye absorbs available solar energy the way chlorophyll does , taking in electrons and transferring them to the titania layer to create electricity .
“ The principle is just like a leaf , ” explains Sylvia Tulloch , cofounder of Dyesol .
We ’re around the corner from the R&D building in a little green structure that looks like it should belong to a screen - door wholesaler .
She points to a coaster on the conference - room table and to a patch of red berries in the festive scene it depicts .
“ As long as you can see that that ’s red , you know that it ’s absorbing light .
And so it ’s not dependent on how much light is hitting it . ”
To her left , a handful of Dyesol cells have been mounted in a trade - show display stand .
There are six small fans affixed to the sides of the stand , and they whir quietly as we talk .
It ’s only when I stare down at the red berries on the coaster in the shadowy light that I get what ’s odd about that :
We ’re indoors , and the room ’s windows are half - shaded by Venetian blinds .
Dyesol ’s cells are spinning those fans with essentially no direct sunlight at all .
“ That ’s one of the key advantages of dye - solar - cell technology , ” Tulloch explains .
“ It accepts light from all directions ; it accepts light in all light conditions .
And the other key advantage is its manufacturing process .
You need very sophisticated equipment for either the first or the second generation , but for dye solar cells , there are kits sold for children .
My son , when he was 9 , made one and did a demonstration at school . ”
Dyesol is one of a rapidly expanding roster of firms worldwide experimenting with this third generation of solar technology — a subsection of the lab usually referred to as “ organic PV . ”
Dyesol ’s key distinction , though , is its startling proximity to market readiness and the name of the business partner intending to bring it there : Corus , the industrial behemoth formerly known as British Steel .
In early 2007 , Dyesol signed a $ 1 million contract with Corus to assess the feasibility of incorporating dye solar cells into its prefinished - steel - roofing materials .
Corus churns out 100 million square meters of this Colorcoat roofing for use in factories and warehouses each year — more than enough to reroof every Wal - Mart in America — and the process already involves applying layers of paint .
Replace some random decorator color with the ability to generate clean power and the appeal would be obvious and enormous — particularly in Europe , where makers and buyers of building materials are increasingly required to account for the emissions involved in producing them .

By the end of 2007 , the project had cleared what Tulloch calls “ the area of highest technical risk , ” in which it was determined that Dyesol ’s cells could in fact feasibly be printed on a massive unspooling roll of steel as it zooms down a production line at 3 to 5 meters per second .
The government of Wales has since invested in the project , and Corus has converted one of its Welsh production lines into a demonstration facility for solar - coated steel roofing .
The test phase continues through 2009 , and there ’s little chance the product could be on the open market before 2011 — which is likely why Corus is declining comment on the technology ’s potential for now “ as a way of managing expectations . ”
Fair enough .
After all , the prospect of Europe ’s second - largest steel producer integrating solar cells into 100 million square meters of roofing per year might set certain fevered minds racing .
“ Can you imagine metal roofs all around the world that are power generators ? ” Dyesol COO Ross MacDiarmid asks me .
The truth is , I can .
It does n’t even seem like an act of imagination anymore .

FOR some years now , many elite American colleges have been downgrading the role of standardized tests like the SAT in deciding which applicants are admitted , or have even discarded their use altogether .
While some institutions justify this move primarily as a way to enroll a more diverse group of students , an increasing number claim that the SAT is a poor predictor of academic success in college , especially compared with high school grade - point averages .
Are they correct ?
To get an answer , we need to first decide on a good measure of “ academic success . ”
Given inconsistent grading standards for college courses , the most easily comparable metric is the graduation rate .
Students ’ families and society both want college entrants to graduate , and we all know that having a college degree translates into higher income .
Further , graduation rates among students and institutions vary much more widely than do college grades , making them a clearer indicator of how students are faring .
So , here is the question : do SATs predict graduation rates more accurately than high school grade - point averages ?
If we look merely at studies that statistically correlate SAT scores and high school grades with graduation rates , we find that , indeed , the two standards are roughly equivalent , meaning that the better that applicants do on either of these indicators the more likely they are to graduate from college .
However , since students with high SAT scores tend to have better high school grade - point averages , this data does n’t tell us which of the indicators  independent of the other  is a better predictor of college success .
Instead , we need to look at the two factors separately .
And we can , thanks to the recent experience of the State University of New York , America ’s largest comprehensive university system , where I was provost from 1997 to 2006 .
SUNY is blessed with many different types of campuses , mirroring most of the collegiate options ( other than small elite private institutions ) that characterize contemporary higher education .
The university also collects a gold mine of student data , including statistics on pre-admission academic profiles and graduation rates .
A somewhat failed adventure in Haskell abstraction
I usually blog about weird and wonderful things you can do in Haskell .
Today I 'm going to talk about something very plain and not wonderful at all .
If you want to try out the code below , use these Haskell extensions :
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies , MultiParamTypeClasses , OverloadedStrings , FlexibleInstances , TypeSynonymInstances , ScopedTypeVariables , FunctionalDependencies , RecordWildCards , FlexibleContexts , GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}
The simple problem
module Person ( Person (.. ) , display ) where data Person = Person { firstName :: String , lastName :: String , height :: Double } display :: Person ->
String display p = firstName p ++ " " ++ lastName p ++ " " ++ show ( height p + 1 )
print $ display $ Person { firstName = " Manuel " , lastName = " Peyton Jones " , height = 255 }
String
Double
ByteString
Int
We want to define a type for a person which has a few fields and operations .
Like thisVery simple .
To use it we can just import the module and the write something likeBut being efficiancy conscious I 'm not happy with usingand .
I 'd like to experiment with different types for these .
Maybe I should useandinstead ?
Simple enough , let 's abstract out the types and operations into a different module .
module Ops ( XString , XDouble , (+++ ) , xshow ) where import Data .
String newtype XString = XString String deriving ( Eq , Show , IsString ) newtype XDouble = XDouble Double deriving ( Eq , Show , Num ) (+++ ) :: XString -> XString -> XString XString x +++ XString y = XString ( x ++ y ) xshow :: XDouble ->
XString xshow ( XDouble x ) = XString ( show x ) module Person ( Person ( .. ) , display ) where import Ops data Person = Person { firstName :: XString , lastName :: XString , height :: XDouble } display :: Person ->
XString display p = firstName p +++ " " +++ lastName p +++ " " +++ show ( height p + 1 )
Person
XString
XDouble
There , problems solved .
By changing the import in themodule you can try out different types forand
No , this is not problem solved .
To try out different implementations I need to edit the Person module .
That 's not abstraction , that 's obstruction .
It should be possible to write the code for the Person module once and for all once you decided to abstract , and then never change it again .
I also did n't really want to necessarily have newtype in my module .
Maybe I 'd want this :
module Ops ( XString , XDouble , (+++ ) , xshow ) where type XString = String type XDouble = Double (+++ ) :: XString -> XString -> XString (+++) = (++) xshow :: XDouble ->
XString xshow = show
interface Ops where type XString type XDouble (+++ ) :: XString -> XString ->
XString xshow :: XDouble -> XString
You can define Ops that way , but then the implementation of Ops may leak into the Person module .
What you really want is to type check Person against the signature of Ops , likeAnd later supply the actual implementation .
Alas , Haskell does n't allow this .
In ML ( SML or O'Caml ) this would be solved by using a functor .
The Person module would be a functor that takes the Ops module as an argument and yields a new module .
And then you can just plug and play with different Ops implementations .
This is where ML shines and Haskell sucks .
Type classes
class ( IsString xstring , Num xdouble ) =>
Ops xstring xdouble where (+++ ) :: xstring -> xstring -> xstring xshow :: xdouble -> xshow
data Person xstring xdouble = Person { firstName :: xstring , lastName :: xstring , height :: xdouble } display :: ( Ops xstring xdouble ) => Person xstring xdouble -> xstring display p = firstName p +++ " " +++ lastName p +++ " " +++ xshow ( height p + 1 )
instance Ops String Double where (+++) = (++) xshow = show
Person
But the defenders of Haskell superiority say , Haskell has type classes , that 's the way to abstract !
So let 's make Ops into a type class .
Let 's do old style with multiple parameters first .
Since
Ops defines two types it will correspond to having two type parameters to the class .
Ok , so how do we have to rewrite the Person module ?
An implementation is provided by an instance declaration :
We see the major flaw in this approch at once .
Thedata type now has two parameters .
This might be bearable , but imagine a more complicated example where Ops contains 15 types .
And every time you add a field with a new type to Person you have to update every single place in the program that mentions the Person type .
That 's not abstraction .
But in fact , it 's even worse than that .
The definition of display might look plausible , but it 's full of ambiguities .
Compiling it gives lots of errors of this kind :
Could not deduce ( Ops xstring xdouble ) from the context ( Ops xstring xdouble4 )
display :: ( Ops xstring xdouble , Ops xstring xdouble3 , Ops xstring xdouble2 , Ops xstring xdouble1 , Ops xstring xdouble4 ) => Person xstring xdouble4 -> xstring
Well , we can remove the type signature and let GHC figure it out .
The we get this
And this function can , of course , never be used because most of the type variables do not occur outside the context so they will never be determined .
I do n't even know how to put explicit types in the function to make it work .
Well , it 's common knowledge that multi- parameter type classes without functional dependencies is asking for trouble .
So can we add some functional dependencies ?
Sure , if we use
class ( IsString xstring , Num xdouble ) =>
Ops xstring xdouble | xstring -> xdouble where
instance Ops String Int
then things work beautifully .
Until we decide that another instance that would be interesting to try iswhich is not valid with the FD present .
So we can't have functional dependencies if we want to have flexibilty with the instances .
So what is it that goes wrong without the FDs ?
It 's that all the uses ( +++) and xshow are not tied together , they could potentially have different types .
Let 's try and be sneaky and tie them together :
display :: ( Ops xstring xdouble ) =>
Person xstring xdouble -> xstring display p = let (++++) = (+++ ) ; xxshow = xshow in firstName p ++++ " " ++++ lastName p ++++ " " ++++ xxshow ( height p + 1 )
class ( IsString xstring , Num xdouble ) =>
Ops xstring xdouble where ops :: ( xstring -> xstring -> xstring , xdouble -> xstring ) instance Ops String Double where ops = ( (++ ) , show ) display :: ( Ops xstring xdouble ) => Person xstring xdouble -> xstring display p = let ( (+++ ) , xshow ) = ops in firstName p +++ " " +++ lastName p +++ " " +++ xshow ( height p + 1 )
class ( IsString xstring , Num xdouble ) =>
Ops xstring xdouble where ops :: DOps xstring xdouble data DOps xstring xdouble = DOps { (+++ ) :: xstring -> xstring -> xstring , xshow :: xdouble -> xstring } instance Ops String Double where ops = DOps (++ ) show display :: ( Ops xstring xdouble ) => Person xstring xdouble -> xstring display p = let DOps {..} = ops in firstName p +++ " " +++ lastName p +++ " " +++ xshow ( height p + 1 )
This only generates one error message , because there 's still nothing that says the the two operations come from the same instance .
We need to make the tie even closer .
This actually works !
We can make it neater looking .
We have basically packaged up the dictionary and unpack it ourselves to get access to the operations .
It 's not pleasent , but it works .
But as I already said , the multiparameter type class version is n't really a good solution to the problem even if it works ; it introduces too many parameters to the Person record .
Associated types
class ( IsString ( XString t ) , Num ( XDouble t ) ) =>
Ops t where type XString t :: * type XDouble t :: * (+++ ) :: XString t -> XString t ->
XString t xshow :: XDouble t ->
XString t data Person t = Person { firstName :: XString t , lastName :: XString t , height :: XDouble t }
The new and shiny way of doing type classes is to use associated types instead of FDs .
So let 's give that a try .
So what should the associated types be in the class .
The associated type is supposed to be the one that can be computed from the main one .
But we have two types that are on equal footing , so there is no main one .
We can remedy that by introducing an artificial third type that is the main one , it can then determine the other two .
That looks pretty neat .
Note how the Person record has one parameter and no matter how many new associated type we add it will still only have one parameter .
One parameter is reasonable , the Person record is after all parameterized over what kind of Ops we are providing .
Let 's do an instance .
It will need the extra type that is somehow the name of the instance .
data Basic = Basic instance Ops Basic where type XString Basic = String type XDouble Basic = Double (+++) = (++) xshow = show
display
display
Now what about thefunction ?
Alas , now it breaks down again .
Thefunction is full of type errors again .
And the reason is similar to the multiparameter version ; there 's nothing that ties the operations together .
We can play the same trick as with DOps above , but for some reason it does n't work this time .
The type comes out as
display :: ( XString t ~ XString a , XDouble t ~ XDouble a , Ops a , Num ( XDouble t ) ) =>
Person t ->
XString a
I have no clue why .
I find associated types very hard to get a grip on .
OK , multi- parameter type classes made things work , but had too many type parameters .
And associated types is the other way around .
You can try combining them , but it did n't get me anywhere closer .
Associated data types
class ( IsString ( XString t ) , Num ( XDouble t ) ) =>
Ops t where data XString t :: * data XDouble t :: * (+++ ) :: XString t -> XString t ->
XString t xshow :: XDouble t ->
XString t data Basic = Basic instance Ops Basic where newtype XString Basic = XSB String deriving ( Eq , Ord , Show ) newtype XDouble Basic = XDB Double deriving ( Eq , Ord , Show ) XSB x +++ XSB y = XSB ( x ++ y ) xshow ( XDB x ) = XSB ( show x ) instance Num ( XDouble Basic ) where XDB x + XDB y = XDB ( x+y ) fromInteger = XDB .
fromInteger instance IsString ( XString Basic ) where fromString = XSB
OK , I wo n't admit defeat yet .
There 's still associated data types .
They are easier to deal with than associated types , because the type function is guaranteed to be injective .
At last , this actually works !
But it 's at a price .
We can no longer use the types we want in the instance declaration , instead we are forced to invent new types .
Using this approach the original multi- parameter version could have been made to work as well .
Normally the GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving language extension makes it relatively painless to introduce a newtype that has all the instances of the underlying type .
But due to a bug in ghc you can't use this extension for associated newtypes .
So we have to make manual instance declarations which makes this approach very tedious .
Conclusion
I have found no way of doing what I want .
My request is very simple , I want to be able to abstract over the actual implementation of a module , where the module contains types , values , and instances .
Haskell normally excels in abstraction , but here I have found no natural way of doing what I want .
Perhaps I 'm just not clever enough to figure out how , but that is a failure of Haskell too .
It should not take any cleverness to do something as simple as this .
In ML this is the most natural thing in the world to do .
Associated types are not a replacement for a proper module system .
They let you do some things , but others just do n't work .
I 'd be happy to see anyone doing this in Haskell in a simple way .

A 38 - year - old man in Springfield , Ohio , told police he was reaching for something on the nightstand during sex when his pistol went off and shot his estranged wife in the chest , according to a local news report .
Timothy Havens previously served 60 days in jail for assaulting Carolyn Havens , 42 , who is now in the hospital .
The shooting comes just a handful of days after NFL player Plaxico Burress accidentally shot himself in the thigh in a Manhattan nightclub .
While the Burress incident made big headlines , Carolyn Havens ' tragedy is a far more common affair in this country where people shoot themselves or other family members far more frequently than many realize .
A quick scan of headlines just this week finds :
The standard argument for keeping guns in the home is that they keep you safe , of course .
The National Rifle Association trains about 750,000 gun owners a year .
NRA courses teach proper handling and storage of firearms .
Yet far more people who own guns — including many who see the guns as useful for self defense — never get such training .
There are somewhere between 193 million and 250 million guns in the United States , according to the Brady Campaign ( in 1981 , during the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan , Press Secretary Jim Brady was shot and seriously wounded ) .
Studies show that , statistically speaking , a gun in the home is more dangerous than protective .
Some facts , according to the Brady Campaign :
More children , teenagers and adult family members are killed by firearms in their own home than by criminal intruders .
Guns kept in the home for protection are 22 times more likely to be used to kill someone you know than to kill in self - defense , according to a 1998 study in The Journal of Trauma .
The risk of homicide in the home is three times greater in households with guns .
The unintentional firearm - related death rate for children up to age 14 is nine times higher in the United States than in 25 other countries combined , according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
There 's a loaded gun in 10 percent of households with children ; and there 's a gun that 's hidden but not locked away in one in every eight family homes .
Not surprisingly , a study last year found that homicide rates are highest in states where more households have guns .
Topping that list : Wyoming , Alaska and Montana .
" Our findings suggest that in the United States , household firearms may be an important source of guns used to kill children , women and men , both on the street and in their homes , " said the lead researcher of that study , Matthew Miller of the Harvard School of Public Health .
We Americans , it seems , have a penchant for doing ourselves harm .
One other little - known fact :
The odds of dying in an assault by firearm in this country are 1 - in - 325 , less than suicide ( 1 - in - 121 ) .
And neither of those can compare to the odds of being killed on the road ( 1 - in-100 ) .
All these methods of dying are in the top 8 overall ( accidental injury is even higher ) .

ST . PETERSBURG , Fla. , Nov. 23 ( UPI ) -- U.S. actor - professional wrestler Hulk Hogan 's estranged wife , Linda Bollea , says she needs more than the $ 40,000 - a- month payments she receives .
Pinellas - Pasco County , Fla. , Circuit Judge George Greer has been asked by one of Bollea 's attorneys to unfreeze a portion of the couple 's assets while they are finalizing their divorce , the St. Petersburg ( Fla . )
Times reported Thursday .

The request during a hearing on other divorce matters came after Bollea and Hogan , whose real name is Terry Gene Bollea , agreed in August that she would receive $ 40,000 each month in temporary alimony payments from the former wrestler .
Hogan also agreed to pay for most of the upkeep on the couple 's Florida home where she lives .
The Times said Greer sided with Linda Bollea 's attorneys regarding their claims Hogan also should pay the home 's cable TV , window - washing and pest control bills .
But the judge did rule that the former WWF star is not responsible for payments on the home 's security system .
By Enalini Elumalai , general coordinator Suara Rakyat Malaysia ( Suaram )
November 27 , 2008 -- While Malaysia celebrated its 51st anniversary of ( independence ) from Britain in 2008 , the Malaysian government continued to arrest and detain individuals without charging them or putting them on trial under the ( ISA ) , the legacy of a colonial legislation enacted to combat the communist insurgency in Malaya in the 1940s and 1950s .
The ISA was originally enacted to succeed emergency laws aimed at combating the communist insurgency in the 1940s and 1950s .
It was also used against political dissidents , students and labour activists .
Since then , the ISA has been used against those who commit acts deemed to be “ prejudicial to the security of Malaysia ” or threatening to the “ maintenance of essential services ” or “ economic life ” .
The government determines which acts fall into these categories and , using a strained interpretation of the legislation , has detained scores of individuals under the ISA in cases that would normally require prosecution .
Under the ISA , detainees are subject to an initial 60 - day detention period in special police holding centres , allegedly for the purpose of investigation .
No judicial order is required for such detentions .
The locations of these holding centres are kept secret , and detainees are transported to and from these centres in blindfolds .
Visits by family members are purely discretionary and , contrary to Article 5 ( 3 ) of the Malaysia 's federal constitution , detainees are denied access to lawyers .
During the initial detention period , detainees are commonly subject to torture and other cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment .
At the end of the 60 - day period , the Internal Security Ministry may release a detainee on restrictive orders , or order further detention without trial for a term of two years .
The ministry can renew the two - year detentions indefinitely .
Detainees may also be released with or without conditions at any time during detention .
Conditions can include restrictions on activities , movement , residence and employment ; orders to remain indoors during certain hours ; and prohibitions against holding public office or taking part in political activities .
Detainees who are issued two - year detention orders are held in the Kamunting Detention Camp ( KDC ) in Perak .
In recent years , the Malaysian government ’s justification of detentions without trial has been highly contradictory .
For example , it has criticised the United States government for detaining two Malaysians without trial in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in 2006 , yet continues to invoke such legislation to detain persons without trial in Malaysia .
The prime minister appeared to be unaware that indefinite detention without trial continues to be used extensively in Malaysia .
Abolish ISA Movement ( AIM )
The AIM which is better known in Malaysia as Gerakan Mansuhkan ISA ( GMI ) is a coalition consisting of 83 organisations made up of non-governmental organisations , political parties , human right bodies , labour unions , women and student movement .
It was launched on April 30 , 2001 , when 10 human rights activists ( reformist or reformasi ) were detained on unproven charges .
The two main objectives of GMI are to work towards the abolishment of ISA and to demand for the release of all ISA detainees on the premise that no one should be detained without trial .
In order to achieve these objectives , the GMI has launched several campaigns to create public awareness through press statements , exhibitions , demonstrations , forums , intellectual discourses , signature campaigns , publishing of books , distribution of pamphlets etc .
Other key elements employed for the publicity of the GMI campaign include lobbying at the national and international level , filing legal proceedings , establishing the Family Support Centre , communicating with the media , fundraising etc .
Since then the GMI has been successful with support from the public :
All 10 reformasi activists have been released .
The Federal Court made a landmark decision on the habeas corpus case filed by six reformasi activists on September 6 , 2002 .
It declared that the detention of these activists was mala fide and illegal .
SUHAKAM or Suruhanjaya Hak Asasi Malaysia ( Malaysia ’s Human Rights Commission ) has vehemently proposed for the review of the ISA and has appealed for it to be replaced with a law that will protect the rights of detainees .
All Al - Maunah ISA detainees have been released .
All KMM ( Kumpulan Militan Malaysia , Malaysian Militant Group ) ISA detainees have been released ( last six were released on October 18 , 2006 , just less than a week before Eid ul Fitr -- Muslim religious holiday ) .
Many of the JI ( Jemaah Islamiyaah ) ISA detainees have been released .
Ex-ISA detainee Abdul Malek Hussin won a lawsuit against the government over his arrest and torture in 1998 , and was awarded RM2.5 million in damages on October 18 , 2007 .
High Court judge Mohd Hishamuddin Mohd Yunus ruled that Abdul Malek ’s detention was unlawful and that he had been assaulted and tortured under custody .
The judge in awarding exemplary damages to the plaintiff said that it was “ to show the court ’s abhorrence against the gross abuse of power by the police and the use of the ISA Release of Raja petra Kamaruddin , Teresa Kok , Tan Hoon Cheng and Cheng Lee Wei , Sanjeev Kumar and several other six - year detainees ( 2008 )
At the time of this writing , around 64 ISA detainees , alleged to be JI militia members , and many more detainees are still suffering in Kamunting Detention Centre and they were also detained without trial there .
What you can do ?
Please write a protest letter to the Prime Minister of Malaysia to condemn the arrest under the ISA and call for abolition of the ISA .
You may also send postcards to the detainees in detention centre to show to them that we are with them .
You may contact the secretariat of AIM to get involved or support any of their activities .

Dear Mister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi ,
Re : Appeal for the immediate release of ISA detainee ’s and call for abolishment of the ISA
I am writing to strongly urge you to immediately release of all the ISA detainees who have been detained without trial under the Internal Security Act ( ISA ) .
ISA detainees must be given recourse to a fair trial in conformity with international standards of due process and access to full legal representation and family members .
If no evidence is found against a detainee , he / she should be released without delay , as holding them indefinitely merely on the basis of suspicion is a blatant violation of due process .
I am also quite concerned about the fact that the ISA detainees have been physically abused and harassed in the past and are being forced to live in small cells and under strict regimes .
I ask that you ensure that all the ISA detainees are treated according to the international human rights standards .
Human rights organizations and NGOs should be given immediate and full access to the Kamunting Detention Centre .
Most importantly , I strongly urge you to abolish the ISA under which many such innocent people have been held in the past and are still being currently detained without charge , or legal representation , merely on the basis of suspicion .
I look forward to hearing from you on this matter ,
Yours sincerely ,
[ Name , Date ]

Actressandare expecting their first child together .
The two met on the set of Men in Trees back in 2006 and started a relationship before Heche had split with her husbandor Tupper with his wife .
Heche's rep has confirmed the news of the baby and said that the couple are thrilled .
Heche and Laffoon have a 6 year old son Homer .
The couple were very good at dodging relationship questions until they had ended their marriages .
Once that was accomplished , they could n't wait to talk about each other .
Tupper was quoted as saying ;
" I wish people could meet her in person , she has a sparkle and such a love for people , and she works so hard .
She is so dedicated to all good things . "
Congrat's to Anne and James !

An ancient predecessor to the virus that causes Aids evolved in wild primates many millions of years earlier than previously believed , according to research published yesterday by the Stanford University School of Medicine .
The findings open a critical new avenue in the quest to understand the origins of the human immunodeficiency virus , or HIV , which unleashed a pandemic that since 1981 has claimed more than 25 million lives worldwide , and threatens millions more .
The discovery also bolsters scientific hunches that HIV - like viruses may be more broadly distributed among primates and other wildlife than previously thought , posing a potential risk for humans in close contact with these animals .
Primates in Africa passed on the two strains of HIV circulating among humans , scientists are convinced .
" It points to the direction for future research , that we need to establish how widespread these viruses are , " said Robert Gifford , an infectious disease researcher with Stanford , and lead author of the study .
Gifford and his colleagues studied gray mouse lemurs , squirrel - sized , saucer - eyed primates found in Madagascar .
They found that the lemur genomes they studied carried lentiviruses , which are among a family of viruses that include HIV .
Lentiviruses have been intensely studied since the emergence of Aids .
While the discovery of lentiviruses in lemurs surprised the researchers , what especially stunned them was the realisation that lemurs must have carried the virus for at least 14 m years .
That was the last time a land bridge might have existed between the island and mainland Africa , providing an opportunity for another species infected with the virus to pass it to the geographically isolated animals , which are native only to Madagascar .
At the outside , lemurs may have carried the virus for as long as 85 m years , when the primate family that includes lemurs split from the evolutionary branch that gave rise to monkeys , apes and humans .
The only other way lemurs could have acquired lentiviruses would have required mammals such as infected bats to wing their way across the 400 km span of ocean between Madagascar and Africa – which the scientists consider unlikely .
The findings upend long - held beliefs about how long primates have carried HIV - like viruses , and how recently these viruses evolved .
" There was a generally accepted maximum of a million years , " Gifford said .
" But many people thought it might be less than that . "
Honing in on how long species carrying lentiviruses have harboured the pathogens helps scientists understand how they spread and evolve in wild populations , and the prevalence of biological defences against them .
Certain species of primates , such as mandrills , sooty mangabeys and green monkeys , harbour the viruses without getting ill .
That knowledge could be used to protect humans from transmission of other HIV - like viruses still confined to wildlife .
It could also help drug development by pinpointing features of the virus that remain fixed through its evolution .
These fixed features may prove critical for normal functioning of the virus , and provide a target for new Aids drugs .
The HIV - 2 strain is widely accepted to have been passed from sooty mangabeys in west Africa to humans , probably bushmeat hunters or those keeping the primates as pets , or both .
Scientists believe HIV - 1 was passed from chimpanzees to humans .
" There 's an imperative to try to establish from these findings what the distribution of lentiviruses is , what the routes of transmission are , and the time frame , " Gifford said .
Cars and homes were burnt as settlers rampaged after the eviction
Outgoing Israeli PM
Ehud Olmert has compared the violence used by Jewish settlers against Palestinians in Hebron to bygone anti-Semitism in Europe .
He told Cabinet he was ashamed by recent scenes in the West Bank city , which he said amounted to a pogrom .
The settlers shot and wounded three Palestinians and set fire to property after Israeli security forces evicted a Jewish group from a disputed building .
Correspondents say Mr Olmert 's use of " pogrom " has particular resonance .
It is usually associated with the anti-Semitic violence Jewish people experienced in Europe and Russia in the 19th and 20th centuries .
" As a Jew , I was ashamed at the scenes of Jews opening fire at innocent Arabs in Hebron .
There is no other definition than the term ' pogrom ' to describe what I have seen , " he told Cabinet members , according to public radio .
" We are the sons of a nation who know what is meant by a pogrom , and I am using the word only after deep reflection . "
Video from an Israeli human rights group showed two settlers shooting Palestinian rock - throwers on Thursday .
About 600 Jewish settlers live in the city , with several thousand more in surrounding settlements .
It is not the first time Mr Olmert has used the word to condemn Jewish settlers - in October he described a rampage through a Palestinian village in the West Bank as a pogrom .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - U.S. scientists have created the first human model for studying a devastating nerve disease , which allows them to watch how the disease develops and could help researchers find a way to treat it .
Using skin cells from a child with spinal muscular atrophy , a genetic disease that attacks motor neurons in the spinal cord , researchers grew batches of nerve cells with the same genetic defects .
The finding allowed scientists to watch the nerve cells die off .
“ Now we can start from the beginning of development and replay the disease process in the lab dish , ” Clive Svendsen of the University of Wisconsin - Madison said in a telephone interview .
The finding , reported on Sunday in the journal Nature , marks the latest advance in research that reprograms ordinary cells to look and act like embryonic stem cells -- the master cells of the body that can produce any type of tissue or blood cell .
Spinal muscular atrophy is the most common cause of childhood death caused by a genetic mutation , Svendsen said .
It is caused by a deficiency of a protein called SMN , for survival of motor neurons .
“ That SMN protein is important for motor neuron survival .
They are the cells that make muscles move , ” Svendsen said .
Infants with the most severe form the disease develop normally for the first six months of life , and then gradually develop muscle weakness and loss of motor control .
“ They end up completely paralyzed , ” Svendsen said , adding they typically die around age 2 .
MAKING NEURONS
Svendsen ’s team made motor neurons that contained the genetic defect that causes SMA with a powerful new type of cell called induced pluripotent stem cells , or iPS cells , which behave like embryonic stem cells .
The researchers used skin cells from a child with SMA to make iPS cells , and induced these cells to become motor neurons .
Because every cell in the body contains the same genetic instructions , the motor neurons made from the child also carry the genetic disease .
The team also made motor neurons with cells from the child ’s healthy mother .
After two months , the motor neurons from the child ’s cells began to die , while the mother ’s neurons kept developing normally .
“ We suddenly had a split and it was related to the lack of the SMN protein , ” Svendsen said .
Since iPS cells can grow for months or years in the lab , the experiment can be repeated in many batches of cells .
Svendsen likens it to a video of a car accident .
“ You can watch the tape again and again and work out how the accident happened .
In iPS , it allows you to replay the disease , ” he said .
Svendsen said the discovery will allow drug makers to test potential treatments to prevent nerve death in SMA .
His lab is one of many using iPS cells as a new tool for studying disease .
Earlier this year , Harvard Stem Cell Institute Kevin Eggan created iPS cell lines from skin cells of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or ALS , commonly known as Lou Gehrig ’s disease .

Deadly pistol shrimp that stuns prey with sound as loud as Concorde found in UK waters
A prawn which can make a sound louder than a jet engine has been found in British waters .
Pistol shrimps - which stun their prey by snapping their claws together to create a deafening ' crack ' - normally live in the sub -tropics .
Despite being less than an inch long , the creatures can emit an astonishing 218 decibels - louder than a gunshot .
Super shrimp :
The pistol shrimp is only 2 cm long but can make a noise louder than Concorde 's sonic boom
The sound stuns small fish and crabs , allowing the shrimp to move in for the kill .
The creatures , also known as snapping shrimps , are native to the warmer waters of the Mediterranean and have only been found swimming off the coast of Britain a handful of times this century .
A pair were discovered last week near the mouth of the Helford River in Cornwall by crab fisherman Tim Bailey , 56 .
They were brought to the Blue Reef Aquarium in Newquay , where staff were forced to separate them to stop them stunning each other .
Curator Matt Slater , who collected the creatures from Mr Bailey , said : ' Only a handful of this type of shrimp have ever been recorded in UK waters , although their numbers do appear to be on the rise .
' I started to think they were something special while I was driving back from Falmouth .
' I kept on hearing this cracking noise from the back of the vehicle as if someone was popping bubble wrap .
' It was n't until we unloaded the bucket that I realised the sound was coming from the shrimps snapping their claws together . '
Ben Marshall , a scientist at the aquarium , added : ' They are among the loudest marine animals .
They simply snap their claw to make a loud noise , and it 's 218 decibels . '
He said the level of noise made by the shrimps was comparable with that produced by a sperm whale .
' That is 40 tonnes , and this is 2 cm , ' he added .
' The click of the claw stuns the victim for enough time for them to get on it and kill it - from tiny shrimp to anything planktonic .
' The noise is very instantaneous .
It 's not like a shotgun blast .
It lasts literally a fraction of a second , but it 's enough to stun the prey they 're after . '
Douglas Herdson , the information officer at the National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth , said that the creatures are so loud that they can be heard by sailors .
' I have heard of yachtsmen being moored in a bay and not being able to sleep because of the noise these shrimps make , ' he said .
He added that the species is likely to be seen in UK waters more often as sea temperatures rise .
The British pair may have been carried to the UK as larvae by a passing ship .
There are around 600 species of pistol shrimp worldwide .
Most dig burrows and feed off small crabs and fish .
ATHENS ( Reuters ) - Greece welcomed back on Tuesday a marble fragment from a frieze decorating the Parthenon temple which an Austrian soldier removed during World War Two , but renewed a call for all its stolen treasures to be returned .
An inscription on the fragment , measuring 7 - by - 30 cm ( 2.8 by 12 inches ) , says it was taken from the Acropolis in Athens on February 16 , 1943 -- in the midst of the three - year occupation of Greece by the Axis powers , led by Germany .
Martha Dahlgren inherited the piece -- broken from the frieze adorning the Parthenon ’s inner colonnade -- from her grandfather and decided to return it to Greece .
“ Today we honor the return of an architectural part of the Acropolis ...
It is a very symbolic return , ” Greek Culture Minister Michalis Liapis said in a statement .
Greece in recent years has stepped up its campaign to recover ancient artifacts , and especially large sections of the decorative frieze removed from the Parthenon in 1801 by Lord Elgin , the then - British ambassador to the Ottoman empire .
The Parthenon Marbles , also known as the Elgin Marbles , were bought by the British Museum in 1816 and are exhibited as a prized part of its collection in London .
The British Museum repeatedly has rejected Greek calls for the return of the 2,500 - year - old frieze on the ground that its statutes would not allow it to do so .
“ The request for the return of the Parthenon Marbles has exceeded the borders of our country .
It has become the request and the vision of the global cultural community , ” Liapis said , flanked by two leading archaeologists who support the return .
The fragment was the third piece of the Parthenon Marbles to return home in recent months after the Vatican returned a small fragment on a one - year loan last month and a museum in Sicily gave back another piece in September .
The Mexican army is targeting gangs involved in kidnapping and drugs
A US anti-kidnapping expert who has negotiated the release of dozens of hostages in Latin America has been abducted by gunmen in Mexico .
Felix Batista , a Cuban - American from Miami , was kidnapped as he stepped outside a restaurant to answer a phone call in the northern city of Saltillo .
Drug gangs are blamed for hundreds of kidnappings in Mexico each year .
More than 5,000 people have been killed in drug - related violence between rival cartels this year .
Mr Batista is credited with negotiating the release of many kidnap victims .
He was in Saltillo , in Coahuila state , to offer advice on how to deal with kidnaps for ransom when he himself was seized last Wednesday , local authorities revealed on Monday .
Support for family
Charlie LeBlanc , president of Houston - based security firm ASI Global LLC , where Mr Batista is a consultant , said : " We have notified the FBI and Mexican authorities , and they are working on the case .
" We are offering our support to the family and hoping for the best . "
He declined to say whether the kidnappers had demanded a ransom .
The US embassy in Mexico City said it was investigating and would not comment further .
Hundreds of people are kidnapped in Mexico every year .
The number of victims has increased sharply following an army - backed crackdown on drug gangs , which has forced cartels to seek new ways of making money to fund their operations .
Airport security staff strip - searched a clown on his way onto a plane – because they thought he could ’ve been a terrorist .
Children ’s entertainer Dave Vaughan – aka PC Konk the clown – was frisked by security guards at Birmingham International Airport after setting off a security alarm , and was ordered by cops to strip down from his clown costume to shorts and tee - shirt .
Stunned PC
Konk – who was wearing bright blue clown trousers , massive shoes and a flashing police helmet – was trying to board a flight for disadvantaged youngsters .
He had been booked by Variety Club Midlands to perform for children on the Search for Santa trip , which involves a one - hour round flight .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
PC Konk was even made to hand over his plastic handcuffs , as they were deemed a ‘ risk ’ .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Mr Vaughan , 60 , from Shard End , Birmingham , who has been a children ’s entertainer for 25 years , said : ‘ I just could n’t believe it when they told me to get undressed so they could search me and my belongings .
‘ I showed them my police clown identity card , which had my picture next to the my credentials as a member of the Criminal Insane Department , but I do n’t think that really helped !
‘ My plastic scissors and camera got through fine , as did my funny glasses and bubble machine , but then they discovered my plastic toy handcuffs .
I told them I had bought them from the Early Learning Centre especially for the trip but they still said they were a risk .
‘ I suppose they have to be really safety - conscious nowadays , but I ’ve never had this problem before when I ’ve been to international clown conventions abroad . ’
Security guards spent 10 minutes examining PC Konk ’s outfit , including his clown shoes and bubbles .
They eventually released Mr Vaughan when they discovered his costume featured a metal band which held up his pantaloons – the reason he set off the alarm .

Michelle Bachmann found out the hard way that getting caught up in the moment with Chris Matthews can be hazardous to one 's political health .
But she survived to serve another two - year term in Congress .
In what no doubt became the most closely watched House race for Matthews , the Minnesota Republican retained a seat that was put in jeopardy after controversial comments she made on his MSNBC talk show a few weeks back .
Lots of other folks from outside the district were paying attention to it as well , after Bachmann questioned Barack Obama 's patriotism and called for a wide - ranging media investigation of whether her colleagues on Capitol Hill held pro- or anti-American views .
Her remarks sparked a spurt of donations to her Democratic rival , Elwyn Tinklenberg , and cast in doubt her reelection prospects .
Bachmann first won the suburban and exurban district surrounding Minnesota 's Twin Cities two years ago by an 8 - percentage - point margin .
With most of the vote counted in Tuesday 's vote , she led Tinklenberg by 4 percentage points .
She had to sweat it out for a while , but in her victory speech to supporters , she said : " Thank you , Team Bachmann !
You rock ! "
[ UPDATE ] :
On the stage near Bachmann was a sign that read , “ Nice try Chris Matthews . ”
No word on whether she 'll be sitting down soon with him to discuss her close call .

US : Economic stress drives rise in child abuse and domestic violence
By Kate Randall
30 December 2008
As families confront the impact of the current economic crisis , social service agencies across the US are seeing growing numbers of cases of domestic violence and child abuse .
The correlation between financial stress and the growing incidence of such cases is shown in increased calls to hotlines , visits to emergency rooms and the utilization of social services and shelters .
Lisa Rivera , a staff attorney at the Domestic Violence Clinical Center in New York , told the New York Lawyer , " When you speak with victims of violence , they talk about the stressors in their lives and the stressors in their abusers ' lives — loss of a job , loss of income . "
" This is a very stressful time , " Baltimore Health Commissioner Dr. Joshua Sharfstein told the Washington Afro American .
" Everyone 's waiting for the next shoe to drop . "
As the recession deepens , social workers and medical professionals expect the situation to worsen .
And while more women and children — the primary targets of this violence — become victims , funding for programs to assist them is being cut back .
The impact is being felt in states across the country .
Domestic violence shelters in Texas are experiencing an unprecedented jump in families seeking emergency assistance .
Of the 29 shelters surveyed by the Allstate Foundation this year , 83 percent reported a dramatic increase in hotline calls , walk - ins , and / or families staying at their shelters .
Walk - ins at one Texas shelter were up by 240 percent over one year ago , and the number of women and children staying in shelters has increased by as much as 71 percent in some cases .
Calls to many emergency shelter hotlines have doubled .
" Every year the stresses of the holiday season send women and children fleeing for safety , " Paige Fink , executive director of Family Place in Dallas , told the Allstate study .
" But this year , the financial pressures of the holiday season are compounded by the weakened economy . "
Shelter directors in Texas said they expect the situation to worsen , as many women try to keep their families together during the holidays , only to seek shelter in January when their home situation becomes untenable .
In Florida , the number of calls received by the state 's Department of Children and Families ' hotline is up by more than 12,000 over the 12 - month period ending in October .
DCF Secretary George Sheldon attributes the rise to the financial stresses of job loss and dwindling family budgets .
By state officials ' estimates , one in five cases reported to the hotline represents a legitimate child abuse case , which would translate into 2,400 children in danger .
Despite the urgent need for care , Florida is likely to carry out cuts to social services programs in order to deal with an estimated $ 2 billion budget deficit .
Child welfare experts in the Sacramento , California region are concerned about the number of children at risk for abuse as the economy worsens .
Sacramento County Child Protective Services is seeing an increase in both the number and severity of child abuse cases .
In October , there were 460 reported situations where a child 's safety was in such immediate risk that an investigator was required to respond immediately .
The Child Abuse Prevention Council of Placer County ( Calif . ) handles cases involving sexual and physical abuse , abandonment and medical and educational neglect .
The council has seen a 65 percent increase in need for its services , and is struggling to keep up with demand .
Placer County , with the region 's highest per capita income , saw its unemployment rate rise to 7.4 percent in October from 5 percent a year earlier .
Median home sale prices plunged by 20.5 percent in the same period .
The county recorded 1,833 foreclosures from January through October , up from 668 for the same period last year , according to MDA DataQuick .
Deanne Thornton , executive director of the Placer County council , told the Sacramento Bee , " Parents are losing their jobs and their health plans .
Families are facing foreclosure and they do n't know where to turn . "
Rhode Island has recently seen a 25 percent increase in felony - level domestic violence crimes .
Victims ' advocates say that economic stress contributes to more frequent and violent abuse , posing grave dangers to the victims , who have fewer opportunities to seek help or to get away from their abusers .
From 2005 to 2007 , the rate of domestic violence - related homicide in Massachusetts tripled , according to the Boston Globe .
Researcher Jaclyn Campbell identified the risk factors contributing to this horrific statistic as limited access to services for the victim and joblessness for the person committing the crime .
In Fairfax County , Virginia , investigations of child neglect have surged by 152 percent , comparing July - October 2008 to the same four - month period in 2007 .
Many of these investigations are the result of families living without heat or electricity , or failing to provide children with medical care .
Abuse and neglect investigations combined rose by 23 percent .
In nearby Washington DC , the nation 's capital , there was an 18 percent increase in child neglect and abuse investigations during the same period .
Allison Jackson , medical director of the Children 's National Medical Center , has noticed an increase in the number of children coming to the emergency room with burns , broken bones , fractured skulls and injured stomachs .
Jackson told the Washington Post , " We are all questioning whether it's the economy and the stresses that come with a bad economy . "
The need for shelters and services for victims of domestic violence is immense .
A 24 - hour census conducted in 2007 by the National Network to End Domestic Violence found , in one day , that more than 53,000 women , men and children across the US received services from domestic violence programs .
Over 25,000 of these individuals were able to find refuge in emergency domestic violence shelters or transitional housing , while more than 7,700 victims did not receive help because the programs lacked adequate funding and resources .
Need for these services will surely rise as more families face the loss of a job , wage cuts , lose their medical coverage , or go into foreclosure .
A September 2004 study released by the National Institute of Justice revealed a direct link between such stress and domestic violence :
• Women whose male partners experience two or more periods of unemployment over the five - year course of the study were three times more likely to be abused .
• Couples under " financial strain " had triple the domestic violence rate of other couples in the population .
Despite such data , as the demand for services grows under the weight of these economic strains , federal funding to a key program that serves victims of domestic violence has been cut : $ 2.1 million was slashed from The Family Violence Prevention and Services budget earlier this year .
To solve the third layer , the speedcuber must assemble all of the yellow squares on the bottom face by applying one of 40 algorithms in a phase called “ orientation . ”
The cuber must instantly recognize which algorithm to apply in order to have any hope of solving it with haste .
In the final step , permutation , one of 13 algorithms restores the cube ’s chromatic harmony , one color per face .
Image MATH AS METHOD Jessica Fridrichs strategy for quickly solving the Rubiks Cube requires using at least 53 algorithms .
Credit ... Bina Venkataraman
The world ’s fastest speedcubers , including Dr. Fridrich , know more than 100 algorithms to whisk the cube to its solution .
They recognize when the puzzle is jumbled or positioned in their palms in a way that one set of moves is quicker than 99 others .
As a teenager , Dr. Fridrich saw a man demonstrating the Rubik ’s Cube at a mathematics seminar , and scrambled defiantly through a crowd to touch it .
She says it was immediately clear that she was “ cube possessed , ” her shorthand for people who spend most of their waking hours learning to speed - solve the cube .
Even though no cubes were for sale in her country then  the few people who had them bought them in Hungary  she would not be stopped .
She picked up Kvant , a Russian math journal that outlined one method of solving the cube , and worked it out on paper .
When she finally got her first cube , left behind by family friends visiting from France , she began to improvise , cubing faster and faster to beat record times from Prague , Hungary and the United States printed in newspapers .
By the time the Czech national championship took place in 1982 , Dr. Fridrich was one of the fastest speedcubers in the country .
She won the championship , solving the cube in less than 23 and a half seconds  a time that would now be laughably long in international competition  going onto place 10th in the first world championship in Budapest .
After earning her master ’s degree , she was building mathematical models of rock deformation at a mining institute when she was recruited by a professor from Binghamton who heard about her mastery of the cube and her grades at the Czech Technical University in Prague .
After a brief meeting in which she described her cube algorithms , he asked her to apply for the doctoral program in systems sciences .
She had no résumé , so she dashed one off on a typewriter just before the professor ’s train left the station .
A year later , she arrived in Binghamton , where she has lived ever since .
In her research in digital forensics , Dr. Fridrich uses computers to tackle another seemingly intractable puzzle : matching a photograph with the individual camera that took it .
Law enforcement agencies plan to use the techniques to track down child pornographers and movie pirates .
Shocking images : A senior nurse at Haifa 's Bnei Zion Medical Center 's neonatal unit was photographed recently with a premature baby - girl in her uniform pocket – as a humorous gesture .
Ynet has obtained the original footage , but has chosen not to reveal the nurse 's identity .
The nurse is considered one of the ward 's most dedicated employees , with a career spanning more than a dozen years .
Medical Beat Preemie spontaneously breathes hours after pronounced dead Eli Senyor Medical staff at Nahariya hospital stunned by premature baby showing vital signs five hours after being pronounced dead , kept in hospital cryolab .
Case dubbed medical miracle , Health Ministry to launch probe Preemie spontaneously breathes hours after pronounced dead
The hospital 's administration refused to allow the nurse or the neonatal unit 's director to personally comment on the photo , opting instead to release the following statement : " The Bnei Zion Medical Center 's management views this incident as severe and will take the appropriate disciplinary actions against all those involved . "
The Health Ministry issued a statement calling the incident " grievous . "
The nurse in question is scheduled to go before a ministry review board on Monday .
The kangaroo method ?
Preemie in a pocket
Dr. Amnon Rofe , director - general of the Bnei Zion Medical Center , said that the hospital received an anonymous complaint , which was immediately investigated .
The photo , he told Ynet , was taken as part of a presentation meant to be screened for parents of premature babies hospitalized in the the neonatal unit .
" It Illustrates the ' kangaroo method ' which is supposed to teach parents how to create a direct physical bond with the preemies , " he said .
" After we realized that when people see the photo they either smile or are completely shocked , we decided to take it out of the presentation . "
The nurse shown in the photo , stressed Dr. Rofe , " is a senior nurse , who 's very good at her job .
All she did was pose for the photo , she did n't initiate it . "
' Heads will roll '
Prof. Francis Mimouni , head of Pediatrics Medicine at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem , said that while completely inappropriate , the only thing the photo indicated was poor judgment : " If the baby 's parents agreed , and the photo was taken under the proper medical supervision , I do n't see a real problem .
" However , if it was done without the parents ' consent I believe heads will roll . "
Another neonatologist said that although the act is far from acceptable , the baby is clearly in no danger : " This is n’t something we do in neonatal units , but the preemie look stable .
I 'm sure no one would have taken her out of her incubator if it was life - threatening . "
Oren Malberger , head of Lahav , the Israeli preemie association , was appalled by the photo : " This is outrageous and something must be done , " he told Ynet .
" The neonatal unit at Bnei Zion is a reputable one , but this incident demonstrates , once again , the grave shortage of personnel in such units , which sometimes results in hospitals having to hire people who fail to meet the high standards required of neonatal professionals .
Nevertheless , we are sure the hospital will handle the incident in the proper manner . "
Ilana Cohen , head of the Israeli Nurses Union , was equally horrified : " Never , in all my years of nursing , have I seen such a thing .
It 's absolutely horrible .
They could have used a doll . "
Knesset Member Nadia Hilou ( Labor - Meimad ) , who chairs the Knesset 's Committee on Rights of the Child , said the photo represented " another low in the cruelty shown to babies and preemies .
How can we work to boost fertility on one hand and once the babies arrive demonstrate such disregard for their lives ? "
The incident generated massive negative publicity which put a damper on neonatologists ' efforts to illustrate the dire conditions of neonatal care in Israel : According to data recently presented before the Knesset , neonatal units have just one nurse for every eight babies , while the standard calls for one nurse for every four .
More than 20 % of the units ' physician posts are left unfulfilled .
BORROWING FROM PETER TO PAY PAUL :
THE WALL STREET PONZI SCHEME CALLED FRACTIONAL RESERVE BANKING
Cartoon in the New Yorker :
A gun-toting man with large dark glasses , large hat pulled down , stands in front of a bank teller , who is reading a demand note .
It says , � Give me all the money in my account . �
Bernie Madoff showed us how it was done : you induce many investors to invest their money , promising steady above - market returns ; and you deliver � at least on paper .
When your clients check their accounts , they see that their investments have indeed increased by the promised amount .
Anyone who opts to pull out of the game is paid promptly and in full .
You can afford to pay because most players stay in , and new players are constantly coming in to replace those who drop out .
The players who drop out are simply paid with the money coming in from new recruits .
The scheme works until the market turns and many players want their money back at once .
Then it�s game over : you have to admit that you don�t have the funds , and you are probably looking at jail time .
A Ponzi scheme is a form of pyramid scheme in which earlier investors are paid with the money of later investors rather than from real profits .
The perpetuation of the scheme requires an ever - increasing flow of money from investors in order to keep it going .
Charles Ponzi was an engaging Boston ex-convict who defrauded investors out of $ 6 million in the 1920s by promising them a 400 percent return on redeemed postal reply coupons .
When he finally could not pay , the scam earned him ten years in jail ; and Bernie Madoff is likely to wind up there as well .
Most people are not involved in illegal Ponzi schemes , but we do keep our money in accounts that are tallied on computer screens rather than in stacks of coins or paper bills .
How do we know that when we demand our money from our bank or broker that the funds will be there ?
The fact that banks are subject to �runs� ( recall Northern Rock , Indymac and Washington Mutual ) suggests that all may not be as it seems on our online screens .
Banks themselves are involved in a sort of Ponzi scheme , one that has been perpetuated for hundreds of years .
What distinguishes the legal scheme known as �fractional reserve� lending from the illegal schemes of Bernie Madoff and his ilk is that the bankers � scheme is protected by government charter and backstopped with government funds .
At last count , the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury had committed $ 8.5 trillion to bailing out the banks from their follies .
1
By comparison , M2 , the largest measure of the money supply now reported by the Federal Reserve , was just under $ 8 trillion in December 2008.2
The sheer size of the bailout efforts indicates that the banking scheme has reached its mathematical limits and needs to be superseded by something more sustainable .
Penetrating the Bankers� Ponzi Scheme
What fractional reserve lending is and how it works is summed up in Wikipedia as follows :
� Fractional - reserve banking is the banking practice in which banks keep only a fraction of their deposits in reserve ( as cash and other liquid assets ) with the choice of lending out the remainder , while maintaining the simultaneous obligation to redeem all deposits immediately upon demand .
This practice is universal in modern banking .
. . . The nature of fractional - reserve banking is that there is only a fraction of cash reserves available at the bank needed to repay all of the demand deposits and banknotes issued .
. . .
When Fractional - reserve banking works , it works because :
� 1 . Over any typical period of time , redemption demands are largely or wholly offset by new deposits or issues of notes .
The bank thus needs only to satisfy the excess amount of redemptions .
� 2 . Only a minority of people will actually choose to withdraw their demand deposits or present their notes for payment at any given time .
� 3 . People usually keep their funds in the bank for a prolonged period of time .
� 4 . There are usually enough cash reserves in the bank to handle net redemptions .
� If the net redemption demands are unusually large , the bank will run low on reserves and will be forced to raise new funds from additional borrowings ( e.g. by borrowing from the money market or using lines of credit held with other banks ) , and / or sell assets , to avoid running out of reserves and defaulting on its obligations .
If creditors are afraid that the bank is running out of cash , they have an incentive to redeem their deposits as soon as possible , triggering a bank run . �
Like in other Ponzi schemes , bank runs result because the bank does not actually have the funds necessary to meet all its obligations .
Peter�s money has been lent to Paul , with the interest income going to the bank .
As Elgin Groseclose , Director of the Institute for International Monetary Research , wryly observed in 1934 :
� A warehouseman , taking goods deposited with him and devoting them to his own profit , either by use or by loan to another , is guilty of a tort , a conversion of goods for which he is liable in civil , if not in criminal , law .
By a casuistry which is now elevated into an economic principle , but which has no defenders outside the realm of banking , a warehouseman who deals in money is subject to a diviner law : the banker is free to use for his private interest and profit the money left in trust .
. . .
He may even go further .
He may create fictitious deposits on his books , which shall rank equally and ratably with actual deposits in any division of assets in case of liquidation .�3
How did the perpetrators of this scheme come to acquire government protection for what might otherwise have landed them in jail ?
A short history of the evolution of modern - day banking may be instructive .
The Evolution of a Government - Sanctioned Ponzi Scheme
What came to be known as fractional reserve lending dates back to the seventeenth century , when trade was conducted primarily in gold and silver coins .
How it evolved was described by the Chicago Federal Reserve in a revealing booklet called � Modern Money Mechanics � like this :
� It started with goldsmiths .
As early bankers , they initially provided safekeeping services , making a profit from vault storage fees for gold and coins deposited with them .
People would redeem their " deposit receipts " whenever they needed gold or coins to purchase something , and physically take the gold or coins to the seller who , in turn , would deposit them for safekeeping , often with the same banker .
Everyone soon found that it was a lot easier simply to use the deposit receipts directly as a means of payment .
These receipts , which became known as notes , were acceptable as money since whoever held them could go to the banker and exchange them for metallic money .
� Then , bankers discovered that they could make loans merely by giving their promises to pay , or bank notes , to borrowers .
In this way , banks began to create money .
More notes could be issued than the gold and coin on hand because only a portion of the notes outstanding would be presented for payment at any one time .
Enough metallic money had to be kept on hand , of course , to redeem whatever volume of notes was presented for payment .
� Transaction deposits are the modern counterpart of bank notes .
It was a small step from printing notes to making book entries crediting deposits of borrowers , which the borrowers in turn could �spend � by writing checks , thereby �printing � their own money . �
If a landlord had rented the same house to five people at one time and pocketed the money , he would quickly have been jailed for fraud .
But the bankers had devised a system in which they traded , not things of value , but paper receipts for them .
It was called �fractional reserve� lending because the gold held in reserve was a mere fraction of the banknotes it supported .
The scheme worked as long as only a few people came for their gold at one time ; but investors would periodically get suspicious and all demand their gold back at once .
There would then be a run on the bank and it would have to close its doors .
This cycle of booms and busts went on throughout the nineteenth century , culminating in a particularly bad bank panic in 1907 .
The public became convinced that the country needed a central banking system to stop future panics , overcoming strong congressional opposition to any bill allowing the nation�s money to be issued by a private central bank controlled by Wall Street .
The Federal Reserve Act creating such a �bankers � bank� was passed in 1913 .
Robert Owens , a co-author of the Act , later testified before Congress that the banking industry had conspired to create a series of financial panics in order to rouse the people to demand �reforms � that served the interests of the financiers .
4
Despite this powerful official backstop , however , the greatest bank run in history occurred only twenty years later , in 1933 .
President Roosevelt then took the dollar off the gold standard domestically , and Federal Reserve officials resolved to prevent further bank runs after that by flooding the banking system with �liquidity � ( money created as debt to banks ) whenever the banking Ponzi scheme came up short .
� Too Big to Fail� : The Government Provides the Ultimate Backstop
When these steps too proved insufficient to keep the banking scheme going , the government itself stepped up to the plate , providing bailout money directly from the taxpayers .
The concept that some banks were �too big to fail� came in at the end of the 1980s , when the Savings and Loans collapsed and Citibank lost 50 percent of its share price .
Negotiations were conducted behind closed doors , and �too big to fail� became standard policy .
Bank risk was effectively nationalized : banks were now protected by the government from loss regardless of risk - taking or bad management .
There are limits , however , to the amount of support even the government�s deep pocket can provide .
In the past two decades , the bankers � lending scheme has been kept going by an even more speculative scheme known as �derivatives .�
This is a complex subject that has been explored in other articles , but the bottom line is that more dollars are now owed in the derivatives casino than exist on the planet .
( See Ellen Brown , � It �s the Derivatives , Stupid ! � and � Credit Default Swaps : Derivative Disaster Du Jour , � www.webofdebt.com/articles.)
� Attempting to fill the derivatives black hole with taxpayer money must inevitably be at the expense of other essential programs , such as Social Security and Medicare .
Interestingly , Social Security and Medicare themselves are in some sense Ponzi schemes , since earlier retirees collect their benefits from the contributions of later workers .
These programs , too , may soon be facing bankruptcy , in this case because their mathematical models failed to account for a huge wave of Baby Boomers who would linger longer than previous generations and demand expensive drugs and care through their senior years , and because the fund money has have been drawn on by the government for other purposes .
The question here is , should the government be backstopping private banks that have mismanaged their investment portfolios at the expense of workers contractually entitled to a decent retirement from a fund they have paid into all their working lives ?
The answer , of course , is no ; but there may be a way that the government could do both .
If it were to nationalize the banking system completely � if the government were to assume not just the banks � losses but their profits , oversight and control � it might have the funds both to maintain Social Security and Medicare and to provide a sustainable credit mechanism for the whole economy .
Replacing Private with Public Credit
Readily available credit has made America � the land of opportunity � ever since the days of the American colonists .
What has transformed this credit system into a Ponzi scheme that must continually be propped up with bailout money is that the credit power has been turned over to private parties who always require more money back than they create in the first place .
Benjamin Franklin reportedly explained this defect in the eighteenth century .
When the directors of the Bank of England asked what was responsible for the booming economy of the young colonies , Franklin explained that the colonial governments issued their own money , which they both lent and spent into the economy :
� In the Colonies , we issue our own paper money .
It is called � Colonial Scrip . �
We issue it in proper proportion to make the goods pass easily from the producers to the consumers .
In this manner , creating ourselves our own paper money , we control its purchasing power and we have no interest to pay to no one .
You see , a legitimate government can both spend and lend money into circulation , while banks can only lend significant amounts of their promissory bank notes , for they can neither give away nor spend but a tiny fraction of the money the people need .
Thus , when your bankers here in England place money in circulation , there is always a debt principal to be returned and usury to be paid .
The result is that you have always too little credit in circulation to give the workers full employment .
You do not have too many workers , you have too little money in circulation , and that which circulates , all bears the endless burden of unpayable debt and usury . �
In an article titled �A Monetary System for the New Millennium , � Canadian money reform advocate Roger Langrick explains his concept in contemporary terms .
He begins by illustrating the mathematical impossibility inherent in a system of bank - created money lent at interest :
� [ I ] magine the first bank which prints and lends out $ 100 .
For its efforts it asks for the borrower to return $ 110 in one year ; that is it asks for 10 % interest .
Unwittingly , or maybe wittingly , the bank has created a mathematically impossible situation .
The only way in which the borrower can return 110 of the bank�s notes is if the bank prints , and lends , $ 10 more at 10 % interest . . . .
The result of creating 100 and demanding 110 in return , is that the collective borrowers of a nation are forever chasing a phantom which can never be caught ; the mythical $ 10 that were never created .
The debt in fact is unrepayable .
Each time $ 100 is created for the nation , the nation�s overall indebtedness to the system is increased by $ 110 .
The only solution at present is increased borrowing to cover the principal plus the interest of what has been borrowed . �
The better solution , says Langrick , is to allow the government to issue enough new debt - free dollars to cover the interest charges not created by the banks as loans :
� Instead of taxes , government would be empowered to create money for its own expenses up to the balance of the debt shortfall .
Thus , if the banking industry created $ 100 in a year , the government would create $ 10 which it would use for its own expenses .
Abraham Lincoln used this successfully when he created $ 500 million of �greenbacks � to fight the Civil War . �
National Credit from a Truly National Banking System
In Langrick�s example , a private banking industry pockets the interest , which must be replaced every year by a 10 percent issue of new Greenbacks ; but there is another possibility .
The loans could be advanced by the government itself .
The interest would then return to the government and could be spent back into the economy in a circular flow , without the need to continually issue more money to cover the interest shortfall .
The fractional reserve Ponzi scheme is bankrupt , and the banks engaged in it , rather than being bailed out by its victims , need to be put into a bankruptcy reorganization under the FDIC .
The FDIC then has the recognized option of wiping their books clean and taking the banks � stock in return for getting them up and running again .
This would make them truly �national � banks , which could dispense � the full faith and credit of the United States� as a public utility .
A truly national banking system could revive the economy with the sort of money only governments can issue � debt - free legal tender .
The money would be debt - free to the government , while for the private sector , it would be freely available for borrowing at a modest interest by qualified applicants .
A government - owned bank would not need to rob from Peter to advance credit to Paul .
� Credit� is just an accounting tool � an advance against future profits , or the �monetization� ( turning into cash ) of the borrower�s promise to repay .
As British commentator Ron Morrison observed in a provocative 2004 article titled � Keynes Without Debt� :
� [ Today ] bank credit supplies virtually all our everyday means of exchange , and this brings into sharp focus the simple fact that modern money is no longer constrained by outmoded intrinsic values .
It is pure fiat [ enforced by law ] and simply a glorified accounting system .
. . .
Modern monetary reform is about displacing the current economic paradigm of �what can be afforded � with �what we have the capacity to undertake .��5
The objection to government - issued money has always been that it would be inflationary , but today some �reflating� of the economy could be a good thing .
Just in the last year , more than $ 7 trillion in purchasing power has disappeared from the money supply , including wealth destruction in real estate , stocks , mutual fund shares , life insurance and pension fund reserves .
6
Money is evaporating because old loans are defaulting and new loans are not being made to replace them .
Fortunately , as Martin Wolf noted in the December 16 Financial Times , � Curing deflation is child�s play in a � fiat money � � a man -made money � system . �
The central banks just need to get money flowing into the economy again .
Among other ways they could do this , says Wolf , is that �they might finance the government on any scale they think necessary .�7
Rather than throwing money at a failed private banking system , public credit could be redirected into infrastructure and other projects that would get the wheels of production turning again .
The Ponzi scheme in which debt is just shuffled around , borrowing from one player to pay another without actually producing anything of real value , could be replaced by a system in which the national credit card became an engine for true productivity and growth .
Increased � demand� ( money ) would come from earned wages and salaries that would increase � supply � ( goods and services ) rather than merely servicing a perpetually increasing debt .
When supply keeps up with demand , the money supply can be increased without inflating prices .
In this way the paradigm of �what we can afford� could indeed be superseded by �what we have the capacity to undertake . �
Ellen Brown developed her research skills as an attorney practicing civil litigation in Los Angeles .
In Web of Debt , her latest book , she turns those skills to an analysis of the Federal Reserve and � the money trust .�
She shows how this private cartel has usurped the power to create money from the people themselves , and how we the people can get it back .
Her earlier books focused on the pharmaceutical cartel that gets its power from � the money trust .�
Her eleven books include Forbidden Medicine , Nature�s Pharmacy ( co-authored with Dr. Lynne Walker ) , and The Key to Ultimate Health ( co- authored with Dr. Richard Hansen ) .

Police in Mexico have found nine decapitated bodies close to a highway in the southern state of Guerrero .
Local officials said the victims were a policeman and eight soldiers .
Nine heads were found earlier in plastic bags close to a supermarket , reportedly with a note warning of more decapitations to follow .
Nearly 5,400 people have been murdered in drugs - related violence this year .
Thousands of troops have been deployed across Mexico to tackle drugs gangs .
Local media reported that the soldiers were believed to have been abducted on Saturday as they left a nearby military base , close to the city of Chilpancingo .
Another three decapitated bodies were found on Sunday on the outskirts of the city , officials said .
President Felipe Calderon has deployed about 40,000 troops and police since December 2006 against the drugs cartels .
However , Mexico's top prosecutor has said that the violence is likely to worsen in 2009 as drug gangs split and fight for turf .
Officials say the increasingly gruesome nature of the violence shows that the drugs gangs are being squeezed , intensifying their internal squabbles .
In a statement , the defence ministry said the murders of the soldiers were the result of " the severe blows the Mexican army and air force have dealt to organised crime " and described the drug gangs as " cowards " who had been " cornered and weakened " .
But the latest killings suggest the drug traffickers are prepared to take on the security forces , says the BBC's Stephen Gibbs In Mexico City .
The gruesome tactic of decapitation would appear to be designed to spread fear among anyone who threatens them , he says .
Local media reported that a message was found next to the nine heads warning , " For each one of us they kill , we 'll kill 10 of them . "

ON JANUARY 15 , 1995 , A JAPANESE ROCKET took off from Kagoshima , carrying a Russian - made satellite with German scientific instruments .
The mission ’s purpose was to test materials processing techniques in microgravity and then return the samples to a landing zone in Australia .
But the launch vehicle swerved off course and headed for the horizon .
Ground controllers in Germany listened for radio signals indicating that the satellite had reached a stable orbit , but they heard nothing .
Without such confirmation , they eventually concluded it had fallen back to Earth .
Searching for the satellite was never considered since it could have ended up almost anywhere , and all involved with the mission assumed that the Russian spacecraft would never be seen again .
As it turned out , the heat - shielded landing capsule ended up in northern Ghana , near the town of Tamale , after the satellite had limped around Earth twice in a lopsided orbit .
The capsule ’s parachute had opened as planned , and as the craft drifted down , it broadcast homing signals that nobody picked up .
Villagers outside of Tamale witnessed the landing and called the local schoolmaster .
It was obvious to him that the vehicle was a spacecraft and , given the Cyrillic characters on its side , probably of Russian origin .
The schoolmaster organized a recovery team , who trucked the hardware to a storage room in town .
Then he wrote to officials in Accra asking how to contact the satellite ’s owners .
Months later , news of the space object reached Geoffrey Perry , an amateur satellite tracker in England , who quickly realized it must be the lost Russian vehicle .
He knew whom to call in the German space program , and a few months later , staffers from the German embassy in Ghana showed up in Tamale and asked for their payload .
Along with the capsule , the Germans were given a bill for the storage fee , which they grudgingly paid .
Had the Germans known the capsule ’s point of reentry into the atmosphere , they could have avoided the storage fee .
Eight years later , another team desperately seeking another failed space vehicle knew its point of reentry .
Using models that can predict how space objects fall through Earth ’s atmosphere , this team was able to pinpoint not merely the continent , the country , and even the county where something had fallen , but the likely pasture .
For weeks , searchers on foot had combed the ground in east Texas , seeking pieces of the space shuttle Columbia , which on February 1 , 2003 , had broken apart during reentry , killing all seven astronauts aboard .
The location of each fragment of the shattered shuttle was carefully documented , and then the parts were transported to a hangar at Kennedy Space Center in Florida , where reconstruction efforts tried to help forensic engineers discover what had gone so terribly wrong .
On March 18 , a recovery team was sent to an area that had already been searched ; in fact , it had been marked “ completed . ”
This time , though , the team was seeking one particular piece of hardware that had been aboard Columbia .
Knowing its size and weight , and the distribution of other pieces already recovered , experts in reentry dynamics had concluded that the 58 - pound object — a VCR - size box containing potentially valuable flight data on the doomed mission — would lie in the already - searched area .
Sure enough , on a hillside near Hemphill , Texas , technicians found the Orbiter Experiment Recorder , embedded several inches in the ground .
It contained time - tagged measurements that were exactly what investigation teams needed to pinpoint the moment Columbia ’s left wing had collapsed , an event that preceded the breakup of the vehicle .
The insights that led to the search team ’s discovery had been developed over many years of study at NASA ’s Johnson Space Center in Houston , Texas , and an earlier instance of spacecraft disintegration made the shuttle searchers confident that they were on the right track .
In Shanghai , in particular , it is regarded as socially undesirable to make social visits without appointments in summer , in case the family is lounging around in their underwear to keep the heat at bay .
But , wearing pyjamas to pop down to the shops or to communal loos hardly raises an eyebrow .

Abstract
We address three common misconceptions about capability - based systems : the Equivalence Myth ( access control list ( ACL ) systems and capability systems are formally equivalent ) , the Confinement Myth ( capability systems cannot enforce confinement ) , and the Irrevocability Myth ( capability - based access cannot be revoked ) .
The Equivalence Myth obscures the benefits of capabilities as compared to ACLs , while the Confinement Myth and the Irrevocability Myth lead people to see problems with capabilities that do not exist in practice .
The prevalence of these myths is due to differing interpretations of the capability security model .
To clear up the confusion , we describe three different models that have been used to describe capabilities , and define a set of seven security properties that capture the distinctions among them .
Our analysis in terms of these properties shows that pure capability systems have significant advantages over ACL systems : capabilities provide much better support for least - privilege operation and for avoiding confused deputy problems .
Keywords
Capabilities , access control lists , security models .
Introduction
This paper is concerned with three misconceptions about capability systems that we believe to be prominent among students , researchers , and practitioners of computer security .
Over the course of history , these three myths seem to have achieved the status of common wisdom :
The Equivalence Myth : Access control list ( ACL ) systems and capability systems are formally equivalent .
The Confinement Myth : Capability systems cannot enforce confinement .
The Irrevocability Myth : Capability - based access cannot be revoked .
The first myth obscures important benefits of capability systems , and is based on an incomplete description of ACL systems and capability systems as merely alternate perspectives on Lampson 's access matrix [ 15 ] .
The second and third myths state false limitations on what capability systems can do , and have been propagated by a series of research publications over the past 20 years ( including [ 2 , 3 , 7 , 24 ] ) .
They have been cited as reasons to avoid adopting capability models and have even motivated some researchers to augment capability systems with extra access checks [ 7 , 13 ] in attempts to fix problems that do not exist .
The myths about what capability systems cannot do continue to spread , despite formal results [ 22 ] and practical systems [ 1 , 9 , 18 , 21 ] demonstrating that they can do these supposedly impossible things .
We believe these severe misunderstandings are rooted in the fact that the term capability has come to be portrayed in terms of several very different security models .
This paper describes three common interpretations , which we call Model 2 : Capabilities as Rows , Model 3 : Capabilities as Keys , and Model 4 : Object Capabilities .
We compare these to Model 1 : ACLs as Columns .
We will begin by addressing the three myths directly .
The Equivalence Myth is based on a comparison of the ACLs - as - columns and capabilities - as - rows models ; we will refute this myth by explaining why the comparison it makes is not meaningful and pointing out specific differences between ACL and capability systems in practice .
The other two myths concern what is feasible in a capability system ; we examine them in the context of the object - capability model , which represents the vast majority of implemented " capability - based " or " pure capability " systems .
We will then examine and compare the three different interpretations of capabilities in more detail , to clear up the confusion among them .
In particular , we will identify distinctions between the models in terms of some important security properties , and trace how these interpretations have made the capability myths appear to be reasonable or even obvious statements .
Along the way , we will find that these properties not only dispel the myths , but in fact afford capability - based systems with significant advantages that are crucial for secure operation .
We will conclude with a discussion of these advantages with respect to the principle of least privilege [ 20 ] and the confused deputy problem [ 10 ] .
Terminology
Graphical legend : subject , resource , authority , invocation .
The Equivalence Myth
In order to discuss all of these models together , we need to adopt some consistent terminology .
For the following discussion , we will use the word authority to mean the ability of a subject to access a resource .
Note in particular that we are using the word resource instead of object to mean " a thing to which an authority provides access " , as it is sometimes used .
Instead , we will reserve the word object to mean an encapsulation of state and behaviour , as in object - oriented programming .
Our first myth is the common belief that ACLs and capabilities are formally equivalent .
This usually stems from being introduced to ACLs and capabilities as different views on an access matrix .
/etc / passwd /home/markm/foo /etc/motd
Alice {read} {write} {} Bob {read} {} {read} Carol {read} {write} {read}
The access matrix visualization of authority relationships described by Lampson [ 15 ] is a table indexed by subjects and resources .
The cells of the matrix contain access attributes that specify the kinds of access each subject has to each resource .
For example , consider a simple system with three subjects , three resources , and the permission settings shown in Figure 2 .
For each resource , the corresponding column lists all the kinds of access any subjects have to that resource .
An ACL system associates each resource with an access control list , which represents a column of this matrix .
This is our Model 1 : ACLs as Columns .
For each subject , the corresponding row lists all the kinds of access available to that subject .
A capability system associates each subject with a list of capabilities ( or C- list ) , which represents a row of this matrix .
This is our Model 2 : Capabilities as Rows .
It appears that ACLs and C - lists both represent the same information , and differ only in whether the information is recorded in a by - column or by - row data structure .
If the access matrix constitutes the entire story , then it would seem that the two models are equivalent .
However , such a line of reasoning ignores a crucial factor : the difference between static models and dynamic systems .
Model is Not Dynamic
1 Many ACL systems share some features with Lampson 's rule set , such as an owner attribute .
However , as soon as such rules are taken into account , it 's not possible to claim that ACL systems and capability systems are equivalent , because they use different update rules .
The access matrix is not usually assumed to include a precise specification of the rules that condition how the cells of the matrix may be updated .
Although Lampson 's presentation of the access matrix [ 15 ] actually did suggest a set of such rules , the lasting legacy of this model – what most everyone remembers and teaches to one generation after another – is the matrix itself as a static representation of access rights .
In practice , what most people consider the definition of " ACL system " does not specifically impose Lampson 's rules , or any canonical set of rules .
Subtle changes in these rules for authority manipulation can have far - reaching effects on the security properties of the entire model .
When the matrix is only seen as a static depiction of security state , this makes the access matrix model more general , which can be an advantage for some modelling purposes .
However , the description of any security mechanism is incomplete without a specification of how access relationships are allowed to evolve over time .
Thus , comparing ACL and capability models in terms of the static access matrix alone is insufficient to establish logical equivalence .
In short , the access matrix is indeed general enough to describe both types of security models , but that does not necessarily make them equivalent .
A Shift in Perspective
Switching from a column - based to a row - based organization of the access matrix results in at least three real differences between the models .
Visualizing the access matrix in another way will help make these differences apparent .
This figure will be modified so that the resources are just filenames , and the ACLs contain little boxes ; each box will be labelled with an access mode and contain a dot anchoring an arrow pointing leftward at a subject .
Figure 3 depicts the ACL - as - columns model , this time explicitly identifying the access control lists .
The circles on the left are subjects , and the boxes on the far right are resources .
Each access control list is shown as a tall oval next to its corresponding resource .
When access control lists are stored with the resources , they must contain references to subjects , which are shown as the leftward - pointing arrows .
This figure will be modified so that the resources are just filenames , and the C - lists contain little boxes ; each box will be labelled with an access mode and contain a dot anchoring an arrow pointing rightward at a resource .
Now let us compare this to Figure 4 , a depiction of the capabilities - as - rows model in the same style .
Here , each subject on the left carries a C - list containing capabilities .
Each capability has a reference to a resource , which we depict as a rightward - pointing arrow .
By shifting to this new visualization , where the references are explicitly visible , we see a difference between the models that was previously obscured : the direction of the arrows .
To see why this matters , let us consider how subjects and resources refer to each other .
Designation and Authority
First , let 's look at the arrows from the subject side .
The ACL model presumes some namespace , such as the space of filenames , that subjects use to designate resources .
This namespace must necessarily be separate from the representation of authority , since the arrows representing authorities point in the opposite direction .
Looking only at the matrix without considering the direction of the arrows assumes away the designation problem , which is arguably one of the deepest problems in computer security .
In order to use a resource designator , subjects must not only come to know the designator in some fashion ; they must also understand their relationship to the designated resource in order to determine what actions they should perform on the resource .
In a capability system , since each capability points from a subject to a resource , it is possible for the capability to serve both to designate which resource to access , and to provide the authority to perform that access .
This change provides us with the option to avoid introducing a shared namespace into the foundations of the model , and thereby avoid the issues involved in managing a shared namespace – issues rarely acknowledged as a cost of non-capability models .
We will refer to this distinction as Property A : No Designation Without Authority .
As we have explained , no ACL system can possibly have this property ; a system described by the row - based view of the access matrix may or may not have this property .
This property will be relevant to the issue of confused deputy problems [ 10 ] , which are discussed later in this paper .
Granularity of Subjects
2 This is especially problematic if the design of the ACL system presumes that ACLs will typically be edited by humans .
Now , we 'll consider the arrows from the resource side .
Another consequence of the direction of the arrows in the ACL model is that the ACLs also need a namespace in which to refer to subjects .
In order for the ACL model to be coherent , the entities that update ACLs must maintain up - to - date knowledge of the set of subjects and their designations .
Maintaining such consistency would be difficult if subjects are frequently appearing and disappearing .
The frequency with which the set of subjects changes depends on the level of granularity at which subjects are distinguished .
3 In fact , Lampson 's presentation [ 15 ] explicitly suggested that domains ( what we mean by subjects here ) could be processes , whereupon access control lists would contain access keys to identify the domains .
However , access control lists as generally implemented contain subject names rather than access keys , which makes it hard for them to identify a dynamic , unbounded set of subjects .
Lampson touches on the difficulty of fine - grained subjects in ACL systems when he writes " the procedure gets the domain 's name as argument , and this can not be forged .
However , unique names may not be very convenient for the procedure to remember – access is more likely to be associated with a person or group of people , or perhaps with a program . "
4 Sometimes user accounts are created so that authorities can be specified separately for particular programs , but that is not the same as specifying authorities separately for each individual running instance of a program .
5 Usually , only an administrator can create new principals .
Although Lampson 's definition of the access matrix does not prohibit the possibility of fine - grained subjectseven in an ACL system , the difficulty just explained strongly motivates ACL systems to define subjects at a coarse granularity so as to keep the set of subjects relatively static .
Thus , ACL systems in practice map processes to principals ( broad equivalence classes of processes ) such as user accounts , where the set of principals does not change in the course of normal operation .
These principals then serve as the subjects of the access matrix .
Subjects in an ACL system do not in generalhave the ability to create an unbounded number of new subjects .
The appeal of the ACL model rests on the ability of administrators to enumerate subjects whose identities they can know and reason about , such as humans .
In capability systems , a subject corresponds to an instance of a software component , such as an object ( an instance of a class , as in a capability language ) or a process ( an instance of an executable program , as in a capability operating system ) .
Instances are distinguished at a much finer granularity than user accounts – indeed , at finer granularity than users are normally even aware of .
Because authorities are aggregated by subject , it is no problem for subjects to be defined at a fine granularity such that subjects can create new subjects all the time .
We will refer to this distinction as Property B : Dynamic Subject Creation .
Strictly speaking , neither view of the access matrix imposes or prohibits this property , but we know of no ACL implementation that allows individual processes to be separate subjects , whereas all capability - based systems distinguish subjects at the instance level .
This property will bear on our later discussion of the principle of least privilege [ 20 ] .
Power to Edit Authorities
Policies for updating authorities vary from system to system , but all ACL systems known to us define an owner or edit permissions attribute , which is set on a resource to give a subject the power to edit that resource 's ACL .
The consequence of this attribute is that the power to edit authorities is aggregated by resource : the ability to change a permission on a resource generally comes together with the ability to edit the entire ACL .
In capability systems , the power to edit authorities is aggregated by subject : subjects manipulate authorities in their own C - lists .
We will refer to this distinction as Property C : Subject - Aggregated Authority Management .
As with property B , the access matrix model does not force the presence or absence of this property , but in all cases of which we are aware , capability systems have this property and ACL systems do not .
Intermission
All of these differences between the capabilities - as - rows model and the ACLs - as - columns model should put to rest the Equivalence Myth .
Object - capability systems are different from ACL systems in yet more ways , which will surface as we address the other myths .
The Confinement Myth
We come now to the Confinement Myth , which is sometimes stated as " capability systems cannot limit the propagation of authority " or " capability systems cannot solve the confinement problem " .
For example :
A major problem for capability systems is a fundamental inability to solve the confinement problem , .... — Karger [ 13 , p. 67 ]
This view continues to be held even as recently as 2001 :
Delegation in a trust management style of access control provides for bounds on propagation of access rights , a property which does n't hold true for capabilities .
...
Trust management , modelled here without keys or name spaces , can strongly ( one - to - one ) simulate the other mechanisms , providing a tractable compromise between unrestricted capability passing from the capability model and easy revocation provided by access control lists .
— Chander , Dean , Mitchell [ 3 ]
Achieving Confinement
In order to explain the problems with this claim , we need to describe how authority is transferred in most actual capability systems in practice , where capabilities are object references [ 6 ] .
We refer to this as Model 4 . Object Capabilities ( Model 3 is described below ) .
The transfer of authority in these systems is depicted in Figure 5 .
In this diagram , Alice , a subject possessing a capability to Carol , is delegating this capability to another subject , Bob .
The open arrow on the left represents an invocation or message .
The message is riding on a capability from Alice to Bob , since messages may only travel along capabilities in an object - capability system .
In order for Alice to authorize Bob to access Carol , Alice must herself be authorized to access both Bob and Carol .
The requirement for both capabilities makes confinement possible , since no capability transfer can introduce a new connection between two objects that were not already connected by some path .
Confinement of authorities within a set of objects can be determined simply by observing that the subgraph containing the set of objects is not connected to the rest of the object graph .
Suppose , for example , we decide not to trust Bob .
To prevent Alice from delegating to Bob , we simply refrain from giving Alice access to Bob .
No subgraph of co-operating objects can delegate to Bob if Bob is not reachable from that subgraph to begin with .
This is the simple insight behind many capability - based confinement systems [ 9 , 21 , 25 , 26 ] .
Karger noted in 1988 that KeyKOS did , in fact , achieve confinement :
KeyKOS achieves confinement by a mechanism called factories .
Essentially , a factory is a mechanism for creating new instances of protected subsystems .
— Karger [ 13 , p. 75 ]
The discussion of KeyKOS goes on to compare its performance to that of another capability system , noting that occasionally KeyKOS requires two calls and returns instead of one .
Regardless of the benchmarks , however , the fact remains that confinement is indeed achievable in a capability system .
It is unfortunate that the Confinement Myth continues to scare people away from capabilities so long after KeyKOS succeeded in confining programs .
The myth was further amplified by an influential and widely cited paper on extensible security architectures for Java :
However , an important issue is confinement of privileges [ 26 ] .
It should not generally be possible for one program to delegate a privilege to another program ( that right should also be mediated by the system ) .
This is the fundamental flaw in an unmodified capability system ; two programs which can communicate object references can share their capabilities without system mediation .
This means that any code which is granted a capability must be trusted to care for it properly .
In a mobile code system , the number of such trusted programs is unbounded .
Thus , it may be impossible to ever trust a simple capability system .
— Wallach , Balfanz , Dean , Felten [ 24 ]
Note that the above makes a slightly different error with respect to the confinement issue .
Rather than stating that capability passing is unrestricted , it correctly acknowledges that the ability to communicate object references is necessary for two programs to share their capabilities .
However , it appears to overlook the possibility that such an ability to communicate might be unavailable or restricted .
We will examine some possible reasons for the persistence of the delegation myth in more detail below , but let 's take care of the third myth before diving into that discussion .
The Irrevocability Myth
Our third myth is the belief that capabilities cannot revoke access .
This is also quite widely held , for example :
Capability systems modelled as unforgeable references present the other extreme , where delegation is trivial , and revocation is infeasible .
— Chander , Dean , Mitchell [ 3 ]
This belief stems from the fact that , once a subject holds a capability , no one but the subject can remove that capability , not even the creator of the corresponding resource .
It is true that capabilities themselves are not literally revocable .
Further , we know that the capability alone is sufficient to establish access to the resource .
This might lead one to reasonably believe that there is no opportunity to revoke the access .
Revocable Access in Object - Capability Systems
In an object - capability system , however , capabilities can be composed in such a way as to provide revocable access .
Suppose once again that Alice wants to give Bob access to Carol , but Alice also wants to have the option to revoke this access at some time in the future .
To accomplish this , Alice could simply create a pair of forwarders , F and R , connected as shown .
Of this pair , we may call F the forwarding facet , and R the revoking facet .
Alice would send Bob access to F , and retain R for herself .
Any messages sent to F get forwarded through R to Carol , so Bob may use F as if it were Carol .
This works as long as inter - object interactions are mediated by messages , and messages are handled generically , so that a reusable mechanism can forward any message .
When Alice wants to revoke Bob 's access to Carol , she invokes R , telling it to stop forwarding .
R then drops its pointer to Carol , and F becomes useless to Bob .
Notice that no capabilities were themselves revoked , which is the truth supporting the myth .
Bob still has access to F .
However , access to F is now useless .
We have n't revoked Bob 's capability itself , but we have revoked the effective access to Carol represented by that capability .
This revocation mechanism also works for delegated authorities .
Suppose Bob delegates to Ted his access to Carol .
Since Bob only ever has access to F , not to Carol herself , that is all Bob can give to Ted ( and Bob can only do so if Bob also has access to Ted ) .
When Alice invokes R in order to disable F , this prevents further access to Carol by Ted , or by anyone to whom Bob sent his capability , just as much as it prevents access by Bob .
This scheme is not a recent invention .
Redell described exactly this method for revoking access in 1974 [ 18 ] , and it was later implemented in the CAP - III system [ 12 ] .
Karger addresses the concern that " indirection through a large number of revoker capabilities could adversely affect system performance " by suggesting that " a properly designed translation buffer , however , could cache the result of the capability indirections and make most references go quickly " [ 13 , p. 111 ] . KeyKOS [ 9 ] and EROS [ 21 ] both employ this optimization technique .
Origins of the Myths
Now that we have refuted the remaining two myths , at this point it is worth examining how the myths came about , in order to understand the thinking that led to them .
Let 's start by analyzing the origins of the Confinement Myth .
An Argument Against Confinement
Our story begins in 1984 , when Boebert presented a claim [ 2 ] that no unmodified capability machine can enforce the *- Property .
His paper defined an unmodified capability machine as one in which " capabilities are the sole mechanism for controlling access by programs to storage objects " , and defined a capability as a distinguished object containing two parts : a reference to a storage object and an access mode such as read or write .
His argument has been cited as evidence that capability systems cannot solve the confinement problem , for example :
Boebert made clear in [ 1 ] that an unmodified or classic capability system can not enforce the *- property or solve the confinement problem .
The main pitfall of a classic capability system is that " the right to exercise access carries with it the right to grant access " .
— Gong [ 7 ]
( Gong 's citation [ 1 ] is Boebert 's 1984 paper , which corresponds to our citation [ 2 ] ) .
Because Boebert 's argument [ 2 ] had such tremendous influence on later research , we will pay special attention to it here .
The argument concerns the problem of enforcing two rules called the Simple Security Property and the *- Property .
The rules suppose a world in which subjects have clearance levels ( representing the trustworthiness of a subject ) and resources have classification levels ( representing the sensitivity of the information they contain ) .
The Simple Security Property requires that subjects have read access only to resources classified at or below their clearance level .
The *- Property requires that subjects have write access only to resources classified at or above their clearance level .
Together , these two rules confine information at higher classification levels and prevent it from escaping to lower levels .
Boebert 's example consists of a capability system with two levels , where there is a subject ( Alice ) and a memory segment ( Low ) at the lower level , and a subject ( Bob ) and a memory segment ( High ) at the upper level .
The two confinement rules are implemented by an oracle that grants capabilities of the appropriate modes to anyone requesting access , based on its special knowledge of the clearance of the subject and the classification of the object .
The oracle grants read capabilities whenever the object 's classification is at the same level or lower than the subject 's clearance .
The oracle grants write capabilities whenever the object 's classification is at the same level or higher than the subject 's clearance .
To make the argument easier to illustrate , we will depict subjects as carrying all the capabilities that such an oracle would have granted them .
Figure 7 shows the starting condition corresponding to the oracle Boebert described .
In the attack that Boebert describes , Alice takes her Write - Low capability and writes it into the Low segment , as in Figure 8 .
Then , Bob can read this capability out of the Low segment , as in Figure 9 .
At this point , Bob can violate the *- Property by reading sensitive information out of the High segment and using his newly - acquired write capability to leak the information into the Low segment .
Boebert concludes correctly that this particular use of capabilities does not enforce the *- Property .
However , the argument assumes that subjects can transmit capabilities anywhere they can transmit data , which is not the case in most capability systems .
In partitioned or type - enforced capability systems such as KeyKOS [ 9 ] , W7 [ 19 ] , EROS [ 21 ] , or E [ 4 ] , capabilities and data are distinguished by the kernel or runtime .
Reading and writing capabilities are necessarily distinguishable operations from reading and writing data .
Nearly all capability systems make this distinction .
Suppose now that each of the two classification levels has separate read capabilities for capabilities and data , and separate write capabilities for capabilities and data .
The oracle now hands out capabilities of both kinds , much as before , with the exception that it does not hand out any capabilities that permit reading or writing capabilities between different levels .
If we show each subject holding all the capabilities that the oracle could possibly grant it , we now have Figure 10 .
Figure of five arrows and four hamburgers .
Since no capability - carrying capabilities cross between levels , no capabilities can cross between levels .
The only capability Bob holds to a lower level is a read capability , so the *- Property is enforced .
The only capability Alice holds to a higher level is a write capability , so the Simple Security Property is enforced .
The result is an unmodified capability system ( satisfying Boebert 's own definition ) that is perfectly capable of enforcing both the Simple Security Property and the *- Property .
The claim that capability systems in general cannot enforce the *- Property appears to be based on the misunderstanding that capabilities and data are not distinguishable .
A very similar misunderstanding is the belief that capabilities are equivalent to bit strings :
Since a capability is just a bit string , it can propagate in many ways without the detection of the kernel or the server ....
Generally a capability is a bit string and can propagate in many ways without detection ... — Gong [ 7 ]
The equivalence of capabilities and bit strings is a feature only present in a specialized category of capability systems known as password capability systems , such as Amoeba [ 17 ] .
Boebert 's result is valid in any capability system that cannot distinguish between data transfer and capability transfer .
But partitioned and type - enforced capability systems do not have this problem , and password capability systems have been engineered to avoid this problem [ 1 , 11 ] .
Moreover , it has been formally verified that any capability system enforcing independent controls on data transfer and capability transfer can enforce both confinement and the *- Property [ 22 ] .
The Capabilities - as - Keys Model
Sometimes capabilities are explained using the analogy that capabilities are like copyable , unforgeable keys ( or copyable , unforgeable tickets ) in the real world .
This as our Model 3 . Capabilities as Keys .
It turns out that the Confinement Myth and the Irrevocability Myth are both true statements within such a model , so we believe this model is a likely contributor to the propagation of these myths .
Let 's take apart the key analogy carefully to see how it compares with the object - capability model .
As the story goes , each resource is protected by a lock , perhaps a locked door .
People carry keys on their key rings , and if they want to delegate authority , they can make copies of their keys to give to other people .
It is usually assumed that they can give copies of their keys to anyone they like .
To exercise an authority , a person must make two choices : a choice of key , and a choice of lock .
The attempt to access succeeds or fails depending on whether these choices put together a compatible key and lock .
As with object - capability systems , the keys are assumed to be unforgeable .
The only way someone can get a key to a resource is either by being its creator , or if someone else who already has the key decides to give them a copy of the key .
Subjects are also assumed to be encapsulated : if someone does n't voluntarily decide to hand out a copy of a key , no one can steal it .
Note that it is possible to hold a key without knowing the door to which it belongs , and it is also possible to designate a door without holding the key that opens it .
The analogy does not usually specify whether one chooses a particular key to use before seeking the appropriate door , or whether , upon encountering a locked door , one then tries all the keys on the key ring to find a key that works .
This decision will be pertinent to the discussion of the confused deputy problem , below .
We will now compare this model to the other two capability - like models we have discussed .
Keys versus Rows : Ambient Authority
Observe that there is a crucial difference between the capabilities - as - keys model and the capabilities - as - rows model .
In the key model , exercising an authority requires the selection of a key , but the capabilities - as - rows model has no such requirement .
We will use the term ambient authority to describe authority that is exercised but not selected by its user .
In an ambient authority system , subjects are not required to indicate a specific authority in order to exercise it .
The corresponding analogy is to imagine a world with doors but without keys .
When a person walks up to a door , the door magically opens if it deems the person worthy .
For example , Unix filesystem permissions constitute an ambient authority mechanism , because the caller of a function such as open ( ) does not choose any credentials to present with the request ; the request merely succeeds or fails .
We will refer to the requirement that subjects select the authorities they exercise as Property D : No Ambient Authority .
This distinction will also be relevant in our later discussion of the confused deputy problem .
Keys versus Objects
/etc/motd
/etc/motd
Although the capabilities - as - keys analogy is an appealing way to tell stories about capabilities , it is not an accurate representation of the object - capability model .
In Figure 11 , which represents the capabilities - as - keys model , the ability to readis behind a locked door .
To read it , Alice must request access tofor reading and present the key that unlocks the door .
The diagram shows that Alice possesses such a key , represented by the thin black arrow pointing from Alice to the resource .
The wide arrow on the left represents a message from Alice to Bob , in which Alice sends Bob a copy of her key .
Once Bob receives it , he will be able to read / etc / motd as well .
By giving Bob a copy of her key , Alice authorizes Bob to read / etc / motd .
The wide arrow containing the black arrow tail represents this act of authorization .
In this model , subjects authorize subjects ( the wide arrow on the left ) , whereas subjects access resources ( the shaded arrow carrying the operation name read ) , and these are two distinct kinds of action .
As long as subjects and resources are partitioned into two separate type categories , authorization and access cannot be unified because the types of these two operators do not match .
Now compare Figure 11 to Figure 12 , which illustrates delegation in the object - capability model .
Two things are different .
First , the resource box has been replaced by a circle labelled Carol .
This depicts the fact that there is no artifical separation between subjects and resources .
Every subject is a resource , and every resource is conceptually a subject ( though some resources , such as the number 3 , are primitively provided ) .
A consequence of this is that access and authorization can be unified .
This uniformity makes the object - capability model compositional ; these networks can be composed to any depth .
We will refer to this as Property E : Composability of Authorities .
Second , the message from Alice to Bob is now riding on a capability from Alice to Bob .
In the capabilities - as - keys model this access is not necessary ( Alice can give her keys to anyone ) , but in the object - capability model such access is a prerequisite for delegation .
We will refer to this as Property F : Delegation on Access - Controlled Channels .
Observe that without Property E , we cannot construct revocable forwarders to solve the revocation problem .
And it is precisely the restriction of Property F that enables confinement .
So , it is easy to see how staying within the capabilities - as - keys model could lead one to believe both the Irrevocability Myth and the Confinement Myth .
Summary of the Four Models
We have now described four different security models , and identified several properties that distinguish them .
These are summarized in Figure 13 .
Model 1 represents ACLs in practice and approximately as commonly understood .
Model 4 represents all the major capability systems in practice , in which capabilities are object references .
Models 2 and 3 represent two different ways in which capabilities are sometimes explained : according to a naive static view of Lampson 's access matrix ( " capabilities as rows " ) , and according to the metaphor that capabilities are like unforgeable physical keys in the real world ( " capabilities as keys " ) .
Chander et al. have presented and compared three of these models [ 3 ] , which they identified as M_acl , M_C_row , and M_C_ref .
They call M_acl " access control lists " , which corresponds to our Model 1 , and call M_C_row either " Lampson matrix capabilities " or " capabilities as rows " , which corresponds to our Model 2 .
They describe M_C_ref alternately as " capabilities as unforgeable bit strings " , " capabilities as tickets " , or " capabilities as references " , but M_C_ref actually corresponds to our Model 3 , since their definition of the Pass operation allows subjects to pass their capabilities without restriction ( that is to say , M_C_ref lacks Property F ) .
Model 4 ( capabilities as object references ) , which describes most of the capability systems in practice , is missing from their analysis .
Systems in Practice
For comparison , let 's look at some examples of security mechanisms in practice to see how they measure up against these properties .
Unix and NT Filesystems
Representative real - world systems that fit the ACLs - as - columns model include the standard Unix filesystem , Unix with a setfacl ( ) extension , and the NT ACL system .
All three of these mechanisms lack all six of Properties A through F .
POSIX Capabilities
The " POSIX capabilities " mechanism described in POSIX 1003.1e might seem to be a representative system for capabilities - as - rows , since authorities are indeed aggregated at the subject .
Indeed , with respect to all of the six properties we have defined so far , the " POSIX capabilities " mechanism fits the capabilities - as - rows model .
However , there is one very important difference : the set of resources ( POSIX capability flags ) is finite and fixed .
At the level of detail that we typically care about ( individual files , programs , and so on ) resources are created and destroyed all the time .
There is a bounded set of POSIX capability flags only because they do not express authorities at this level of detail .
For example , one of the POSIX capability flags is CAP_CHOWN , which represents the power to change the ownership of any file on the entire system .
Just as with the granularity of subjects , we can consider this a granularity issue with respect to resources , where the ability to dynamically create new resources is the clear dividing line betwen " fine - grained " and " coarse - grained " .
We will refer to this additional distinction as Property G : Dynamic Resource Creation .
All of the other models and examples mentioned here have this property , but the " POSIX capabilities " mechanism does not .
POSIX capability flags can be transmitted to a new process when it is created , but the ability to start new processes depends on access to executable files .
Such access depends on file permissions rather than POSIX capabilities , and is also affected by the view of the filesystem ( which the use of chroot ( ) may have altered ) .
Thus , with respect to Property F : Delegation on Access - Controlled Channels , delegation can be somewhat limited , but the complexity of Unix filesystem access makes the question of confinement unclear .
SPKI
SPKI [ 5 ] is a reasonable real - world representative for the capabilities - as - keys model .
In SPKI , an authority is a signed certificate carried by a subject .
The certificate specifies the resource and the kind of access , and the existence of a valid signature on the certificate conveys the authorization .
Authorities ( certificates ) are always bound to resource designators ( names ) in SPKI , because resource designators are embedded in the signed certificates .
If the certificate is altered to break this binding , the signature becomes invalid .
However , designators are not always bound to authorities .
The designators are S - expressions that describe a path to the resource , and do not in themselves convey any authority .
Just as with the key analogy , authority in SPKI is not ambient : a subject must choose and present a certificate as part of an attempt to access any resource .
Also as with the key analogy , there is no restriction on propagation of SPKI certificates ; the holder of a certificate may give a copy of that certificate to any other party .
There is nothing to prevent one from constructing entities that can both accept and hold SPKI certificates , so strictly speaking authorities are composable .
However , we have not heard of this being done in practice ; it is not clear whether such a use of SPKI could be made practical .
Unix File Descriptors
File descriptors in Unix are an example of a mechanism nearly but not quite equivalent to object capabilities .
Since they are sometimes cited as an example of a capability mechanism , it is useful to compare them to the models we have discussed .
Although files themselves cannot wield other file descriptors , a file descriptor could designate a pipe to another process that wields file descriptors .
So file descriptors are composable as long as they are limited to the functionality of a pipe ( e.g. pipes do not support random access ) .
File descriptors differ from object capabilities in that the channel for transmitting file descriptors among processes ( a Unix socket ) is controlled by an ACL , not by a capability - like mechanism .
Thus , while the file descriptor mechanism is similar to object capabilities in some ways , confining the propagation of file descriptors depends on the details of the ACL system .
Pure Capability Systems
A large number of capability systems in the history of security research , including Dennis and Van Horn 's Supervisor , CAL - TSS , CAP , and Hydra ( all described in Levy 's survey of capability systems [ 16 ] ) , KeyKOS [ 9 ] , W7 [ 19 ] , Mungi [ 11 ] , EROS [ 21 ] , and E [ 4 ] , as well as the password capability system by Anderson , Pose , and Wallace [ 1 ] , have all seven of the security properties we have mentioned , and thus fit Model 4 .
Advantages of Object - Capability Systems
Least - Privilege Operation
An essential design requirement for secure systems is the principle of least privilege [ 20 ] : every entity should operate using the least set of privileges necessary to complete its task .
In terms of authority relationships between subjects and resources , we can look at this principle from two perspectives .
Operating in least - privilege fashion demands that we provide access to minimal resources , and that we grant such access to minimal subjects .
In the course of comparing security models and systems so far , we have already encountered both granularity issues .
Property B : Dynamic Subject Creation is necessary for limiting authority when starting new running instances of software components .
In order for subjects to be able to create instances with limited authority , each instance must have its own separate set of authorities , and must therefore be a distinct subject .
For example , Property B allows a user to invoke a program while granting it only the subset of the user 's authority that it needs to carry out its proper duties .
Property G : Dynamic Resource Creation is necessary in order for the model to be able to express access restrictions on objects ( such as individual files ) that can be created and destroyed .
No security model limited to controlling a static set of resources can possibly have sufficient expressive detail to support least - privilege operation on a dynamic system .
So both Property B and Property G are necessary ( though not sufficient ) for least - privilege operation .
The three capability - like models offer both of these properties , whereas the ACL model does not .
The POSIX capabilities mechanism bears a weak resemblance to capability models but lacks Property G , so it cannot ( on its own ) support least - privilege operation .
Avoiding Confused Deputy Problems
A deputy is a program whose duty is to wield an authority on behalf of its source .
A confused deputy [ 10 ] is a deputy that has been manipulated into wielding its authority inappropriately .
A frequent challenge in computer security is to construct deputies that cannot be confused .
Confused deputy problems are a common class of security incidents in many systems , including the World - Wide Web [ 23 ] .
6 Actually , the story we tell here is a simplified version of the original .
In the original story , the compiler is given write access to a directory containing the billing file for the purpose of writing a different file .
With respect to the confused deputy problem , the point is the same .
BILL
BILL
The classic story of the confused deputy [ 10 ] concerns a compiler in an ambient authority system .
The compiler is granted write access to a file calledin order to store billing information .
Upon invoking the compiler , the user can specify the name of a file to receive debugging output .
If the user specifiesas the name of the debugging file , the compiler is fooled into overwriting the billing information with debugging information .
The problem is not caused by the compiler using access that it should not have .
The problem is that it exercises its authority to write to BILL for the wrong purpose .
While no security model can prevent people from writing bad programs , there are some properties of the security model that can have a profound effect on our likelihood of writing reliable programs .
Let us consider the confused deputy problem with respect to two properties we have identified : Property D : No Ambient Authority and Property A : No Designation Without Authority .
Ambient Authority
The question of ambient authority determines whether subjects can identify the authorities they are using .
If subjects cannot identify the authorities they are using , then they cannot associate with each authority the purpose for which it is to be used .
This makes it difficult for a subject to safely use an authority on another party 's behalf .
Suppose that we return to the compiler story with this property in mind .
If the authority to write to BILL were not ambient , then the compiler could hold one key to BILL for the purpose of writing billing information , and accept another key from the user for the purpose of writing debugging information .
Then , as long as the compiler uses each key for its intended purpose , the confused deputy problem cannot occur .
The lack of distinguishable keys would make it impossible for the compiler to draw this distinction .
Eliminating ambient authority helps make it possible to avoid confused deputies , but does n't guarantee that deputies will never be confused .
We mentioned earlier that it matters whether one chooses a key to use before attempting to open a door , or whether one goes to a door and then tries all available keys to find one that works .
Even if one can distinguish the keys , deciding to try all available keys puts one at risk of becoming a confused deputy .
In order to avoid the confused deputy problem , a subject must be careful to maintain the association between each authority and its intended purpose .
Using the key analogy , one could imagine immediately attaching a label to each key upon receiving it , where the label describes the purpose for which the key is to be used .
In order to know the purpose for a key , the subject must understand the context in which the key is received ; for example , labelling is not possible if keys magically appear on the key ring without the subject 's knowledge .
Separable Designators
We mentioned earlier that designating resources is a tricky problem when designators are separated from authorities .
When designators and authorities take separate paths through a system , their recombination is likely to lead to confused deputies .
Looking again at the scenario of the compiler as confused deputy , we see that an authorization given by one party is used to access a resource designated by a different party , bringing about an unintended transfer of authority .
In ACL systems , because designation and authorization are necessarily separated , this confusion is very difficult to escape .
In a system where designation and authority are inseparable , this common type of confused deputy problem – in which a malicious party designates a resource they are not supposed to access – simply cannot occur .
In addition , if resource designations can never be separated from authorities , any request asking the deputy to access a resource necessarily includes the corresponding authorities , and places those authorities in the context of the request .
This helps to provide the aforementioned context that a deputy needs in order to determine the proper purpose for each received authority .
Any request for access to a resource must designate the resource in some way .
If designators are inseparable from authorities , any request for access must necessarily include the authority , which means that any subject requesting access always chooses the authority to exercise .
So the presence of Property A implies the presence of Property D .
Summary
The arguments in this section are captured in Figure 14 .
designation inseparable from authority ==implies== > deputies cannot be fooled by authority - less resource designators
designation inseparable from authority ==implies== > there are no ambient authorities
no ambient authorities ==implies== > subjects can distinguish authorities
subjects can distinguish authorities = =implies== > subjects have local identifiers for authorities
designation inseparable from authority = =encourages== > authorities arrive in the context of requests
subjects have local identifiers for authorities ==contributes=to== > possible to write an unconfusable deputy
authorities arrive in the context of requests ==contributes=to== > possible to write an unconfusable deputy
As they possess both Property A and Property D , object - capability systems enforce the combination of designation with authority , enable the assignment of local identifiers to authorities , and encourage the presence of context when authorities are conveyed .
All three of these things contribute to establishing a chain of designation , running from the original creator of a resource , through the entity that exercises the resource , and finally to the resource itself .
Maintaining this unbroken chain of designation greatly improves our ability to reason about the behaviour of trusted programs .
SPKI is an interesting case to analyze in these terms .
Each certificate comes with an embedded nonlocal resource designator in cleartext , so designators can be separated from authorities .
However , it can still be feasible to construct unconfusable deputies so long as ( a ) certificates arrive in the context of a request ( particularly , an undamaged request ) and ( b ) subjects maintain local identifiers for the certificates they hold .
SPKI does not specifically provide for a certificate or tuple of certificates to be securely bound together with a message so that the receiver can determine the intended purpose for the conveyed authorities .
Such a feature would be necessary to enable ( a ) .
Summary of Systems and Properties
The table in Figure 15 summarizes all of the models and systems we have mentioned , evaluating them in terms of the seven security properties , the two model - specific myths , and the issues of confused deputies and least - privilege operation .
The columns are arranged roughly along a spectrum from ACLs to capabilities .
A Note on " Capability "
Given that there are varying interpretations of the capability model , the reader may wonder what one should adopt as the most legitimate meaning for the term capability .
It is also worth explaining why we feel justified in declaring the Irrevocability Myth and Confinement Myth to be false , rather than merely false in certain cases .
We would argue that the " true " capability model is the object - capability model , because all known major capability systems take the object - based approach ( for examples , see [ 1 , 4 , 9 , 11 , 16 , 17 , 19 , 21 ] ) .
In all of these systems , a capability is an object reference – not something that behaves like a key or ticket in the real world .
Definitive books on capability - based systems [ 6 , 16 ] also describe capability systems from the object - capability perspective , and explicitly describe them as " object - based " .
In fact , we know of no security mechanisms outside of the object - capability model that have described themselves using the word capability except for " POSIX capabilities " , " Netscape capabilities " , and " split capabilities " [ 14 ] .
POSIX capabilities have not been described as " capability - based security " .
The " Netscape capabilities " extensions to Java were fairly short - lived and have not been presented in the research literature as a capability system .
Moreover , both " POSIX capabilities " and " Netscape capabilities " have never been presented as security mechanisms that can stand on their own , instead only serving as an extension to existing security systems .
The split capabilities model is explicitly presented in contrast to the pure capability model [ 14 ] .
Conclusion
We have described a progression of four security models from traditional ACLs to pure capabilities , while defining a set of seven properties that can be used to distinguish the models .
We have also used the properties to evaluate and compare some real - world security systems that resemble the models .
The distinctions we have drawn support our refutations of three common misconceptions about capability - based systems – the Equivalence Myth , the Confinement Myth , and the Irrevocability Myth .
Although the myths have some truth in the intermediate security models that are often taken as interpretations of capabilities , they do not hold for the " pure capability " or " object - capability " model represented by the vast majority of capability systems .
Furthermore , the properties we identified show that the capability model has very significant advantages over the ACL model .
Avoiding confused deputy problems can be extremely difficult in an ACL system , but relatively straightforward in a capability system .
In addition , capability - based systems provide much stronger support for the principle of least privilege , which is fundamental to secure operation .

News Years Resolution
Most New Year ’s Resolutions fail .
After a few months a person is back at their old habits and routines .
One reason well intended resolutions fail is because we are already overloaded .
Our mind is full of things to think about , our daily schedule is full , and our energy spent on existing routines .
With our attention , time , and energy spent , we do n’t have enough resources to successfully implement anything new .
That is why by the end of the day we just want to sit on the couch and watch TV .
Sometimes it is all we have energy for .
At that point , we lack the energy necessary to get to the gym and push our body through a work out , a night class , or other things that we seriously intended over too much champagne .
Once your new routine is implemented it can bring you more time and energy in return .
However , it takes some personal power to implement the new mental , emotional , and physical habits before you get that energy back .
Some people think it just takes a serious commitment and / or discipline .
However , the energy we put into the commitment and the energy to keep our selves focused has to come from somewhere .
If you are going to make a life change permanent you will have to free up some personal power and energy for it .
Less is More
Before you implement something new you must first free up some resources for it to be successful .
Instead of making a New Year ’s resolution that just adds something to your schedule , make a resolution to detach from something .
Begin to simplify your life by deleting things from your daily or weekly regiment .
Once you ’ve freed up some energy , start putting in place small positive changes .
A way to make large changes successful is to break them up into smaller elements of change .
Why make small changes first ?
A huge plan for change can overwhelm us , and set us up for failure which leads to self - judgment .
To combat this pitfall , start with something small .
Besides , large scale change is really just a lot of small changes added together so it works out to be the same .
It might not seem as heroic , but better to get results than to try and feed an ego image of the hero and fail .
Implement one simple thing .
When you have integrated a small change into an easy habit that adds positive energy to your life , then make another small change .
Depending on the change you are making , 4 to 6 weeks is enough time to build a new habit .
Example of Less is More
Refrain from making your resolutions about adding something such as “ eat healthier . ”
This is an additional , “ to do ” item that takes energy , and adds stress to the mind .
Instead , make a resolution to eliminate something or do less .
I call them NON - DOINGS .
Instead consider the commitment , “ I ’m going to treat my body better by no longer drinking soft drinks . ”
This statement is not as general , and therefor not as vague .
Being specific in your resolutions makes it easier to notice how to achieve them and be successful .
Also have a commitment of what you will do instead .
“ I ’ll drink water , or herbal tea instead . ”
Now you have a new habit to commit to that can fill in that empty space of activity instead of an old habit dropping in .
If you are already drinking diet soft drinks with artificial sweeteners , delete them as well .
Studies have shown that diet drinks are equally as unhealthy as regular soda .
Adopt “ Non Doings ” as a way to change
Think of it as not spending money on unhealthy drinks .
Think of it as not picking up something at the grocery store .
One less thing to carry to your car , put in your refrigerator , keep cold , or throw in the recycling .
Your liver and organs have less toxic materials to purify from your body as well .
One simple Non Doing leads to less in other things .
By breaking just one habit , you created a little more time in your week , more money in your pocket , and more energy in your body .
As you learn the art of Non-Doing , or refrain , you find that you have more , energy , attention , and money .
Then it is time for the next step of change .
Compounding Change
With your added resources and personal power implement the next “ Not Doing . ”
After that habit is an easy and natural way to live , refrain from doing something else in your life that bleeds off your energy
With the personal power that you recover from these habits , it is much easier to break each additional habit .
As you recover additional power each time you break an old pattern your speed at making changes in your life grows .
As your confidence grows in making small changes , the doubtful and skeptical thoughts that can sabotage change have less power as well .
The important thing is to start with something small and build .
Do Less with your Time
Perhaps you want to work out at the gym a couple times a week .
Where are you going to get the time for the gym if you do n’t eliminate something else first ?
What are you spending time doing that you are going to do less of ?
If you do n’t free it up from somewhere , then you will try to do too much .
Eventually you will become overwhelmed and tired .
When you are tired your mind will begin to return to old habits and you ’ll skip the gym workouts .
Perhaps eliminate television or some internet surfing .
Look at where you spend your time and attention that is least worthwhile .
One mother was running ragged driving her son to soccer practice , guitar lessons , and then karate on the weekend .
It made her tired .
She longed for a simple evening with time to make dinner at home with her family .
She told her kids that they could only do one activity at a time and they had to choose .
To her surprise her children did n’t resent her for it .
They were happy with the lifestyle change as well , particularly when they had more time to hang out with friends .
Changing this behavior does n’t take much effort .
Actually , because you are doing less of it , it takes less effort .
You actually get some of your attention , energy , time back
If you add something to your schedule without eliminating something first , it will put stress on your mind , emotions , and possibly your pocketbook .
Your mind will feel overloaded and that will affect your emotional well being .
It seems like you are doing more , but you feel less about it .
Make Room to Change Your Thoughts
In order to break a habit or behavior , you will sometimes have to change the belief in your mind that drives that action , or behavior .
Part of why we waste time on things like television and internet games is that we have beliefs that support the behavior .
Those beliefs fight against the conscious and reasoned thoughts of it being a waste of time .
A belief is a mental construct that we accept as true , and then gets expressed as a behavior .
It usually remains unconscious to us until we raise our awareness and put our attention in it .
We can have thoughts and tell our self one thing , but we act and behave according to our beliefs .
An example of this is when we know that eating healthy is better but we eat unhealthy foods and drinks because we have beliefs about ease , or making changes later .
If you believe that exercise is “ hard work , there is “ no pain no gain ” relationship , or “ no fun ” it will be difficult to keep the habit going .
Those types of beliefs sabotage our motivation .
As long as you have a supporting belief about a habit or behavior , it will be difficult to break that habit or behavior .
You will often be able to push away the behavior for a while , but since the mental construct is still in your mind , the behavior will tend to creep back in .
To make a complete and permanent change in behavior , you will have to change the belief at the root of the behavior .
What does a belief look like ?
One place beliefs hide is in justifications .
A comment like , “ I just need to watch TV for a bit to wind down ” is a justification that hides a belief .
At the same time those words are so automatic that they are a habit as well .
The word “ need ” exaggerates the desire as if it were food , shelter , or water .
This is a distortion that we accept as true when we use such strong misplaced words .
From our dialog and thoughts it then appears that we have not choice .
We NEED television .
When you put your attention on these distortions in a skeptical manner you no longer believe your own justifications and they can begin to change .
How many ways can you wind down and let go of your stress of the day ?
Perhaps let go of watching TV and go for a walk .
If you only come up with one , then you have found a limiting belief .
If you come up with several , but only actually do one , you found a limiting belief .
Your actions are a big indicator of your beliefs .
Limiting beliefs take up space in your mind , drain your energy with wasteful habits and defensive justifications .
When you begin to do less television , internet surfing , or drinking pop , you will find these agreements poking at you .
They will attempt to pull and poke you back into old habits .
Your old beliefs will propose lots of justifications for going back to your old habits .
This is where awareness comes in handy .
If you have awareness when these thoughts tempt you , you can avoid being hypnotized by them .
Awareness is your best defense against sabotaging beliefs .
It gives you the power to perceive the distortions , exaggerations , and lies behind those words .
With that awareness it is easy to say no to temptation before you fall into an old behavior habit .
Why most Resolutions Fail over time
Most resolutions fail over time because people attempt to change the behavior , but do n’t address the unconscious beliefs that support those behaviors .
Our beliefs are often below our conscious radar of what our mind is doing .
We are not trained how to look at them or even that we should .
To change these beliefs you will have to LEARN how to look at your thoughts and see the beliefs that support them .
The audio program in Self Mastery will help you to do this .
Begin with Less
Begin your resolutions this year with detaching from something that is taking up your attention , time , and energy .
Your emotional reactions and emotional drama can be some of the things you detach from as well .
Once you have carved out some extra time and energy for your self , then consider what you want to do with it .
Before you add something healthy to your diet make room by deleting something unhealthy .
Before you create new beliefs that will add to your happiness , break some old beliefs that create unhappiness .
Breaking old beliefs will free up the power you need to make future commitments work out .
If you want to grow a garden you must first clear the ground of weeds .
If you do n’t , those weeds will take the nutrients and sunlight from whatever you plant .
Clearing the space makes it possible for your new creation to grow .
To make effective changes in your life begin by clearing away what does n’t work .
Then in the empty space that you create , build something beautiful , nurturing , and beneficial to your self and your relationships
May each new year of your life be happier than the last .
I wish you the happiest year of your life .
Democrats are dusting off their New Deal history books and openly discussing the idea of re-engineering Depression - era agencies for the 21st century .
Democrats ’ plan : New Deal 2.0 ?
With visions of a massive liberal majority in the next Congress and the power to remake economic policy for the next generation , Democrats are dusting off their New Deal history books and openly discussing the idea of re-engineering Depression - era agencies for the 21st century .
Several lawmakers want to bring back the Home Ownership Loan Corp. , and others have discussed resurrecting the defunct Reconstruction Finance Corp. , a federal program that made direct loans to businesses .
Others see a lame - duck stimulus bill less as a short - term cash infusion for the economy and more as a long - term , government - driven jobs creator — a kind of modern Works Progress Administration that invests in infrastructure , bridges and roads .
Advertisement
Come next year , the new administration and the new Congress may be able to build an entire new bureaucracy to govern the economy for decades .
Essentially , Democrats want to put some institutional permanence behind the sweeping executive actions taking place as the Bush administration moves to shore up banks and other financial institutions with Treasury ’s new powers .
“ This is the equivalent of what FDR had to do with the SEC — to regulate capitalism , ” said Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) , the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee .
“ A failure to regulate the economy appropriately is what led to this mess . …
We need to do what we can to prevent it from happening again . ”
Did he just say FDR ?
“ Democrats 10 years ago considered the New Deal to be a liability , ” said James K. Galbraith , University of Texas professor and leading expert among liberal economists .
Not so anymore .
“ It ’s not a rush to rebuild the New Deal out of enthusiasm , ” Galbraith explains . “
It ’s being pushed by events , and we ’re looking at models of the past for how to go forward . ”
Call it New Deal 2.0 : an effort to mold a 75 - year - old political philosophy for the 21st - century economy .
Or maybe just the End of the Reagan Revolution .
“ This exemplifies the sort of old school , big government thinking that Democrats have shown in response to this crisis , ” says Michael Steel , a spokesman for House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio ) .
“ It 's a Model T solution in a Prius era .
Rather than expanding the government and giving more money to bureaucrats , we need to empower the American people with policies like the House Republicans ' economic growth package . ”
Privately , Democrats are debating just how far they should go in discussing big ideas .
One Senate Democratic aide warns that Hill Democrats should be careful not to “ box Obama in ” with too many big , unrealistic promises if he is elected .
A House leadership aide says Democratic leaders are not taking a comprehensive look at New Deal agencies , but are studying what worked and what did n’t .
Nobody is discussing re-creating the Civilian Conservation Corps at this point .
And even as Democrats think about resurrecting some New Deal ideas , they ’re trying to figure out which Depression - era agencies need to be dismantled or reworked .
Some Democrats are now embracing a Treasury blueprint from earlier this year which suggests restructuring the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of Thrift Supervision .
One Democratic
House aide said there is active discussion of creating a 2008 version of the Pecora Commission , the 1932 panel that studied the crash of 1929 and recommended creation of the SEC and a whole new regime of banking regulations that exist to this day .
Frank , along with Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - Ill. ) , has asked the Congressional Budget Office to provide estimates on the cost of re-creating the Home Ownership Loan Corp. , a 1930s agency that bought and restructured mortgages .
Hillary Rodham Clinton was one of the early backers of relaunching the HOLC and continues to push the idea .
Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) , meanwhile , is studying a new program along the lines of the Reconstruction Finance Corp. , which gave loans to banks , farm mortgage companies , railroads and localities .
The RFC actually made money — nearly all of its loans were eventually paid back — and it disbanded in 1957 .
“ You ’ve got to learn from the mistakes of the past , but there ’s no harm in looking to the past , ” Schumer said of the renewed interest in some New Deal concepts .
“ You ’d have to be leaner [ in a new agency ] , and look for basic models that work .
In the future , a lot of the old agencies will go , and new agencies may be created . ”
But historians caution that Congress should be careful about trying to force old institutional models on to the complex modern financial infrastructure .
“ Looking to the past in terms of institutions is a mistake , ” said Sean Wilentz , a Princeton University history professor who has studied the New Deal .
“ Looking to the past in terms of spirit is great .
...
We are at the end of the age of Reagan , but it does n’t mean we should go back to FDR . ”
Many top Democratic strategists see this as a New Deal sort of moment for America .
Schumer , the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , elicited skepticism over the past year as he hyped a “ tectonic shift ” in the electorate , but now he ’s got a shot at being the architect of a 60 - seat Senate Democratic majority .
Emanuel , who engineered the Democratic takeover of the House in 2006 , has insisted for two years that we are in a two - step election wave that started with the 2006 congressional takeover and will be completed with an expansive Democratic majority , similar to the post - Watergate sweep of Democrats in 1976 .

Q : What are banks for ?
A : To make money .
Q : For the customers ?
A : For the banks .
Q : Why does n’t bank advertising mention this ?
A : It would not be in good taste .
But it is mentioned by implication in references to
reserves of $ 249,000,000,000 or thereabouts .
That is the money they have made .
Q : Out of the customers ?
A : I suppose so .
Q : They also mention Assets of $ 500,000,000,000 or thereabouts .
Have they made that
too ?
A : Not exactly .
That is the money they use to make money .
Q : I see .
And they keep it in a safe somewhere ?
A : Not at all .
They lend it to customers .
Q : Then they have n’t got it ?
A : No .
Q : Then how is it Assets ?
A : They maintain that it would be if they got it back .
Q : But they must have some money in a safe somewhere ?
A : Yes , usually $ 500,000,000,000 or thereabouts .
This is called Liabilities .
Q : But if they ’ve got it , how can they be liable for it ?
A : Because it is n’t theirs .
Q : Then why do they have it ?
A : It has been lent to them by customers .
Q : You mean customers lend banks money ?
A : In effect .
They put money into their accounts , so it is really lent to the banks .
Q : And what do the banks do with it ?
A : Lend it to other customers .
Q : But you said that money they lent to other people was Assets ?
A : Yes .
Q : Then Assets and Liabilities must be the same thing ?
A : You ca n’t really say that .
Q : But you ’ve just said it !
If I put $ 100 into my account the bank is liable to have to pay it
back , so it ’s Liabilities .
But they go and lend it to someone else , and he is liable to have to
pay it back , so it ’s Assets .
It ’s the same $ 100 is n’t it ?
A : Yes , but ….
Q : Then it cancels out .
It means , does n’t it , that banks have n’t really any money at all ?
A : Theoretically ……
Q : Never mind theoretically !
And if they have n’t any money , where do they get their
Reserves of $ 249,000,000,000 or thereabouts ??
A : I told you .
That is the money they have made .
Q : How ?
A : Well , when they lend your $ 100 to someone they charge him interest .
Q : How much ?
A : It depends on the Bank Rate .
Say five and a -half percent .
That ’s their profit .
Q : Why is n’t it my profit ?
Is n’t it my money ?
A : It ’s the theory of banking practice that ………
Q : When I lend them my $ 100 why do n’t I charge them interest ?
A : You do .
Q : You do n’t say .
How much ?
A : It depends on the Bank Rate .
Say a half percent .
Q : Grasping of me , rather ?
A : But that ’s only if you ’re not going to draw the money out again .
Q : But of course I ’m going to draw the money out again !
If I had n’t wanted to draw it out
again I could have buried it in the garden !
A : They would n’t like you to draw it out again .
Q : Why not ?
If I keep it there you say it ’s a Liability .
Would n’t they be glad if I reduced
their Liabilities by removing it ?
A : No .
Because if you remove it they can’t lend it to anyone else .
Q : But if I wanted to remove it they ’d have to let me ?
A : Certainly .
Q : But suppose they ’ve already lent it to another customer ?
A : Then they ’ll let you have some other customers money .
Q : But suppose he wants his too …. and they ’ve already let me have it ?
A : You ’re being purposely obtuse .
Q : I think I ’m being acute .
What if everyone wanted their money all at once ?
A : It ’s the theory of banking practice that they never would .
Q : So what banks bank on , is not having to meet their commitments ?
A : I would n’t say that .
Q : Naturally .
Well , if there ’s nothing else you think you can tell me ….?
A : Quite so .
Now you can go off and open a banking account !

Hat tip : BOB HOYE , INSTITUTIONAL ADVISORS
http://www.institutionaladvisors.com/
Dec. 17 , 2008  -- Bernard Madoff , accused of the largest fraud in U.S. history , will be allowed to remain in his $ 7 million Park Avenue apartment instead of being sent to jail , under terms of an agreement announced today by federal prosecutors .
Click here to see Madoff being pushed by a photographer upon returning to his residence .
Madoff was unable to meet the bond conditions set last week by a federal magistrate which required him to get four people to sign his personal recognizance bond .
According to the U.S. Attorney 's office , only Madoff 's wife and brothers were willing to sign the document .
But instead of ordering him held in jail , prosecutors agreed to home detention with electronic monitoring .
In related news , the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman said today the agency has found " no evidence of wrongdoing by any SEC personnel " in connection with Madoff 's alleged $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme and that the SEC intends to get to the bottom of where it may have gone wrong .
" I was very concerned to learn this week that credible allegations about Mr. Madoff had been made over nearly a decade and yet never referred to the commission for action , " Commissioner Christopher Cox said at a press conference .
Yesterday , Cox acknowledged what amounted to a generational failure on the part of the SEC to discover any hint of Madoff 's scheme , despite allegations dating back to 1999 .
In his statement , Cox said that he had turned the investigation into what might be an institutional lack of rigor over to the inspector general for the SEC .
" We have asked , in addition to investigating the allegations that had been made , over a period of many years , about Mr. Madoff and the way that they were handled , " Cox told reporters today .
" Also questions about the policies under which they were handled , whether or not all of the actions of SEC professionals were in compliance with those policies and , if so , what changes need to be made to the policies to make sure that we can get better results with such information in the future . "
Having received the case less than 24 hours ago , Security and Exchange Commission Inspector General David Kotz told ABC
News that his office has barely begun the process of selecting the staff , identifying the key areas to target , and determining the way in which the IG will proceed in attempting to unravel what other authorities have termed " nearly a generation of systemic and policy failure " at the SEC .
In terms of his new bond conditions , Madoff and his luxury apartment on Manhattan 's upper east side will be fitted with an electronic monitoring device by the court 's pre-trial services and Madoff will be under a curfew of between 7 p.m. through 9 a.m .
Madoff 's wife agreed to post the mansions in her name in Palm Beach , Florida and in Montauk on New York 's Long Island .
Madoff reportedly admitted to FBI agents last week that he had single - handedly pulled off a $ 50 billion scheme , defrauding a long list of investors .
Was Madoff Running a Ponzi Scheme ?
Madoff made headlines last week when an unsealed criminal complaint in federal court in New York charged that he has been running a decades long Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors of $ 50 billion dollars .
A former chairman of NASDAQ , Madoff was an investment advisor who catered to a handful of high net worth clients , one of whom told ABC News that Madoff was so sought after that , as recently as two months ago , he was turning down potential new business .
His handful of clients routinely expected -- and received -- double digit returns , up market or down .
Bernard Madoff Investment Securities and the SEC
According to a SEC document filed in Jan. 2008 , and cited in the complaint , the firm had between 11 and 25 clients for the fiscal year ending Oct. 2007 and managed about $ 17 billion in assets in 23 different accounts .
Bernard Madoff Investment Securities , in addition to that private client practice , is also a market maker that trades with other dealers in bonds , the S&P 500 and NASDAQ , according to Bloomberg News .
The firm was the 23rd largest market maker on NASDAQ in October , handling a daily average of about 50 million shares a day .
The firm specialized in handling orders from online brokers in some of the largest U.S. companies , including General Electric Co. and Citigroup Inc. , Bloomberg News reported .
But on Dec. 10 , Madoff allegedly told senior employees at his firm that his entire business was a fraud .
According to the federal complaint , Madoff told those employees that he was " finished " and that " it 's all one big lie . "
Madoff estimated " the losses from the fraud to be at least approximately $ 50 billion , " the complaint states .
At that time Madoff also told those employees that he intended to surrender to authorities , but before he did he planned to use $ 200 - 300 million he had left to make payments to " selected employees , family and friends , " the complaint states .
Madoff started his business in 1960 with $ 5000 in savings .
He resides in New York City and , according to clients , also maintains a posh waterfront home .
Known to his clients as Bernie , he has a long and significant history on Wall Street and has been a chairman of the board of the NASDAQ and was a founding member of the board of the International Securities Clearing Corp. in London .
The Web site for Madoff 's firm , in its company profile , says , " Clients know that Bernard Madoff has a personal interest in maintaining the unblemished record of value , fair - dealing , and high ethical standards that has always been the firm 's hallmark . "
Madoff was arrested last Thursday morning by FBI agents and charged with criminal securities fraud by federal prosecutors in Manhattan .
The complaint states that he used " manipulative and deceptive practices . "
The complaint cites two senior employees in describing how Madoff kept his client records " under lock and key " and how he left them in the dark about how he managed the private client funds .
One of those employees , in interviews with the FBI , said that Madoff was " cryptic " in his statements .
This , according to clients , is in keeping with the aura that Madoff cultivated among his clients , some of whom have kept funds under management with him for generations .
Madoff Struggled to Obtain Liquidity in December , Complaint Says
But by the first week of December , when clients began clamoring for redemptions -- to the tune of $ 7 billion -- the complaint states that Madoff began a struggle to obtain the necessary liquidity .
The stress began to show , the employees said .
In a meeting at their boss 's Manhattan apartment -- held there following a confrontation in the office Wednesday because Madoff was n't sure " he would be able to " hold it together " if the conversation took place in the office -- the employees came away believing that Madoff was " saying , in substance that he had for years been paying returns to certain investors out of the principal received from other , different investors . "
The next day , Dec. 11 , Madoff spoke with FBI agent Theodore Cacioppi and invited the agent and another agent to his apartment .
Cacioppo stated in the complaint that he told Madoff he came by to see if " there 's an innocent explanation . "
" There is no innocent explanation , " Madoff replied , according to the sworn complaint .
Madoff 's lawyer , Dan Horwitz , a partner at Dickstein Shapiro in New York , said his client is cooperating fully with the federal investigation .
" Bernie Madoff is a long - standing leader in the financial services industry and he is cooperating fully with the government investigation into this unfortunate set of events , " Horwitz said .

When acclaimed artist Dave Gibbons sat down to create epochal comic book series Watchmen with writer Alan Moore , neither had any idea what was to come .
" I do n't think we ever thought that we were going to produce the Citizen Kane of comics , " Gibbons confessed in a lengthy interview with Wired.com .
The painstaking process of creating Watchmen – a transformative title that remains as vital today as when first published in the mid-'80s – is recounted in Watching the Watchmen , Gibbons ' behind - the - scenes art book that offers a deep peek into the making of one of speculative fiction 's finest releases .
Contest : Win a Free Copy of Dave Gibbons ' Awesome Watching the Watchmen
Recently released to coincide with the mounting buzz surrounding Zack Snyder 's cinematic adaptation of Watchmen , which is due in 2009 , the big , beautiful book collects Gibbons ' exhaustive notes , sketches and other material into one of our choice stocking - stuffers of the holiday season .
Watching the Watchmen also carves out a well - deserved corner of comics fandom for Gibbons ' artistry , which has often been overshadowed by Alan Moore 's outspoken genius .
" People unacquainted with graphic novels , including journalists , tend to think of Watchmen as a book by Alan Moore that happens to have some illustrations , " says Gibbons .
" And that does a disservice to the entire form . "
Unlike Moore , whose distaste for Hollywood and cinematic versions of his work is legend , Gibbons has gotten behind Snyder 's movie with gusto .
He 's impressed by what he has seen already and hungers for more , but it 's no wonder :
His artwork is directly quoted at length by the film .
In fact , Snyder once showed me his sketchbook for Watchmen , which in some sections was a panel - for - panel lift from the original .
That kind of homage could keep Watchmen loyalists , especially the cynics , at bay when the film finally drops .
Whatever the fan reaction , Gibbons ' own legend is secure .
From his acclaimed work on Watchmen , 2000 AD and Doctor Who to DC Comics ' crown jewels like Batman , Superman , Green Lantern and more , he has proven to be one of comics ' greatest artists .
Wired.com landed some lucky minutes with Gibbons to talk about his new book and the upcoming film , and why sucking on a sugar - coated chili is better than sucking on a sweetie .
Wired.com : Did you have an idea that your Watchmen sketches , notes and other marginalia would someday merit their own book ?
Dave Gibbons : I did n't know that the sketches , notes and other stuff would merit its own book , but I did know it was worth holding on to .
I kept them for the years that I was actually working on the book , because I had to refer to them .
I was n't sure when I would ever have to draw that intersection again , or the interior of Hollis Mason 's apartment .
So it all ended up very nicely in the drawer and stayed there for 20 years .
It was only when the movie came up and I was talking to DC Comics about some other things that I mentioned that I had all this stuff , and it just occurred to me that it might make a very interesting book .
I 've always been a fan of behind - the - scenes work , and knew that it would make the kind of book that fans like .
I 've always had a bunch of behind - the - scenes books on my shelves , from Batman : The Animated Series to Alex Ross .
I always found them fascinating , and DC Comics thought it was a good idea as well .
When we actually inventoried what I had , it was clear we had enough to make an interesting book .
And it also offered me a chance to put down my memories of the various anecdotes and stories that I have told about Watchmen over the years .
And it was almost a requirement of mine that Chip Kidd design it .
I 've got a lot of books designed by him , and he 's got a wonderful way of making things very tactile .
You feel you are holding the actual sketch or scruffy old napkin in your hand .
I always feel that makes the book feel very rich .
[ Note : Keep an eye out for Wired. com 's upcoming interview with Kidd , who also worked on another of 2008 's best comics art books : Bat -Manga !
The Secret History of Batman in Japan . ]
Wired.com Did Watchmen feel momentous in its early stages ?
Gibbons : Not really .
It was momentous for Alan and I personally , because we had enjoyed working together in the past and always wanted to do something bigger .
And here was DC giving us 12 issues to do whatever we wanted .
They got us to come up with our own characters after deciding that they would n't give us their newly bought Charlton Comics characters , probably because they thought they could get more mileage out of them .
God knows , we got enough mileage out of the Watchmen characters .
But yeah , in a personal sense it felt momentous because we knew we had a big canvas on which we could get down so many things we found interesting about superheroes .
Wired.com :
When did it hit you that it was going to stand the test of time ?
Gibbons : I do n't think we ever thought that we were going to produce the Citizen Kane of comics .
It really did n't extend beyond the idea of collecting the 12 - issue run , which we could n't envisage at the time .
The fact that it is still in print 20 years later ?
No , we had no clue .
I suppose it hit me that it was going to stand the test of time after it started selling out of its reprints .
It 's been a cumulative thing .
I suppose the accumulation of sales , reprints and the fact that every new generation that comes into comics seems to rediscover Watchmen is the way that its fame has hit me .
Wired.com : You and Alan worked on the clever Future Shocks from 2000 AD , so were you two in a groove by the time Watchmen came about ?
Gibbons I really did enjoy working on Future Shocks with Alan , particularly " Chrono Cops , " which is a really involved tale of time travel , where people meet and hide from themselves and all sorts of shenanigans .
Which was not an easy thing to draw , but was tremendously rewarding , and why I think Alan said at that point that anything he asked me to draw , I probably could , and that gave him a feeling of great possibility .
Immediately before Watchmen , Alan and I also created the Superman annual " For the Man Who Has Everything , " which was a great joy .
Not only was it Superman , the crown jewel in the comics firmament , but it was also for the editor Julius Schwartz , who had reintroduced so many of the characters that we loved from the comics of our youth .
So yeah , we were really in a good groove .
There always seemed to be a lot of common ground between us .
Alan writes in a very visual way , and I draw in a story way .
We 've always enjoyed working together .
Wired.com : How does Watching the Watchmen illuminate your working relationship , and what is your relationship like now ?
Gibbons :
It certainly talks about the mechanics , the kind of organic collaboration where ideas and themes were batted backwards and forwards .
We 're still friends , but we do n't talk as frequently as we did back in the days when we were doing Watchmen .
But we keep in touch .
Like so many friends in comics , we do n't often speak for months or even years , but then we just pick up the conversation where we left off .
Alan has specifically asked me not to talk to him about Watchmen anymore , because he has decided to distance himself from the movie and its accompanying circus , which I completely respect .
But I last spoke to him about two months ago , and we speak from time to time .
I 'm going to be doing some illustrations for a book he is doing next year , so the frequency of our conversations will increase .
Wired.com :
Do you feel that Watching the Watchmen properly highlights your hard work on the novel , which has sometimes been overshadowed by Moore 's irascible quotability ?
Gibbons : Yeah , in many ways , it 's always been journalistic shorthand in the past to give Alan the lion 's share of the credit .
Obviously , he deserves a huge amount of it , and I would never want to take away anything from what he has done , not just on Watchmen but his other series , too .
But people unacquainted with graphic novels , including journalists , tend to think of Watchmen as a book by Alan Moore that happens to have some illustrations .
And that does a disservice to the entire form , because comics are stories in words and pictures .
To marginalize either aspect shows a misunderstanding and under-appreciation of the form .
And Alan is scrupulous about giving credit ; there 's never been a problem between us .
Certainly in Watching the Watchmen , I tend to get a lion 's share of the attention , but I think perhaps that 's appropriate since it's a picture book .
But Alan does give very good quotes .
Wired.com :
How has it felt to revisit all of this material ?
What are your thoughts the second time around ?
Gibbons : Obviously , I was very familiar with all of this material at one time .
I could remember every piece of paper that I had , so going through it again was a bit like archaeology , or going through old family photographs .
" Hey look , I 'd forgotten all about this ! "
That sort of thing .
So it was an interesting process of discovery to see what I had kept .
The second time around , I am amazed by how much thought we put into Watchmen , how hard we labored over every detail .
But I think that is one of the reasons for its longevity .
In comics , there are depths that do n't reveal themselves immediately , and the stuff that you might consider anal about Watching the Watchmen – like the notes where I plot the rotation of a perfume bottle through the air – might not be particularly obvious to anyone who reads it .
But those who do will note the consistency , the reality behind it all that exists in great depth .
It gives it a more magical quality , which it would n't have had if we just made things up as we went along or changed it to suit the latest continuity .
It does give it a feeling of authority .
Wired.com : About the movie ...
Warner Bros. is marketing Snyder as a visionary director , but he 's using the most famous comic of all time as a storyboard .
Is that jumping the gun ?
Gibbons : I think Zack Snyder is arguably a visionary director .
I do think that he has got a very sharp , clear and idiosyncratic vision .
Much as he is using the comic book as a storyboard , the way that he has assembled it and the way he has introduced his own images into the film shows that he is a man of incredible vision .
Naturally , I am very flattered that the compositions I came up with are included , from the costumes to further details , but I do n't feel that Zack is riding on my abilities at all .
I think a movie is a very different beast than a comic book .
Zack could no more visualize the comic book than I could visualize the movie – although I am perhaps selling myself a bit short !
[ Laughs ]
But I would n't want to take away from Zack .
I think he 's brought a lot to the project , and I am very happy with his interpretation .
Wired.com :
How are you feeling about the film so far , having seen its progress from the inside ?
Gibbons : I am feeling very optimistic about the film .
I have been pleased with everything I have seen , and every successive thing I see makes me feel better .
I 've seen parts of it now three or four times , and I can still watch them again very happily .
Like a graphic novel , there are depths of detail and meaning in film that give themselves up on a first viewing , and I am really looking forward to getting the director 's cut of the DVD so I can go through it frame by frame .
Which itself is a similar experience some have the first time they read Watchmen , and which the film is cruelly denying me !
[ Laughs ]
Wired.com :
Will the film 's necessary compression of Watchmen 's dense narratives and sub-narratives only make the book look that much better ?
Someone coming to the comic from the film is probably going to have his or her mind blown .
Gibbons : I do n't know about better .
Different , certainly , as things are very compressed in the film , which has done a wonderful job on that count .
There are things left out , and there are other things paradoxically inserted , acting as bridge material , which is great .
But I do think people who come to the comic after seeing the film will get much more from it .
Things will be explained to them .
Like I said about the DVD , it 'll be like seeing the director 's cut of the movie slowed down so you can watch it at your own pace .
Which of course is the beauty of graphic novels and comic books in the first place .
And there are some sub-narratives and background material that will only come from the graphic novel .
It 's not like one will replace the other .
Hopefully , it will be the same dense , interesting narrative told in two different ways , although Watchmen was designed to be read as a comic book .
That is its prime medium .
You would be selling yourself short if you did n't read the comic .
Wired.com :
Do you think readers of today are patient enough for that kind of visual and narrative complexity ?
Gibbons : I think readers are always patient .
Look at the Harry Potter series .
Some have given up on this generation of kids as game and TV addicts , but lots of people spend lots of time patiently reading through hundreds of pages of dense prose .
I think reading a comic by comparison is a lot more immediate .
With the Watchmen comic , we attempted to tell it in an accessible way .
I deliberately made the artwork very clear , deceptively so .
You think you 're sucking on a sweetie , but it turns out to be a sugar - coated chili .
So yes , I think today 's readers are patient , and visually sophisticated .
I have spoken to some who have read Watchmen , and it took them a while just to understand how to read a comic .
Do you look at the pictures , then the words ?
The words , then the pictures ?
Do you look at the whole page and then come back and read it ?
I think you read a comic in any way you want to read it .
We all have our own behavioral psychology .

RNC to report another $ 30,000 spent on Palin wardrobe John Byrne
Published : Thursday December 4 , 2008

The price of Sarah Palin's RNC - provided wardrobe is approaching the price of an average American home .
As the price of median US home prices continues to fall , the price of Sarah Palin 's wardrobe continues to rise .
" The Republican National Committee is scheduled to file a campaign report with the Federal Election Commission Thursday disclosing that the committee spent additional funds to clothe and accessorize vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin , " the National Journal reported late Wednesday .
" In October , Politico revealed that the RNC had spent approximately $ 150,000 on clothing and accessories for Palin and her family after she was selected as Sen. John McCains running mate , " the magazine added .
" The story provoked a storm of criticism of the Alaska governor , a mother of five and favorite of the conservative wing of the GOP . "
GOP officials would n't provide many details .
" The amount to be reported is significantly less than $ 150,000 , " one RNC official told National Journal .
" The accessories on the report are less than $ 30,000 . "
The clothing , the official says , is in the committee 's possession and
will be dispersed to national and local charities at the appropriate time . "
They are said to include " other " accessories purchased for the " hockey mom " before the election .
Sen. John McCain's ( R - AZ ) campaign spent more than $ 150,000 on Palin 's wardrobe between late August and Nov. 4 .
In early September , the RNC 's clothing buys for Palin included bills from Saks Fifth Avenue in St. Louis and New York for $ 49,425.74 , and shopping trips to Neiman Marcus in Minneapolis , including one totaling $ 75,062.63 in September .
The RNC also spent $ 4,716.49 on hair and makeup through September , Politico reported .
KUALA LUMPUR ( Reuters ) - Malaysia ’s prime minister said Wednesday Muslims should still take up yoga , reversing an outright ban that has drawn widespread protests amid concerns over growing Islamic fundamentalism in the multiracial nation .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Malaysia ’s National Fatwa Council , comprising Islamic scholars , told Muslims at the weekend to avoid yoga because it uses Hindu prayers that could erode Muslims ’ faith .
But the decision drew a sharp rebuke from many Muslims and even Malaysia ’s sultans , or hereditary rulers , who said that they should be consulted on any matters involving Islam .
Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi moved to contain the damage , telling the national news agency Bernama that Muslims could carry on doing yoga but minus the chanting .
“ I wish to state that a physical regime with no elements of worship can continue , meaning , it is not banned .
I believe that Muslims are not easily swayed into polytheism , ” he said .
Just before Abdullah spoke , the eldest son of the ruler of the central Negeri Sembilan state took the government to task over the yoya ruling .
“ Islam is a progressive religion and the ulama ( scholars ) should be confident of the followers ’ faith rather than micro-managing their way of life , ” Tunku Naquiyuddin told a luncheon .
“ If I go to a church or a Buddhist temple , is there any fear of me converting ? ...
Where do we draw the line ? ” the online version of the Star newspaper quoted him as saying .
The yoga fatwa ruling came hot on the heels of another edict against young Muslim women wearing trousers .
Fatwas or religious edicts are not legally binding , but they are highly influential in Malaysia , where Malay - Muslims form just over half of the country ’s 27 million people .
The fatwa council has said that by wearing trousers , girls risked becoming sexually active “ tomboys . ”
Gay sex is outlawed in Malaysia .
Malaysia ’s sizeable minorities include ethnic Chinese and Indians who practice either Christianity , Buddhism or Hinduism .

9:25 AM CT :
The board is discussing the possibility of going back into the pile of challenges to re-review some questionable ballots .
There are apparently 16 ballots that were marked with an X ; from these 16 ballots , the board discerned that the X was written in a " different ink , " or on a different plane ( above or below another mark ) on the ballot .
9:31 AM CT : The board is now considering whether to actual " pull " and review those ballots .
Apparently it would result in reviewing 40 total ballots due to the comparisons requested ; the clerk estimated that the review would take about half an hour .
9:33 AM CT : If they review those 16 ballots , as requested by the Coleman campaign -- which would require 40 total ballots to be reviewed -- the Franken campaign has argued that they also have a select group of ballots they would like to have re-reviewed .
9:35 AM CT : An hour long recess is forthcoming as they sort through the challenges and " pull " the 40 ballots in question .
Recess until 10:30 AM
CT .
9:47 AM CT : On a side note ; Coleman counsel , Fritz Knaak was just semi-complaining about the recess .
After the recess , Mr. Knaak preceded to the back of the room to get his get something in his laptop bag .
On the way , a member of the audience asked Mr. Knaak if " [ he ] got paid " for waiting .
Mr. Knaak responded by saying , " wait , its what lawyers do . "
At the same moment in time , Franken counsel , Marc Elias was talking with a group of about four people who were laughing .
Bottom line : Knaak is nervous and Elias seems at ease .
In the meantime , let 's look at the composition of the Minnesota Supreme Court :
Justices are elected to six - year terms unless a mid-term vacancy occurs , in which case the governor appoints a replacement to finish the term .
Justices have a mandatory retirement age of 70 .

Films like Four Weddings and a Funeral could promote unrealistic expectations Watching romantic comedies can spoil your love life , a study by a university in Edinburgh has claimed .
Rom-coms have been blamed by relationship experts at Heriot Watt University for promoting unrealistic expectations when it comes to love .
They found fans of films such as Runaway Bride and Notting Hill often fail to communicate with their partner .
Many held the view if someone is meant to be with you , then they should know what you want without you telling them .
Psychologists at the family and personal relationships laboratory at the university studied 40 top box office hits between 1995 and 2005 , and identified common themes which they believed were unrealistic .
The problem is that while most of us know that the idea of a perfect relationship is unrealistic , some of us are still more influenced by media portrayals than we realise
Dr Bjarne Holmes
Heriot Watt University
The movies included You 've Got Mail , Maid In Manhattan , The Wedding Planner and While You Were Sleeping .
The university 's Dr Bjarne Holmes said : " Marriage counsellors often see couples who believe that sex should always be perfect , and if someone is meant to be with you then they will know what you want without you needing to communicate it .
" We now have some emerging evidence that suggests popular media play a role in perpetuating these ideas in people 's minds .
" The problem is that while most of us know that the idea of a perfect relationship is unrealistic , some of us are still more influenced by media portrayals than we realise . "

As part of the project , 100 student volunteers were asked to watch the 2001 romantic comedy Serendipity , while a further 100 watched a David Lynch drama .
Students watching the romantic film were later found to be more likely to believe in fate and destiny .
A further study found that fans of romantic comedies had a stronger belief in predestined love .
Kimberly Johnson , who also worked on the study , said : " Films do capture the excitement of new relationships but they also wrongly suggest that trust and committed love exist from the moment people meet , whereas these are qualities that normally take years to develop . "
The researchers have now launched an online study on media and relationships .

The head of the Russian Orthodox Church , Patriarch Alexy II , who restored the authority of the church after decades of Soviet repression , has died , church officials say .
" Yes , he has died , " a church spokesman said by telephone after Russian news agencies said the patriarch , aged 79 , died earlier on Friday at his residence outside Moscow .
There was no immediate word on the cause of death .
Born Alexei Ridiger , Alexy II made his ecclesiastical career at a time when the church was controlled by Soviet authorities before forging an alliance with the new Russian state under presidents Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin .
The patriarch was an impressive character with a benign expression and moral authority among millions of Russian believers , but his personality was always locked in by the deeply hierarchical nature of his role .
Alexy II took stances on foreign policy issues that often matched the Kremlin line , criticising NATO strikes against Yugoslavia , the US - led war in Iraq and defending the rights of ethnic - Russians in the former Soviet Union .
Supreme Court to decide Ashcroft , Mueller immunity
Agence France - Presse
The US Supreme Court will hear a case Wednesday on whether cabinet - level officials could be held accountable for controversial tactics President George W. Bush ordered as part of the US - led “ war on terror . ”
Former attorney general John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller have sought immunity from the charges in a lawsuit filed by Javaid Iqbal , a Pakistani national .
Iqbal was among more than 700 Arab and South Asian Muslim men from the New York City area rounded up after the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
While they were all eventually charged with immigration violations or minor crimes , none was linked to terrorism .
In his lawsuit , Iqbal alleges that Ashcroft and Mueller targeted the men for investigation and punitive detention , sidestepping procedural protections usually granted to such detainees .
Iqbal , who was held at a maximum security section of a Brooklyn federal prison , says he was subjected to harsh treatment and discrimination and that federal officials classified him as a “ high interest ” suspect because he was a Muslim from Pakistan .
A June 2003 report by the Department of Justice inspector general found “ significant problems ” in the treatment of detainees like Iqbal .
Iqbal ’s lawsuit says Ashcroft and Mueller approved the policy of holding post -September 11 detainees in restrictive confinement .
Ashcroft was among those who “ willfully and maliciously approved of , endorsed , and / or ordered that these searches take place ” and “ knew of , condoned , and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject ( Iqbal ) to unreasonable , unnecessary and extreme strip and body - cavity searches , ” according to the suit .
A federal court and an appeals court refused to remove the cabinet - level officials from the case .
Lawyers for Ashcroft and Mueller say their clients were not personally involved in the detainee mistreatment and did not know about Iqbal .
“ A complaint must allege sufficient facts to cross the line between possibility and plausibility , ” Solicitor General Gregory Barre wrote in his brief to the court .
Barre says Iqbal ’s lawyers have failed to provide enough evidence linking Ashcroft and Mueller to Iqbal ’s mistreatment .
Alexander Reinert , who will argue for Iqbal , challenges the government ’s position as an attempt to avoid responsibility by high - ranking officials for mistreatment okayed by the Bush Administration .
“ The government ’s position will have the practical effect of ensuring that these officials will never be held accountable for unconstitutional conduct , ” Reinert said in a statement .
Some critics have assailed Ashcroft over the Patriot Act , legislation that broadened law enforcement powers after September 11 , saying it did so at the expense of civil liberties .
Iqbal claims that during his five - month confinement he was held 23 hours a day in a constantly lit cell where the air conditioning was turned on in the winter and the heat was turned in the summer .
He says he was also beaten and strip - searched .
Upon release in 2003 , he had lost nearly 20 kilograms ( 44 pounds ) .
He was then deported to Pakistan with no terror - related charges filed against him .

A drunk driver who killed a father and son was masturbating at the wheel moments before the fatal crash , a court heard today .
Imran Hussain 's powerful Audi Q7 was like a " speeding bullet " moments before it ploughed into the back of a Fiat Punto carrying Gary Proctor , 47 , his wife Catherine , 44 , and their 16 - year - old son James .
Mr Proctor and James died in the collision on the M62 motorway near Rochdale , Greater Manchester , on August 3 last year .
Hussain , 32 , of Como Avenue , Bradford , West Yorkshire , pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and one count of driving with excess alcohol .
Manchester Crown Court heard that Hussain 's penis was partially exposed when motorists came to his aid after the crash .
Judge Andrew Blake told him : " At the least it must have been a symptom you were not giving your full attention to driving . "
He sentenced him to eight years for each of the two counts of causing death by dangerous driving , to be served concurrently , and banned him from driving for 15 years .
He made no separate penalty for driving with excess alcohol .
Prosecutor Andrew Nuttall said Hussain , a car dealer and father - of - four , was twice over the legal limit .
Seven hours before the crash , Hussain had rowed with his wife and left the family home to meet friends in Bradford , the court heard .
Mr Nuttall said the group drove around , swigging from a bottle of Southern Comfort , before going to a lap - dancing club in Leeds , where they continued to drink .
Hussain left his friends and climbed into his car , " substantial in size and power " , according to the prosecutor .
He stopped at a service station in Leeds just after 5 am and was described by the cashier as " staggering and clearly drunk " .
Hussain ripped open a bag of crisps and began eating them and also took a soft drink , before swearing at the cashier , who asked him not to swear and to hand the crisps over .
He replied : " I 'll find out where you live and will kill you . "
He repeated the threat several times before leaving .
The cashier took down his registration number and contacted police .
Hussain 's erratic driving , at speeds of up to 120 mph over a 10 - mile stretch , was reported to police by three groups of concerned motorists just minutes before the crash .
One motorist saw Hussain stop on the hard shoulder and throw a bottle over his car before setting off again .
Another motorist , Christian Downard , told police : " He is going all over the road and is going to kill someone . "
Mr Nuttall said that , moments before the crash , the Audi Q7 was seen lane - hopping , before veering sharply across to the nearside lane and smashing into the back of the Fiat Punto .
He said : " A cloud of debris burst into the air and the Q7 car spun off to the left , through the barrier , smashing 15 yards of metal structure before smashing into a street lamp and coming to rest behind the barrier . "
Several motorists stopped to help both the victims and the defendant .
Mr Downard and his two friends went to the aid of the defendant , and saw that his semi-erect penis was out of his trousers .
He attempted to run away and hurled abuse at them , including making threats to kill them .
A passing nurse and a doctor came to the aid of the Proctors , who were travelling from their home in Wakefield to Manchester Airport to fly out to Florida for a holiday .
Mrs Proctor , who was in the front seat , suffered six broken ribs .
Her husband and son were trapped in the wreckage of the car for 40 minutes and had to be cut free .
Both suffered heart attacks and died at the scene .
Hussain was uninjured in the collision .
Police examined his mobile phone and discovered that he had called directory inquiries to request the number of an escort agency around 30 minutes before the crash .
Mr Nuttall said he called the agency - which provides female escorts on an hourly basis - but it was closed .
He said : " His attempts to contact the agency and the finding of him with an erect penis out of his trousers indicates that he was sexually excited and clearly handling his penis whilst he was driving and at the time of the collision . "
Mr Nuttall read excerpts from Mrs Proctor 's victim impact statement to the court which spelt out her determination to carry on for the sake of her husband and son .
He said : " I know my future will be different to that which I was expecting before August 3 .
I 'm determined this will not be the end of my world and I will fight it , mainly because James and Gary will expect me to .
" I did n't die in the collision for a reason and I 'll be damned if the guy in the collision will drag me down as well . "
Mrs Proctor was in court for the verdict .
Mr Nuttall said she has required plastic surgery to her face because of the scars she received .
Judge Blake said : " Nothing that anyone can say or do can alleviate the suffering Mrs Proctor has borne and will bear in the future . "
Mrs Proctor said , in a statement released after the verdict : " Me and my family were going on a long - awaited trip to New York and Florida when this happened .
" No words or sentence will ever describe the devastation that we feel .
No - one should ever go through the nightmare I have suffered over the last four months .
" James was my only child and loved life .
He was a kind , thoughtful young man and loved and lived life to the full .
" He was just due to start an exciting chapter in his life after finishing his GCSEs .
Sadly he will never experience any of that now .
" Gary was a quiet , lovely man who I have spent my whole adult life with .
We had been married for 24 years .
" My whole life has been shattered .
My hopes and dreams for the future have been taken away from me and the rest of my family .
We will never recover from this . "
Sergeant Phil Robinson , of Greater Manchester Police , said : " This man has taken Catherine Proctor 's entire family away from her in one fell swoop .
" Hussain appeared to be on a mission to act as recklessly as possible that night , clearly holding absolutely no regard for anyone else 's safety .
" Not only had he got behind the wheel of his car when drunk , but he had driven so dangerously it is actually a wonder that he did not ruin anyone else 's life that day . "
Mr Nuttall said outside the court that he would consider appealing over the sentence .

It 's not an easy question to answer and I sometimes find myself struggling to answer it .
It 's not a question I take lightly though and the last thing I would ever want to do is diminish the honesty and the beauty of the love that my ex-wife and I shared at the time we got married in the early days of 1980 .
The answer is basically yes .
My ex-wife knew that I 'd been with both men and women .
I told her as much on our second date .
But I think both of us were just young enough , in love enough and naieve enough to believe that because we were in love the homosexual thing was behind us .
It 's an answer however , that opens up a whole Pandora 's Box of caveats and implications .
Yes , I had been with men before I met my ex-wife .
And I 'd been with a few women too .
In terms of a sexual response there was no question in my mind about which was stronger and more satisfying .
Sex with men rocked my world and sex with women was something I had to work at .
But in my mid-twenties and having denied myself any sexual experience at all until I was 21 , I had enough hormones raging in me to handle whatever situation happened to present itself .
It was a very confusing time though as I was trying to sort out my sexuality , my relationship to the Mormon church and my desire to be married to the woman I loved all in the same breath .
One thing was for sure - when I met my ex-wife I fell head over heels in love with her and wanted nothing more than to be married to her and have a life with her ; the house with a white picket fence and the whole nine yards .
It was all there .
It was my fantasy .
But it was also my reality considering who I was and how I 'd been brought up in the church .
I tried to be as honest with her as I knew how to be at the time .
The fact is , I did n't really know what was going on with me .
I just knew that I loved this woman and for awhile everything else pretty much seemed to take a backseat to that .
True too is the fact that I had no idea two men could even have a relationship , much less enter into anything even remotely resembling a marriage .
For all I knew back then , it was just about the sex .
For a long time I tried to tell myself that I was bisexual because I was having sex with both men and women and that seemed the only logical way to explain what I was experiencing .
When my ex-wife and I got married I pretty much assumed that the whole homosexual thing was behind me , while not really abandoning the idea that I might be bisexual .
But it was n't very far into the marriage before I began to realize that my desires for men were getting stronger and more irresistible than ever .
I tried to justify my infidelities by telling myself that because I was n't having sex with another woman I was n't being unfaithful to my wife .
But it was n't long before I realized what a crock that was .
The thing is , the marriage was good , our love was strong and we soon had a beautiful daughter together .
I was happy with what we had and I had every reason in the world to try and make it work .
But there was this gnawing issue of my desire to be with men that never , ever went away .
It was always there , lurking in the shadows like some kind of a magnet to my soul .
The harder I tried to resist my desires , the stronger they got .
She knew .
She always knew .
And once in a moment of stupidity while we were living in Italy a couple of years into our marriage , I unburdened myself of my guilt by telling her about the men I 'd been with since we 'd been married .
It was a moment of devastation for her that she never recovered from .
The trust had been broken and though we struggled for the rest of our time together to repair it , we were never able to .
Sometimes things just get broken so badly that you can't fix them .
I do regret hurting my ex-wife .
I regret it deeply because it was n't my intention to do so .
I loved her .
I just did n't know how to do without this other part of my life .
It was like I was convinced that if I really worked hard enough at it I could get oil and water to mix .
But I could n't .
So yes , she knew .
But I think she thought as I did , that our love for each other cancelled out the other part of me .
And it did n't .
We struggled along for over ten years with lots of great adventures and the joy of raising a beautiful daughter together .
But in the end we both found ourselves with no steam left to keep the relationship going .
It did n't help matters either that I was definitely on my way out of the church during our time together while she was more determined than ever to be involved and faithful .
Our differences truly became irreconcilable .
By the time our marriage ended I had long since stopped my extra-marital affairs , but it did n't make any difference .
Every man that ever walked in front of me became a suspect .
And with a never - ending parade of models , athletes and actors wandering in and out of my photography studio , the distrust became too much for both of us .
During a visit to her folks place in Nebraska I got a call from my ex-wife during which she said simply , " This is n't working for me anymore .
I want out of the marriage . "
And that was that .
It was over .
I knew she was right .
As devastated as I was by her words I also felt an enormous swell of relief come over me .
I hung up the phone , picked it back up again and called a guy that I 'd been shooting a few days before and asked him what he was doing that night for dinner .
We ate , we talked for a long time and we made love .
He was the first of my many hundreds of clients over the years that I ever had sex with .
But at that point I knew that my marriage was over and I was tired of trying to fix something that was hopelessly broken .
So I gave in and did what I 'd been accused of doing all along .
I did n't feel good about it - I just felt relief .
Yes , my ex-wife knew what was what when we married .
But like me she did n't have enough pieces of the puzzle to make any sense of the life that lay before us .
And when you 're in love you see only the person you 're in love with and everything else just seems to disappear .
But who can argue with love ?
And who can argue with a marriage that brings a precious child into your lives ?
We both entered into our relationship and our marriage with as much honesty and love as any two people could ever hope for .
That one of us was gay became more than we 'd bargained for and more than we knew how to handle .
I 've heard it argued that if the Mormon Church had better counseling available , was more realistic about the nature of homosexuality and worked more closely with young homosexual members rather than being so intent on changing them , that not so many of them would end up plunging into ill - fated marriages like they do .
In a perfect world that would be the best solution and hopefully one day we 'll see it happen .
That said however , I 'm grateful that things worked out the way they did for me .
I would n't trade a day of my marriage for anything .
I loved my ten years of being married and the great gift of my daughter that came out of it .
She made it worth every difficult moment and I hope my ex-wife could say the same thing , though I certainly can't speak for her .
She was the one who carried the greatest pain during our time together and that made her experience a very different one than mine .
When I draw the bottom line and add everything up , having this beautiful daughter is the only thing that matters .
And I would n't have her in my life today had I not married her mother some 26 years ago .
Sometimes you have to simplify the past , distill it down to its essence and look at how much good came out of a particular experience ...
... and then let the rest of it go .
In all honesty though , I think it 's probably wise to consider that marriages between gay men and straight women rarely last and often go through so much heartache getting to the end that you have to wonder whether it 's really worth it .
Most women in these situations are left holding a mountain of pain and self - doubt :
" What did I do wrong ?
" Why was I not good enough for him ? "
" What 's wrong with me that he could n't love me
the way I loved him ? "
" I could have competed with another woman ,
but with another man ? "
And the oft heard comment that is so hard to reconcile :
" Our whole marriage has been a lie . "
Every woman needs and deserves to be loved by a man who can do it fully and without reservation .
Most gay men are simply not capable of giving women the satisfaction they desire when it comes to a sexual relationship .
And on the other side of the coin , most gay men are never going to get from a woman the intimacy and sexual fulfillment that they most need and want .
Whatever the upsides are , and in my case there were many , the downsides are such that they can leave so many scars that it can take years to heal them , if they can ever be healed at all .
There are countless instances in which men have been denied custody of their children during a divorce because the battle became ugly and the man 's homosexuality was used successfully as a weapon against him .
The deep anger and pain that a woman sometimes experiences in learning that she 's been unwittingly married to a gay man are almost incalculable .
Some marriages end amicably as mine did with custody being shared jointly .
But this is n't always the case and the devastation of losing access to one 's children is a heavy burden to carry .
Sometimes kids find their way back to an estranged parent , but sometimes they do n't , and it's hard to imagine anything more difficult or heartbreaking .
Perhaps even more tragically , there are those gay men who have made their wives unwitting partners to disease by living out their homosexual desires clandestinely and carelessly .
That 's the kind of heartache that never goes away and the kind that no one should ever have to experience .
How I managed to dodge that bullet I have no idea .
I 'm just glad I did .
There are of course , no easy answers .
It 's almost impossible to walk away from love as many of us know from experience .
And sometimes the good really does outweigh the bad - even a failed marriage can have its silver - lining .
So maybe it all boils down to a crap - shoot in the end ; certainly there are those who have made non-traditional marriages work even though the odds were stacked against them .
So yes , my ex-wife and I both kind of knew what was what when we married .
But what we did n't know far outweighed what we did and it was in those places of not knowing that we ultimately found our reasons for ending the marriage .
In the words of the immortal Bard :
" O , how this spring of love resembleth
The uncertain glory of an April day ;
Which now shows all the beauty of the sun ,
And by and by a cloud takes all away . "
My experience has been that most marriages between gay men and straight women do n't last .
But maybe while they do there 's enough good there to have made them worthwhile .

生ローヤルゼリーとは？
ローヤルゼリーにはいくつか種類があり、中でも最も鮮度が保たれているのが生ローヤルゼリーです。新鮮さ以外に、他のローヤルゼリーと何か違いはあるのか、みていきましょう。
生ローヤルゼリーってどんなもの？
生ローヤルゼリーとは、働き蜂が花粉などを食べ、体内で合成したあとに分泌して、女王バチに与える特別な食事です。薄黄色のクリーム状をしていて、独特のピリッとした酸味があります。「王台」と呼ばれる特別な部屋の中に、女王バチ候補の幼虫の周りを埋め尽くすように詰められています。
製品化にあたっては、王台から採取したあと、品質の低下を防ぐために不純物を取り除いています。最低限の加工以外は行わないため、採れたての味を保ち、栄養価も損なわれないのが特長です。
生ローヤルゼリーには定義がある
生ローヤルゼリーとして販売するには、厳しい審査や検査を通過しなければいけません。ローヤルゼリーの適正で公平な製造・販売を促進する団体「全国ローヤルゼリー取引協議会」によって、定義が定められています。
王台から採取後、72時間以内に瓶詰めしたものだけが「生ローヤルゼリー」として販売することを許されています。さらに付け加えると、水分やタンパク質量、デセン酸の量なども厳しくチェックされ、基準を満たしたものだけが高品質の生ローヤルゼリーとして認められています。
生ローヤルゼリーが飲みにくい場合は
健康食品は基本的 に 「 食べる」のではなく「栄養素を摂取する」目的で利用されます。ただ、生ローヤルゼリーはクリーム状の見た目から、食品として味わってみたいと思う方もいるでしょう。
ですが、生ローヤルゼリーは独特な酸味があり、飲みにくいという方も少なくありません。この問題を解決するには、酸味を直接感じないように飲み方を工夫するとよいでしょう。
舌の上に触れさせずに飲む
通常、生ローヤルゼリーはスプーンですくって少量を口に含みます。このとき、舌の上には乗せず、下部分に入れると酸味を感じにくくなります。
舌の表面部分には、味覚を感じる器官、味蕾(みらい)が多く存在しています。以前は、舌の左奥部分に酸味を感じる味蕾が多く存在するとされていました。現在では舌の場所に関わらず、味蕾はどの味覚でも感じるというのが明らかになっています。
この味蕾は、舌の下部分には比較的少ないので、酸味を含めた味覚を感じにくくなります。生ローヤルゼリーは酸味のほか、独特の風味が苦手という方も少なくありません。そのため舌の下部分に入れると、酸味や風味が苦手な方でも食べやすくなるでしょう。
また、胃酸に触れることもないので、栄養成分の吸収率が高まります。ひとつだけ注意する点は、舌の下でも付け根部分には味蕾が多く存在するので、酸味を感じてしまいます。生ローヤルゼリーを上手に取り入れるには、できるだけ舌先の下部分に含むとよいでしょう。
オブラートに包 む
舌の下でもにいれてもどうしても酸味が気になるという方は、オブラートに包んで取り入れるとよいでしょう。固形物のような感覚で飲み込めるので、生ローヤルゼリーをしっかり取り入れた実感も得られます。
生ローヤルゼリーは少量でも、オブラートに包むと意外とサイズが大きくなってしまいます。オブラートに包まれたサイズが大きいと、飲み込むとき喉付近で破れ、生ローヤルゼリーの酸味を感じてしまう可能性があります。
薬などでも大きい錠剤を飲むのが苦手という方は、生ローヤルゼリーの量を2～3回分に分け、できるだけオブラートの包みを小さい状態にしてから飲むとよいでしょう。
そもそもなぜ生のままで摂取するの？
生ローヤルゼリーは酸味が強く、率直にいって美味しい食品とはいえません。サプリメントタイプであれは、酸味を気にせず摂取できるはずです。ではどうして食べ方を工夫してまで取り入れる必要があるのでしょうか？それは何といっても、ローヤルゼリー本来の栄養素を損なうことなく、まるごと摂取できる利点があるからです。
生ローヤルゼリーには、ミツバチたちが自然の中から集めてきた天然成分が豊富に含まれています。私たちの健康維持に欠かせない3大栄養素、タンパク質・炭水化物・脂質に加え、ビタミン・ミネラルなど美容効果も得られる栄養素が凝縮されています。
これらの栄養素は、採れたての状態が最も含有量が保たれ、全体のバランスも維持されています。特にタンパク質は、ローヤルゼリーの中でも含まれる量が多く、鮮度が低下すると変質する可能性があります。さらに特有成分のデセン酸は、ローヤルゼリーの品質にも関わる重要な成分です。
実は、生ローヤルゼリーの酸味のもとは、このデセン酸が作り出しています。つまり、その含有量が多く新鮮なほど、酸味が強く出てしまうのです。
デセン酸は女性ホルモンと似た働きをするため、ホルモンが影響を及ぼす女性特有の症状を予防・改善する効果があります。まだその詳しい働きは完全には解明されていませんが、現在も研究が続けられ、解明と新たな効果に期待が寄せられています。
生ローヤルゼリーの酸味は、強いほど栄養価が豊富な証です。そのため、できればローヤルゼリーは生の状態で摂取するのが理想といえます。ただ、酸味がストレスになってしまっては、継続的な摂取が難しくなってしまいます。どうしても食べづらさを感じてしまう場合は、サプリメントを検討してみましょう。

A US Senate committee has accused the former defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , of being directly responsible for the abusive interrogations of detainees at Abu Ghraib in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay .
After an 18 - month investigation , the Senate 's armed services committee concluded that Rumsfeld 's approval of aggressive interrogation methods in December 2002 was a direct cause of abuses that began in Guantánamo and spread to Afghanistan and Iraq .
They culminated in the Abu Ghraib scandal in 2003 , where Iraqi detainees were found to have been forced into naked pyramids , sexually humiliated and threatened by dogs .
The Bush administration insisted the abuses had been the result of a few " bad apples " and that those responsible would be held accountable .
The committee found neither those statements to be true .
" The abuses at Abu Ghraib , Gitmo [ Guantánamo ] and elsewhere cannot be chalked up to the actions of a few bad apples , " said the Democratic chair of the committee , Carl Levin .
" Attempts by senior officials to portray that to be the case while shrugging off any responsibility are both unconscionable and false . "
No other congressional report has pointed the finger of blame so squarely at Bush and his senior advisers .
In hearings in June and September , the committee heard testimony that allowed it to piece together the chronology of events leading up to the Abu Ghraib abuses .
It focused its attentions on Sere , a training system used to prepare US soldiers for aggressive interrogations so that they might endure if captured overseas .
The techniques were never intended to be used by US interrogators against their detainees .
But in February 2002 , in the wake of the 9/11 attacks , Bush determined that the Geneva Conventions should not apply to terror suspects .
Following that ruling , techniques used in Sere training were applied against US detainees , and Rumsfeld gave his approval that December .
More and more journalists and columnists are starting to read into the tea leaves and seeing signs of generational change seemingly embodied in the incoming White House administration .
A prime example is found today at AlterNet , in a well written column by Alexander Zaitchik that , like NORML ’s staff , seeks balance between an undeniable enthusiasm for the potential of substantive changes in cannabis laws under a more enlightened and science - based Obama administration and the stark reality of the collective histories of many of his important cabinet members opposing cannabis law reforms–even for medical access and industrial purposes .

If Obama Is Pro-Science and Honest , He ’ll Put the Kibosh on the Drug War
By Alexander Zaitchik , AlterNet
Posted on December 23 , 2008
One of the many things that made Barack Obama such a refreshing candidate was his frank and unapologetic admission of drug use .
True , Anderson Cooper extracted curt “ yeses ” from some 2004 Democratic candidates when he asked them point - blank if they had ever smoked pot .
But Obama has written openly and without prompting about his experiences , not only with marijuana , but cocaine , a “ hard ” drug .
On the campaign trail he even joked about inhaling deeply — “ that was the point , ” he said more than once .
Unlike George W. Bush , Obama did n’t hide behind evasive murmurs about “ irresponsible behavior , ” or turn his drug experiences into a setup for some maudlin born - again conversion story .
As recounted in his memoir , Dreams From My Father , Obama was a normal American kid .
Which is to say he used drugs , had fun and survived .
The book does n’t romanticize the president - elect ’s days of smoking pot and snorting “ a little blow when [ he ] could afford it , ” but it ’s easy to take what details he provides and imagine him with his basketball buddies on some Oahu beach blazing bowls of Maui Wowie , alternately laughing until his guts hurt and sitting in quiet wonder before a magnificent pink - and - yellow Pacific sunset .
Obama has even written about his pursuit of heroin ’s moon - shot high .
As a teenager , he went so far as to ask a junkie friend for an assisted first hit , but recoiled when presented in a deli freezer with the surgical tools of the mainliner ’s trade : rubber tubing and second - hand syringe .
Partly because Obama was so reasonable and matter - of - fact about his own All - American experiences getting high , drug - policy reformers were among those most excited by his candidacy .
If any aspect of America needs change , it is the country ’s prohibitionist and punitive approach to drugs and drug use .
Obama , it seemed , was the right politician to take an executive hammer to the cracked marble pillars of America ’s disastrous war on drugs .
Throughout the primaries and general election , Obama gently encouraged these hopes by advocating commonsense drug - policy reforms .
He criticized federal paramilitary raids on state - sanctioned greenhouses and called for ending racist discrepancies in cocaine sentencing laws .
( As a little - mentioned footnote to the first of these positions , Obama ’s mother died from cancer five years before the Hawaii legislature legalized medical marijuana . )
Nobody expected Obama to tap Tommy Chong to run the Office of National Drug Control Policy .
But maybe , just maybe , Obama would have the political courage to publicly acknowledge what an emerging majority of Americans now grasps : that the war on drugs is a failure , that it is unjust , and that it is an epic waste of law - enforcement time and resources .
Still a month before inauguration , the hopes of drug - policy - reform advocates have had their wings clipped several times , beginning with the announcement of the Democratic ticket .
“ The pick of Joe Biden was my first sign of digestive tumult , ” says Keith Stroup , founder and legal advisor of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) .
“ Rather than oppose the Reagan - inspired War on Some Drugs , Biden became an enthusiastic supporter and legislative booster .
He was at the center of creating the ONDCP [ in 1988 ] , mandatory minimum sentencing , civil forfeiture laws , the Rave Act , funding for DARE in public schools and the ad campaigns for the Partnership for a Drug Free America . ”
NORML board member Dominic Holden says : “ Biden is the drug war embodied . ”
The selection of the emblematic Democratic drug warrior of the 1980s was followed by the selection of his 1990s counterpart , Rahm Emanuel .
As President Bill Clinton ’s liaison with the ONDCP , the incoming chief of staff advised on and defended that administration ’s tough - on - crime punitive approach to drugs and its cowardly opposition to medical - marijuana initiatives and needle - exchange programs .
While Clinton has since expressed regret over some of these positions , the tightly wound Emanuel has not .
Obama ’s pick for attorney general , meanwhile , has a mixed record on drug policy reform that will hopefully be clarified during the expected Senate dogfight over his nomination .
But the record is not encouraging .
As D.C. attorney general in the 1990s , Eric Holder supported mandatory sentences of 18 months to six years for selling a range of drugs that included marijuana .
He is also on record supporting the “ broken windows ” theory of neighborhood policing most closely associated with Mayor Rudy Giuliani ’s NYPD and the conservative Manhattan Institute .
Holder ’s iron - fist drug politics find a public health counterpart in the confused mind of Obama ’s Transition Team point man on the ONDCP , Don Vereen , who as recently as November explained his opposition to medical marijuana by saying , “ [ It ] sends the wrong message to children . ”
Which takes us to the drug czar throne .
Here the rumors are worse than most would have DARE ’d imagine .
The Obama transition team has done nothing to dispel talk that Rep. Jim Ramstad , R - Minn. , is a leading candidate to run ONDCP or the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration .
In either position , Ramstad ’s nomination would make a joke of Obama ’s pledge that his policy decisions will be made “ based on facts , ” not ideology and caveman politics .
Earlier this month , hundreds of leading substance - abuse health professionals signed a letter to Obama expressing concern over Ramstad ’s opposition to evidence - based HIV / AIDS - reduction practices such as methadone and needle - exchange programs , as well as his support for arresting medical marijuana patients and failure to co-sponsor any of the three bills put forward by the last Congress to eliminate the cocaine - sentencing disparity .
But it gets worse .
As Maia Szalavitz first reported on The Huffington Post , Ramstad funneled almost a quarter of a million dollars in federal money to an abusive church - run addiction program that sees drug addiction not as a health issue requiring medication and counseling , but as a “ sin ” that needs cleansing through the acceptance of Jesus Christ as lord and savior .
Ramstad is such a Bush - league freak show that concern over his possible nomination has spilled beyond the small world of drug - policy - reform professionals .
Last week , the Boston Globe editorialized strongly against his candidacy .
Of course , it ’s possible that the views of people like Holder , Emanuel , Biden and Ramstad are no longer what they were .
But reformers are concerned that there ’s no way of knowing .
“ Because they have n’t spoken on these issues in so long , we have to go back to what they said in the ’ 90s , ” says Paul Armentano , deputy director of NORML .
“ We hope they have evolved , or that at least Obama does n’t listen to them if they have n’t .
After all , the president sets the policy . ”
Sound familiar ?
Regardless of where Obama ’s appointees stand and how much , if any , political capital he is willing to spend on drug - policy reform , the need to turn his campaign slogan into reality has never been greater .
Last week , the Justice Department released numbers showing that 1 in every 100 Americans is now in prison , and 1 in every 31 is either behind bars , on parole or on probation .
For this grotesquerie we can thank the war on drugs .
More than half of federal prisoners ( 95,000 people ) are behind bars for drug - law violations — a record .
Nationally , around half a million people are in prison on nonviolent drug charges .
The Drug Policy Alliance estimates that this is a tenfold increase since 1980 , totaling more than the entire prison population of Western Europe .
Reform advocates are realistic about the possibilities for progress in the coming years .
Everyone agrees that a radical overhaul of U.S. drug laws , including ending the prohibition of marijuana , remains years if not decades away .
But the major groups have clear goals for the first administration and are guardedly optimistic about meeting them .
The Drug Policy Alliance , the nation ’s largest drug - policy - reform advocacy group , seeks the repeal of the federal syringe - exchange - program ban and an end to racist federal cocaine sentencing laws , which continue to punish low - level crack offenders 100 times more severely than powder cocaine offenders .
“ Obama talked about his opposition to the syringe ban on the campaign trail and mentioned it again in his AIDS Day statement , ” says Bill Piper , DPA ’s director of national affairs .
“ And both Obama and Biden are strong supporters of reforming cocaine - sentencing laws .
Even if Congress does n’t pass a [ crack cocaine ] bill , the administration could instruct federal attorneys to ignore the law .
We hope he ’ll do so . ”
Another law that reform advocates hope will be ignored is the blanket federal prohibition of marijuana , which the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled trumps states ’ rights to legally grow and distribute marijuana for medical purposes .
Obama has criticized federal raids on state - sanction dispensaries as a poor use of federal resources , a popular position .
The electoral politics of medical marijuana also favor progress on this front .
“ One in four Americans now lives in a medical marijuana state , ” Aaron Houston , director of government relations at the Marijuana Policy Project , explained to Reason magazine .
“ And medical marijuana outpolled Obama in Michigan by six points .
Medical marijuana states , including Colorado , New Mexico and Nevada , were essential to Obama ’s victory , and continuing a federal war against a quarter of the country would make no sense . ”
NORML , America ’s pot-reform spearhead , will push for the establishment of a National Marijuana Commission , modeled on congressional commissions formed in 1970 and 1972 to study pot prohibition .
Both prior commissions concluded in favor of decriminalization , and activists think it is high time to throw another national spotlight on the law that last year resulted in 870,000
marijuana arrests .
“ Any serious commission today would come to same conclusion [ in favor of decriminalization ] .
We ’re willing to sit tight for a couple of years as Congress studies it , ” says NORML ’s Keith Stroup .
“ But we want high - profile hearings in the judiciary committees .
We want to get our experts up there . ”
Meanwhile , NORML will push Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , to reintroduce his decriminalization bill , HR5843 , also known as the Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act.
Co-sponsored by former presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , the bill would in effect decriminalize possession of up to an ounce .
When introduced last year , it became the first bill to take
aim at prohibition since 1982 .
Advocates may have their best ally not in the White House or in Congress , but in the economy .
As state budgets shrink across the country , legislatures are often forced to choose between education and prison budgets .
This phenomenon is most stark in California , where a budget shortfall and massive overcrowding has Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger talking about letting people go
and the legislature discussing sentencing reform .
“ During the last recession , we saw an enormous number of states enact reform , ” says DPA ’s Piper .
“ This is the silver lining of an economic downturn .
After the recession recedes , the reforms tend to stick , when the states realize they are saving money . ”
If the economy ends up being the prime mover behind drug reform under Obama and the incoming Congress , it will be better than nothing , but still a sad commentary on the Democratic Party and American democracy in general .
Polls and state ballot initiatives continue to show the public widening its lead ahead of their elected leaders on drug policy , who more often than not remain stuck in the 1980s , if not the 1920s .
While changing the law ultimately falls upon Congress , Obama could help take his party and the country into the new century by using the bully pulpit to question the premises and effects of the drug war .
If he chooses to do so , he is certainly surrounded by enough veteran drug warriors to provide political cover .
Who knows ?
If President Richard Nixon could go to China , maybe Joe Biden & Co. can help Obama make the shorter but equally historic trip down Main Street to the local head shop .

I am an occasional reader of Business Week , and each time I pick it up and read James C. Cooper 's " Business Outlook " column , I find myself frustrated .
With that said , let me lay out my argument against Cooper 's " A Real Risk of Deflation , " in the November 10th , 2008 edition of Business Week .
I feel I should point out that Mr. Cooper has a small internet footprint and a brief Google search reveals a dearth of information on the man , and nothing official .
I will however assume him to be educated and qualified insofar as the established business and economic press is concerned .
This is of import here as I believe Mr. Cooper employs arguments that ring throughout the economic establishment .
I will endeavor to show that these supposed axioms are little more than mercantilist self - interest .
I will first let Mr. Cooper speak for himself :
Deflation is an economic disease caused by a sustained drop in overall demand and falling prices that forces business to cut prices ever deeper .
Mr. Cooper likens deflation to an economic ill of the most terminal variety .
He goes on to blame this contagion for a real increase in the cost of credit , which he posits is " the opposite of what monetary policy needs to do to combat falling demand . "
The real cost of credit does increase in the event of deflation .
This however would increase the return to would - be creditors .
This increase in profit would bring more credit to the market , the lack of which , supposedly , is the monkey on the back of the flailing economy .
Mr. Cooper is confused at the most fundamental level as to the definition of deflation .
Since deflation is just part of the continuum of the money supply , i.e. , a falling money supply , it cannot be treated separately from inflation .
To quote Milton Friedman , " Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon " ( A Monetary History of the United States 1867 – 1960 ) .
This is to say that inflation ( or deflation ) is not the result of a change in prices , but rather a change in the supply of money .
The broad sustained change in prices is a result of a change in the money supply .
It is the real inflationary mechanism that Mr. Cooper alludes to when he talks about " what monetary policy needs to do . "
It is this misunderstanding between disease and symptom that seems to be the genesis of Mr. Cooper 's incorrect conclusions .
It is nearly impossible for a broad sustained drop in prices to occur while the federal government is bringing about one socialist policy after another , spending on the public 's credit to no good end and wildly expanding the money supply .
Then , how , you may ask , can we see the current sharp depression in so many prices ?
Does this not refute the tie between money supply and the inflationary continuum ?
Let us examine the graph to the right , taken from Mr. Cooper 's article , but , I should point out , not directly mentioned in the text .
From the data , it would appear that commodity prices were on a steady climb and have undergone a massive collapse .
There is a very different conclusion buried in the data that must be considered .
Based on information made available on Commodity Research Bureau 's website , here is a broader view of commodity prices :
While considering the broader context of the recent decline , I will do Mr. Cooper 's allusive data one favor and I will ignore the Nixon Shock of late 1971 .
For this reason I will use the peak of 249.9 at the end of July 1974 as my baseline .
From this point to the end of January 2006 , there was a 25 % increase in commodity prices .
Over this 31.5 year period , this is an annualized rate of 0.8 % .
In the 2.4 year period between the end of January 2006 and the peak at the end of June 2008 , there was an annualized rate of increase of 22 % !
This is hardly consistent with the preceding three decades and is not a reasonable rate of growth .
If we look at the annualized growth rate between the end of July 1974 and the end of October 2008 , after the fall in prices , the growth rate is a much more modest 1.1 % .
Based on the historical average this " corrected " growth is approaching the normal market variation .
This correction is a drop in demand , rather than a contraction of the money supply , but in the same way an overinflated balloon must pop , the demand was never sustainable from the outset .
Much of the demand in commodities as well as other assets was based on the pyramid - scheme belief that another buyer , hungrier than the last , was just around the corner .
As with all such schemes , someone finally decides they are done with the game , and the downward spiral begins .
If the scheme was built on credit or margin , the fall is all the more precipitous .
Mr. Cooper 's suggested baseline of the past few years was a heyday for business due to the free flow of credit , and thereby monetary expansion .
Businesses who received these credit - created dollars are the first in line at the monetary - expansion spigot , and the ones to feel its maximum benefit .
Their employees , creditors , and vendors receive an already - inflated , credit - created dollar , and , as each dollar moves its way through the system , its lack of value becomes apparent as the realization sets in that dollars are more numerous .
Despite the predictions offered by Mr. Cooper that the 5.5 % inflation of July 2008 will be " close to zero by early " 2009 , such a thing seems extraordinarily unlikely if viewed in the broader context of history , as opposed to the excess of the last few years .
Mr. Cooper goes on to point out that it is not just commodities that are falling in price .
A 40 % drop in the Wilshire 5000 and a 20 % drop in the S&P Case - Shiller Home Price Index from their respective peaks " are part of a broad deleveraging by financial firms and households . "
Mr. Cooper goes further : " this forced casting off of debt is fueling the sale of homes , stocks , and other securities at fire - sale prices while shutting off new lending in a self - reinforcing spiral that destroys wealth and depresses demand . "
Mr. Cooper 's assertion that a reduction in debt is fueling sell - offs is enigmatic at a minimum .
A reduction in debt would seem to give the consumer and businessman greater room to increase demand based on savings ( real wealth ) or room for additional credit .
This does not match reality because these consumers and businessman have overstretched their credit capacity and their gambles ( " investments " ) have not paid off , leaving them to sell their now greatly devalued assets to cover their debts .
Mr. Cooper is under the painfully common misconception that the ability to acquire is the ability to afford .
Credit is not wealth : it is at best someone else 's wealth .
At worst , credit is purely fabricated currency .
You would not suggest giving a teen who has just maxed out their first credit card more credit so they could somehow spend their way out of the financial hole they have made , nor will this approach work for a business or a nation .
The delusion and mysticism that is called upon by the business and economic establishment have obscured the fact that the economic realities of your own homes are not fundamentally different from those of a business or nation .
If you are unable to pay your debts , you are insolvent .
In some cases , credit can help you bridge a " low " time .
If , however , this credit only increases debt you still cannot afford , then the inevitable has merely been postponed .
$ 19 $ 15 " As long as our central government has the ability to dole out these favors , there will be special interests lining up to receive them . "
The same mistakes that were made during the Great Depression are being made now .
The call to prop up prices will grow to a din as the self - interests of businesses push themselves on the Federal Reserve and Treasury .
This desire for price controls is no different from the mercantilist policies of colonial Britain , which forced the British populace to pay the higher prices of British producers , to the boon of the businesses and the pain of the populace .
Talk of today's " illiquid " assets is just a resistance by the owners of those assets to sell them at the market - clearing price .
I assure you , I 'll buy a mortgage for one dollar !
The business and economics establishment will soon call for a new New Deal , and all the socialist policies of FDR will be dusted off and respun to the unwitting public , and the years that follow will be ones of pain , high prices , and a real fall in the standard of living .
As long as our central government has the ability to dole out these favors , there will be special interests lining up to receive them .
James C. Cooper has no reason to doubt the value of his opinions to a businesscentric audience .
This does not , however , make his views any more just or valid .
In so long as these mouthpieces for special interests maintain a stranglehold on mass media , we will all pay the unfortunate price .
Bush shoe - thrower ' too injured ' to appear in court , brother says RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday December 17 , 2008
Print This Email This BAGHDAD 
The Iraqi journalist who became an instant media star for hurling his shoes at US President George W. Bush appeared on Wednesday before a judge investigating the incident .
Muntazer al - Zaidi , 29 , a television reporter who relatives and colleagues said acted because he " detested " Bush and America , was brought before the judge in the high - security Green Zone in the heart of Baghdad , his brother , Dhargham , said .
Al - Zaidi appeared before the judge in his jail cell " because he is too injured to appear in a courtroom , " Australia 's Herald Sun quotes the brother as saying .
" The al - Zaidi family went to Baghdad 's Central Criminal Court expecting to attend a hearing , " reports the paper .
The brother said " the family was told that the investigative judge went to see [ Muntazer ] al - Zaidi in jail , and to return in eight days , " which Dhargham took to mean that his brother " was severely beaten and they fear that his appearance could trigger anger at the court . "
But Iraqi officials and another brother deny that the journalist suffered severe injuries after being wrestled to the floor after the incident , the Herald Sun says .
Under Iraqi law , Zaidi risks up to seven years in jail for " offending the head of a foreign state . "
Lead lawyer Dhiya al - Saadi said he had yet to see his client but that he would apply for permission to see him on Thursday and would also lodge a bail request .
" Tomorrow we will submit two requests -- first , to be able to meet Muntazer al - Zaidi for enough time to assess his state of health and prepare his defence , and second for him to be granted bail on condition that he answer any summons to appear before the judge , " Saadi told AFP .
The lawyer , who heads Iraq 's bar association , said he saw no reason for the bail application to be refused .
" The investigation is virtually complete and there is no risk of his absconding , " he said .
He said he had been able to examine the minutes of the police investigation into Zaidi 's protest since receiving his power of attorney earlier in the day .
Durgham said on Tuesday that his brother had been taken to the US - run Ibn Sina hospital in the Green Zone after being beaten by security guards and suffering a broken arm and ribs , as well as injuries to an eye and a leg .
He was unable to say whether Muntazer had sustained the injuries while being overpowered during Sunday 's protest or after his arrest , and there was no immediate information about the journalist 's condition on Wednesday .
Zaidi grabbed the world spotlight when he threw his shoes at Bush during a press conference and called him a dog during a farewell visit to Iraq by the US leader who ordered the invasion of the country in 2003 .
Bush ducked both shoes while Zaidi , who works for private Iraqi television station Al - Baghdadia , was wrestled to the ground by guards after his action , regarded as the supreme mark of disrespect in the Muslim world .
To avoid a repeat of the drama , tight security measures were introduced at a press conference on Wednesday between Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki and his counterpart Gordon Brown of Britain -- Washington 's top ally in the war .
Extra security guards were brought in to monitor journalists , and anyone not appearing on a list of accredited reporters was barred , although no one was asked to remove their footwear .
Later , addressing British troops , he quipped : " I was going to say before I spoke that you should take off your shoes . "
The White House said on Tuesday it was for Iraqi leaders to decide whether to punish Zaidi , who relatives said had been arrested at the beginning of the year by US forces and was once kidnapped by militants and held for days .
" I think the president believes that Iraq is a sovereign country , a democratic country , and they will have a process that they follow on this , " spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
" The president harbours no hard feelings about the incident .
We 've really moved on . "
Perino , who herself was sporting a bruise on her face from the shoe throwing , sought to downplay the incident .
" I do n't think that you can take one guy throwing his shoe as representative of the people of Iraq , " she said .
Zaidi's action won him widespread plaudits in the Arab world where Bush 's policies in Iraq as well as the broader Middle East and the US - led " war on terror " have drawn deep hostility .
Iraqi reaction was mixed , however , with some considering the attack against a visiting head of state reflected badly on the country , while others considered it the ideal parting gift for an unpopular president .
With wire services .
NAGOYA , Japan ( Reuters ) - Toyota Motor Corp forecast a first - ever annual operating loss , blaming a relentless sales slide and a crippling rise in the yen in what it said was an emergency unprecedented in its 70 - year history .
Toyota , the world ’s biggest automaker , had been expected to issue its second profit warning in less than seven weeks after domestic rival Honda Motor
Co also cut its outlook again last week , but the downward revision was bigger than predicted .
“ This is very , very , very bad , ” said Koichi Ogawa , chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments .
“ There ’s a chance they could fall into the red in the next business year as well .
“ This is also not just a problem for Toyota .
What is good for Toyota is good for the Japanese economy . ”
Automakers around the world face their toughest business environment in recent memory , caught in a sharp reversal of demand as the financial crisis spreads , squeezing credit and consumer sentiment .
Toyota cut its group operating forecast to a loss of 150 billion yen ( $ 1.7 billion ) for the year to end - March , after shocking financial markets last month by slashing its group operating profit forecast by 1 trillion yen to 600 billion yen .
It made a record profit of 2.27 trillion yen last year .
Analyst forecasts on Reuters Estimates ranged from a loss of 150 billion yen to a profit of 800 billion yen for figures not updated since conditions deteriorated in the past month .
Toyota now expects group net profit of 50 billion yen instead of 550 billion yen .
Toyota shares closed down 0.2 percent ahead of the announcement in a firmer Tokyo market .
Its Frankfurt - listed shares fell 2.4 percent in light trade .
BIG STEP BACK
Like the rest of the industry , Toyota has idled factories , slowed assembly lines and delayed manufacturing projects , such as the start of a Mississippi plant under construction to build the Prius hybrid model , and said it would continue those moves until the tide turned .
“ We are facing an unprecedented emergency , ” President Katsuaki Watanabe told a year - end news conference .
“ This is a crisis unlike the crises of the past . ”
Toyota will postpone all projects to expand capacity , move 16 of its 75 global assembly lines to a single shift , and cancel directors ’ bonus payments for this year , among a wide range of steps aimed at improving near - term profitability , he said .
Even the electric hand dryers at the company ’s Nagoya office building have been unplugged in an effort to cut costs .
Watanabe stopped short of projecting what global car sales and earnings would do next year , saying only that Toyota hoped to return to profit and cut capital spending to below 1 trillion yen next year , compared with the 1.4 trillion yen planned this year .
“ Conditions next fiscal year could be more severe given the yen ’s strength and worsening market conditions , unless the company and the government cope flexibly with external factors , ” Shotaro Noguchi , auto analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities , said .

Toyota lowered its dollar assumption for the remainder of the year to 90 yen and its euro assumption to 120 yen , versus current rates of 90 yen and 126 yen .
Honda made a similar move last week , cutting its annual profit forecast by 67 percent , and outlined a list of counter - measures such as putting off non-urgent investments to prop up its profitability .
In the United States , automakers are in even bigger trouble , with President George W. Bush throwing General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC a lifeline of up to $ 17.4 billion to stave off bankruptcy .
India ’s Tata Motors
Ltd has agreed to inject “ tens of millions ” of pounds into Jaguar Land Rover to prevent an immediate cash flow crisis , the Financial Times reported .

Elsewhere , Japanese small - car makers Suzuki Motor Corp and Daihatsu Motor
Co announced more production cuts , of 29,000 units and 16,000 units , respectively , by the end of March , along with a reduction of non-permanent workers .
Germany ’s BMW was also considering further production cuts , an executive said .
Bridgestone Corp , Japan ’s largest tire maker , on Monday cut its operating profit forecast for 2008 by 24 percent to 118 billion yen on slower tire demand for new cars and replacement purposes .
Its French rival Michelin said it faced costs of nearly 150 million euros ( $ 209 million ) as it cuts back operations to cope with a decline in tire demand .
MUM ON DIVIDEND
Departing from past practice , Toyota did not disclose its sales and production forecasts for the coming calendar year , saying it was impossible to predict where the bottom for the global vehicle market lay .
“ We need to be prepared for the tough conditions to continue , and maybe even worsen , ” Watanabe said .
He said Toyota was undecided about what to do with its dividend , which rose to a record 140 yen last year and is widely feared to fall .
For 2008 , Toyota estimated group - wide global sales , which include sales at units Daihatsu and Hino Motors Ltd , at 8.96 million vehicles , down 4 percent from last year .
For the business year to March 31 , Toyota lowered its vehicle sales forecast to 7.54 million vehicles from 8.24 million .
It sold 8.913 million vehicles last business year .

University of Minnesota anthropology professor Kieran McNulty ( along with colleague Karen Baab of Stony Brook University in New York ) has made an important contribution toward solving one of the greatest paleoanthropological mysteries in recent history -- that fossilized skeletons resembling a mythical " hobbit " creature represent an entirely new species in humanity 's evolutionary chain .
Discovered on the Indonesian island of Flores in 2003 , controversy has surrounded the fossilized hominid skeletons of the so - called " hobbit people , " or Homo floresiensis ever since .
Experts are still debating whether the 18,000 - year - old remains merely belong to a diminutive population of modern - day humans ( with one individual exhibiting " microcephaly , " an abnormally small head ) or represent a previously unrecognized branch in humanity 's family tree .
Using 3D modeling methods , McNulty and his fellow researchers compared the cranial features of this real - life " hobbit " to those of a simulated fossil human ( of similar stature ) to determine whether or not such a species was distinct from modern humans .
" [ Homo floresiensis ] is the most exciting discovery in probably the last 50 years , " said McNulty .
" The specimens have skulls that resemble something that died a million years earlier , and other body parts reminiscent of our three - million - year - old human ancestors , yet they lived until very recently -- contemporaries with modern humans . "
Comparing the simulation to the original Flores skull discovered in 2003 , McNulty and Baab were able to demonstrate conclusively that the original " hobbit " skull fits the expectations for a small fossil hominin species and not a modern human .
Their study was published online this month in the Journal of Human Evolution .
The cranial structure of the fossilized skull , says the study , clearly places it in humanity 's genus Homo , even though it would be smaller in both body and brain size than any other member .
The results of the study suggest that the theorized " hobbit " species may have undergone a process of size reduction after branching off from Homo erectus ( one of modern day humanity 's distant ancestors ) or even something more primitive .
" We have shown with this study that the process of size reduction applied to fossil hominins accounts for many features seen in the fossil skull from Flores , " McNulty said .
" It becomes much more difficult , therefore , to defend the hypothesis that the preserved skull is a modern human who simply suffered from an extremely rare disorder .
Public interest in the discovery , analysis and implications of Flores " hobbits " has been high ever since 2003 , inspiring several television specials ( including a recent episode of " NOVA " entitled " Alien From Earth " ) and other media attention .
While the debate over Homo floresiensis will continue , McNulty believes this comprehensive analysis of the relationship between size and shape in human evolution is a critical step toward eventually understanding the place of the Flores " hobbits " in human evolutionary history .
" I think the majority of researchers favor recognizing this as a new species , " McNulty said about the categorization of Homo floresiensis .
" The evidence is becoming overwhelming , and this study helps confirm that view . "
A hot pizza can be quite a handful
A Florida pizza delivery man who was challenged by armed robbers in the city of Miramar got in first with his own weapon - a large pepperoni pizza .
Eric Lopez Devictoria , 40 , flung the piping hot pizza at the gunman , then turned on his heels and ran .
He made a safe getaway , according to the Florida Sun-Sentinel , despite one shot being fired as he fled .
Police later arrested three teenage suspects , who have been charged with armed robbery .
This scantily - dressed Londoner is the latest victim of unwanted fame that Google Street View can bring you as you go about your daily business .
The image has reignited the debate over the legitimacy of Street View - a topic we looked at in December .
The image , taken at 108 Queensway , Paddington , England , United Kingdom , has already received 5982 diggs , provoking comments like " Google , always keeping abreast of new technology " and " Google Baps " .
Google Street View has not been well received in the UK , with concerns over privacy rights leading to various incidents ( one Street View car was blocked from entering a village , another was attacked by local residents ) .
Our Observers looked at this subject a few months ago .
Here 's the post :
Beware of tripping over , sunbathing topless , cheating on your partner in public ... - if there 's a Google van passing by , the evidence will be forever set in a 360 - degree photographic panorama and posted online for all to see .
Google 's ever - increasing mapping applications are getting ever - increasingly closer to our personal lives .
Suspicious minds wo n't need to bother with private detectives - they can simply log on to Google Maps and access the pedestrian - level view of the entire city - if they 're lucky enough to live in Milan , Paris , or the majority of the US , New Zealand , Australia or Japan ...
Otherwise , not long to wait : Google Street View is soon to arrive in the UK and looks set to pan the entire world .
So far the application has been received warmly , and perceived as a meeting , directions and house hunting tool .
There are even activities like scavenger hunts set up for those who find Street View more aesthetically - pleasing than real life .
However , as the data collector travels further afield and more " Street View Tourists " find themselves online - not necessarily doing something they 're proud of - Google has found itself under fire for privacy concerns .
In Japan , a group of lawyers have set themselves up under the name " The Campaign Against Surveillance Society " , just weeks after the application was rolled out there .
And in the UK , there 's already an anti Street View project going , before the programme has even been launched .
If you have been following my blog for the past year , then you are familiar with my controversial narrative of the US anime market and how it reached its breaking point a few months ago .
The giants of the industry formed their mighty empire after Toonami and Adult Swim brought in a new American audience around the turn of the century .
The fans needing something more than just Dragonball Z and Cowboy Bebop to handle their anime craving began to head out to their local Best Buy and spend their hard earned cash on new DVDs .
With this expanding new market demanding more series , the American distributors bought into any new series that Japan was producing at the time and began adapting them for the US audience .
But during this time , broadband internet connection became available to more households through out the country .
With this new development , it was no longer TV that provided the gateway to new American otaku , it was illegal downloading and streaming video websites .
The audience brought in from the internet were not going out to Best Buy to buy anime DVDs .
Why would they if they could just download it all for free ?
And as older fans discovered the ease and availability of fansubbing , they also stopped buying DVDs .
This meant that all those series that the giants have been working on following that big rush were now just sitting on the store shelves going unsold .
The anime DVD market was dead , and it died at the hands of the internet fansub monster .
Although fandom continued to grow through the years , profits began to shrink and wither away into nothingness .
We saw the first causalities of this when the giant Geneon fell around a year ago , and again when ADV fell to pieces only a few months after that .
So instead of trying to squeeze water out of this dried up sponge , I have written many essays on how the Japanese needed to adapt into the digital space created by illegal file sharing .
And as the economy and general outlook of the industry became far more gloomy as the months passed , it has become obvious that they had better do it soon .
Otherwise , we were going to see many more causalities in the near future .
However , despite what appears to be all too painfully obvious to the Americans , the Japanese seem to be completely oblivious to the fansub monster .
I faced this fact head on with an interview I had at Otakon last summer .
Chiyako Tasai of Kadokawa Entertainment gave a presentation at the convention on new anime properties that were still in the process of obtaining a US distributor .
I was working on a piece about the importance of the American anime market to the Japanese , and I thought she would give me the best insight on the subject from the Japanese point - of - view .
After her panel , I stopped her , handed her my business card , explained that I was writing an article on the negative effects of the internet to the business , and asked if I could talk to her about the subject .
She agreed to the interview , and we moved out into the hallway of the convention to talk .
“ Now , can I ask you something ? ” she asks after I had finished my questions .
“ Just how bad is download problem ? ”
Much to my surprise , this had just become a two - way interview .
Ms. Tasai was a little surprised with the audience ’s reaction to her panel .
She was expecting to be introducing the American fans to these new shows for the first time .
After all , shows like Spice and Wolf and H20 – Footprints in the Sand were only available in Japan at the time , so how could the Americans already know about it ?
When she realized that the audience was not shocked and awed , she asked , “ How do you know about this already ? ”
When someone sheepishly admitted that is was because of downloading , she let out a very disappointing , “ oh … ”
After telling her that I reported on just such things , I became her top expert into the situation .
This was a role I ’ve always wanted to play , so I proudly said to her all the things I ’ve been saying on this site for years .
How bad was the download problem ?
Well , from my point - of - view , it was killing the industry , so I ’d call that pretty freaking bad .
“ But , like , how many fans do it ?
One percent ?
Five percent ? ”
Well let ’s see .
I used to do it .
All my friends still do it .
All my peers in the blogging world do it .
And looking around that crowded hallway at Otakon , I could see every single one of them just causally downloading anime off of the internet for free .
So I gave her my conservative estimate – at least 90 % .
“ Ninety percent ? ! ? ” she gasps in disbelief , “ But is n’t downloading difficult to do ? ! ? ”
It was dead simple , and I explained to her the complete process .
Just download a bittorrent client once and go onto a website like AnimeSuki.com to start downloading .
It was much easier than buying a DVD .
Ms. Tasai was not happy over this news , and I told her that if they wanted to fix the download problem , the Japanese had to take matters into their own hands .
No matter how quickly an American company tries to release a show over here , the moment that show first airs on Japanese TV , the whole world will be watching it within 24 hours .
We talked a little about what Gonzo had starting doing , and how I found it to be very successful .
Simply put , if the Japanese wanted to end the fansubbing , then they would have to put the show online themselves as soon as it is broadcast on Japanese TV .
And if they wanted to monetize off of that critical initial viewing , they should probably put it on an ad- supported video website .
“ Oh , so like on Crunchyroll , ” she suggested .
And she broke my heart with that statement .
Crunchyroll was a video streaming website that specialized in fansubbing and anime piracy .
After the site was granted a huge amount of venture funding last March , it created a huge uproar from the industry .
How did a site actually manage to get a shitload of cash for harboring anime piracy ?
But the scumbags running the site claimed that they were going to use the money to establish legit deals with anime companies .
But the “ legit ” deals that came shortly thereafter were nothing more then signs of desperation from those affected by the fansub monster .
When ADV had run out of funds to continue production on their Welcome to the NHK property , they had to strike a deal with Crunchyroll .
In exchange for the some of that investor cash , ADV would allow the website to show NHK along with their pirated videos .
The website would then be able to show this off as proof that , “ No , really everyone , we ’re legit now , we swear it ! ”
The day after the deal , the ADV staff went back to work on NHK and finished it , only to have the title taken away from them a few weeks later .
It was just recently released on DVD by FUNimation .
Toei Animation embarrassed themselves when they entered the US market a few years ago .
A combination of poorly produced DVDs and the outcome of the fansub monster meant that this company was dead on arrival to the market .
After years of sitting on their properties and not selling any DVDs , they took Crunchyroll ’s dirty money and put their titles on the service .
And Media Blasters also took up Crunchyroll ’s offer , but then again , they will sell to anyone for a quick buck .
From my point - of - view , Crunchyroll was n’t “ legitimizing ” anything .
They throw around dirty money to companies in dire need of it , and the anime studios would whore themselves for it .
It was n’t progress , it was exploitation .
The big three anime companies not hurting for cash – FUNimation , Viz , and Bandai – made it very clear that they would never deal with a website the promoted piracy like this .
So I explained to Ms. Tasai how much I hated Crunchyroll , and that as long as they continued to allow piracy on their website , I would n’t watch any legal content on it .
“ You should put it on something like Crunchyroll , but make sure the site only has 100 % legit content . ”
I met up with Ms. Tasai at the New York Anime Festival a few months later , and she told me that she had posted my comments and suggestions on a Japanese language website specifically for the Japanese anime industry .
Kadokawa did n’t have any panels at the NYAF that weekend , so I have a feeling that Ms. Tasai was there to get a better understanding on the American anime market and report it back to Japan .
Finally , awareness was being raised about the fansub monster over in the land of the raising sun .
And within a couple of months , the Japanese began to reclaim the internet .
I ’ve talked about how FUNimation is making progress with online distribution this season , but that did n’t compare to the news of what ’s about to come for the winter season .
TV Tokyo is taking control of the most pirated anime show out there , Naruto Shippuden .
Similar to what Gonzo had done , Tokyo TV will post subtitled episodes of Naruto just hours after its Japanese TV broadcast onto Crunchyroll .
In exchange , Crunchyroll agreed to remove all their pirated video and only provide legit material .
Let me repeat that –
TV Tokyo forced Crunchyroll to go 100 % legit !
No more settling for “ it ’s better than nothing ” when dealing with the piracy site .
The Japanese made their own demands to the website , and the douchebags were willing turned their back to their existing user base and caved in to the good guys .
So they ’re making the most popular anime series available legally on the internet from the get - go , and they ’re forcing one of the most popular hubs of anime piracy to go completely legit ?
This is n’t a drill , my readers .
The digital revolution has begun .
Japan is finally stepping up and reclaiming the internet , and one - by - one , the dominoes are about to fall into place in the quest to make piracy obsolete .
We ’re already seeing Bandai taking the initial steps for simultaneous releases in just the past week , and more studios will continue to jump onto this bandwagon within the upcoming months .
Not that this should come as a surprise to anyone .
After all , with the anime DVD market breathing its final breath , what other choice is there other than facing the fansub monster head - on ?
I just wish they would have come to that conclusion a little sooner than this .

A federal judge has dismissed part of a lawsuit filed by two activists who said their rights were violated by White House officials and volunteers when they were removed from a 2005 visit to Lowry by President Bush .
U.S. District Court Chief Judge Wiley Daniel ruled that Leslie Weise and Alex Young had no constitutional right to be present at Wings Over the Rockies Air & Space Museum because it was a “ limited private forum or limited nonpublic forum . ”
“ President Bush had the right , at his own speech , to ensure that only his message was conveyed , ” Daniel wrote .
“ When the president speaks , he may choose his own words . ”
Daniel ’s order dismisses the case filed against three volunteers and White House officials .
Motions are pending from two of the other defendants .
Weise and Young were among three people , referred to as the “ Denver Three , ” removed from the museum before Bush started speaking .
They had obtained tickets for the taxpayer - financed event from a local congressional office , but when they pulled into the parking lot in a car bearing the bumper sticker “ No More Blood For Oil , ” they were pegged as potential troublemakers by White House staff .
The White House has a policy of excluding troublemakers — even potential troublemakers — from appearances by Bush .
Daniel ruled that previous courts had allowed a restriction of speech at presidential events .
No doubt about it : the Chevy Volt looks like it will be one sweet ride ( even the not - so - sporty production vehicle ) .
But a group of electric vehicle enthusiasts here in the St. Louis area is n’t willing to wait for the hybrid Volt ’s 2010 roll - out … so they ’ve built their own fully electric vehicles .
[ social_buttons ]
Today ’s Post - Dispatch features the Gateway Electric Vehicle Club , and a few of the EVs that members have built themselves .
Retired college professor Charlton Jones ( pictured above ) bought a ’ 74 Porsche 914 on Ebay , and with a little elbow grease and money ( OK , a lot of money — $ 19,000 ) converted into a fully electric vehicle .
On the Illinois side of the river , Ron Erb converted a ’ 96 Ford Ranger to an EV ( for a mere $ 7,500 ) .
Erb was able to offset some of his costs with a $ 4000 state tax rebate ( unfortunately , we do n’t have that in Missouri… ) .
Granted , neither of these vehicles are muscle cars : Jones ’
Porsche takes a minute to get up to 60 mph , and Erb claims his Ranger can “ go 80 … but not very far . ”
And each requires significant charging time : 7 hours for the Ranger so it can go 35 miles .
The cost for that recharge is hard to beat , though : 98 cents .
Both EVers cite the time frame for the release of the Chevy Volt as motivations for building their vehicles ; I ’ve got a hunch that both of these guys were really driven by the opportunity to create something themselves , though .
Erb , for instance , noted how he and his son had turned the conversion into a father - son project .
While some will point out to the various drawbacks , each vehicle can serve as commuter cars with little change in lifestyle ( Erb ’s wife drives the truck to work each day — a 12 - mile round trip ) .
In each case , they ’ve built vehicles that serve their actual driving needs … rather than those rare situations that suddenly become so important to most of us when we ’re car shopping ( how often do you really need 4 - wheel drive , or 451 horses ? ) .
I ’m not trying to create guilt here ; rather , just noting how our motivations for our vehicle purchases tend to involve issues beyond our actual transportation routines .
In the case of Jones and Erb , when they focused on the driving they do , they found an EV suited them nicely .
Creating a car is n’t an option for everyone … but it ’s inspiring to see ordinary folks doing just that .
I ’ll definitely put the Gateway Electric Vehicles Club on the “ must - vist ” list .

Audi motorsport boss Wolfgang Ullrich has confirmed that the manufacturer will not attempt to defend its Le Mans Series title next season with the new R15 TDi .
Alexandre Premat and Mike Rockenfeller won the LMS title this year in an Audi R10 , but Ullrich says in this week 's Autosport that the decision not to return was made to save money .
" We will not participate in the LMS , " he said .
" We all have to face that the economy is moving and everyone has to put something into their pocket to save money .
" The LMS has grown quite significantly but you have to face the fact that to make the best out of less money , there is no choice but to cut parts of the programme . "
The Le Mans 24 Hours is , so far , the only confirmed outing for the R15 beyond the American Le Mans Series season - opener , the Sebring 12 Hours , in March .
But Ullrich says a decision about a tenth consecutive full ALMS campaign is still to be made .
" We are still in discussion about the American programme , " he said .
" There has to be a board decision to do it , but we are all working on it very hard . "
Audi stalwarts Emanuele Pirro and Frank Biela , who have five Le Mans wins each with the marque , are likely to race Audis again next year despite not having their contracts renewed this season .
Both are expected to race the new R8 GT3 car for teams in Europe .
Mr Medvedev took over from Mr Putin earlier this year
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has sent to parliament a bill that extends the presidential term to six years from the current four , the Kremlin says .
Mr Medvedev said last week the measure would give more time for the head of state to push through reforms .
He did not say if he wanted to extend his own term or that of his successor .
There has been speculation that Mr Medvedev is a stop - gap so that his predecessor Vladimir Putin can return to his job .
Mr Putin - who is currently serving as Russia 's prime minister - has served the maximum two consecutive terms , stepping down in May .
When you hear the term " domestic extremist " , whom do you picture ?
How about someone like Dr Peter Harbour ?
A retired physicist and university lecturer , he worked on the nuclear fusion reactor run by European governments at Culham in Oxfordshire ; he 's 70 next year , and has never been tried or convicted of an offence , except the odd speeding ticket ; and he has never failed a security check .
Not the sort of person you had in mind ?
Then you do n't work for the police .
Dr Harbour was one of the people who campaigned to save a local beauty spot - Thrupp Lake - between the Oxfordshire villages of Radley and Abingdon .
They used to walk and swim and picnic there , and watch otters and kingfishers .
However , RWE npower , which owns the nearby power station at Didcot , wants to empty the lake and fill it with pulverised fly ash .
The villagers have marched , demonstrated , and sent in letters and petitions .
Some people tried to stop the company from cutting down trees by standing in the way .
Their campaign was entirely peaceful .
But the power company discovered that it was legally empowered to shut the protests down .
Using the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 , it obtained an injunction against the villagers and anyone else who might protest .
This forbids them from " coming to , remaining on , trespassing or conducting any demonstrations , or protesting or other activities " on land near the lake .
If anyone breaks this injunction they could spend five years in prison .
The act , parliament was told , was meant to protect women from stalkers .
But as soon as it came on to the statute books , it was used to stop peaceful protest .
To obtain an injunction , a company needs to show only that someone feels " alarmed or distressed " by the protesters , a requirement so vague that it can mean almost anything .
Was this an accident of sloppy drafting ?
No. Timothy Lawson - Cruttenden , the solicitor who specialises in using this law against protesters , boasts that his company " assisted in the drafting of the ... Protection from Harassment Act 1997 " .
In 2005 parliament was duped again , when a new clause , undebated in either chamber , was slipped into the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act .
It peps up the 1997 act , which can now be used to ban protest of any kind .
Mr Lawson - Cruttenden , who represented RWE npower , brags that the purpose of obtaining injunctions under the act is " the criminalisation of civil disobedience " .
One advantage of this approach is that very low standards of proof are required : " hearsay evidence ... is admissable in civil courts " .
The injunctions he obtains criminalise all further activity , even though , as he admits , " any allegations made remain untested and unproven " .
Last week , stung by bad publicity , npower backed down .
The villagers had just started to celebrate when they made a shocking discovery : they now feature on an official list of domestic extremists .
The National Extremism Tactical Co-ordination Unit ( Netcu ) is the police team directing the fight against extremists .
To illustrate the threats it confronts , the Netcu site carries images of people marching with banners , of peace campaigners standing outside a military base , and of the Rebel Clown Army ( whose members dress up as clowns to show that they have peaceful intentions ) .
It publishes press releases about Greenpeace and the climate camp at Kingsnorth , in Kent .
All this , the site suggests , is domestic extremism .
Netcu publishes a manual for policing protests .
To help identify dangerous elements , it directs officers to a list of " high court injunctions that relate to domestic extremism campaigns " , published on Netcu 's website .
On the first page is the injunction obtained by npower against the Radley villagers , which names Peter Harbour and others .
Dr Harbour wrote to the head of Netcu , Steve Pearl , to ask for his name to be removed from the site .
Mr Pearl refused .
So Dr Harbour remains a domestic extremist .
It was this Paranoia Squad that briefed the Observer last month about " eco-terrorists " .
The article maintained that " a lone maverick eco- extremist may attempt a terrorist attack aimed at killing large numbers of Britons " .
The only evidence it put forward was that someone in Earth First ! had stated that the world was overpopulated .
This , it claimed , meant that the movement might attempt a campaign of annihilation .
The same could be said about the UN , the Optimum Population Trust , and anyone else who has expressed concern about population levels .
The Observer withdrew the article after Netcu failed to provide any justification for its claims .
Netcu now tells me that the report " was n't an accurate reflection of our views " .
But the article contained a clue as to why the police might wish to spread such stories :
" The rise of eco-extremism coincides with the fall of the animal rights activist movement .
Police said the animal rights movement was in disarray ... its critical mass of hardcore extremists was sufficiently depleted to have halted its effectiveness . "
If , as the police maintain , animal rights extremism is no longer dangerous , it is hard for Netcu to justify its own existence - unless it can demonstrate that domestic extremism exists elsewhere .
A better headline for the article might have been : " Keep funding us , say police , or civilisation collapses " .
Netcu claims that domestic extremism " is most often associated with single - issue protests , such as animal rights , anti-war , anti-globalisation and anti-GM crops " .
With the exception of animal rights protests , these campaigns in the UK have been overwhelmingly peaceful .
As the writer and activist Merrick Godhaven points out , the groups whose tactics come closest to those of violent animal rights activists are anti-abortion campaigns .
The UK Life League , for example , has published the names and addresses of people involved in abortion and family planning .
Two of its members have been convicted of sending pictures of mutilated foetuses to doctors and pharmacies .
Anti-abortionists in the US have murdered doctors , nurses and receptionists .
Yet there is no mention of the UK Life League or anti-abortion campaigning on the Netcu site .
This looks to me like partisan policing .
Just as the misleading claims of the security services were used to launch an illegal and unnecessary war against Iraq , Netcu 's exaggerations will be used to justify the heavy - handed treatment of peaceful protesters .
In both cases police and spies are distracted from dealing with genuine threats of terrorism and violence .
For how much longer will the government permit the police forces to drum up business like this ?
And at what point do we decide that this country is beginning to look like a police state ?

Crash in Food Supply
“ In my own case , the Depression brought a strange result , ” writes Eddie Cantor in 1931 .
“ Before the crash , I had a million dollars , a house , three cars and four daughters .
Now all I ’ve got left is five daughters . ”
Eddie Cantor ( 1892 - 1964 ) was a comedian , singer , songwriter and actor .
“ Banjo Eyes , ” as he was sometimes called , was also the author of two little books on the Great Depression .
“ People used to rob banks , ” he writes in Yoo - Hoo Prosperity .
“ Now we ’re lucky when it is n’t vice versa . ”
Cantor jokes about many troubles in the Great Depression , but one recurring theme is the relative lack of food .
A millionaire is “ one who eats three square meals a day . ”
Things were so bad that “ the pigeons are now feeding the people . ”
They were funny lines … sort of .
For many of the people living during those times , Cantor ’s jokes were not so far from the truth .
We have it comparatively easy in this , the crisis of 2008 .
We may have to make do with fewer Swatch watches and Coach handbags .
We may have to pass on the latest iPod and make do with last year ’s winter coat .
These hardships are not important , except for people selling those goods .
But the credit crisis is also affecting the world ’s ability to produce one thing important to everyone : food .
It ’s harder for farmers to get credit for next season ’s crop , especially farmers overseas .
They need fertilizer , seed , fuel and more .
And most farmers need to borrow money to obtain these essential items .
No credit ; no crops .
Therefore , the global credit squeeze might reduce plantings of key grains , even as world inventories of these grains hover near historic lows .
In Russia , for example , cash - starved banks have cut off funding for the industry .
The head of the Russian Grain Union says , “ Many farmers probably wo n’t be able to borrow money for the spring sowing . ”
This is important because Russia is no lightweight in the grain division .
It produces 9 % of the world ’s wheat , for instance .
No surprise that the United Nations considers Russia a critical component of the global food supply .
Ironically , Russia just had its best harvest ever .
And still , global grain inventories remain low .
Bloomberg reports that global inventories of corn , wheat and soybeans are the second lowest they ’ve ever been since 1974 .
A number of countries already fear what might happen next year .
The Washington Post Foreign Service in Shanghai reports that China adopted a number of measures to protect itself from the worsening food crisis : “ Among the most extreme measures [ China ] took was to impose new export taxes to keep critical supplies such as grains and fertilizers from leaving the country . ”
These taxes are extremely high , on the order of 150 % - 185 % .
China worries that richer countries may outbid its own farmers for supplies and weaken China ’s own food supply .
One Chinese fertilizer company , which produces 150,000 tons per year , already said that the new taxes mean exporting is no longer profitable .
China was the biggest exporter of certain types of fertilizer .
No longer .
That ’s a lot of supply off the market .
Fertilizers are absolutely critical in maintaining ( and improving ) crop yields .
Without them , we ’d produce far less per acre .
As a result , in parts of Africa where people depend on Chinese fertilizers , the food supply problem is now more acute .
China ’s export taxes and bans follow those of other grain producers , including the Ukraine , India , Pakistan and Argentina .
Amazingly , despite these various maneuvers around the world to prevent grain exports , the prices for wheat , corn and soybeans are all half of their mid-summer highs .
It seems the market believes a global recession will dampen demand .
Maybe so , or maybe the market does n’t know anything .
The severe commodity selloff during the last few weeks might be saying a lot more about the desperation of hedge fund managers to raise cash than about the prospect that grain demand will fall – in which case , we could see another surge in prices next year .
Demand for grains is still very strong .
In China , each wage - earner devotes about 40 cents of every dollar earned to buying food .
In India , that number is a staggering 70 cents out of every dollar earned .
In other words , the food budget in these countries is hardly a discretionary item .
It will remain constant , or even rise , no matter what the global economy does .
Meanwhile , the people in these countries who have a couple of extra rupees to toss around are upping their consumption of meats , which increases the per capita demand for grains .
As PotashCorp chief William Doyle recently pointed out : “ The average daily protein intake in China has increased by 40 % over a 20 - year period , with the greatest percentage of that increase coming from meat consumption . ”
You can see it in the size of the people themselves :
The average 6 - year - old Chinese boy is 12 pounds heavier and 2 inches taller than 30 years ago .
These people are n’t going back to the ways thing were .
This is a long - term story , and these trends should continue .
Yet even if demand growth for grains slows , it ’s not likely that those low global grain inventories will improve .
Even if grain demand fell to 2 % per year , we ’d still need record production to keep grain inventories from falling further .
For all these reasons , I think the future is still bright for agriculture and all that it entails .
I think the fertilizer companies look cheap again .
In my monthly newsletter , Capital & Crisis , my subscribers owned Agrium ( NYSE : AGU ) for nearly three years , and it more than tripled our money .
The stock is now a good one - third below what we bought it for initially .
PotashCorp ( NYSE : POT ) and Mosaic ( NYSE : MOS ) are other names I ’m looking at hard right now – both have been crushed in this troubled market .
Beyond that , irrigation companies have come way down , even after posting outstanding results .
Lindsay ( NYSE : LNN ) and Valmont ( NYSE : VMI ) are two irrigation equipment makers , for example , both coming off great quarterly results .
In 1931 , Eddie Cantor wrote that the biggest thing in years was bread .
“ Why , they ’re giving it away free !
Whenever four men get together at a street corner , it used to be a merger , ” he writes .
“ Now it ’s a bread line ! ”
It ’s funny now .
Next year , it might not be , at least to some .

Once they were as gods , but the deities of the American banking system are now in ruins , plunged from their pedestals into the maw of taxpayer largesse .
Congress voted to give the banks $ 700 billion , lifting them temporarily out of their sepulcher of debt , while revealing a deep truth about the condition of America ’s financial powers :
They never had the money they said they had as they constructed their debt - based monetary system which now lies in ruins .
Their decisions on behalf of depositors , shareholders and investors were lacking in basic integrity and common sense .
Green gods bailing out with their golden parachutes .
There was a time when their power was real .
Come with me to Cleveland 30 years ago today .
Dec. 15 , 1978 , Cleveland , Ohio
I awoke to find a curt payment demand that was dropped on my front step by a grandfatherly man who supplemented his Social Security delivering the morning newspaper .
The headline plastered across the front page :
Cleveland Trust : Pay Up. Bank would relent if Muny Light were sold , Forbes believes .
One of America ’s largest banks , Cleveland Trust , led local banks in demanding immediate payment from the city by midnight , Dec. 15 , of $ 14.5 million in short - term loans .
I regarded the headline skeptically .
Having lived in 21 different places by the time I was 17 , including a couple of cars , I had come to an encyclopedic knowledge of dun letters , sent to my parents by battalions of bill collectors seeking immediate payment for televisions , cars and a variety of household appliances that never seemed to work .
I first came to regard these credit alarms with trepidation , later with impassiveness , with the expectation that as our family grew to two adults and seven children it would soon be on the move again , incurring new delinquencies with each new address .
Lack of access to money , housing and credit seemed to be a permanent condition .
Now , having fought through a thicket of consequence to become America ’s youngest mayor , elected on a promise to stop the privatization of the city ’s electric system , I was faced with paying off loans taken out by the previous mayor , for the financing of municipal projects of dubious value .
The banks refused to extend terms of payment and connived with City Council members to block alternative payment plans , such as the sale of city land or tax revenues .
The banks knew the city could n’t otherwise pay .
They demanded instead the sale of the city ’s electric system , Muny Light , to an investor - owned electric company , the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. ( CEI ) .
The president of the Cleveland Council , George Forbes , had met with the head of Cleveland Trust bank , who insisted on the sale of Muny Light as a precondition for extending the city credit .
This was a case of the bank blackmailing the city , pure and simple .
The alternative to accepting the bank ’s blackmail was default .
Cleveland could become the first city since the Depression to default on its financial obligations .
Cities rely on credit for everyday operations and for meeting long - term financial obligations , such as infrastructure improvements .
If banks called in their loans , the city would head toward dire straits .
No one knew that better than the law firm of Squire Sanders and Dempsey , which had served as bond counsel for the city of Cleveland while the city entered fiscal peril and was simultaneously , though not coincidentally , the principal law firm for the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. Through Squire Sanders and Dempsey , CEI had access to the intricacies of the city of Cleveland ’s financial records .
Under the previous administration , the city began using bond funds for general operating purposes .
As mayor , I inherited $ 40 million worth of debt that had to be refinanced before the end of my first year in office .
Under my predecessor , the city had illegally spent money it did not have , and yet it had the key to every bank in town and the confidence of the bond rating houses , at precisely the same time it was preparing for the sale of the municipal electric system to CEI .
Cleveland Trust and another bank demanding the sale of Muny Light , National City , were principal stock owners in CEI .
Several members of CEI ’s board sat on the boards of local banks as interlocking directorates .
There was a myriad of bank - utility business relations .
Cleveland Trust bank , which handled CEI ’s demand deposits , pension funds and other assets , would directly profit from the sale of Muny Light .
In a way , the banks were the private utility .
With the sale , CEI would have an electricity monopoly in Cleveland and would be able to name its price for electricity and get it .
Everyone in the Muny Light territory would receive at least a 20 percent rate increase as the rates would be raised to CEI ’s levels .
The city was self - sufficient with Muny Light for many years .
Muny provided power to 46,000 homes with low electric rates , which contributed to the economic growth of the city .
That was until the late 1960s and early ’ 70s , when a series of suspicious mechanical failures and power outages diminished the system ’s reliability .
At that time , under heavy lobbying from CEI , the Cleveland City Council delayed the passage of legislation for $ 9.8 million in repairs to Muny Light ’s generators , thereby forcing the city to purchase power at a premium from its competitor , CEI .
The city became increasingly dependent on an interconnection between CEI and Muny Light , a high - voltage line over which power could be transferred from CEI to the city , to ensure reliability .
The city ’s power system began to experience more unexplained power failures .
CEI began to make public overtures to purchase Muny Light .
The sale of Muny Light to CEI was soon supported by most of Cleveland ’s media , business , political and labor interests .
In November 1976 , the City Council passed legislation authorizing the sale of Muny Light for a fraction of its value .
I was clerk of Cleveland ’s Municipal Court at the time and I objected to the sale .
I was advised that there was no way to stop the sale , but I saw it differently .
Cleveland had a long history of municipal power .
I could sense a terrible injustice was being visited upon the people of the city by its leading institutions , which were conspiring to deprive the city of its public power system .
I organized a petition drive that attracted support from city neighborhoods served by Muny Light .
A full civic campaign was born with an intense effort made under brutal weather conditions to gather the signatures necessary to put the issue on the ballot .
There was much at stake besides the monetary value of the system :
The people ’s right to own an electric system .
And the historic position of Muny Light , one of America ’s first municipal electric utilities , founded 70 years earlier by Cleveland Mayor Tom Johnson .
Muny
Light provided electricity to about one - third of the homes and businesses in the city at a peak savings of 20 - 30 percent over the rates charged by CEI .
Additionally , Muny Light provided millions of dollars annually in savings to taxpayers by serving 76 city facilities .
It also provided Cleveland ’s street lighting .
High electric rates and higher taxes would follow if Muny were sold .
The private sector was forcing the sale for its own profit at the expense of the community .
On Jan. 4 , 1977 , the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board ( ASLB ) , in an antitrust review required of any company applying to operate a nuclear power plant , ruled that CEI had conspired to put Muny Light out of business .
CEI tried to force Muny Light into price - fixing and blocked Muny expansion , stopped the installation of Muny Light pollution - abatement equipment and forced the city to buy power it did n’t need .
In addition , the ASLB uncovered a CEI budget planning report for 1971 that spoke of a five - year plan “ to reduce and ultimately eliminate ” Muny Light .
The ASLB determined that CEI deliberately caused a Christmas - season blackout on the Muny Light system and sent salesmen into Muny Light territory offering “ reliable CEI service . ”
The private utility illegally tripled the cost of purchased power , thereby driving up Muny Light ’s operating costs .
CEI illegally blocked Muny Light ’s access to power from other companies , all in violation of federal antitrust law .
As a condition of receiving its license to operate a nuclear power plant , CEI had to provide Muny Light with access to cheap power .
Documents showed that CEI executives believed the purchase of Muny Light would increase CEI ’s earnings by $ 2.732 a share , eliminate a competitive threat , and push the company ’s growth rate to 10 percent , further enhancing investment .
Documents in the case also demonstrated CEI ’s successful attempts to subvert media editorial policy through cunning use of the company ’s large advertising budget .
Over the years , several local reporters lost their jobs after writing reports unfavorable to CEI , and CEI bragged internally about placing verbatim company - written propaganda as general media editorial content .
Confronted with the federal finding that bolstered a previously filed $ 330 million antitrust damage suit , the Cleveland city administration ’s response was incredible : “ Now CEI has to buy Muny Light ! ”
At the same time the campaign to sell Muny Light accelerated , a high - powered rifle shot ripped through my house , just missing my head .
A cavalcade of media editorials commenced favoring the transfer of Muny Light to CEI .
During an ensuing legal battle over the validity of the referendum petitions , I became a candidate for mayor .
I promised that if elected I would save the system .
I won the election .
My first act in office was to cancel the sale of Muny Light .
I next had to pay off a $ 14 million CEI electricity bill that the previous administration owed and wanted to satisfy through the sale of the light system .
I had been in the mayor ’s office barely a year , facing a municipal horror story of huge snow storms , massive water main breaks and a police strike .
I had cut city spending by 10 percent through eliminating corrupt contracts , payroll padding and attritional cutbacks .
Through the year , I struggled with a recall attempt for firing a police chief .
The recall was backed by banks , utility and real estate interests with a last - minute appeal printed by the Plain Dealer to sell Muny Light .
Credit rating agencies , which had looked the other way while CEI was attempting to gain Muny Light in the previous administration , downgraded the city ’s finances .
Another Muny Light - related attempted assassination was averted when I was rushed to a hospital vomiting blood from a profusely bleeding ulcer .
Some years later , a congressional investigation produced information from an undercover agent of the Maryland State Police that the assassination attempt was to occur while I was the grand marshal in a local parade .
A local television investigative report claimed the assassin ’s services were purchased because I refused to sell the electric system .
One month later , I was back at work trying to find a way to save Muny Light .
The utility ’s financial difficulties , though contrived largely through interference with the system by CEI , were depicted as so overwhelming that only the sale of the electric system itself would save the city from financial catastrophe .
I held several meetings with bank officials .
and it became clear we were heading for trouble on the question of refinancing .
The banks were going to try to force me to sell the electric system .
I went public with a plea for an income tax increase to protect the city ’s solvency .
On Dec. 15 , I made a last - minute appeal to Cleveland Trust .
It was 8 o’clock in the morning .
I met with Brock Weir , the chairman of Cleveland Trust , Council President Forbes and our host , a local businessman .
I had the intention of protecting Muny Light and avoiding a default .
“ There ’s just one thing you ’ve got to do , ” said the Council president , who strongly favored the sale .
Weir , the bank CEO with the stern visage : “ If you sell Muny Light , we ’ll roll over the notes .
I can get you $ 50 million in new financing .
We ’d get other banks to participate . ”
It was a bribe .
My thoughts went to the street just outside the boardroom .
Some 20 years earlier , a few blocks from where this meeting was taking place , I slept with my brothers and sister and parents in a car , homeless .
I remembered an apartment where my parents sat underneath the pale yellow light of a kitchen wall lamp , counting their pennies on an old porcelain - topped table .
The pennies dropped , click , click , click .
Pennies to pay the utility bills .
It matters how much people pay for electricity .
It matters if the public owns its own system and has political and financial control over rates .
I could hear the pennies dropping , click , click , click , as Mr. Weir insisted on the sale of Muny Light .
I remembered my family and the struggles of people like them .
I could n’t do it .
I could n’t sell .
Not for $ 50 million , not for anything .
“ I ’m not going to sell , even if it means my career , ” I said , as Council President Forbes looked on in surprise .
“ Why do you want to end your career ?
Sell the system .
Get rid of it ! ” he said .
“ Is there some other way we can work this out ? ” I asked Brock Weir .
He shook his head “ No . ”
Throughout that day , every media outlet in Cleveland echoed the sentiment of Cleveland Trust ’s chairman , including the morning newspaper headline , with such depth of coverage and intensity that it seemed the city itself would crumble unless I agreed to the sale , which also included a provision dropping the $ 330 million antitrust damage suit .
The objective condition of the city ’s finances received no honest review .
The sale of Muny Light was depicted as the only way the city could avoid fiscal disaster .
The majority leader of the City Council held a news conference live on the 6 o’clock news .
He declared that if I sold Muny Light , “ the chairman of the Cleveland Trust bank has informed the council that his bank will purchase $ 50 million worth of city bonds .
So , in effect , we have a plan sitting on the mayor ’s desk that will absolutely end the city ’s financial problems , if he will put his signature on it . ”
The $ 50 million bribe had been brought out into the open in a manner that now suggested it was a legitimate offer , a fake solution to a fake crisis .
I refused to sell .
As Cleveland television stations covered the event live , with a countdown clock that looked like a twisted version of New Year ’s Eve , midnight struck .
Television networks of several countries recorded the grim event :
The city of Cleveland became the first American city to go into default since the Great Depression .
The default was over just $ 14.5 million dollars in credit .
When I called for a congressional investigation a few days later , Cleveland Trust denied it wanted Muny Light , CEI denied it wanted Muny Light , the council president denied the chairman of Cleveland Trust wanted Muny Light , and the majority leader said he was mistaken when he said live on the 6 o’clock news that the bank chairman offered $ 50 million in credit for Muny Light .
Muny Light was no longer the issue .
It was the mayor and his obstinacy that caused the crisis .
So went the waltz into a netherworld devoid of truth , justice , reality or morality .
Though the people of Cleveland supported keeping Muny Light by a margin of 2 to 1 in a referendum a few months later , and passed an income tax increase by the same margin in order for the city to pay off the defaulted bond anticipation notes , the state of Ohio intervened and put the city into fiscal receivership .
I lost the mayor ’s race in 1979 .
The banks renegotiated the defaulted notes , at a profit .
The city lost its antitrust suit against CEI in 1981 , in a hung jury .
An appeal failed .
I was out of major public office for almost 15 years until , in 1993 , Cleveland announced an expansion of Muny Light ( now called Cleveland Public Power ) .
At that time , the City Council and others decided that I had made the right decision in refusing to sell Muny Light .
The city and its residents had saved hundreds of millions of dollars through Muny Light ’s reduced electric rates and the savings the taxpayers enjoyed from Muny ’s lower - cost power for street lighting and city buildings .
I attempted another political comeback and this time succeeded , getting elected to the state Senate with the motto : “ Because he was right . ”
My campaign literature showed a radiant light bulb behind my name .
Two years later , I was elected to Congress , with the slogan “ Light up Congress . ”
Today I am the chairman of the House Government Oversight Domestic Policy Subcommittee , which has broad jurisdiction over most government departments and agencies , including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , and electric utility matters generally .
The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. is now a subsidiary of First Energy Co. , which was fined by the NRC for various safety violations and , a few years ago , was found to have primary responsibility for the 2003 blackout that left 50 million people throughout the northeastern United States without electricity .
Cleveland Trust no longer exists .
No other bank involved in the default survives , except for National City , which next week faces extinction through shareholder approval of a takeover by PNC bank .
I have spent much time trying to save National City .
One newspaper , the Cleveland Press , which advocated that CEI be Cleveland ’s sole electricity provider , ceased publication .
The other strong proponent of the sale of Muny Light , the Plain Dealer , struggles to survive .
The city ’s electric system endures and this past year celebrated its 100th anniversary .
TEHRAN -- Iranian security forces have raided and closed the Tehran office of the human rights center run by 2003 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi .
In an interview with RFE / RL's Radio Farda , Narges Mohammadi , the deputy head of the Human Rights Defenders Center , said 10 to 15 uniformed and plainclothes security agents entered the watchdog 's office in northwest Tehran as members , including Ebadi herself , were preparing to belatedly commemorate the 60th anniversary of Human Rights Day on December 10 .
" I asked them to show their legal warrants , " Mohammadi told RFE / RL , " but they declined to show any authorization .
Now , there are 10 to 15 agents in the building , and they are filming us . "
Mohammadi said 200 to 300 guests had been invited to the celebration but that they had been barred from entering .
" This is an illegal act , " she said .
" They had no kind of authorization of any kind .
They are sealing the office , and our resistance is useless . "
In an interview with the French news agency AFP , Ebadi condemned the crackdown but vowed that human rights advocates in Iran would be unfazed .
" Shutting down the office without a warrant is illegal , and we will protest , " she said .
" Obviously , such a move does not have a positive message for other rights activists in Iran , but my colleagues and I will fulfill our duties under any circumstances . "
Ebadi used a UN forum in Geneva on Human Rights Day to condemn hard - liners in power in some Muslim countries and rulers of the world 's last communist states as abusers of human rights .
She said Muslim dictatorships use religion to underpin their own power .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Random numbers -- numbers without any pattern -- are vital to many applications , such as computer simulations , statistics , and cryptography .
There are many ways to generate them using unpredictable physical processes , including electric - signal noise and radioactive decay , but these methods cannot produce the quantities of numbers needed to keep up with the high data - processing rates of today 's computers .
A group of scientists seems to have discovered a way around this problem .
They have found that the physical chaos present in semiconductor lasers -- laser light produced using a semiconductor as the medium -- can produce good - quality random number sequences at very high rates .
The scientists , from Takushoku University , Saitama University , and NTT Corporation , all in Japan , achieved random number rates of up to 1.7 gigabits per second ( Gbps ) , which is about 10 times higher than the second - best rate , produced using a physical phenomenon .
They report this result in the December issue of Nature Photonics .
" We have shown that the performance of random number generators can be greatly improved by using chaotic laser devices , " said the paper 's corresponding author Atsushi Uchida , a researcher at Saitama University , to PhysOrg.com .
" The rate we obtained is faster than that of any previously reported devices for generating random numbers using physical sources . "
Fields and applications that could benefit from their work are numerous , including computational models to solve problems in nuclear medicine , computer graphic design , and finance .
Random numbers are also important to internet security .
Generating random numbers using physical sources -- which can be as simple as coin - flipping and tossing dice -- are preferred over other methods , such as computer generation , because they yield nearly ideal random numbers : those that are unpredictable , unreproducible , and statistically unbiased .
Lasers , Uchida and his colleagues have shown , can be excellent physical sources if they are chaotic .
This is achieved , in this case , by reflecting part of the laser light back into the laser using an external reflector .
This induces chaos , causing the light intensity to oscillate wildly .
As a result , the light 's electromagnetic signals are highly complex and cover a wide frequency range .
The researchers used a pair of semiconductor lasers in their experimental setup .
Each laser is connected to a photodetector , a device that senses and measures light , and each photodetector is connected to an analog - to - digital converter ( ADC ) , which samples the physical light signals and outputs digital numbers .
In this case , the specific ADCs convert the signals into random binary numbers suitable for computing and other high - speed data manipulation .
The group achieved a bit rate of 1.7 Gbps , although future work may center on devising laser schemes that can achieving rates as high as 10 Gbps .

For the next week I ’m going to try blogging every day .
Things have just been happening too fast for the occasional article .
Every day there ’s something I want to talk about , and that ’s how I ’m going to do it .
Today ’s big news , or comedy skit , however you want to call it , was the news that five Blackwater guards have been indicted on Federal charges of manslaughter and using a machine gun in the commission of a crime .
No joke I could make about this could top that great line from Apocalypse Now : “ Shit , charging a man with murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500 . ”
The Blackwater guys are on trial because they messed up in a big way in a place the Iraqi government actually cared about , at a time when the Iraqis were already massively pissed at the occupation .
They ’re a sacrifice to Iraqi - US relations : “ Here , take these five steroid - casualty overpaid hicks and stop making us look bad with yer bellyachin’ ! ”
You ca n’t exactly say they did n’t do anything wrong , but you can say what they did was SOP for the time and place .
On September 16 2007 A Blackwater guard heard a backfire or felt threatened or was just in a bad mood or something while escorting a State Department convoy through Nisoor Square in Baghdad .
The guards were nervous because there ’d been a car bombing about an hour before .
So this Blackwater guy did what came naturally : shot and killed a kid driving toward the square .
The trouble with shooting the driver is that the car keeps moving .
That made the Blackwater mercs nervous , so they all started shooting at anybody they saw .
Let Black Water hang ?
That happened a lot in Baghdad in those days , but this was n’t Sadr City , this was Nisoor Square , and the people who died included a doctor , a med student , a car dealer ( OK , nobody was complaining about him ) and a couple of government people with serious connections in al - Maliki ’s administration .
It was like those weddings that NATO loves to bomb in Afghanistan : you can get away with vaporizing some white - trash wedding in the sticks , but when we blew up a wedding of Hamid Karzai ’s own kin a few years back , the Afghans were seriously annoyed .
I mean , fun ’s fun , but you have to know who you can safely blast and who you can’t .
Blackwater tried to stonewall , naturally , but they ’d done this shit just once too often .
Even by Baghdad standards they had a bad rep : incompetent trigger - happy illiterate rednecks — and damn it , they get paid too much for it !
Lotta jealousy from lower - paid hitmen .
Blackwater is in its own little steroid - shooting , wild - west , overpaid boondoggle world .
They ’ve got their fancy HQ with its old Deadwood style gate with the sign on it , “ Enter at your own risk , ” although the biggest risk for Blackwater guys is dying like Lyle Alzado from all the shit they inject into their biceps , or falling over with clogged arteries from all the steaks they eat on their ridiculous salaries .
Army guys hate these people because they get paid about 20 times what a combat grunt makes to ride around taking pot shots at civilians .
If there ’s a megamansion going up in the middle of the recession in a Redneck neighborhood , you can pretty much bet it ’s the new abode of your local Blackwater vet .
( Of course it might be a pot dealer but that ’s a much riskier business from what I hear . )
Back when he dropped out of high school he never realized that being dumb , pumped and crazy was the way to riches , but I bet his guidance counselor is ready to admit defeat , now that all the engineers and lawyers are begging on the street and little Johnny who liked to shoot songbirds and torture cats comes back from Iraq with enough loot to buy and sell them all .
So OK , these are not saints .
But it ’s still ridiculous to charge them with manslaughter , especially since the State Department bureaucrats they were paid to protect are on record telling their Blackwater bodyguards that they had total immunity for anything they did in Iraq .
That ’s just plain dangerous , telling this kind of guy that kind of thing .
I can think of about two - thirds of my high - school PE class who ’d kill for fun if they knew they could get away with it .
I would n’t but that ’s only because it ’s not sporting , like the Brits used to say .
I ’ve got standards , see .
Most of those feral little fuckers would pay you for a chance like the Blackwater guys had .
And that claim that they used a machinegun to commit their crimes — that ’s insane !
That ’s a statute the feds passed in one of their little fits of screaming about gangsters taking over , and now they ’re using it to try guys who were using standard military automatic weapons in the middle of a war zone .
The feds are famous for using laws like RICO to get people they were never intended to get .
I have a friend of a friend who imported guns for a living ; suddenly he was volunteering to teach literacy to gigantic thugs in a federal pen in Kentucky because he did n’t have his licensing forms all filled in right .
There ’s no good guys here .
Blackwater ’s incompetent and mean and stupid — quick , how many of these guys speak Arabic ?— but they were doing what they were supposed to do , what these cowardly State suits begged them to do : keep them safe by blowing up any Iraqi who even coughed in the vicinity .
Did you know State had to shanghai an entire graduating class of their foreign service academy for Iraq ?
I love that bit : the prissy bastards thought they were training to sip cocktails , trade quips and get sarcosy with Mrs. Sarkozy , and they find themselves in highspeed convoys hunkered down with buzzcut killers who look like Robert E. Lee ’s finest , give or take a hundred pounds of artificial beef .
Too bad none of them bought the farm that day .
Well , it wo n’t be too bad for these five Blackwater guys in stir , if they ever go at all .
I ’m betting they wo n’t , but if they do , they ’re ready : lots of pumping iron , the gummint feeds you , and you kill the rest of the day sleeping or swapping bullshit kill stories .
The only difference is — oh , about $ 160,000 a year , minimum .

An independent film , traditionally speaking , is generally referred to as a movie created entirely outside the traditional Hollywood system .
It is usually the kind of production where the actors double up as camera men , friends and family provide the bankroll and the director ’s mom is in charge of craft services .
An independent film , traditionally speaking , is generally referred to as a movie created entirely outside the traditional Hollywood system .
It is usually the kind of production where the actors double up as camera men , friends and family provide the bankroll and the director ’s mom is in charge of craft services .
Over the last few years , however , the “ indie ” film has taken on a whole new face .
Large productions houses have formed specialty divisions that focus exclusively on “ limited run ” titles .
These are movies that may not have the broad appeal of a summer blockbuster , but still enough demand worth releasing in a limited capacity - often to critical acclaim .
Of course with a limited run comes a limited budget .
Luxuries such as wide - spread marketing campaigns are slim - to - none for the indie gem .
It is for this reason that poster art plays an particularly significant role in an independent film ’s marketing strategy .
Like the movies themselves , poster art for independent films can be especially beautiful and most certainly stand out from the crowd .
These posters are imaginative and thoughtful while not forgetting the fundamentals such as color and typography .
The result is more often than not an eye catching work of art that sparks your interest and curiosity - which is exactly what it ’s supposed to do .

Fiat money is the mother of all toxic papers .
The reason for bubbles , bursting and Bailouts , is our fake , phony , fiat , fraudulent , intrinsically worthless , " money . "
Because it is inherently fraudulent and criminal it spawns all sorts of other criminal and speculative aberrations .
Among these we find all sorts of convoluted ways to " trade , " in all sorts of other " securities " — all made insecure by being drawn from the same poisoned well .
This encourages and institutionalizes all kinds of theft and speculation and discourages industry , frugality and creativity .
It even encourages and draws out unlawful wars .
For wars need not be successful in any other terms than generating debt for the banksters to continue increasing their power , wealth and influence .
They love getting paid by both sides — or whoever is left .
War Is A Racket — and Fiat Money with Fractional Reserve Banking represents a universal war against the person , liberty and property of everyone on the planet .
The Federal Reserve banking system , along with its siblings in all other major countries , has enjoyed its criminal enterprise for almost 100 years — practically unmolested .
It ’s time for justice to be done .
It ’s time for a rectification of our monetary system and a full vindication of our Constitution .
An audit will not suffice .
Nothing less than Abolishing the Fed will do .
Tragically , our Criminal Congress has not been ethical or manly for such a long time that we could n’t trust them with any part of the job of investigating the Fed .
They are effectively " on the take . "
There is at least one notable exception .
Guess who .
This was all predicted :
Mankind soon learn to make interested uses of every right and power which they possess or may assume .
The public money and public liberty , intended to have been deposited with three branches of magistracy but found inadvertently to be in the hands of one only , will soon be discovered to be sources of wealth and dominion to those who hold them ; distinguished , too , by this tempting circumstance : that they are the instrument as well as the object of acquisition .
With money we will get men , said Caesar , and with men we will get money .
— Thomas Jefferson : Notes on Virginia Q.XIII , 1782 . ME 2:164
Because of its transcendent toxicity , the fraud of fiat money with fractional reserve banking will surface again and again .
Like the cocktail of noxious poisons that oozes from underneath mounds of dirt piled high over the worst of our Superfund landfill sites , the poisonous effects of criminal money and banking , gradually , inexorably , seep in , to choke the life out of every positive economic activity denominated in their toxic paper .
The World ’s poorest suffer the most from this malignancy — making it all the more criminal .
The hardest work the banksters ever do :
Until they are banned , fraudulent banking establishments will never finish the task of covering their bloody tracks .
Their PR campaign must go on at all times .
It must be powerful , thorough , incessant .
But it must also be subtle enough to fool most of the people most the time .
Their chief weapon and ours : EDUCATION
A thorough education in Classical Libertarianism , Austrian Economics , and Original Americanism , ought to leave any potential victim immune .
Perhaps now more than ever , with the leveling effect that the Internet has on media , we will be able to effectively educate the public as to the devastation that has been wrought upon the entire world by the obscene crimes of modern banking establishments in collusion with most of the more powerful national governments and all of the governments of the 50 States of the Union .
Of course we must not forget all of the international corporations and organizations they have spawned — not the least of which is the UN .
All these have a long - standing policy of " bailing out " relatives and friends — even " enemies , " on many occasions .
It could never be anything but extremely dangerous to let any private person , special interest , or combination , control an essentially secret source of indefinite unlimited wealth , value , or power .
Once upon a time there was man who developed an excellent technique for printing his own version of the $ 100 Federal Reserve Note — a species of toxic paper over which the federal government tries to maintain an exclusive monopoly .
This man was going to be a very clever , " conservative " criminal .
Life would be just a little sweeter with this extra advantage he would have over his neighbors .
He decided that his bills were so good no one would ever find out as long as he kept his spending to just a little bit more than his regular job could support .
Who would notice a 10 % lifestyle enhancement ?
He told no one — not even his wife .
But one evening his brother - in - law walked in on him while he was finishing up a fresh batch of almost perfect 100s .
The brother - in - law was overwhelmed .
After he was able to calm his brother - in - law down , our hero acquiesced and gave him just a few samples to spend " judiciously , " explaining to him , that , with a little discipline , there would be enough for them to enjoy and share indefinitely .
If they could only exercise the right amount of self - control , detection was only a very remote concern , because of the extremely high quality of the product .
Sadly , for him and his enterprise , our hero ’s confidence in his brother - in - law proved to have been a gross mistake .
Just a few hours later that same evening , after a few drinks and a few dances , and a few more drinks , the brother - in - law ’s tongue began to wag out of control .
Soon after , he was fitted with a shiny pair of silver bracelets and got to meet a lot of nice men in uniforms and suits .
Naturally his attorney encouraged him to turn in his " partner " in a plea - bargaining arrangement .
With the help of the federal prosecutor he was able to relocate to somewhere in Arizona as a permanent quest of the witness protection program .
The Federal Reserve in collusion with Treasury and the Congress only impersonates the hero in the story above .
In reality they are all more like his profligate brother - in - law .
With the financial leverage they have attained through fiat money coupled with a fractional reserve system that effectively goes down to a zero reserve requirement ; with no oversight or control by any agent truly answerable to the People ; with their tentacles reaching into the pockets of almost every property owner on the planet ; and with their minions and military , undermining life , liberty and property in almost every country , it is time for all people everywhere to say " Kill the Bank before it Kills us All ! "
Using the Federal Reserve Note as a measure of Anything , Anywhere , leaves too much power in the hands of those who can print more at there own caprice .
The wonder is that they have any restraint at any level in this scam .
Of course errant brothers - in - law come and go .
Then there are the Greenspan types who are so " good " they can even lie to themselves and betray their own souls and consciences .
You can buy a lot of talent with unlimited money .
But Alan would n’t have had a prayer without a lot of expensive help .
It takes larger and larger armies to steal and control larger and larger booties .
Once you have studied the issue for a short period of time , with access to some of the best historical documents and scholarship , you will come to realize how impossible it would be to gauge the magnitude of these financial crimes .
I will not quote an entire book to prove my thesis .
But I will ask you to read an entire short book .
This work was bequeathed to you by the man who founded the Naval Academy in Annapolis , MD .
He had held the office of Secretary of the Navy and penned this work in his 85th year — just six years before his death in 1891 .
Bancroft ’s " A Plea for the Constitution of the United States — Wounded in the House of Its Guardians " was doubtless a reaction to what he saw as an egregious ruling of the Supreme Court that had been preceded by a great many errors and some very deliberate machinations to undermine lawful government by destroying every link between de facto government and the Constitutional imperatives related to preserving the integrity of our monetary system as well as the Constitution itself .
Would the United States Supreme Court Lie ?
According to Bancroft :
The supreme court of the United States was endowed by our fathers with a peculiar tenure of office and high powers of jurisdiction , that it might be able to keep watch over the life and integrity of the constitution .
On the third of March , 1884 , without having listened to any public argument on the case which was made the occasion of its utterance , it pronounced before a crowd of listeners an opinion in these words :
“ The power to make the notes of the government a legal tender in payment of private debts being one of the powers belonging to sovereignty in other civilized nations , and not expressly withheld from congress by the constitution ; we are irresistibly impelled to the conclusion that the impressing upon the treasury notes of the United States the quality of being a legal tender in payment of private debts is an appropriate means , conducive and plainly adapted to the execution of the undoubted powers of congress . ”
In the Constitutional Convention of 1787 , Mr. Langdon , a Delegate from New Hampshire , had said he would rather reject the entire new Constitution rather than retain the language that would have permitted emissions of paper money [ called " bills of credit " in the original draft ] .
Even John Marshall , the chief judicial pioneer / heretic and proponent of judicial supremacy , could never stomach paper money according to Bancroft :
The inflexible adversary of paper money , detesting it with a hatred almost amounting to a passion , was the chief justice of the United States , John Marshall .
While he was on the bench , no case could come before him , in which power was claimed for the United States to issue bills of credit ; because at that day he and everybody else well understood and willingly acknowledged that the power to emit bills of credit was withheld from the United States , was forbidden by not being granted .
But his opinion of the illegality of the issue of bills of credit by the states gave him the opportunity to declare in terms of universal application that the greatest violation of justice was committed when paper money was made a legal tender in payment of debts .
But the opportunity to express his opinion , which was never offered to him as a judge , he found as a historian in his life of Washington .
He claimed for himself and those with whom he acted , an “ unabated zeal for the exact observance of public and private engagements . ”
He rightly insisted that the only ways of relief for pecuniary “ distresses ” were “ industry and frugality " ; he condemned “ all the wild projects of the moment " ; he rejected as a delusion every attempt at relief from pecuniary distresses “ by the emission of paper money " ; or by “ a depreciated medium of commerce . ”
These were his opinions through life .
He gave them to the public in 1807 , and twenty - four years later in a revised edition of his Life of Washington he confirmed his early convictions by the authority of his maturest life .
Bancroft , quoting Thomas Paine :
“ The laws of a country ought to be the standard of equity and calculated to impress on the minds of the people the moral as well as the legal obligations of political justice .
But tender laws , of any kind , operate to destroy morality , and to dissolve by the pretense of law what ought to be the principle of law to support , reciprocal justice between man and man ; and the punishment of a member who should move for such a law ought to be DEATH . ”
Yes !
Mr. Paine was saying anyone who introduced any legislative measure in favor of legal tender laws for fiat or paper money ought to have been hung by the neck until dead .
I will say that you have no comprehension of the problem if you would tend to disagree .
My challenge to all who have any place left in their hearts or imaginations for fiat currency , fractional reserve , or the Federal Reserve System : Carefully study everything Bancroft said in his Plea , spend more time reading on the subject at Mises.org and LewRockwell.com
As you read at Mises and Rockwell — please make sure you explore all their archives and links .
Finally , after you truly understand the issue , decide how much poison is too much .
You will not have lawful government without lawful money : Gold and Silver ONLY .
Good money must have an intrinsic value .
The United States of America cannot make its shadow legal tender for debts payable in money without ultimately bringing upon their foreign commerce and their home industry a catastrophe , which will be the more overwhelming the longer the day of wrath puts off its coming .
Our federal constitution was designed to end forever the emission of bills of credit as legal tender in payment of debts , alike by the individual states and the United States ; and it will have that effect , if it is rightly interpreted and firmly enforced .
— George Bancroft [ emphasis added ]
Bancroft closes his Appendix with a quote from Thomas Jefferson :
“ The federal government — I deny their power to make paper money a legal tender . ”
Please email this article to your favorite banker and ask for his complete and thoughtful response .
You might also ask your US Representative to co-sponsor the Bill to Abolish the Fed .
So far Ron Paul ’s Bill has no co-sponsor .

Andrew Gutterson :
Hey , my name is Andrew Gutterson from Beatboxer Entertainment .
Today , I will be teaching you how to beatbox .
I will be teaching you some very basic beats .
The first beat will be a bass beat which sounds like this .
I will be teaching you inward and outward snares which sound like this .
I will be teaching you different bass beats such as Throat Bass .
I will be teaching you the Techno Bass beat .
I will be teaching you different scratches , which is the chewy scratch which sounds like this and the vocal scratch which you heard earlier but sounds like this .
I am going to be teaching you how to the hi-hat which sounds -- or the closed hi-hat and the open hi-hat .
So the closed hi-hat sounds like this and the open hi-hat sounds like this and at the end of my series I am going to be showing you how they all come together to make a beat .
What are you going to need to beatbox is you are going to need your mouth , you need a glass a water and your own creativity .
A little bit about me , I have been beatboxing for about five years .
I beatboxed with my group of my college and I have also beatboxed with the well known beatboxer , the godfather , who is known as Rahzel .
So now let 's get started with me teaching you how to beatbox .
What George W. Bush loved best about his job was being a war president .
Playing war , that is , as opposed to making war like a grown - up .
Remember him strutting onto that carrier in his little flight jacket ?
You never saw Eisenhower , a real general , playing out his martial fantasies this way .
You can take the drink out of the drunk , but you ca n’t take the swagger out of a fool .
Compare Bush ’s eight years to Clinton ’s , and you see how much he loved to play the soldier .
No one expected that from a Republican : Reagan and Bush senior were cautious about betting America ’s chips .
Liberals used to make fun of Reagan for picking on tiny helpless nations that could n’t fight back .
Now they are remembering with pure nostalgia Reagan ’s invasion of Grenada , air raids on Libya , and even our 1984 withdrawal from Beirut .
We ’ll never know how far W. would have gone to find himself a war because he had all he needed delivered by air on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Remember how people felt in those days ?
A friend of mine said , “ It was like the aliens had invaded . ”
We needed our president to be a hero and made him into one , even though it was obvious he was n’t up to the job .
He did n’t take the first plane to Manhattan , stand there and say , “ We ’re coming for you bastards ! ”
Instead he sat in a roomful of children , reading The Pet Goat , then dropped off the radar for hours before his handlers got him ready .
Maybe there ’s a lesson here : if the president does n’t cut it in a crisis , we ’re better off admitting that to ourselves and telling him so instead of pretending he ’s a great leader .
When you make a weakling into a hero , you give him a lot of power .
If we ’d kept our eyes open and faced the fact that Bush reacted badly to 9/11 , we might have been able to ask for a little more detail about his big plans .
Those came courtesy of Cheney and his neocon punks .
What a crew these guys were !
Like their boss , they were also woofers , boasters — but of a different variety .
Dubya was your standard frat boy loudmouth , but Cheney , with his talk about “ working the dark side , ” was more like the ultimate Dungeons and Dragons nerd .
And you could n’t ask Hollywood to serve up a goofier selection of dorks than his neocon staffers , who drifted from the universities to D.C. the way has - been pop singers switch to country and western to leech off a new bunch of suckers .
On the one hand , they were scared to death of Arabs and hated all Muslims .
On the other , they were convinced that every Muslim on the planet really wanted , deep in his heart , to be magically turned into an Ohio Republican .
That was their theory : take an anti-American Arab country , add an invading army , and voila !
a nice fluffy democracy soufflé .
So we poured American blood and treasure into the Iraqi dust to prove the half - baked theories of a bunch of tenth - rate professors .
The most expensive experiment in the history of the world , all to learn something any 10 - year - old could have told them : people do n’t take to foreign troops on their streets , and not everybody wants to be like us .
You know those Ig - Nobel awards they hand out to the dumbest science projects of the year ?
The Iraq invasion is the all - time winner .
Retire the trophy with the names of the winning team : Bush , Cheney , Kristol , Wolfowitz , Feith .
But first came Afghanistan — “ the graveyard of empires . ”
Every military - history wannabe was conjuring the ghosts of that Victorian British army slaughtered by the Afghans , along with all the propaganda we ’d been pushing about the invincible mujahedeen who ’d driven out the Soviets .
Looking back , what they had routed was a dying Soviet state , and they did n’t even manage to do that until we took the risk of giving them Stinger anti-aircraft missiles .
But all the pundits ’ knees were shaking about going into the Afghan haunted house .
We started slow , the way American armies tend to do , taking a while to limber up .
There were weeks of bombing the Shomali Plain to no visible effect and a Special Forces raid on Mullah Omar ’s compound that was more “ Naked Gun ” than “ Top Gun . ”
Then Mazar - i- Sharif in the north fell suddenly , and it turned into the kind of war that Northern Alliance fighters and fighter - bomber pilots both love : hunting down a fleeing enemy .
The campaign went so well , so fast , that it taught Bush and Cheney the wrong lessons .
They started exporting democracy to Afghanistan , even hiring a local Pashtun girl to read the Kabul evening news .
When you tell a big , backwards tribe like the Pashtun that you ’re going to turn their whole world upside down for them , you should n’t expect them to be grateful .
But we did , setting ourselves up for a whole lot of trouble later on .
Worse yet , Bush ’s people figured that since Afghanistan , the tough nut , cracked so easily , their pet project , a second Iraq invasion , would be a cakewalk .
This time they would do it right , occupying the Iraqi cities instead of just crushing Saddam ’s army and withdrawing like Bush senior did .
Nobody wants to recall what Americans believed back then .
That ’s OK : I ’ll remember it .
People thought that Saddam was “ connected to ” 9/11 , and his agents were going to poison our water , nuke our cities , and gas our subways .
At least they claimed to believe all that unlikely James Bond stuff .
I do n’t think they really did .
There was just so much revenge momentum after 9/11 that it had to burst out somewhere .
Everybody wanted payback .
It ’s natural .
But most of the time , in your average democracy , cooler heads are in charge .
Not this time .
Bush and his team were foaming at the mouth far more than the average citizen .
It was like a crazed sheriff trying to talk a lukewarm mob into a lynching frenzy .
With the help of people who should have known better — I ’m looking at you , Colin Powell — he got his way .
That , in the short version , is why George W. Bush is about to leave office the most unpopular American president in history .
You can spin Iraq a hundred different ways , but it still comes up bad news because once the dust settles , the Iranians are in control of the whole region , and they did n’t have to fire a shot .
We destroyed their old rival for them .
It ’s a simple story : we crushed Saddam ’s army , occupied the cities , and then acted like the whole country would turn itself into a neocon fantasyland .
Paul Bremer ’s cult kids were talking tax reform while the Iraqi army they had sent home unemployed was busy digging up the weapons they had buried in their yards .
Bush ’s counterinsurgency policy was pretending there was no insurgency then pretending it was just Saddam ’s “ deadenders . ”
When Saddam ’s capture at the end of 2003 did n’t slow the insurgency , Bush ’s defenders stopped acting like they knew what was going on and just settled for blaming the Iranians — as if it was a nasty surprise that Iran , the country that openly hates America most in the whole world , might get involved in anti-American operations when we occupied Iraq right next door .
People ask what our counterinsurgency strategy was before the surge .
Easy : we had none .
We were doing nothing but offering the insurgents moving targets .
A standard operation for the occupation force in those dark days was patrolling through an alien Sunni neighborhood , waiting for an IED to go off under the lead vehicle or for an RPG or small - arms ambush .
When that happens , conventional forces have a grim choice : do nothing , withdrawing while the locals snicker at your dead and wounded , or open fire on everyone in sight .
Either way , the insurgents win .
If you withdraw , they ’ve hit you with impunity and gained respect in the neighborhood .
If you open fire on the slums , you kill civilians and make enemies .
Effective counterinsurgency means not relying on massive firepower the way conventional forces are trained to do .
The idea is not to fire until you know exactly who you ’re up against .
It ’s the opposite of shock and awe .
It ’s discipline and patience .
Gen .
David Petraeus implemented a set of reforms usually called the surge , though they were about tactics more than reinforcements .
All he really did was initiate overdue standard counterinsurgency doctrine .
He integrated U.S. units with Iraqi forces then sent them out into the neighborhoods .
You ca n’t run any kind of counterinsurgency plan without good street - level intelligence , but Bush ’s people would n’t admit that there was an insurgency , so they would n’t commit to learning about it .
Their style was to ignore it and hope it would go away .
That ’s why Afghanistan went well in the early stages : we did n’t go in trying to turn the Afghans into democrats , but trying to crush the Taliban and al - Qaeda .
In Iraq , Bush was dreaming from the start , so the whole effort was doomed .
The surge worked about as well as any good counterinsurgency effort could .
We know a little about the enemy now , and there ’s less violence because all the neighborhoods had already been ethnically cleansed .
Baghdad is now a Shi’ite city .
There are a few Sunni enclaves , but the Shia rule the city and the country , with the Kurds fortifying themselves up north and wishing they could saw their territory off and relocate it somewhere in mid-ocean .
That ’s what Bush ’s trillion - dollar investment in Iraq has bought .
Meanwhile , if you look at the rest of the world map , you get a real shock .
Regions like Latin America and Central Asia that eight years ago were American protectorates in all but name have turned against us while we were distracted with Iraq .
Many times , the real winners are countries that manage to stay out of a war , the way England benefited by not getting sucked into the Thirty Years ’
War .
Iran is much stronger now , and so is Russia .
The Russians , who seemed to be in their “ throes ” when Clinton left office , just slapped down Georgia , one of our few remaining allies among the old Soviet states , and there was n’t a thing we could do but grumble .
It ’s no puzzle : we pretended a goon was a hero , let him play out his foolish fantasies about remaking the Middle East , and wasted our strength on a losing effort while the rest of the world drifted out of our power .
Our leader was a laughingstock around globe , and he made America the butt of the world ’s contempt .
But Bush got his wish — he was a war president and then some .
The rest of us were the casualties .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - An Iraqi reporter called President George W. Bush a “ dog ” and threw his shoes at him on Sunday , sullying a farewell visit to Baghdad meant to mark greater security in Iraq after years of bloodshed .
Just weeks before he bequeaths the unpopular Iraq war to President - elect Barack Obama , Bush sought to underline improved security by landing in daylight and venturing out beyond the city ’s heavily fortified international Green Zone .
He declared the war “ not over ” despite recent gains .
In a sign of lingering anger over the war that will define the Republican president ’s foreign policy legacy , an Iraqi journalist shouted in Arabic “ this is a goodbye kiss from the Iraqi people , dog , ” and hurled his shoes at Bush during a news conference with Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki .
Throwing shoes at somebody is a supreme insult in the Middle East .
One of the shoes sailed over the president ’s head and slammed into the wall behind him and he had to duck to miss the other one .
Maliki tried to block the second shoe with his arm .
“ It ’s like going to a political rally and have people yell at you .
It ’s a way for people to draw attention , ” Bush said .
“ I do n’t know what the guy ’s cause was .
I did n’t feel the least bit threatened by it . ”
The journalist was leapt on by Iraqi security officials and U.S. secret service agents and dragged from the room screaming and struggling .
Bush ’s fleeting visit to Baghdad was aimed at marking the recent passage of a U.S. - Iraq security pact that paves the way for U.S. troops to pull out of Iraqi cities by July next year and withdraw completely by the end of 2011 .
It was also meant to hail a recent sharp fall in the sectarian violence and insurgency that raged after the 2003 U.S. invasion to topple Saddam Hussein , and to show support for Iraqi police and soldiers as they take on increasing responsibility .
Asked whether he had come to Iraq on a victory lap , Bush said : “ No , I consider it an important step on the road toward an Iraq that can sustain itself , govern itself and defend itself . ”
“ There ’s still more work to be done .
The war is not over . ”
PRAISE FOR BUSH
Bush thanked U.S. forces for their service in Iraq at a rally of about 1,500 cheering troops inside Saddam ’s old al - Faw palace at the sprawling U.S. military base of Camp Victory .

“ The surge is one of the greatest successes in the history of the U.S. military , ” Bush said , referring to the decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Iraq last year .
Bush held talks with President Jalal Talabani and Maliki during the visit .
Talabani called Bush a great friend of the Iraqi people “ who helped us to liberate our country . ”
Maliki , who had a strained look on his face after the shoe - throwing , praised Bush : “ You have stood by Iraq and the Iraqi people for a very long time , starting with getting rid of the dictatorship . ”

The U.S. - Iraq security pact , which replaces a U.N. mandate governing the presence of foreign troops , has its critics in Iraq , some of whom doubt the United States will live up to its promise to withdraw .
“ We reject this visit , as it occurs at a time when Iraq is still under the U.S. occupation and the U.S. army has the upper hand in controlling the security situation , ” said Ahmed al - Massoudi , a spokesman for the parliamentary bloc loyal to anti-American Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
“ This visit is a show of force . ”
Though Iraq has slipped down the list of Americans ’ concerns as the recession - hit U.S. economy has taken center stage , polls show most people think the war was a mistake .
It will now be left to Obama , a Democrat and early opponent of U.S. military involvement in Iraq , to sort out an exit strategy after he takes office on January 20 .
About 140,000 U.S. troops will still be in Iraq nearly six years into a war that has killed more than 4,200 American military personnel and tens of thousands of Iraqis .
DAYLIGHT LANDING
Bush was greeted on the heavily guarded tarmac in Baghdad by the top U.S. commander in Iraq , General Ray Odierno , and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker .
The decision to land in broad daylight reflected confidence that Baghdad was more secure this time than in Bush ’s last visit to the capital in 2006 when sectarian violence was raging .
Until Air Force
One touched down , Bush ’s trip was conducted in strictest secrecy .
The presidential jet was rolled out of its giant hangar only after everyone was on board .
Journalists ’ electronic devices , from cellphones to iPods , were confiscated .
Bush , dressed casually and wearing a black baseball cap after his night - time getaway from the White House , made a rare appearance in the press cabin just before takeoff .
“ Nobody knew who I was , ” he joked when an aide complimented him on his disguise .

As a new administration comes in I ’m starting to see NASA push hard for the idea of returning to the moon .
My own feeling is that this is going backwards , and people should speak up about it now .
Frankly my larger worry is that in view of a major economic downturn that NASA will have their budget chopped yet again — and what sad is that there has n’t been any serious investment in the program for almost forty years now .
So here are my ten reasons why we should try to land on Mars by 2018 instead of going back to 1969 :
1. Chances are very strong that China will get to the moon well before we do .
2 . A lunar project is just a huge distraction if you ’re serious about going to Mars .
3 . We know for a fact that there ’s no chance that life can live on the moon , this is n’t the case with Mars .
4 . The Steven Hawking argument :
If humans are serious about becoming dinosaurs Mars is the first logical place for colonize , so why not take our first baby steps ?
5 . It may take us twenty years to get to Mars — on a purely selfish level I ’d like to live to see that in my lifetime .
6 . From a scientific point of view we can learn as much from Mars as we can about the moon .
7 . Returning back to the moon wo n’t inspire a new generation of scientists the way a trip to Mars would .
8. NASA does best when it has a single strong focus , a Mars project would give them a long term sense of mission that they do n’t have now .
9 . We ’d have to invent a great deal of new technology to go to Mars , this would have a wealth of benefits in terms of spinoffs .
10 .
Because it is hard !
Take a look at the 1961 Kennedy speech and tell me that you do n’t feel ashamed about going back to the moon :
“ We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things , not because they are easy , but because they are hard , because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills , because that challenge is one that we ’re willing to accept , one we are unwilling to postpone , and one we intend to win , and the others , too . ”
Bad stuff .

In an official blog post Tuesday , YouTube announced that it had enacted a new set of guidelines to sanitize its most viewed lists by cracking down on videos with " profanity " and " sexually suggestive " content .
The changes , YouTube wrote , are meant to " help ensure that you 're viewing content that 's relevant to you , and not inadvertently coming across content that is n't . "
Let 's remember first of all that YouTube has had trouble luring big bucks from advertisers , and so this clean - up undoubtedly has two eyes on the bottom line .
The way it works :
If a video violates the guidelines , it will be demoted -- removed from the front pages and marked as " age restricted " -- so only registered YouTube users who claim they 're over 18 can watch .
YouTube 's Most Viewed and Top Favorited pages are often where videos go to become mega-viral sensations , so if you want your vid to qualify for this viral launch pad , you 'd better not break the rules .
That is , if you can find them .
YouTube is specific about what it means by sexually suggestive .
But it says nothing about what profanity might mean in practice .
( The site offered a similar nondefinition back when it banned drug - related videos . )
Staying mum is a PR tactic , of course , because obscenity and profanity are notoriously fluid and slippery concepts .
Any attempt to nail them down will bring a wave of examples the definer forgot to outlaw , or could n't foresee .
And that 's why the definitions you do see ...
I begged the McCain campaign by private email and in a private meeting to give me something - anything - to kill the story off .
I promised to run any evidence that would blow this out of the water .
That offer still stands .
Please make me look like an idiot for asking these questions .
But they did n't offer a thing , asserting that even asking the question was an outrageous reputation - destroying offense .
Maybe Michelle Malkin is right that this is truther , tin-foil hat territory .
But Malkin's only substantive point rebutting the photographic evidence is :
We ’re all obstetricians now !
Actually , the Dish went out and interviewed eight of the leading obstetricians in the country and laid out all the facts of the case and asked the experts for their take .
While none would say that this pregnancy could not have happened , and none would comment on a case they had n't examined personally , all of them said it was one of the strangest and unlikeliest series of events they had ever heard of and found Palin 's decision to forgo medical help for more than a day after her water broke and risk the life of her unborn child on a long airplane trip to be reckless beyond measure .
Malkin also equates the story with the Obama birth certificate affair .
But we have documentary evidence of the certificate , and Palin has produced no hard evidence at all for her pregnancy .
All that 's needed is some medical records of her pregnancy which , as a Down Syndrome pregnancy , would have a large pile of medical documentation easily released .
There is no formal record of Trig 's birth at Mat - Su Regional Medical Center , although there is a record of two other babies born on the same day .
Maybe I am crazy to even wonder .
Or maybe we have witnessed one of the biggest frauds in American political history and the biggest failures among the American media in a very , very long time .
All I know is : the media refuses to ask and does n't want to know and failed to demand medical records .
All I know is that some journalists - like the Washington Post 's Howie Kurtz - even tried to discredit the integrity of bloggers for asking .
And yet in the campaign , the pregnancy and baby were offered at every moment as a reason to vote for Palin .
If the Bridge To Nowhere is worth checking out , why are n't the pregnancy 's bizarre details ?
Without the Down Syndrome pregnancy , Palin would not have had the rock - star appeal to the pro-life base that contributed to her selection .
She made it a political issue by holding up the baby at the convention .
I do not know the truth and have never claimed that Palin is lying .
I have always stated that bringing a baby with Down Syndrome into the world is a noble and beautiful thing .
I have simply asked , given the implausible , if possible , circumstances , that a person running for vice - president provide some basic evidence for a very strange and unclear story .
For a photograph of Palin pregnant with one of her previous children , see below .
Compare and contrast .
Remember that , as a general rule , pregnant mothers show more with each successive pregnancy .
Remember also , as a general rule , that successive labors come more quickly .
I think it 's time Palin 's doctor , Catherine Baldwin - Johnson talked to the press , do n't you think ?
And that the McCain campaign tell us exactly what they knew and asked all along .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Nederland is in Meppel een merkwaardig stukje architectuur rijker met een huis van 70 cm breed .
De oorspronkelijke slagerswinkel moest er plaats ruimen voor de verbreding van een weg .
Architect - kunstenaar Eric de Leeuw vond er bijgevolg niet beter op om de woning te versmallen .

Kunstenaar en architect Eric de Leeuw van het architectenbureau de Leeuw Van Zanten heeft onlangs een bijzonder werk opgeleverd .
Hij werd door de gemeente Meppel gevraagd na te denken over het pand Prinsengracht 2 in het kader van een herstructurering van de verkeersroutes in het stadcentrum .
De Leeuw kwam bij deze meervoudige opdracht met een intrigerende oplossing : de woning versmallen tot 70 cm .
Nog smalle huizen Categoriseren is een menselijke bezigheid .
Vraag een willekeurige Amerikaan iets over zijn land en binnen vijf zinnen zijn waarschijnlijk de woorden langste , hoogste of dikste al gevallen ...
Ook Nederlanders blijken dol op records , zo kennen we uit Amsterdam het smalste huis ter wereld - Singel nummer 7 - , slechts 100 cm breed .
Wie op ' smalste huis ' googlet krijgt razendsnel ook resultaten uit Leiden , Dordrecht , Den Haag , Utrecht en zelfs uit New York .
In België is die eer voor een woning in Antwerpen weggelegd die 2,5 meter breed is .
Comprimeren van de geschiedenis
In deze recordreeks kan nu ook Meppel worden genoemd .
Aan de Prinsengracht 2 was ooit een slagerswinkel gevestigd .
Door het verbreden van een weg moest dat pand verdwijnen .
In plaats van het simpelweg slopen en het ontstane lidteken wegwerken achter een laagje stucwerk of baksteen zou je de gekozen strategie van De Leeuw letterlijk ' het comprimeren van de geschiedenis ' kunnen noemen .
Door het pand te versmallen tot 70 cm en de zo ontstane ruimte toe te voegen aan het overgebleven buurpand zijn de geschiedenis van de plek en het nieuwe beeld nu onlosmakelijk aan elkaar verbonden .
Verpersoonlijken
Dit concept werd overigens door de architecten niet letterlijk genomen maar , zoals ze zelf zeggen : " op een mimetische wijze verwerkt . "
Mimetisch is een term die je kunt uitleggen als het leren van een kind .
Een kind leert door na te bootsen en dat vervolgens te verpersoonlijken ; het resultaat is daarna altijd iets anders dan het origineel .
Enig punt van kritiek kan zijn dat het zadeldak hier in het mimetische proces vervangen is door een plat dak .
Is dit nieuwe beeld , dat oogt als of het er al jaren staat , nu nog wel herkenbaar als een herinnering , als gelaagdheid van een geschiedenis ?
Wie goed kijkt moet die vraag wel met ja beantwoorden , immers het hardstenen stoepje , het huisnummer en de entree , alles is nog te herkennen ...
EDIT : Over one month later they are still playing religious songs that can be heard at least six blocks away .
The songs marking noon and 6:00 pm go on for a minute .
I understand that church bells evoke a nostalgic response from many of the commentators , but I find it hard to believe that if an Islamic call to prayer were blasted over the neighborhood you would approve .
For those of you who live within earshot you have probably already heard the All Pilgrims Church Christmas chiming .
Starting on November 30 they have been banging out such classics as “ Oh come all ye faithful ” to mark the passage of time .
I have lived four blocks from them for over three years and this is the first December that they have chosen to create noise pollution every half hour .
While Broadway is far from a quiet street and it has its fair share of obnoxious music ( think Panache ’s love of Cher for instance ) the bells at All Pilgrims have a far greater radius of impact .
While All Pilgrims should be commended for their inclusive style to proselytizing ( i < 3 rainbow flags on churches ) it does not excuse their decision to force Christmas music into the homes of people like myself who neither celebrate Christmas nor subscribe to a religion .
Please take the time to let them know that their broadcasting of hymnals is not appreciated .
Thank you .
A weaker government in Ottawa is eminently satisfying .
Sovereignists have no interest in people looking at Ottawa as a stable serious government .
The image must be one of a weak , disoriented government , which will become weaker and more disoriented in the future .
This is perfect .
The majority of the people in my riding are francophones and are proud of their heritage .
As a Franco - Ontarian member , I share their pride .
I was honoured to serve Canada 's francophones as the Parliamentary Secretary for Official Languages during the 39th parliament .
Franco - Ontarians are fiercely opposed to Quebec sovereignty .
Not only are we proud of our language , but we are also proud of being Canadians .
We want a united , undivided Canada .
The people in my riding are against the coalition .
In this past week , I have been to all four corners of my riding and the vast majority are not happy with the idea of a coalition for several reasons .
As the stated earlier this week , the great privilege of governing must be earned from the electorate , not taken .
A prime minister receives his mandate from the Canadian people and it is unconscionable that the wants to see himself crowned without a mandate from Canadians based on a backroom deal with the NDP and the separatists .
The opposition leader and his Liberal coalition absolutely do not want to face the people of Canada .
They simply want power with no election .
Canadians understand that the separatist coalition is not about the economic and fiscal update .
It is about seizing power without an election .
It is not about a budget or about the economy .
It is about seizing power without an election .
It is not about democracy .
It is about seizing power without an election .
The opposition is trying to install a coalition government led by the Liberal Party of Canada , a party that received its lowest level of support since 1867 .
The opposition is talking about installing the Leader of the Opposition as prime minister , the same leader who was massively rejected by the Canadian voters barely six weeks ago .
Now Canadians are learning that the NDP and Bloc were making backroom deals even before the economic update .
It is important to understand that the opposition parties have the right to disagree with our economic update , and they even have the right to vote against it .
If the government falls during a confidence vote , it results in an election .
Canadians have a right to choose their government .
That is how democracy works .
Canadians should not suddenly be led by a coalition government simply because that is what the coalition wants .
Not only would Canadians have forced upon them a coalition led by a party that promised a job - killing carbon tax , they would be working hand in hand with a socialist party that has promised to raise business taxes and , worst of all , that would be propped up by a separatist party whose sole purpose is to break up Canada .
In addition , he said on October 10 , only seven weeks ago , in the Chronicle - Herald , “ I can't govern with somebody who wants to raise the taxes by $ 50 billion ” .
The has turned his back on his previous comments and now he is ready to put the interests of our country at stake for a self - serving and highly irresponsible power grab .
This is a desperate move on behalf of the opposition and the result would be disastrous for Canada and for our Canadian economy .
Do not take my word on it .
The Leader of the Opposition himself said in the September 23 edition of the Toronto Star only 10 weeks ago , “ [ The leader of the NDP ] does not understand the economy .
I cannot think that Canadians will give their support to a man who will kill jobs everywhere in the country in raising the corporate tax ” .
We are taking action in these uncertain economic times , but as we are focusing on the economy , the opposition is putting its own interests ahead of the interests of Canadians .
The Liberal , NDP and Bloc refuse to accept the results of the election we had just six weeks ago .
They are now conspiring through secret meetings and backroom deals to seize power and to install an unelected coalition led by a leader that Canadians overwhelmingly rejected on October 14 .
While other countries around the world are now scrambling to come up with ways to address the current economic situation , Canada is ahead of the curve , with an ambitious infrastructure plan already in place and more money flowing through our economy , thanks to the tax reductions we have introduced .
It is important to remember that our Conservative government saw this economic situation coming long ago and we have been taking action all along , but particularly since early last year when we tabled our 2008 budget entitled “ Responsible Leadership for Uncertain Times ” .
It is in this budget that we moved ahead with our historic $ 33 billion infrastructure plan and continued to lower taxes for all Canadian families and businesses .
Since becoming the government , we have consulted with financial experts and a wide variety of stakeholders on how best to protect and grow Canada 's economies .
We continue to work with these financial experts and stakeholders as we prepare the government 's 2009 federal budget , which will build on our strong record of providing responsible and focused spending to address the needs of Canadians and to stimulate our economy .
Let me remind everyone that this fiscal update is about taking certain specific measures and making urgent updates to this year 's tax code .
The economic and fiscal update is not a budget and it was never intended to be a budget .
A budget is a budget and I congratulate our on his initiative to accelerate the tabling of the budget to January 2009 .
This will be one of the earliest tablings of a federal budget in the history of Canada and we are doing this in order to address the exceptional economic circumstances in which we find ourselves .
We have also taken immediate action to address the concerns of vulnerable Canadians such as our seniors , in light of the current economic situation .
These measures include reducing the required minimum withdrawal amounts for their registered retirement income funds by 25 % for 2008 .
I am proud to stand in the House today in support of our government 's economic update , one of the many initiatives our government is taking to protect Canada 's future .
In our economic and fiscal update , we asked politicians to put the interests of Canadians ahead of their own by making sacrifices in solidarity with the tens of millions of Canadians across this country who are themselves making sacrifices to get through these tough and uncertain economic times .
As the member for Glengarry — Prescott — Russell , I would like my voters to know that I have worked hard to represent them here in the House of Commons over the past three years and I will continue to do so .
Mr. Speaker , as this is the first time I rise in this 40th Parliament , my first words are those of thanks to the people of for having elected me to be their member of Parliament a second time .
[ English ]
Order , please .
I would remind the hon .
member not to use proper names but riding names or titles .
I thought I heard the proper name of a member of the Bloc Québécois .
[ Translation ]
I encourage each of my constituents and all Canadians to make their views known on this very important issue .
There are many websites , including mine , that will help them make their voices heard .
Now is the time to act .
Now is the time to stand up for Canada .
However , the Liberal Party and the NDP have crafted a deal with the separatist Bloc party , a party whose main aim is to attack the unity of Canada .
They have formed a coalition and are trying to seize power and install the as the prime minister , the same leader who was overwhelmingly rejected by Canadians and by my constituents just seven weeks ago .
They want to do all of that without an election .
Given these unprecedented events here on the Hill , I would like to reassure the people of my riding that I am their member of Parliament .
They elected me , gave me a strong mandate and that will not change during these challenging times .
We have shown that we are willing to compromise with the opposition parties in order to have our economic statement passed , which would be in the interest of all Canadians .
I therefore invite the opposition to show wisdom and patience and to wait for the 2009 budget , which will be tabled in the weeks to come .
Even though we wanted to lead by example by depriving our own party of subsidies , it is now clear that the opposition parties are not willing to put Canadians ' interests ahead of their own .
We have withdrawn our proposal to eliminate the subsidy for politicians and political parties .
Canadians can see for themselves the threat to our national unity that the separatist coalition poses .
The second concern is also with the presuming that he will be the next prime minister .
There is a pride here that offends Canadians .
Canadians do not like arrogance in politicians and the Leader of the Opposition was soundly defeated by Canadians in the last election and Canadians , Liberal Party members and supporters included , feel strongly that he should not be the prime minister just because he says so .
We also need to remember that former premier Jacques Parizeau wholeheartedly applauded the impressive victory by the Bloc leader and the Bloc Québécois in the recent election .
The Bloc is now part and parcel of the proposed coalition government in Ottawa .
[ Translation ]
I hear a member from Alberta raising an issue that is divisive to the country .
We , in this chamber , want unity in this country .
I have a second question .
If the support of the Bloc Québécois is so heinous and awful , why did his government rely on that vote 140 times in the last Parliament ?
Why did they accept the support 140 times for bills they thought were important to move their agenda forward if it is so awful to accept the support of the Bloc Québécois on bills before Parliament ?
The first question goes to the issue of arrogance and honesty that he said were so important in a leader .
Did the tell the truth when he said that there were no flags behind the table where the three signatories to the coalition entente took place ?
Did he tell the truth ?
Mr. Speaker , I have a great deal of respect for the hon .
member , and I know he was a member of the Canadian Forces , but I must ask him two simple questions .
With respect to the separatist Bloc party , if the Bloc party chooses to vote for legislation that the government has put in place , that is fine and well , but we do not and never will have a formal power - sharing agreement through which the government will be ruled with the separatist Bloc .
That is the difference , and it is a huge difference .
The opposition has given the separatist Bloc veto power over matters that affect Canada .
Mr. Speaker , I am glad my colleague raised the question of the flags .
The answer is , categorically , that there were no Canadian flags directly behind the three leaders who were signing that agreement .
The Canadians flags were pushed well off to the side and they were not behind the three leaders signing that backroom deal contract .
I thank the member for giving me the opportunity to clarify regarding the absence of Canadian flags behind the three leaders during that signing agreement .
[ Translation ]
I have a slightly more serious question about how the Conservatives are changing their tune , depending on whether they are speaking French or English .
It is funny : when I listen to the interpretation provided by the people in the booths , who do an outstanding job , I notice that when the word “ separatists ” is used in English , it is translated as “ séparatistes ” in French and that when the word “ souverainistes ” is used in French , it is translated as “ sovereignists ” in English .
Everyone understand that .
Only the Conservatives are using double - talk .
In French , so as not to offend Quebeckers , they are using the term “ souverainistes ” , and in English , to do a little Quebec - bashing , to show their hatred for Quebeckers , they are using the term “ separatistssssssss ” .
Mr. Speaker , everyone wants to speak this morning .
According to the Conservatives ' logic , your chair will have to be changed , because the flag to your right will have to be positioned behind you .
According to the Conservatives , it is not good to have a flag off to the side .
It must be behind people .
This is a completely fallacious argument .
[ English ]
I thank members for giving me the opportunity to clarify our messaging and to point out that it is the Bloc MPs who are the separatists .
We are not talking about Quebec or Quebeckers , Franco - Ontarians , francophones in Quebec or francophones in Canada .
We are not talking about francophones .
Rather , we are talking about Bloc Québécois members who are separatists or sovereignists .
That is the biggest problem .
However , I want to clarify that we are delivering exactly the same message and the Bloc is a separatist party .
It admits that .
The Bloc leader and Mr. Parizeau admit that .
I also want to be clear on our messaging .
Mr. Speaker , I think it is fair to point out , and the member opposite should realize this , that different languages have different terms and different meanings .
It is fine to say separatists in English and to say souverainistes en français .
[ Translation ]
I hope the hon .
member will not beat about the bush and give us a bunch of rhetoric .
I would like him to answer those two questions .
Meanwhile , putting all that aside , I would like the hon .
member to answer the following question .
Supposing there is a budget in January , and the Liberals and the NDP vote against it , while the Bloc Québécois — the so - called separatists — vote with the Conservatives , will the say that he cannot accept a vote obtained from the separatists and that he must call an election ?
Did the call the three opposition leaders so as to be able to examine the economic problems and come up with a budget ?
Yes or no ?
I will speed things up .
During the election , the said that if he obtained a minority government , he would work with the opposition .
The day after the election , he also addressed the nation and said that since it had elected a minority government , he would work with the opposition to make Parliament work .
In short , this shows how low people have sunk in this House of Commons .
We should instead be focusing on the economy and people who have lost their jobs .
Mr. Speaker , we have reached the point where we have to fight to determine what side the Canadian flag is on .
I listened to the 's address to the nation last night .
The Canadian flag was not behind him ; it was on either side of him .
[ English ]
Speaking about minority governments and wanting to work with the opposition , once again last night the , on national television , asked the opposition parties to submit their ideas and to work with the government .
They will not do so and the leader of the NDP had a secret deal with the separatist Bloc from long ago .
That is right from the mouth of the leader of the NDP , and that is the problem .
Does the NDP really want to work for Canadians and work with the government when it is putting in place , behind the backs of Canadians , a secret deal with the Bloc party .
I think not .
As I mentioned , when it comes to a party , if they want to vote in favour of legislation that the government has tabled , that is fine , and the government will not reject that , but to put in place a formal power - sharing agreement with which to govern Canada , that is wrong .
Mr. Speaker , I am surprised how shallow the questions really are .
I think the member should be taking things a little more seriously .
Could my hon .
colleague comment on the wisdom or folly of getting out ahead of what is happening in the U.S. , particularly as it has the most interlinked economy and industries with us , and the wisdom of waiting until January 27 to field a budget that would take account of what the Americans are doing ?
Mr. Speaker , I would like to get back to the issue of the economic update and some facts .
The fact is that Canada represents about 2 % of the world economy .
Some people seem to think that we can go it alone without taking account of what the other 98 % is doing , and that , of course , is ridiculous .
I ask the opposition to put aside its power grab .
Let us work together for the interests of our economy .
I would like to reiterate what the said last night .
We are asking the opposition to participate in this process .
The has said that the budget will be tabled in January .
There is time between now and January for the opposition to participate in this budget and in this very important process for all Canadians .
The auto industry is interconnected between the United States and Canada and it would be imprudent for Canada to charge ahead with our own stimulus package without co-ordinating this with the impact the U.S. package may have in Canada .
It is better that we take the time to consult , as I mentioned , with our financial experts , stakeholders and Canadians , keeping an eye on what the Americans are doing , and that we all work together .
In our economic update , we were very clear that stimulating the economy was important and necessary .
However , it is also necessary to work with our biggest trading partner , the United States , which is about to have a change of government .
Now is the time for us to stop the rhetoric about how we will do this and who will govern .
We are talking about the economic livelihood and vibrancy of Canada .
We are asking all members of Parliament to stop the politics and start to put the interests of people ahead of partisan interests .
We can .
We can accelerate the infrastructure programs .
We can make stimulative investments in certain areas where job losses are anticipated .
We can mitigate those job losses , or we can invest in those areas where we know we can quickly get jobs put on the table .
How can we ignore the fact that Canadians will be looking at this and saying , “ Ca n't you mitigate the situation ?
Ca n't you do something ? ”
We have a lot of input from the provinces , the economic forecasters , Canadians and every one of the political parties .
They have all called for an economic stimulus .
The auto sector , the manufacturing sector , the forestry sector and the health care system have called for it .
The OECD has forecasted that we will lose about 250,000 jobs in the near future .
That is a lot of pain for a lot of Canadians .
I wonder what Canadians would say if the government immediately announced that Parliament would resume on January 4 , not the January 27 , and that the would come to this place present a mini- budget , not a full - blown budget , and lay on the table the principal strategies and actions to address the realities of the Canadian economic crisis ?
Know what ?
Canadians would say that would be the responsible thing to do .
Canadians would look at it carefully and they would seek the assessment of the experts to see if this would be a good thing .
When are we going to change ?
When are we going to start accepting facts ?
When are we going to start taking decisive action when action is necessary ?
The turnout rate in the last election was very low .
I have no proof of the reasons , but I can only speculate that it was because of the nastiness , the games , the lack of credibility , the lack of confidence , that ordinary , law - abiding decent people looked at Parliament and the government and said that they did not want to have anything to do with us .
It is not credible , and the article is all about that .
The government has misled Canadians and parliamentarians .
On top of that , and I will not go into it , because it would be fun , it threw in some items which would inflame a few people .
It had nothing to do with protecting the jobs , savings , mortgages and pensions of Canadians .
It had to do with politics .
That is why Canadians are so upset .
If we look at this very carefully , this is not a subjective issue .
This is a situation where the numbers speak for themselves .
We now have the numbers rolling in that show we are already in a recession .
They show that we are already incurring deficits .
They show that our growth has gone down , not up .
Yet the economic statement says that we still will have 0.3 % growth .
Mr. Paul Szabo :
They must be all wrong and the is the only one who knows .
Why does the Parliamentary Budget Officer not agree with the ?
The forecasters on whom the finance minister relies for budgeting do not agree with the finance minister .
The OECD does not agree with the finance minister .
Nobody in the G20 agrees with our finance minister .
We are in a deflationary cycle now .
In fact , the growth rate included in the economic statement for the next fiscal year was 0.3 % , the highest projected growth rate of any expert who ever opined on such a factor .
Most countries are between 0 % growth and minus 0.2 % growth .
This article from a forecaster , one the has been relying on , says that the finance minister is wrong .
We cannot assume that what he did in prior years will continue to have that stimulative effect .
It is not there .
If we wait to have perfect information before we do something , we may have missed the boat and we may spend the money and get no return for it because we have buried ourselves so badly we can not get out .
Anybody who has taken economics 101 or better knows about the concept of economic lags .
An economic lag tells us to do something , but it will take three , six , nine months , depending on what it is , before it has any implications .
The says that what the government has done in the past will continue to stimulate the economy by $ 31 billion a year .
That is why he has not taken any additional measures right away in terms of economic stimulus .
This is the fundamental fact .
The has said time and time again that he wants to wait and see whether we need an economic stimulus .
He wants to wait and see whether jobs are lost .
In the fiscal update the argued that his previous tax cuts were stimulating the Canadian economy by about $ 31 billion .
Let me remind the House about the presumption of honesty , integrity , credibility and accountability .
There is an interesting article in the Globe and Mail , which I want to bring to the attention of the House and of Canadians because I think it is useful .
The headline reads “ [ Finance Minister 's ] plan prolongs the pain ” .
This opinion is from one of the key forecasters who the federal government depends on to do its budgeting and the update on November 27 .
The Parliamentary Budget Officer has said , notwithstanding the protestations of the government , that the government is solely responsible for the economic mess we are in today , and it will get worse .
I am a chartered accountant , and I do not want to give an accounting lesson , but I want members to understand that there are some fundamentals we should not discount or ignore or say that is not the case and summarily dismiss them .
They are facts .
Let me give an example .
If government employees are working in that building and a decision is made to sell that building and lease it back , rent will have to be paid .
If a building is owned , rent is not paid , but there are other costs such as maintenance and capital cost allowances , et cetera .
There are some financial implications .
Generally speaking , a well managed asset means a better deal could be done than a lease deal because there would be no rate of return built into the leasing costs .
It is important to understand that principles were articulated in the 's economic statement of November 27 , which included such things as the sale of $ 10 billion worth of assets .
If $ 10 billion worth of assets are sold , there are $ 10 billion to spend , once .
Those assets were either providing a return or they were eliminating an expense that we would otherwise have had to incur .
For instance , we can sell an asset , get the profit from the sale of that asset and then use that to spend .
That is available for one year .
Alternatively , we can keep the asset , which will pay dividends or some return , rent or whatever it might be , and that benefit will be there each and every year for as long as we own the asset .
That was included in the budgets that were presented to Parliament .
Those are the principles under which budgets were prepared and those are the principles under which , not only did we get the government books in order , but we had 10 years of surplus to pay down debt , restore funding to all of the important programs that Canadians need and deserve , and reduce taxes , but only when they were affordable .
However , there was another principle in there , the prudence principle .
The prudence principle said that there has been some discomfort with the government 's forecasting of growth rates and interest rates .
Even though we rely on the input of various parties , we will build into our budgeting a prudence factor .
The prudence factor took the average projected GDP growth rate of the third party experts and reduced it by either a quarter or a half , in fact it was a very conservative estimate of growth .
We did not want to overstate it .
If anything , I would rather understate growth than overstate it , so we get the worst case scenario in our budgeting .
Included in the budgetary planning and strategy for the Liberal government was a contingency reserve .
It is surprising that even the thought it was actually money sitting as a reserve to spend if we needed it .
The contingency reserve is not money sitting somewhere .
It is a principle .
The contingency reserve says that once we get to a position where we only have a $ 3 billion surplus , we will not spend any more money unless there is a significant unplanned , unanticipated activity , like a SARS crisis , a BSE crisis or 9/11 .
That is when we can dip into that last $ 3 billion of the ongoing surplus .
When we were faced with issues , such as the SARS crisis , the BSE crisis , the Mexican peso crisis and even 9/11 , those had significant impacts on the financial circumstances of every government involved with those events .
The Conservative government 's mechanics of budgeting and spending has changed the way in which budgeting has been approached in the past .
In the past , when the Liberals , for instance , took over in 1993 and inherited a $ 42 billion annual deficit , we had to get our fiscal house in order .
It took until 1997 for that to happen but since then we have had surplus budgets .
Those budgets were achieved and , in many cases , over .
The key is that if we do not pay down some debt in good times , we will never pay it down in bad times .
That is important , which is why having a surplus is not a bad thing .
If we look at page 50 , we see that the government is , for the next fiscal year , projecting a $ 6 billion deficit .
It inherited a $ 13 billion annual surplus but that is gone .
There is no surplus .
It was depleted by the erosion of the tax base and by excessive spending at a time when we should have been prudent .
Let there be no question , from any side of the House , that the numbers in the deficit scenario laid out by the in the economic statement on November 27 reflect what the government expects to see in the absence of doing anything else .
It has no budget and no stimulus package .
What it is saying is that it should just keep going and do nothing .
A report was released by Mr. Page in which he points out that the Conservative fiscal policy decisions are largely to blame for what is occurring .
He states :
He is an appointee of the , someone who is charged with the responsibility of giving the facts .
He said clearly that it was due to the erosion of the tax base .
It was due to an increase in spending by over $ 40 billion annually , which put us into a deficit situation .
Therefore , the starting point of this debate should be on what the Parliamentary Budget Officer said on November 20 .
He is an officer of Parliament and he said that the financial distress that the Government of Canada was presently experiencing had nothing to do with the global financial crisis or the credit crunch .
In fact , he went further to say that the problems that we were experiencing from a fiscal standpoint were totally due to the actions or inactions of the current government , the Conservative government .
By providing an independent Parliamentary Budget Officer who has full access to the resources of the finance department , the same as the finance minister , he or she can provide information that Canadians all can rely upon .
In the election of 2006 , accountability was the very first issue that Parliament dealt with .
Under the Federal Accountability Act , we established the position of Parliamentary Budget Officer .
The Parliamentary budget Officer , Mr. Page , was appointed by the because , in the past , members of Parliament in some parties had been expressing their concern about the integrity of the information being provided by the government .
Accountability , to m , means true , full and plain disclosure of the reasons that one did or did not do something so that people will understand .
To split hairs , to give a piece of the story without the other part of it tends to lead to a variety of interpretations rather than the truth , and I think that is what frustrates Canadians .
Parliament operates on the basis of confidence .
It means that the governing party enjoys the confidence of the House , and it is important to remember that .
It also presumes the integrity of the information that is provided outside of this chamber .
It also operates on the presumption of honesty .
Unfortunately , far too often we have situations where people like to state things in a manner that h is not really accountable .
There is a very important matter before us and it is a matter that will affect the daily lives of virtually every Canadian .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to participate in the debate on the economic update that was delivered on November 27 by the .
Unfortunately , the latitude of the debate has been stretched beyond recognition .
We have spent far too much time debating politics and other strategic activities .
Mr. Speaker , in light of the events that are taking place as we speak , my question is this .
What would Robert Baldwin and Louis - Hippolyte La Fontaine , two fathers of responsible government in Canada , two citizens , one francophone , one anglophone , who reached across the aisle to forge a consensus , two people who , out of the rebellions of Upper and Lower Canada in the 19th century , argued that violence was not the solution , but rather a redefined role for the legislative branch of government , one that would see the legislative branch as central to the political life of a nation , have said about the events that have transpired in the House and outside of the House this week ?
They were bright men .
That is what they would have done and that is what the government should do .
Mr. Speaker , they would probably tell us to get back to work .
They would probably tell us to do our job .
They would probably tell us to put the interest of the people before our own interest .
They probably would tell us to stop playing politics in Parliament and start making good policy that is going to deliver jobs , that is going to protect older workers , that is going to amend the EI , that is going to deal with immigration policy that is fair and reasonable , that is going to deal with helping young people get the skills training they need and the transitioning things .
Did the three opposition parties have any choice , given the government 's disregard for prudent fiscal management and its refusal to stimulate the economy and to provide a plan , but to provide the people of Canada with an alternative to restore trust and confidence in the House and to provide sound fiscal management of the economy ?
Mr. Speaker , the member for referred to today ' swherein a leading economic think tank , which the Department of Finance depends upon to provide its economic forecasts , stated that the update of the last week would extend the country 's recession and exacerbate the threat of deflation .
In fact , it said that it would put us into a dangerous deflationary spiral .
The fact is the government has lost the confidence of Parliament and the reason being , in one word , is trust .
It is dangerously wrong because it says that the government is in denial about the financial tsunami that has not even hit Canada yet .
We have not even seen it .
We are already in deficit and yet this is still coming .
Mr. Speaker , the hon .
member for has asked a responsible question .
I hope Canadians will see that third parties advising the government have expressed their shock and dismay at the misleading and totally non-factual information presented to Parliament and all Canadians in the fiscal update .
The numbers are just wrong .
This has been coming back to me over and over again .
The had a throne speech .
He had an economic update .
Last night he had an opportunity to tell the nation that he had an economic plan which would include stimuli so we could have infrastructure , so we could address the needs of the automotive , manufacturing and forestry sectors , so we could protect citizens and ensure that those who were laid off would have employment insurance benefits and so we could improve the lives of families by increasing the child tax benefit .
Mr. Speaker , for the past week , or perhaps even longer , I have been thinking of a line from Dante who said that the hottest parts of hell were reserved for those who in times of great national crisis refused to act .
He concludes that the economic coalition of the NDP and the Liberals is a responsible one that will in fact address the needs of Canadians and protect their jobs , their mortgages , their savings and their pensions .
The expert went on to say that he assessed the impact measures of the proposed coalition of the NDP and the Liberals and the policy framework that they laid out .
He estimated that the $ 15 billion stimulus in 2009 would add 1.4 percentage points to the growth for next year , for a total of 1.6 % growth as long term measures hit the economy early .
Let me finish off with the Globe and Mail article today .
The opinion of the experts is that the only way to break the credit logjam is for the fiscal policy to leap into action and boost the economy .
That view was shared by the International Monetary Fund and was signed on to by the leaders of the group of 20 summit in Washington last month , which included the of Canada .
This economic update includes much of what was pointed out or has been talked about .
It appears the Liberals are actually emulating many of the things we are planning to do , but in January .
As a former health care worker , I see the continuation of the health care transfers .
That continuation will not only allow health care ; it will also allow us to have some stimulus .
I met with forestry workers .
They are having challenging times , but there is a whole program around retraining .
Yesterday I met with someone who is looking at working with one of our first nations communities in terms of a secondary biofuel .
Mr. Speaker , as a new member I have been listening very carefully .
I have also been watching what has been happening in my riding and some of the stimulus in terms of western economic diversification that has been happening as we speak .
I toured the airport and saw many men working to expand our airport through western economic diversification .
The government has not placed responsible , viable plans on the table .
It has lost the confidence of Parliament .
It can not be trusted .
It has no interest in working in a minority government or in making it work .
The government must be replaced .
Here is what we should do : how about an accelerated infrastructure program ?
How about housing and retrofit ?
How about helping key sectors such as the manufacturing , forestry and auto sectors , contingent on plans to rehabilitate them ?
How about skills training ?
How about getting rid of the EI crown corporation and eliminating the two - week waiting period for EI ?
How about lowering the RRIF withdrawal rate by 50 % , not just 25 % , and dealing with the upcoming issue of pension bankruptcies ?
How about dealing with the transition of older workers ?
How about making sure immigration reform is fair and deals with the needs and requirements of Canadians ?
How about regional development , early childhood learning and development , and the environment ?
Mr. Speaker , what has been proposed is to take away the rights of workers and women , to take away pay equity and to take away democratic funding .
What has been proposed is to cut literacy programs , cut women 's programs and cut the court challenges program .
Could the member , with his accounting background , expand a little more ?
Does he see investments in infrastructure , such as investments in housing and job creation , as a wise investment for the future ?
I enjoyed his analogy of buying a house versus renting .
I am from Nova Scotia , where we have very high rates of poverty .
However , we also have very high rates of home ownership , because Nova Scotians realize that it is a wise investment to balance the household budget on the one hand and to buy a home and invest at a good rate of return on the other .
The cash flow that must be invested may increase the deficit , but it may be necessary to protect Canadians .
Mr. Speaker , of course they are wise investments when the results are returns such as job creation or mitigation of job loss .
That is a very good return , because we have to look at the cost of doing nothing .
Then people go on employment insurance , which all of a sudden is added to the deficit for the year .
: Mr. Speaker , it is indeed an honour to speak in debate on the government ’s economic update document .
This debate is rapidly morphing into one of the most controversial debates in Canadian history .
For all its merits , the economic update presented by the on November 27 has singularly flushed out the opposition ’s pent - up need to wrest power from the government .
Mr. Speaker , it is indeed an honour to speak in debate on the government ’s economic update document .
This debate is rapidly morphing into one of the most controversial debates in Canadian history .
For all its merits , the economic update presented by the on November 27 has singularly flushed out the opposition ’s pent - up need to wrest power from the government .
I have received many phone calls from my constituents .
They are puzzled , disappointed and outraged by the opposition ’s unprecedented attempt to form its own government illegitimately .
The three opposition parties are desperate enough to form an unholy alliance that runs counter to the conventional wisdom , and worse , counter to the desire of voters in the recent federal election .
I have constituents who believe the leaders of these parties should not only be thwarted in this gluttonous attempt to grab power , but should spend their time in leg irons .
Canada is laid low by this coalition , and if power is allowed to change hands on this issue , we stand to become an international black hole at this critical economic juncture .
Let us consider for a moment why the economic update is a credible document that is custom made to plot Canada ’s course through an economic storm .
The opposition ’s antics have unfortunately put the document ’s real intent on the back burner .
Let me interject something here : the opposition had decided to seize power in a bloodless coup even before they saw our economic update .
They have admitted as much .
Even before we brought in a budget , they feared Canadians might really like what we were doing and what we were presenting .
The agreement between the NDP and the separatist Bloc had already been made long before this fiasco unfolded .
Any scheme , any plan would have been enough to precipitate what they are doing here today .
The naysayers have obscured the fact that the government has reduced the federal debt by $ 37 billion .
That is unprecedented .
That is something many predicted would be impossible to do .
We have done it .
Over 2007 - 08 and the five years following , we will have reduced taxes by nearly $ 200 billion .
That too will be an unbelievable accomplishment .
We will have reduced the tax rate on new business investment to the lowest level in the G7 by 2010 .
When people talk about an economic stimulus , we have already done it .
We have made unprecedented investments in job - creating infrastructure .
We have invested in science and technology .
We are investing in education and training .
We all know that an intelligent investment provides financial returns to workers , to industry and to government .
The opposition would see that we have already addressed the things they are complaining about , if they would only look at the document .
The opposition contends that this government has failed to provide fiscal stimulus for the economy .
Perhaps they should get around to reading what we have done and looking at how we compare to the other industrialized nations .
Nothing could be further from the truth than their accusations .
No advanced industrialized economy in the world has enacted measures as large as those in Canada .
We have done more than any other country .
It is notable that the stimulus measures in most countries are temporary , yet the Canadian measures are permanent , and when compared to the permanent measures chosen by some other countries , Canada ’s are the highest .
Since 2006 , the government has announced stimuli equal to 1.4 % of GDP .
They are incremental in 2008 - 09 and are almost 2 % of GDP in 2009 - 10 .
Most countries with permanent stimuli are closer to 0.1 % to 0.3 % .
We are many times higher in this country .
I think the opposition is frustrated by the fact that we are being so successful .
This government understands trends .
When stimulus measures are temporary , their impact on GDP the following year is negative .
We see some of these things happening in other countries .
The stimuli being suggested by the NDP , Liberal and separatist Bloc have been tried in other countries , including the U.S. , and they have not worked .
It would be irresponsible for us to carry out some of the suggestions the other side is contemplating .
It would be blindly putting money into programs that in other areas have already been proven to be ineffectual .
In the year after the measures expire , the government is contributing less to GDP than the year before .
It subtracts from year - over - year growth when we put in place ineffective measures to stimulate the economy .
Does the opposition want this country to grow or not ?
Let us consider the opposition 's real motive for cobbling together a power grab that millions of people find unsettling , undemocratic and downright un-Canadian .
One has to seriously consider what is not to like about a government that has changed the economic face of an entire country for the better .
I would be pleased to tell the House what is not to like about this document from the opposition 's perspective .
The initial draft of this document was going to remove the taxpayer subsidy paid to political parties , one of three subsidies they receive .
It was about cutting spending , which would have hurt three opposition parties , because their fundraising tactics are all about entitlements .
It is about abject greed .
Again , I want to emphasize that we were only removing partial subsidies to politicians .
The opposition 's public relations and media relations machines have been cranking out top - notch propaganda ever since November 27 .
The scale of the opposition 's abject greed was something we did not foresee .
That was a misjudgment on our part .
That is where we went wrong .
We gave the opposition too much credit for being genuinely concerned about preserving Canada 's superior economic status .
We should have known opposition members would react this way , but we had a modicum of faith that they too would see fit to curtail the handover of Canadians ' hard - earned wages to parties that were really doing nothing to earn it .
My own party would have taken the biggest hit of all , but we were convinced that old - fashioned political fundraising would have kept us strong .
The other parties were not .
All parties should be supported by people who have enough faith in their policies to open their wallets voluntarily and invest in our collective future .
That is democracy .
The opposition parties do not see it that way .
That is why they pretend to object to the economic update as a whole .
My constituents have seen through this , and I suspect Canadians from coast to coast have seen through it as well .
That is why the opposition parties have chosen to hide behind each other 's skirts rather than to take that issue to the people .
Our government would prefer to have another election .
It is a cowardly solution for the opposition to smugly threaten to snatch power without an election .
All three parties need the taxpayer subsidy because they do not have grassroots support to carry on their viable political parties .
This is a cowardly position and I can only hope Canadians will punish them for it .
I fear for the country .
If this coalition is allowed to form a government , I fear that the reaction from western Canadians will be one of intolerance for a kangaroo government that will almost surely neglect their needs .
This is a very divisive move on the part of the opposition .
The Bloc Québécois gets up in the morning to rip this country apart , yet it is an integral part of the coalition that can dictate policy to government .
How have we arrived at a point where the Liberal Party and the NDP will take the Bloc into their tent ?
Attempting to bring down the government is a slap in the face to all Canadians , and to none more than those who live in my province .
The coalition is adding insult to injury for the people who grow our food .
The Liberals , NDP and separatist Bloc are turning a blind eye to Canada 's real risk takers , our farmers , whose livelihoods depend solely on good weather , decent prices and hard work .
The coalition parties should not be surprised if there is a wholesale revolt against their power grab by rural people all across Canada .
They are , by all indications , extremely angry at the entire parliamentary institution , and all of us in this place bear the blame .
This government is attempting to restore parliamentary equilibrium .
We have offered concessions by removing specific controversial issues from our original economic update in an effort to restore calm .
We have offered concessions .
We are willing to work together with the opposition parties .
We have invited them to submit their proposals .
No , they want to simply grab power .
They are not interested in restoring calm .
The new coalition will have nothing of our offer to have it work together with us .
This is clear evidence that the fiscal update was not the issue .
It was an excuse for their banana republic - style , bloodless coup .
Parliament has plummeted to perhaps the lowest ebb in our nation 's history and it is up to us , all of us in this place , to fix it .
Hon. Joseph Volpe :
You believe that so intensely that you have to read it over and over and over .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz : I think I have struck a nerve , Mr. Speaker .
I think some of them do not like the fact that we have pointed out that the Liberals have joined together with the separatist Bloc .
Let me continue .
If we fail in our quest to put the economic well - being of Canadians first , we will surely deserve all the vitriol and derision that comes our way from across the nation , and believe me , it will come .
If we do not relent , if the coalition does not stand down , how can we expect anything but cynicism and outrage in return ?
It is painfully obvious that the coalition was created to provide it with a quick and easy access to the public purse .
That is what it is all about , to get hold of the treasury of Canada .
It is all about getting drunk on power that it has not earned .
On October 14 , the electorate told each one of those parties that they did not deserve to form a government .
That is just six weeks ago .
We have not even had time to bring down a budget , and budgets should be the point at which a government lives or dies .
That is when confidence motions take place .
The opposition was not even willing to wait for that time .
It is incumbent upon the Governor General to remind the coalition parties that the electorate made it clear they were not invited to govern this country .
If I were still a school teacher , I would be tempted to send all three parties to their separate corners to think carefully about what they are threatening to do .
Perhaps more appropriately , they should consider what they are about to undo .
They can tear this country asunder as they cater to their own self - interests .
Punks and street gangs know there is safety in numbers , and these parties are using their collective numbers to bully the country in letting them ascend to power .
Ms. Yasmin Ratansi : Who created that word ?
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz : Opposition parties point to the results of the last election .
They say the Conservatives did not get 50 % of the votes , but I would like to point out to the person heckling me across that the separatist coalition that was formed got zero per cent votes in the last election , yet those parties want to grab power .
The gangs can become unruly mobs when leadership is challenged and the pecking order is disputed .
If this gang is allowed to govern our country , I predict we will all bear witness to a sad litany of internal bickering , distrust and mutiny from that side of the House .
Canadians deserve better .
Canadians deserve an economic future that is sculpted by a party with compassion , the Conservatives .
We must not be hoodwinked by the tub - thumping coalition that bleats long and loud that it is about the people .
In its case , it is about the people , the people who are glueing themselves together across the floor into an alliance that is going to systematically decimate Canadian economic policy .
It will undo all the responsible planning that this party has taken pains to establish .
We saw the economic mess coming and we were ready for it .
To bully us into the cheap seats now will put all we have done at risk , and with it goes the envy of the G7 nations , the stable fiscal policy that has so far averted disaster and kept Canada relatively secure .
I stand here today concerned about the direction the opposition is threatening to take us .
I stand here today concerned about where our country might end up if we hand the reins to a coalition that is rife with spendthrifts , opportunists and separatists .
No good can come of this ugly act of desperation .
The government removed the segments of the economic update deemed most offensive to the opposition parties , yet the smell of blood still permeates this place .
The signing of an unholy alliance on December 1 means that they will not rest until they taste blood .
It lies with all of us to stave them off .
In the meantime , I would urge the opposition parties to stand down , think hard and cool off .
The government has demonstrated a willingness to alter the economic update to better suit the opposition 's needs .
We have done what we can to appease and assuage the ire because the stakes are too important , but there is one thing I believe the three leaders in this coalition should share with all of us :
How did that handshake really feel ?
Why do they not reveal the agreement that they made ?
How much money was promised to come out of the treasury of Canada to appease certain elements in this coalition ?
I want to address some of the questions now that I have finished my main remarks .
We have heard the separatist coalition say that we are not stimulating the economy enough .
We are putting money into infrastructure .
We have already started doing that .
We will continue to do that .
It is complaining that we have not done that .
We are doing more and we have a program .
We want to continue with that program to improve the infrastructure in Canada , more than was ever done by a previous government , and that will help business .
It is being done in a very responsible way , and in a way that will help the country .
It also talked about the fact that we are not stimulating the economy .
We have done a phenomenal amount already .
The tax measures that will take place on January 1 , 2009 and that are being put at risk are the tax - free savings accounts that Canadians will be able to establish .
They can put $ 5,000 every year into an account that will accumulate and be there for anything they would like to use it for in the future , without having to pay any taxes on the interest or any increase in the value of that fund .
It could be phenomenal .
Young people with a tax - free savings account , where they put in whatever savings they are able to , could have a tremendous amount of money to buy a house , to do whatever , or to retire with a very good and secure pension .
We are increasing the basic personal exemption amount to $ 10,100 this year .
We are reducing the general corporate income tax to 19 % .
I know some of my opponents opposite will complain about this , but that is a very effective economic stimulus , something the government has done .
I would also like to elaborate on some of the things we have done already : 1.4 % of GDP , incremental in 2008 - 09 , and almost 2 % of GDP , total in 2009 - 10 since 2006 , has made us the top nation in the G7 when it comes to stimulating the economy .
The opposition parties say we are not doing anything .
We are the envy of all these other nations .
It is a shame that they would make that accusation when it is totally false .
They are repeating a lie so many times in the expectation that Canadians might accept it .
Let Canadians look at the facts .
We are better poised than any other country to really weather the economic storm .
Yes , there will be tough times ahead .
We do not deny that .
We have asked the House to wait for our budget .
However , there is a fear there that when Canadians see what we are doing , we will get more support , and this coalition , this unholy alliance that has been formed , will have to sit in the cheap seats for a long time .
The Indian government raised the country 's security to a " war level " yesterday saying it had certain proof of a Pakistani link to the Mumbai attacks .
The dramatic move prompted Pakistan to say it would end military operations against Islamist militants on the Afghan border , which are critical to the " war on terror " , for an " unwanted conflict " with Delhi .
With bodies being pulled from the Taj Mahal hotel , where gunmen had made their last stand after a rampage that left more than 170 dead , Sri Prakash Jaiswal , India 's minister of state for home affairs , said the country 's " intelligence will be increased to a war level , we are asking the state governments to increase security to a war level " .
The Press Trust of India , India 's official news agency also reported that the government was considering suspending the four - year - old peace process with its neighbour .
Pakistan 's government has condemned the Mumbai assault as a " barbaric act of terrorism " and denied involvement by any " state institutions " .
But the group named by India , Lashkar - e - Taiba , has longstanding relationships with Pakistan 's security establishment .
The US and UK have been urging restraint since the Mumbai terror attacks and escalating tensions on the subcontinent are likely to top the agenda when Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , meets David Miliband , the foreign secretary , today in London .
The Indian minister said yesterday there was " no doubt that the terrorists had come from Pakistan ...
We have evidence of their nationalities .
We will reveal everything soon " .
Indian police say they have in custody one of the gunmen , a 21 - year - old Pakistani , Ajmal Amir Kasab , and detailed accounts of an alleged confession given by him have been played out in the Indian media .
Authorities have also recovered a satellite phone that appears to corroborate much of his testimony .
A fresh confrontation between India and Pakistan would jeopardise attempts by western powers to persuade Pakistan to take on militants linked to the Taliban and al- Qaida in its tribal regions bordering Afghanistan , rather than pitting its forces against India .
Pakistani defence sources said nearly 100,000 troops deployed on the western frontier with Afghanistan could be pulled back to deal with a more immediate threat .
In India the government is struggling to contain public anger over the attacks with demonstrators taking to the streets to vent their anger over the inability to stop the killings .
The wave violence unleashed claimed its first political casualty yesterday when India 's home minister , Shivraj Patil , resigned as the government struggled under growing accusations of security failures .
India 's ruling Congress party , which faces a general election next year , has been attacked by opponents for being soft on terrorism , a potent charge given that India has suffered a major attack every month this year .
The government said last night it would be urgently upgrading maritime and air security and looking to create a federal investigative agency .
The peace process between India and Pakistan now appears in doubt .
" There is a view in the government that India should suspend the peace process ... to show that it is not going to take lightly the deadly carnage in Mumbai , " the Press Trust of India reported .
It quoted sources as saying the government , " including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , is very upset as it feels that Pakistan has not kept its promise made at the highest level to end terrorism directed at India " .
Lashkar - e - Taiba , which is fighting Indian control of the disputed Kashmir region , was behind a deadly 2001 assault on the Indian parliament that pushed New Delhi and Islamabad to the brink of war .
It is believed at least 10 militants carried out the assault on Mumbai .
Among the dead were 18 foreigners , including six Americans and a Briton .

As the warden of San Quentin , I presided over four executions .
After each one , someone on the staff would ask , “ Is the world safer because of what we did tonight ? ”
We knew the answer : No .
I worked in corrections for 30 years , starting as a correctional officer and working my way up to warden at San Quentin and then on to the top job in the state — director of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation .
During those years , I came to believe that the death penalty should be replaced with life without the possibility of parole .
I did n’t reach that conclusion because I ’m soft on crime .
My No. 1 concern is public safety .
I want my children and grandchildren to have the safety and freedom to pursue their dreams .
I know from firsthand experience that some people are dangerous and must be removed from society forever — people such as Robert Lee Massie .
I presided over Massie ’s execution in 2001 .
He was first sentenced to death for the 1965 murder of a mother of two .
But when executions were temporarily banned in 1972 , his sentence was changed to one that would allow parole , and he was released in 1978 .
Months later , he killed a 61 - year - old liquor store owner and was returned to death row .
For supporters of the death penalty , Massie is a poster child .
Yet for me , he stands out among the executions I presided over as the strongest example of how empty and futile the act of execution is .
I remember that night clearly .
It was March 27 , 2001 .
I was the last person to talk to Massie before he died .
After that , I brought in the witnesses .
I looked at the clock to make sure it was after midnight .
I got a signal from two members of my staff who were on the phone with the state Supreme Court and the U.S. attorney general ’s office to make sure there were no last - minute legal impediments to the execution .
There was none , so I gave the order to proceed .
It took several minutes for the lethal injections to take effect .
I did my job , but I do n’t believe it was the right thing to have done .
We should have condemned Massie to permanent imprisonment — that would have made the world safer .
But on the night we executed him , when the question was asked , “ Did this make the world safer ? ” the answer remained no .
Massie needed to be kept away from society , but we did not need to kill him .
Why should we pay to keep him locked up for life ?
I hear that question constantly .
Few people know the answer :
It ’s cheaper — much , much cheaper than execution .
I wish the public knew how much the death penalty affects their wallets .
California spends an additional $ 117 million each year pursuing the execution of those on death row .
Just housing inmates on death row costs an additional $ 90,000 per prisoner per year above what it would cost to house them with the general prison population .
A statewide , bipartisan commission recently concluded that we must spend $ 100 million more each year to fix the many problems with capital punishment in California .
Total price tag : in excess of $ 200 million a year more than simply condemning people to life without the possibility of parole .
If we condemn the worst offenders , like Massie , to permanent imprisonment , resources now spent on the death penalty could be used to investigate unsolved homicides , modernize crime labs and expand effective violence prevention programs , especially in at - risk communities .
The money also could be used to intervene in the lives of children at risk and to invest in their education — to stop future victimization .
As I presided over Massie ’s execution , I thought about the abuse and neglect he endured as a child in the foster care system .
We failed to keep him safe , and our failure contributed to who he was as an adult .
Instead of spending hundreds of millions of dollars to kill him , what if we spent that money on other foster children so that we stop producing men such as Massie in the first place ?
As director of corrections , I visited the Watts district in Los Angeles and met with some ex-offenders .
I learned that the prison system is paroling 300 people every week into the neighborhood without a plan or resources for success .
How can we continue to spend more than $ 100 million a year seeking the execution of a handful of offenders while we fail to meet the basic safety needs of communities such as Watts ?
It is not realistic to think that Watts and neighborhoods like it will ever get well if we ca n’t — or wo n’t — support them in addressing the problems they face .
To say that I have regrets about my involvement in the death penalty is to let myself off the hook too easily .
To take a life in order to prove how much we value another life does not strengthen our society .
It is a public policy that devalues our very being and detracts crucial resources from programs that could truly make our communities safe .

It ’s the end of the year , and DJ Earworm has made a mashup of the top 25 hits of the year according to Billboard magazine .
2008 was a bit of a “ soft ” year for pop ( heck , let ’s just call it lame ) , but he ’s done a fantastic job of the mash - up – it ’s got a bit of a symphonic feel to it with Coldplay keeping the feel through the track .

JOHN MCCAIN STATEMENT ON THE GLOBAL FIGHT AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS
Friday , October 3 , 2008
ARLINGTON , VA – McCain - Palin 2008 today released the following statement from John McCain on the launch of TED Prize winner James Nachtwey ’s photos on extremely drug - resistant tuberculosis ( XDR - TB ) :
“ Tuberculosis is a devastating disease that accounts for nearly 2 million deaths a year .
The painful and searing images of human suffering documented by James Nachtwey is another wake - up call for everyone around the globe to come together to meet their obligation to fight this disease .
I honor him for his work .
The lives of citizens of nations around the globe will be less prosperous and fulfilling without help to combat entrenched problems , such as tuberculosis , which afflicts poorer nations severely .
It is critical that we face this crisis head - on with a committed global partnership .
As President , I will ensure that treatment and prevention programs are funded at levels befitting a wealthy and great nation .
I will have a sustained commitment to helping people in need in Africa , Asia , and elsewhere cope with the ravages of this devastating disease . ”
Baby P died shortly before Ofsted gave Haringey a clean bill of health A total of 210 children in England have died following abuse over a 16 - month period , Ofsted 's chief inspector Christine Gilbert has told MPs .
She was speaking after Ofsted was criticised for " favourable " inspections of north London 's Haringey Council .
Baby P , who was on the council 's child protection register , died last year .
Meanwhile , the prime minister said the government would do all in its power to prevent the " needless loss of young life as a result of child abuse " .
The number of deaths , recorded between April 2007 and this August , is higher than the government 's official figure but Ofsted has insisted it is correct .
' Less confident ' Barry Sheerman , chairman of the Commons children and families select committee , said the " horrific figures " had left him worried other councils may be failing to protect abused children .
After Ms Gilbert had answered the committee 's questions , Mr Sheerman said : " The session made me less confident , rather than more confident , that there is n't going to be another Haringey waiting . "
He added that the chief inspector 's answers had also made him less confident about Ofsted 's ability to assess social care .
NSPCC statistics show between one and two children die on average every week following abuse in England and Wales .
This compares with Ofsted 's figures which suggest the number is as high as three a week in England alone .
Ms Gilbert said Ofsted was planning changes to its inspection routine Ms Gilbert told the committee not all the 210 children who died after neglect or abuse were known to local authorities .
Of the 21 babies who died , only two were known to social services , she said .
The prime minister said Lord Laming 's review would help to make sure child protection arrangements were effective and the government would act on any recommendations .
He said £ 73 m had been set aside for better training for social workers and Ofsted was being asked to carry out annual inspections across the country .
Reservations
During the committee questions , it also emerged that from next year social workers worried about poor local authority childcare practices may be able to call a confidential " whistleblower " hotline .
Ms Gilbert said : " We want to make it easier for frontline staff to tell us when things go wrong . "
But social worker representatives have expressed reservations about the proposed scheme .
Bridget Robb , of the British Association of Social Workers , told the BBC her members might be unwilling to use an Ofsted hotline to raise concerns about particular cases .
She said : " What will Ofsted do with that information , except go back to the employer and ask - and then the employer will know who complained . "
Ofsted , which carries out official inspections of schools and councils , has come under fire after it emerged it awarded Haringey a " good " rating just weeks after the death of 17 - month - old Baby P . I agree that just writing things on piece of paper is n't going to help anyone .
It is what you do to help the child that matters .
Christine Gilbert
Inspecting the inspectors
The little boy died after months of abuse by his mother , stepfather and a lodger , all of whom were found guilty of causing or allowing his death .
Ms Gilbert has previously said Ofsted was misled by Haringey which " hid behind " false data on how it was handling potential child abuse cases .
She told MPs her inspectorate 's assessment of Haringey 's child protection services in 2007 was " paper - based " relying on reports and data from other organisations , rather than on - the - ground inspection by Ofsted staff .
After the Baby P case the data was checked , and found to be misleading .
Face - to - face Ms Gilbert said : " Social care cases and the allocation of social workers , when we looked at the files in a number of incidences , appeared to be families rather than separate children in families that had been put forward .
" There was a far harder and higher caseload than had been reported .
" Files also were n't closed promptly as they should have been . "
Ms Gilbert said during 2007 there was at least one face - to - face meeting between Ofsted and a " senior person " from Haringey but she did not know what that senior person was .
MPs were concerned Ofsted destroyed data three months after a report was written .
Ms Gilbert said the evidence was in the Ofsted report , the annual performance assessment ( APA ) letter and the Haringey case files .
The destruction of the records meant Ofsted could not say who inspectors had spoken to at Haringey .
Committee chairman Barry Sheerman said : " That is like an academic writing a paper and destroying all their research material . "
Agency staff Mr Sheerman asked her if " alarm bells " sounded when council documents showed nearly half of Haringey 's social workers were agency , not full - time , staff .
Ms Gilbert said that was " fairly usual " in London but agreed the " personal connection " between a social worker and a child was important .
The Ofsted chief also said inspections would not necessarily have discovered some Haringey staff failed to attend all of Baby P's case conferences , where crucial decisions were made about his future welfare .
She said Ofsted was only now aware that : " Although there was commitment to working together , they [ Haringey staff ] were almost working in parallel . "
Ms Gilbert revealed Ofsted was considering lengthening annual inspections to allow more time to talk to staff on the ground and she proposed a questionnaire be sent to social workers to fill in before Ofsted inspectors arrived .
Ms Gilbert was asked whether a " Kafkaesque " system of form - filling prevented social workers from doing their jobs properly .
" I agree that just writing things on piece of paper is n't going to help anyone .
" It is what you do to help the child that matters , " she said .

No doubt the celebrations of Christmas and New Year ’s are moments of love , joy and happiness .
At least this is how it should be or how we want to believe it is .
Unfortunately for many people Christmas holidays is a period of depression and stress .
There are many situations that affect the beauty , charm and spirit of holidays .
Many people each for different reasons feel too much tension , some surrender to depression , others get frustrated because they can not do everything that they wanted to do in such a short period of time .
Apart from the emotional stress and mental intensity that can harm our health during the holidays , there are also the rich dishes that are not the best thing for our diet and physical health .
The foods that are rich in calories , salt , fats and carbohydrates are ceaseless temptations even for those with a very strong will .
The reasons that make Christmas and generally holiday periods , a period of stress and depression for some people are a lot .
These range from personal , economic to physical and emotional .
Below we outline the main causes of stress and depression during the Christmas period .
Causes of stress and depression during Christmas
1. Absence of a beloved person
The absence of a beloved person during the holidays creates feelings of loneliness and regret .
Additionally people who feel loneliness and depression when they see other people having a good time , then the situation is getting worse .
2. Family misunderstandings
Conflicts and stressed relations in several cases come to the surface this time of the year .
Usually people want to gather the whole family together for Christmas , but everyone has plans and sometimes there is conflict because people prefer to spend the holidays in their own home .
Although family gatherings are wonderful there are also people who need to take advantage of holidays and get some time for themselves or for their close family only .
In addition , many families have « roles » for each member ( e.g. the « small child » ) that relate to how this person was in the past and not how it is now .
This may cause more anxiety , stress and less pleasure .
There is also the possibility that people have high expectations these days from other people .
People might expect perfect conditions with expensive gifts and positive response by all .
This is not usually the case and this increases the chances to feel disappointed and the risk of sadness and depression are increased .
3 . The economic difficulties
Many families , for various reasons face financial difficulties , especially nowadays that the economy is under recession .
The holidays add an extra burden to their already tight budget .
It is likely that there is no available money to buy gifts , presents or clothes for Christmas .
As a result some people even use more money than they can actually afford and this worsens their financial situation even more .
During holidays there are many parties , celebrations and gatherings that require the spending for food and drink .
This creates the need to put the hands deep in the pocket , both for gifts and to pay for the restaurants and bars .
The temptations such as food , the cocktails , purchases and gifts is high and leads many people to feel stress for the consequences of their actions ( gain more weight , headache , depression , overdrafts ) .
These effects remain after the end of the holidays and cause even more stress and depression .
4. Physical tiredness
One of the main reasons that the holidays bring with them intense stress is that suddenly there are many requirements and people have to do many things in a short period of time .
Even when the activities are basically pleasant and enjoyable , they are a change from the daily routine that people are used to .
This situation is pushing the person to do more things than it can normally do .
Shopping , the need for finding gifts , participation in various social events and obligations , the preparation of Christmas dishes and other sweets all create stress and fatigue .
And let us not forget the disappointment created when gaining that extra kg while in fact you are trying to lose weight .
5. Loneliness
For many people especially the elderly , the loneliness is a real issue during the holidays .
They may not have someone to sit with them in the dinner table ; they may not even have a festive table or even people to speak .
Many old people also have no friends , either because they are ill or because they are no longer alive .
But younger people who rely only to friends , can be found alone and without invitation during the holidays .
These situations create perfect candidates for depression .
6. Seasonal Emotional Disturbance
A real psychological problem , which coincides with the period of holidays but unfortunately is not so easily recognized , is the seasonal emotional disorder .
This disorder occurs when autumn gives way to winter .
As daylight is reduced and people spend more time inside they are affected by a form of depression that is known as a « seasonal emotional disorder » .
Although it is a mild form of depression it is annoying and affects the person who is suffering from it .
It creates a source of anxiety and worry at a time when the general expectation is that everybody should be happy .
We must understand and accept that in life things are not perfect and beautiful as in television shows and films .
Often life is unpredictable and we should focus on things that make us happy and we should always be thinking positive for the future .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Former American International Group Inc AIG.N Chief Executive Maurice " Hank " Greenberg said on Tuesday the U.S. government support for the giant insurer will have to continue until the hobbled company is back on its feet .
CV Star , Inc. Chairman and CEO and former AIG Chairman and CEO Maurice Greenberg speaks at a luncheon at the New York Law School in New York April 24 , 2006 .

A day after AIG posted what Greenberg called a “ mind boggling ” $ 24.5 billion quarterly loss and snagged a new lifeline from the government , the former CEO said the government ’s $ 150 billion investment means it has too much at stake , and will have to keep the lifeline open .
The government will likely have to spend much more to fix the overall economy , said Greenberg , who called the $ 700 billion financial rescue legislation “ woefully inadequate . ”
AIG , a company that Greenberg ran for 38 years , will “ be a long time in working out ” its financial woes , he said at a conference held by Reactions , an industry publication .
He said fixing the company at all was going to be “ pretty damn tough ” because it requires the company to repay a $ 60 billion federal loan with the proceeds of asset sales .
Tough credit markets have thinned buyers , and the insurer has yet to ink any sales .
On Monday , AIG CEO Edward Liddy said he felt the company was in a better position now the government has stepped in to assume mortgage liabilities that had left the insurer deeply in the red over the past four quarters , but did not rule out the need for more federal cash .
“ Never say never , ” Liddy told Reuters , saying it was possible AIG ’s $ 1 trillion investment portfolio could sustain more losses if financial markets remained volatile .
The company recorded $ 18.3 billion in losses on investments in the latest quarter .
Greenberg controlled about 11 percent of AIG ’s outstanding shares before the government stepped in September , and has said that accounted for the bulk of his personal wealth .
Under the federal deal , the government gets a 79.9 percent stake , largely diluting shareholders before the deal .
EASIER TERMS
AIG was saved from bankruptcy by an $ 85 billion government loan on September 16 , but it proved inadequate , and with interest and fees of about 14 percent , was too costly to be a permanent fix .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve on Monday agreed to invest a total of $ 150 billion -- $ 40 billion for preferred shares paying a 10 percent dividend , $ 60 billion under a five - year credit facility that carries a lower interest rate , and another $ 50 billion to buy toxic mortgage assets underlying AIG credit default swaps , allowing the insurer to eventually tear up those contracts .
AIG shares , which gained on Monday after the new federal rescue plan was announced , were down nearly 10 percent to $ 2.06 in early afternoon trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange .
AIG ran into a severe cash crunch in September because of mounting collateral demands from counterparties of its credit default swaps and ratings downgrades .
Greenberg said his wish had been for a 10 - year term on the credit facility , and a 5 percent dividend on the preferred shares for at least five years .

The US has successfully tested its missile defence system designed to intercept long - range ballistic missile attacks , the Pentagon says .
A spokesman said it was a crucial step in plans for the missile shield the US wants to base in Europe .
The target missile was launched from the Alaskan island of Kodiak before being tracked and destroyed by an interceptor launched from California .
Russia sees US plans to base such a system in Europe as a direct threat .
The US wants to build a radar on Czech soil and put 10 interceptor rockets in Poland as a defence against what Washington describes as " rogue " states .
Russia has said it will deploy short - range Iskander missiles in the Kaliningrad region to " neutralise " the US shield .
But Moscow has expressed willingness to discuss the issue with the incoming administration of Barack Obama , who will replace George W Bush as US president in January .
Correspondents say the president - elect agrees with missile defence in principle , but it will face more scrutiny after he takes office .
United States Court of Appeals , Eighth Circuit .
UNITED STATES of America , Plaintiff - Appellee , v. Reed Raymond PRIOR , Defendant - Appellant .
No. 96-2110 .
Decided : February 27 , 1997
Before FAGG , BOWMAN , and HANSEN , Circuit Judges .
Steven Paul DeVolder , Des Moines , IA , argued , for Defendant - Appellant .
Lester A. Paff , Des Moines , IA , argued ( Don C. Nickerson , U.S. Attorney , on the brief ) , for Plaintiff - Appellee .
Reed Raymond Prior received a mandatory life sentence following his plea of guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine , in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841( a ) ( 1 ) ( 1994 ) .
Prior appeals his sentence and the district court 's denial of his motion to withdraw his plea .
We affirm .
I .
Acting upon information that Prior was dealing in narcotics , police made numerous attempts to locate Prior .
On May 2 , 1995 , police located Prior 's vehicle at a Motel 6 in Des Moines , Iowa .
They observed Prior carrying bags to his car as he prepared to leave his room .
Police officers followed Prior to a mini storage unit where they saw him transferring items from his vehicle to the storage unit .
Police officers then obtained a search warrant for the storage unit and Prior 's vehicle .
During the search , officers found a large quantity of methamphetamine in a duffle bag on the floor of the storage unit .
In all , the police seized 869 grams of methamphetamine from the vehicle and storage unit .
The police also seized a scale , other drug paraphernalia , and $ 17,690 in cash .
Prior was arrested and charged with possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute , in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a ) ( 1 ) .
Given the amount of cash and actual methamphetamine found in the search , Prior could have been held responsible for a total of 1,147.6 grams of methamphetamine .
The government provided notice that it would request the enhanced mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole , pursuant to § 841 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ( viii ) , because Prior 's offense involved over 100 grams of methamphetamine and he had three prior felony drug convictions .
Three days after his arrest , Prior signed a written waiver of indictment , a waiver of detention hearing , and a guilty plea agreement in which Prior agreed to fully cooperate with the government and provide complete and truthful information concerning any criminal matters of which he has knowledge .
If the government determined Prior had provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person , the government had the sole discretion under the agreement to move for a departure below the mandatory minimum life sentence .
Prior 's attorney moved quickly with this agreement to preserve Prior 's option of providing substantial assistance , which was the only way to avoid the mandatory life sentence .
( Plea Tr. at 23 . )
After a hearing on May 31 , 1995 , the district court accepted Prior 's plea of guilty and ordered the preparation of a presentence investigation report .
On November 30 , 1995 , before sentencing had taken place , Prior filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea .
During a hearing on the motion , Prior presented testimony that he had been incompetent to enter the plea agreement because he was going through withdrawal from addiction to controlled substances at the time he signed the agreement on May 5 , 1995 .
Following a hearing , the district court filed a written order denying the motion .
The court found that even if Prior had been incompetent at the time he signed the agreement , he undoubtedly was competent to make a knowing and voluntary waiver of his rights at the plea hearing when the district court accepted his plea of guilty .
On April 11 , 1996 , the district court entered judgment on Prior 's guilty plea .
The government presented certified copies of Prior 's previous drug convictions and refused to make a substantial assistance motion , rendering the district court without authority to depart below the statutory minimum life sentence .
Accordingly , the district court sentenced Prior to a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole .
Prior appeals .
II .
Prior first contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea .
A guilty plea is a solemn act not to be set aside lightly .
United States v. Morrison , 967 F.2d 264 , 268 ( 8th Cir.1992 ) .
We review the district court 's denial of a motion to withdraw a plea for an abuse of discretion .
United States v. Newson , 46 F.3d 730 , 732 ( 8th Cir.1995 ) .
Rule 32(e ) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that a district court may permit a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea prior to sentencing upon a showing of “ any fair and just reason , ” and we have held that the defendant bears the burden of establishing such a justification .
United States v. Yell , 18 F.3d 581 , 582 ( 8th Cir.1994 ) .
While a defendant seeking to withdraw a plea before sentencing is given a more liberal consideration than someone seeking to withdraw a plea after sentencing , “ a defendant has no absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea before sentencing , ” and the decision to allow or deny the motion remains within the sound discretion of the trial court .
United States v. Boone , 869 F.2d 1089 , 1091 ( 8th Cir. ) , cert .
denied , 493 U.S. 822 , 110 S.Ct. 81 , 107 L.Ed.2d 47 ( 1989 ) .
Factors to consider in determining whether to set aside a plea of guilty include whether the defendant has demonstrated a fair and just reason , whether the defendant has asserted his innocence , the length of time between the guilty plea and the motion to withdraw , and whether the government will be prejudiced .
Id. at 1091 - 92 .
The reasons offered by Prior for withdrawing his plea were that he was mentally incompetent due to substance abuse at the time he signed the plea agreement and that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his constitutional rights .
At the December 22 , 1995 , hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea , Prior presented the testimony of a psychiatrist , Dr. Mark Souza , who concluded that because Prior was undergoing withdrawal from several controlled substances , he was unable to fully comprehend the agreement or appreciate its implications at the time he signed it on May 5 , 1995 .
Dr. Souza further testified that Prior would have been competent by the time of the plea hearing on May 31 , 1995 , when the court accepted Prior 's guilty plea .
Prior asserts that because he had been incompetent when he signed the plea agreement and when it was explained to him , his plea was not knowing and voluntary at the May 31 , 1995 , plea hearing .
Prior was competent at the time of the plea hearing , and he cannot seriously argue otherwise .
Furthermore , the transcript of the plea hearing indicates that Prior understood his rights .
The Assistant United States Attorney summarized the plea agreement in court , explaining that under the agreement Prior is subject to a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment , he has agreed to cooperate with the government , and upon a government motion , there may be a possibility of reducing his sentence below the mandatory minimum if he provides substantial assistance .
( Plea Tr. at 11 - 12 . )
The district court asked Prior if he was able to follow the government 's summary description of the plea agreement .
Prior replied , “ Yeah , I was , because I 've read it a couple of times myself . ”
( Id. at 13 . )
Prior also stated that he had understood its terms at the time he signed the agreement and that he had been given a full opportunity to confer with counsel about this matter .
The district court carefully explained to Prior his constitutional rights , including the right to trial by a jury , to confront the witnesses against him , and to put the government to its proof .
Prior indicated that he understood that he had the right to go to trial and have his case decided by a jury if he so chose .
( Id. at 25 . )
Prior indicated that he understood and voluntarily waived all his trial - related constitutional rights .
Prior provided an adequate factual basis for the plea , admitting to possessing 3 1/2 pounds of methamphetamine with intent to deliver .
Additionally , at the hearing on his motion to withdraw the plea , Prior testified that he had told the truth at the May 31 , 1995 , plea hearing .
We agree with the district court 's conclusion that Prior , who at all times was represented by counsel , knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights and pled guilty to the charge at the plea hearing on May 31 , 1995 .
Thus , Prior 's asserted fair and just reason to withdraw his plea cannot carry the day .
Additionally , he did not assert his innocence of the charges and he waited approximately five months before seeking to withdraw his plea .
We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Prior 's motion to withdraw his guilty plea .
III .
Prior raises several constitutional challenges to his sentence .
Specifically , he contends that the mandatory life sentence , imposed pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 841 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ( viii ) , violates his rights to due process and equal protection under the Fifth Amendment , his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment , and the doctrine of separation of powers .
“ The question of whether a statute is constitutional is a question of law and must be reviewed de novo . ”
United States v. Wesley , 990 F.2d 360 , 363 ( 8th Cir.1993 ) .
First , Prior contends that the mandatory life sentence violates his due process rights , arguing that the statute deprives the district court of discretion to impose an individualized sentence .
Where capital punishment is not involved , however , an individualized sentencing determination is not a constitutional imperative .
United States v. Goodface , 835 F.2d 1233 , 1236 , 1237 n. 4 ( 8th Cir.1987 ) .
See Harmelin v. Michigan , 501 U.S. 957 , 995 , 111 S.Ct. 2680 , 2701-02 , 115 L.Ed.2d 836 ( 1991 ) ( plurality ) ( recognizing the Court 's repeated holding that there is no requirement comparable to the “ individualized capital sentencing doctrine ” outside the capital context due to “ the qualitative difference between death and all other penalties ” ) .
“ [ D]ue process is not violated merely because a statute divests the trial judge of discretion to sentence as he might wish , ” even if the resulting effect is to place wide discretion in the hands of the prosecutor .
Goodface , 835 F.2d at 1236 .
In noncapital cases , “ Congress has the power to define criminal punishments without giving the courts any sentencing discretion . ”
Chapman v. United States , 500 U.S. 453 , 467 , 111 S.Ct. 1919 , 1928 - 29 , 114 L.Ed.2d 524 ( 1991 ) ; United States v. Hammer , 3 F.3d 266 , 269 ( 8th Cir.1993 ) , cert .
denied , 510 U.S. 1139 , 114 S.Ct. 1121 , 127 L.Ed.2d 430 ( 1994 ) .
Consistent with its authority to do so , Congress has merely made a legislative choice in section 841 ( b ) to deprive the courts of sentencing discretion .
Prior argues that the statute is overinclusive and violates due process because it does not differentiate between drug kingpins , who run large drug trafficking operations , and drug addicts , who may traffic in controlled substances only to make enough money to buy more drugs to feed their habit .
We find no due process violation .
“ Absent classifications based on race or some other forbidden or suspect ground , legislative decisions of the sort here in question - how severely to punish a particular class of drug - trafficking crimes - need only have a rational basis to survive ” a due process challenge .
United States v. Frieberger , 28 F.3d 916 , 921 ( 8th Cir.1994 ) , cert .
denied , 513 U.S. 1097 , 115 S.Ct. 765 , 130 L.Ed.2d 662 ( 1995 ) .
Section 841 ( b ) rationally serves to discourage illegal drug trafficking activity by imposing a mandatory minimum life sentence upon any defendant convicted of violating section 841 who was criminally responsible for a certain quantity of drugs and who also has a record of two or more felony drug convictions .
Drug addicts who traffic in illegal substances contribute to the same problem addressed by the statute as do so - called drug kingpins who engage in drug trafficking solely for profit .
“ That distributors of varying degrees of culpability might be subject to the same sentence does not mean that the penalty system ․ is unconstitutional . ”
Chapman , 500 U.S. at 467 , 111 S.Ct. at 1929 .
Prior contends that the unbridled prosecutorial discretion to allow some , but not all , defendants to avoid life in prison in exchange for their cooperation offends the Equal Protection Clause .
We disagree .
Defendants convicted of section 841 ( a ) are not all similarly situated with regard to their ability to provide substantial assistance to aid the government in further prosecutions .
Allowing prosecutors to provide the benefit of a motion for a sentence below the mandatory minimum only to those who are capable of providing substantial assistance to the government is rationally related to the legitimate government interest in prosecuting criminal conduct .
We have previously determined that a sentencing scheme that removes discretion from the courts but builds in a safety - valve adjustment “ predicated on the reasonable assumption that the government is in the best position to supply the court with an accurate report of the extent and effectiveness of the defendant 's assistance , ” does not violate due process .
United States v. Grant , 886 F.2d 1513 , 1514 ( 8th Cir.1989 ) ( internal quotations omitted ) .
Likewise , we now determine that this scheme does not offend equal protection rights .
Accord United States v. Van Winrow , 951 F.2d 1069 , 1073 ( 9th Cir.1991 ) .
We note that there is no assertion here that the prosecutor acted in bad faith by denying Prior a motion for substantial assistance .
In fact , the government offered Prior the opportunity to benefit from this “ prosecutorial grace , ” as Prior calls it ( Appellant 's Br. at 27 ) , but he refuses to provide the government with any assistance at all .
Prior flatly asserts that he will not aid the government in arresting any more people .
( See Sent. Tr. at 45 . )
Unfortunately , his steadfast refusal to offer any help renders the courts unable to provide him with any relief from the congressionally mandated life sentence to which he is subject .
Next , Prior asserts that his sentence violates his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment because the life sentence is grossly disproportionate to his crime .
Prior argues that his sentence is disproportionate because he is an addict and , until the time of his arrest on this charge at the age of 45 , he had never spent a day in jail because his three previous felony drug convictions yielded no more than suspended sentences and fines .
Prior asserts that he is capable of leading a productive life as he was an excellent student who completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and a Master of Arts degree in education .
Thus , Prior claims that his life sentence is disproportionate to his crime .
The Eighth Amendment “ forbids only extreme sentences that are ‘ grossly disproportionate ’ to the crime . ”
Harmelin , 501 U.S. at 1001 , 111 S.Ct. at 2705 ( opinion of Kennedy , J. , concurring in part and concurring in the judgment ) ( quoting Solem v. Helm , 463 U.S. 277 , 288 , 303 , 103 S.Ct .
3001 , 3008 , 3016 - 17 , 77 L.Ed.2d 637 ( 1983 ) ) ; accord Frieberger , 28 F.3d at 920 ; United States v. Jones , 965 F.2d 1507 , 1518 ( 8th Cir. ) , cert .
denied , 506 U.S. 924 , 113 S.Ct. 346 , 121 L.Ed.2d 261 ( 1992 ) .
Our review to determine whether a sentence is grossly disproportionate is quite narrow .
Frieberger , 28 F.3d at 920 .
While Prior 's sentence is harsh , we conclude that it is not grossly disproportionate given the equally serious nature of his crime .
The Supreme Court concluded in Harmelin that a state sentence of mandatory life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for possessing 672 grams of cocaine did not violate the Eighth Amendment , despite the fact that the defendant had no prior felony convictions .
501 U.S at 994 , 111 S.Ct. at 2701 ( plurality ) .
In this case , Prior has a record of three prior drug felony convictions , and he was held responsible for possessing with intent to distribute 1,147.6 grams of methamphetamine .
Comparing this case with the facts of Harmelin leads us to conclude that Prior 's sentence does not violate the Eighth Amendment 's ban on cruel and unusual punishments .
Prior seems to assert that because he is an addict , he is not as deserving of a life sentence as so - called drug kingpins .
A comparison of his conduct with that of even larger - scale distributors , however , is not relevant to our analysis .
Such a proportional analysis is only appropriate after an initial comparison of the crime to the sentence for which it is imposed leads to an inference of gross disproportionality .
United States v. Johnson , 944 F.2d 396 , 409 ( 8th Cir. ) ( relying on Harmelin ) , cert .
denied , 502 U.S. 1008 , 112 S.Ct. 646 , 116 L.Ed.2d 663 ( 1991 ) .
We have noted that the possession of narcotics with the intent to distribute is an offense “ at the root of some of the gravest problems facing our country .
The ‘ fruit ’ of the drug plague is everywhere ; it fills our jails , our courts , our streets , and our nurseries . ”
United States v. Meirovitz , 918 F.2d 1376 , 1381 ( 8th Cir.1990 ) , cert .
denied , 502 U.S. 829 , 112 S.Ct. 101 , 116 L.Ed.2d 71 ( 1991 ) .
Prior 's three previous convictions indicate that he has been involved in drug distribution for many years , and his actions have furthered the spread of this plague .
Life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in this circumstance is not grossly disproportionate to the offense .
As an aside , it is again worth noting that Prior has been given the opportunity to attempt to reduce this sentence himself by providing substantial assistance to the government , and he steadfastly refuses to do so .
Finally , Prior argues that section 841 ( b ) is unconstitutional under the doctrine of separation of powers .
The district court can depart from the mandatory minimum sentence only if the prosecution makes a motion for departure on the basis that the defendant has provided substantial assistance , and Prior argues that this usurps the function of the judiciary .
We have previously rejected this argument , see United States v. Mason , 902 F.2d 1314 , 1316 ( 8th Cir.1990 ) , and one panel is not at liberty to overrule a decision of another panel .
Mack v. Caspari , 92 F.3d 637 , 641 n. 6 ( 8th Cir.1996 ) .
Accordingly , we reject this argument without further discussion .
IV .
Prior also challenges the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. § 851(e ) , which is a statute of limitations provision that prohibits defendants from challenging “ the validity of any prior conviction alleged under this section which occurred more than five years before the date of the information alleging such prior conviction . ”
Two of Prior 's previous convictions occurred more than five years earlier , and the district court did not permit Prior to attack their validity .
Prior contends that section 851(e ) provides an arbitrary and irrational classification that violates due process and equal protection .
We disagree .
While we have not previously addressed this question , several of our sister circuits have squarely reached the issue .
They have determined that , except for the limited circumstance where a prior conviction was obtained in violation of the right to have counsel appointed , a defendant has no constitutional right to challenge a prior conviction used to enhance a current sentence , and accordingly , section 851(e ) does not violate due process .
See United States v. Gonzales , 79 F.3d 413 , 426-27 ( 5th Cir. ) , 519 U.S. 869 , 117 S.Ct. 183 , 136 L.Ed.2d 122 ( 1996 ) ; United States v. Arango - Montoya , 61 F.3d 1331 , 1338 ( 7th Cir.1995 ) ; United States v. Davis , 36 F.3d 1424 , 1438-39 ( 9th Cir.1994 ) , cert .
denied , 513 U.S. 1171 , 115 S.Ct. 1147 , 130 L.Ed.2d 1106 ( 1995 ) ; United States v. Williams , 954 F.2d 668 , 673 ( 11th Cir.1992 ) .
Several courts have also rejected an equal protection challenge to section 851(e ) .
See Gonzales , 79 F.3d at 426-27 ; Davis , 36 F.3d at 1438 - 39 ; Williams , 954 F.2d 668 , 673 .
No court has sustained a constitutional attack against this provision .
Because no suspect class or fundamental right is at issue , the ban against challenging convictions over five years old need only be supported by a rational legislative purpose .
The five - year ban , which applies equally to all recidivists to whom the statute applies , rationally serves the legitimate purpose of avoiding the costs and other problems associated with keeping court records indefinitely .
Davis , 36 F.3d at 1438 .
Prior argues that a five - year cutoff point is arbitrary , but we do not find it to be unconstitutional .
Five years is a reasonable amount of time to require court documents to be preserved without the requirement becoming overly burdensome .
Any cutoff point for the right to collaterally challenge a prior conviction will sound somewhat arbitrary , but we conclude that the five - year mark is rationally related to the goals of the statute .
We agree with the conclusion of our sister circuits that “ [ s] ection 851 (e ) is wholly reasonable , both to effectuate the legitimate purposes of enhanced sentencing for recidivists , and to eliminate a host of practical problems with respect to ancient records absent such a provision . ”
Arango - Montoya , 61 F.3d at 1338 ( internal quotations omitted ) ; accord Davis , 36 F.3d at 1438 - 39 ; Williams , 954 F.2d at 673 .
Accordingly , we join those circuits that have held that section 851(e ) does not violate due process or equal protection , and we conclude that the district court properly applied it to preclude Prior from challenging the validity of two of his previous convictions .
V .
Finally , Prior contends that his conviction should be set aside because he was denied the effective assistance of counsel .
Claims of ineffective assistance are ordinarily reserved for collateral attack , but we may consider such a claim where the record is established and there is no need to develop additional facts .
United States v. Martin , 62 F.3d 1009 , 1012 ( 8th Cir.1995 ) , cert .
denied , 517 U.S. 1161 , 116 S.Ct. 1556 , 134 L.Ed.2d 657 ( 1996 ) .
We will consider Prior 's claim because his argument does not incorporate or depend upon the development of facts outside the original record .
See id .
To make out a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during the plea process , a defendant must first demonstrate that counsel 's performance was deficient , which requires a showing that the representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness .
Strickland v. Washington , 466 U.S. 668 , 687-88 , 104 S.Ct. 2052 , 2064-65 , 80 L.Ed.2d 674 ( 1984 ) ; see also Hill v. Lockhart , 474 U.S. 52 , 57 , 106 S.Ct. 366 , 369-70 , 88 L.Ed.2d 203 ( 1985 ) ( holding Strickland 's two - part standard applies to ineffective assistance claims arising out of the plea process ) .
Second , the defendant must demonstrate prejudice , that is , that “ there is a reasonable probability that , but for counsel 's errors , he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial . ”
Hill v. Lockhart , 474 U.S. 52 , 59 , 106 S.Ct. 366 , 371 , 88 L.Ed.2d 203 ( 1985 ) ; see Strickland , 466 U.S. at 687 , 104 S.Ct. at 2064 .
Prior contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when he signed the plea agreement on May 5 , 1995 , while incompetent , and at the plea hearing on May 31 , 1995 .
At the plea hearing , Prior 's attorney stated that he moved quickly with the plea agreement in order to timely preserve for Prior the possibility of avoiding a life sentence by providing substantial assistance .
Prior 's attorney stated that it was apparent very early on that Prior would be subject to a mandatory life sentence , given the quantity of methamphetamine in his possession when he was arrested and his three prior felony convictions .
( Plea Tr. at 22-23 . )
Counsel acknowledged that he had considered the strength of the government 's case and asserted that while he had explored the possible defenses that might be available , none were feasible .
( Id. at 23 - 25 . )
Prior 's attorney stated , “ we determined that Mr. Prior , who had cooperated with the government initially and , faced with the overwhelmingly severe sentence that he was looking at , needed to provide the government with some substantial assistance in order to have any hope of avoiding the mandatory life imprisonment . ”
( Id. at 22 -23 . )
Although Prior now refuses to provide any assistance to the government , counsel 's strategy was reasonable and prudent , and Prior consented to it .
The fact that this strategy has now proven unsuccessful because Prior refuses to cooperate does not render counsel 's performance deficient .
See James v. State of Iowa , 100 F.3d 586 , 590 ( 8th Cir.1996 )
( “ Reasonable trial strategy does not constitute ineffective assistance simply because it is not successful . ” )
We conclude that , in the face of a very strong case against Prior , counsel provided objectively reasonable representation by timely securing an opportunity for Prior to provide substantial assistance in the hope of securing a sentence of less than life imprisonment .
We reject Prior 's attempt to lay off on his experienced and able counsel the consequences of his own criminal conduct and the statutorily mandated result of his adamant refusal to help himself .
Even if counsel 's performance could be considered deficient because of Prior 's withdrawal from substance abuse at the time he signed the agreement , a conclusion we specifically reject , there is no credible evidence that Prior would not have pleaded guilty had he been competent when he signed the agreement .
As noted above , Prior was competent at the plea hearing on May 31 , 1995 .
The government had a strong case against Prior that would send him to prison for life absent a government motion for departure based on substantial assistance .
Prior provided a factual basis for the plea and was advised of all his rights .
Prior testified that he knew he faced a life sentence .
During the plea hearing , the Assistant United States Attorney recited a summary of the plea agreement , including the provision allowing Prior an opportunity to provide substantial assistance to the government in order to avoid the life sentence .
Prior indicated that he understood because he had read the agreement a couple of times himself .
He indicated that this was a correct statement of what he had agreed to and that it included nothing that he did not agree to .
( Plea Tr. at 13 - 14 . )
Also , the district court carefully informed Prior of his right to a trial and that “ if I accept this plea of guilty today , there will be no trial . ”
( Id. at 27 . )
Prior indicated that he understood and waived his rights .
There simply is no credible evidence to indicate that Prior would have insisted upon going to trial had he not signed the plea agreement while in withdrawal .
Thus , Prior was not prejudiced by his counsel 's conduct .
VI .
We conclude that the trial court committed no reversible error and that Prior received the effective assistance of counsel .
Accordingly , we affirm the judgment of the district court .
FOOTNOTES
. The Honorable Ronald E. Longstaff , United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa .
.
At the sentencing hearing , the district court clearly expressed to Prior that he is , in effect , needlessly confining himself to life imprisonment by his refusal to provide substantial assistance .
Judge Longstaff explicitly told Prior the following : You 're making me do something I hate doing today ․ you 're making me send you to jail for life , and I do n't want to do that , and I hope someday that in the next approximately 365 days I have a chance to revisit this sentence and give you a just sentence and prove to you that the system works ; but unfortunately , Reed , under the law , right or wrong , you 're the only person right now that holds the key to unlock the handcuffs that bind me right now , and I hope someday in the next year you 'd make a decision to give me a chance to do what 's right .
( Sent. Tr. at 43 - 44 . )
.
Prior does not claim that his prior convictions were secured without the benefit of counsel .
HANSEN , Circuit Judge .

Someone approached me recently and wanted to ask about how the US faked going to the Moon back in the 1960 ’s and 70’s .
I was so shocked , appalled and dumbfounded , I really did n’t know what to say .
I just directed them to Phil Plait ’s Moon Hoax Hoax info .
Then I wondered , what do the Apollo astronauts say if someone asks them the same question ?
Now I know .
I just finished watching “ In the Shadow of the Moon , ” a documentary of the Apollo era presented by Ron Howard , directed by David Sington ( * correction ) .
It ’s a wonderful film with fantastic and rare footage along with interviews of several of the Apollo astronauts .
I highly recommend it !
And the end , as the credits are rolling , each of the astronauts responds to an unsaid question about the those who think this greatest adventure in human history was a hoax :
Mike Collins : “ I do n’t know how I would grab someone by the collar who did n’t believe and shake them and somehow change their mind . ”
And later Collins added , “ I do n’t know two Americans who could have a fantastic secret without one of them blurting it out to the press .
Can you imagine thousands of people being able to keep this secret ? ”
Charlie Duke : “ We ’ve been to the moon nine times .
If we faked it , why did we fake it nine times ? ”
Alan Bean : “ Some of the tabloids are saying that we did this in a hanger in Arizona .
Maybe that would have been a good idea ! ” ( meaning , it would have been a lot safer )
Dave Scott : “ Any significant event in history , somebody has had a conspiracy theory one way or the other about it . ”
Gene Cernan : “ Truth needs no defense .
Nobody , nobody can ever take those footsteps that I made on the surface of the moon away from me . ”
And Buzz Aldrin said this on a the UK TV show , “ Where Are They Now : ” “ I ’m an honest person .
If I tell you I was on the moon and you choose not to believe it , forget it . ”
The next time someone approaches me , I ’ll be better prepared .
And I can hardly wait for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ’s launch early next year .
LRO will carry a powerful camera into low orbit over the Moon ’s surface .
While its primary mission is not to photograph old Apollo landing sites , it will probably photograph them , many times , providing the first recognizable images of Apollo relics since 1972 .
The spacecraft ’s high - resolution camera , the LROC , or Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera , has a resolution of about half a meter .
That means that a half - meter square on the Moon ’s surface would fill a single pixel in its digital images .
Apollo moon rovers are about 2 meters wide and 3 meters long .
So in the LROC images , those abandoned vehicles will fill about 4 by 6 pixels .

Jay Leno Lawsuit Turns Deadly
The Tonight Show hostandare being sued by the estate of deceased Macy 's heirfor unlawfully auctioning off two of his cars .
Just days after receiving the news , parking garage maintenance director Ricca , 55 , shot himself in the head and died .
His mourners are saying that the lawsuit did him in .
Straus , 88 years old at the time of his death in May 2008 , had been storing his vehicles in Ricca 's garage for 50 years and reportedly was $ 20,000 behind in storage fees - a claim that Straus estate lawyers deny .
In the estate lawsuit , the legal team contends that the two men " knowingly participated in certain unlawful purported auctions and sales " .
Leno , who had lusted after the classic automobile for many years , made the transaction in 2005 .
The Tonight Show host had been attempting to talk the ailing Straus into selling him the vehicle on numerous occasions and even discouraged other interested parties by initiating rumors of problems with the Duesenberg .
Straus bought the car from his mother in the early 1950's and put it in the Windsor Garage on the upper east side of NY .
The lawsuit , filed on Tuesday in Manhattan Supreme Court alleges that the auction was a sham that unfolded after Ricca refused to accept a $ 36,000 check for storage fees and then held an auction citing non-payment .
Straus lawyers contend that he took advantage of the elderly man 's failing health .
Leno claims to be an innocent bystander who simply purchased his dream car .
Straus lawyers do n't buy that .
They believe that he was well aware that Straus had no intention of selling the car to anyone .
He considered it a family possession that he would not part with and told this to Leno on more than one occasion .
Leno purchased the 1931 Duesenberg , valued at $ 1.2 million .
The now deceased Ricca purchased a Rolls valued at $ 500,000 .

Season Wrap Up
It seems that general manager Billy Beane has no problem finding pitching for his team and even when he trades away his best pitchers , he always has some waiting in the wings .
The problem for Beane is finding proven hitting that can produce on a daily basis without needing much in the way of a paycheck .
The team finished 75 - 86 which was good enough for third place in the AL West .
Beane once again attempted to find a way to conquer the larger market teams with his 28th ranked $ 47.9 million payroll last year .
It ’s hard to tell where the team would have gone if they were not mired with injuries throughout the season .
While they were not producing on the field , they were setting records off of it , as they sent players to the disabled list an amazing 25 times during the course of the season .
While manager Bob Green tried many different line - ups throughout the season , the team could never find its stroke and finished the year last in the AL in runs scored and batting average .
Despite the turnover , the pitchers still found ways to impress as they ended the season fourth in the league with a 4.01 ERA .
Holes to Fill
While it ’s hard to see the A ’s doing much on the open market this off season with their lack of spending power , they do have many holes that need to be filled in their everyday line - up .
Their defense was n’t terrible in 2008 as they posted a .984 fielding percentage which was good enough for seventh in the league , but since there is no telling how many games their lack of offense cost them , they may need to sacrifice some of that defense next season in order to add some pop to their line - up .
The team will attempt to get their stat heads together this off season and try to find a gem in the free agent market whose statistics are riding just under the noses of other front offices around baseball .
It is conceivable that Beane may be able to find one of these in a corner outfield position hidden in the market , but with almost all teams employing at least one person who uses the averages that Beane became famous for , singling out that player and getting them for less then market value , may be harder than ever .
At this point in the off season , Beane is really lacking any names that would spark serious interest in the trade market in order to woo a bat away from someone else .
Although the A’s do have a lot of young talent throughout their system , as always , they may be reluctant to give three or four of these players up to receive just one bat in return .
Whether they do this will probably depend on how close Beane deems the team to being able to compete for a playoff spot next season .
Free Agents
At the beginning of the off season , the Athletics had four players who entered free agency in relievers Alan Embree and Keith Foulke , outfielder Emil Brown and designated hitter Frank Thomas .
Early in the off season , the A ’s made their decision on Embree as they decided not to pick up his club option for the 2009 season .
This was probably a good move for the team as they are stocked with pitching and can probably get more ( or about the same ) production for less cost .
Thomas did not help himself once he got to Oakland as he had just 19 RBIs in 55 games .
If someone is going to give him another chance in the league , it certainly is n’t going to be the Athletics who pride themselves on production .
Foulke will probably not be back either for basically the same reasons Embree ’s option was not picked up .
This would be the same tune for any veteran free agent pitcher the A ’s would have during almost any off season .
Brown will likely face the same fate as the other three players as he will probably be offered a deal that is far more than the A ’s will want to pay on the open market .
The Outlook
While the A’s are probably not going to be able to catch the 100 game winning Angels , they could move up a spot in their division if Beane is able to work his magic yet again this off season .
In the past year , the A’s have shipped some big names around the league including Marco Scutaro , Nick Swisher , Mark Kotsay and Dan Haren .
While some of the talent they received in return is producing throughout their system , this has perhaps left the Athletics with a lack of real trade bait this off season .
Bobby Crosby may be a name that pops up in trade talks as his contract will be up after the 2009 season , and the A ’s will probably not make an offer to him , unless for some reason he really wants to stay in Oakland .
They have already probably made the most publicized trade of the off season when they acquired Matt Holliday from the Colorado Rockies for a deal that was focused around closer Huston Street ( who lost his job at the end of the bullpen last season to one of Beane ’s young and talented arms ) .
Holliday could provide some of the pop that was missing from a line - up that was starved for runs last year .
While he probably wo n’t hit like he did in Denver , because no one does , he will still bolster Geren ’s everyday line - up .
As always , the A’s have a number of kids in their system who are almost ready to start contributing at the big league level .
They played 21 different rookies during the 2008 season , and it does n’t look like that trend will be slowing down any time soon ( although they would be hard pressed to reach a number that high again ) .
Even though some of the players acquired in the deals mentioned above did not statistically perform like the team thought they would , Beane ’s thinking is usually that they just need more time with his coaches and that they will be ready once they get the call from the big club .
One has to wonder how successful Beane would be if he had more money to spend .
With a new stadium not to far down the road , that may provide some extra revenue for the coming seasons and allow the team to actually keep some of the talent they have spent so much time grooming .

It ’s a weird thing that a ideology like socialism , which is supposed to promote cooperation , can sustain such anti-social behaviour as the one I ’m lately seeing in the socialist reddit .
Specifically , all hell broke loose after I posted my blog - reply over there .
I do not mind people criticizing my ideas and thoughts , this is how one learns but it ’s amazing how much the administrators of that reddit have gone on a power - trip even by the small power provided to them for filtering out trolls and spammers .
it ’s funny that even though I did n’t agree with Larry ’s request to stop submitting his articles to reddit , mostly because I always consider that among the morons there might be some who will listen and have an interest in conversation , his assessment ended up forcing itself upon me .
Lazy morons indeed do not care to see or hear conflicting opinions and will happily attempt to silence them so that nobody else will either .
This has become plainly true in the comments of that last post , where arguing about my article ensued .
This very quickly escalated into a flamewar since , for these “ socialists ” anyone who does not think exactly the same way they do , is an enemy to be labeled and assaulted .
The jump from “ You ’re saying something wrong ” to “ You are a wrong kind of person ” in their minds is near - instantaneous .
But this is the wrong kind of attitude .
When one says something wrong , our reaction should not be to insult the person .
That does not achieve anything other than alienate and drive others away .
Sure , if your purpose is to have only your own voice heard , like the moderators above , this can be a good tactic , but in the long run , you have only managed to burn more bridges behind you .
But is this mentality of “ my way or the highway ” useful ?
On the contrary by refusing to discuss points , even wrong points that others raise , in favour of calling them traitors or heretics , not only does not help them understand where their thinking has gotten astray but immediately erects a wall between you , effectively making sure that they will get defensive and ignore whatever you say .
This is what happened to me in my last post , while I got in with interest to discuss , the initial comments immediately flew off the handle , accusing me of being “ anti- working class ” and calling me a “ Maniac ” .
And even though I should have known better than to rise to the bait , I went on the defensive and the flamewar began .
More time was spent on accusing each other of douchebaggery than actually countering each other ’s arguments .
And opinions we do not agree with are important as well , especially coming from people that do not have completely opposite kind of views .
Controversial ideas is how we learn either to strengthen our own opinions or we change our mind when we cannot counter them .
It is disheartening that this reddit tends to reward mostly orthodox views on marxism and punishes the heretics with obscurity .
This is simply groupthink .
You do not learn anything new , nor do you get to think .
You only get to reinforce what you already believe in .
As long as an article is well written and raises a few points on the part of the author , it should never be downvoted .
Ignored perhaps , and even upvoted if the ideas are well presented , even if wrong .
But downvoting simply hides the opposing view away from others .
We should treasure controversy , not attempt to silence it .
If our views are solid enough , controversy is not an issue .
The arguments against it can be presented and the idea eviscerated .
When libertarians and * shudder *
Objectivists come here to argue with me , I do not accuse them of being exploitation supporters , horribly misguided or douchebags as this would only serve to drive them away .
But that would mean that I have even less people to criticize me , and that ’s just hurts myself .
Especially people who label themselves socialists should have so much more tolerance to each other .
If we cannot have an argument within our own ranks , how do even attempt to take on the people who outright disagree for anything we stand for ?
If we waste all of our time fighting each other with such ferocity , is it any surprise that no pressure can be directed towards the real culprits ?
This is the most common reason why the Anarchist and Socialist movements are much more hostile towards each other , than they are towards the Capitalists .
From the first time I noticed that , my initial thoughts were “ But we ’re on the same side ?!
Why are people fighting others who have the same goal in mind ? ” .
And yet , for some of the revolutionary socialists , anyone who does not follow the rigid tactics he believes in , is as bad as the enemy .
For the Anarchist , because of the misunderstanding of how Marxists try to achieve Communism , they consider them hostile .
The two opposing camps in the case , simply talk past each other , exchanging more insults than ideas and stabbing each other in the back more than lending a hand .
But back to our original subject .
I do not expect to last much more in the socialist reddit .
Bannination threats have already been implied and the willingness to do the act admitted , so I ’m obviously on a tight rope for speaking my mind and daring to argue my position .
Because of this , I decided to start my own subreddit where people like me , who value conversation and do n’t fear opposing viewpoints , can meet .
If you ’re tired of being bullied for not being a “ true socialist ” and prefer intelligent discussions over insultfests , hopefully you will consider joining me at Libertarian Socialism .
It ’s up to us to make it what the admins of Socialism /r/ wo n’t let happen .
That does not mean I ’m quitting socialism /r/ just yet , but It ’d be nice to have a conversation without the Marxist purists insulting everyone and then calling them whiners for pointing that out .
Dogma and inability to consider progressive ideas are a recipe for stagnation and if that is what is necessary to be considered a Marxist , then I ’m certainly not a Marxist .

For now , a marriage between Twitter and Facebook is not meant to be — but the courtship between the two Web 2.0 companies could be rekindled in the future .
That was one message from Evan Williams , the chief executive and co-founder of Twitter , in a talk at the Churchill Club in San Francisco Tuesday night .
Serious talks between the Facebook social network and the Twitter microblogging service started soon after Mr. Williams took over as chief executive on Oct. 16 .
Twitter reportedly rejected Facebook ’s $ 500 million , mostly stock offer several weeks ago .
“ We explored it , as we should .
We took it seriously , ” Mr. Williams said .
“ It definitely made sense — the strategy we talked about with them — but it was n’t the right time . ”
Ultimately , he said , Twitter decided that it had too much left to do , beginning with figuring out how to make money .
“ Maybe we ’ll see each other in the marketplace , ” Mr. Williams said .
Twitter , which lets users broadcast messages of up to 140 characters via cell phone or the Web , began to take off in March 2007 .
Until this fall , though , it struggled with technical difficulties and frequent service failures .
It now has some 6 million registered users , though the number who use it regularly is much smaller .
( One of them — perhaps Twitter ’s most extreme user — was at the speech .
He said he follows 17,800 people and 6,000 people follow him .
“ Do you do anything else ? ” asked Mr. Williams , who said he can barely keep up with the 947 people he follows . )
Twitter has raised $ 20 million from venture capitalists , but has brought in virtually no revenue , choosing growth over everything else .
Indeed , Mr. Williams said he had planned to raise more capital in mid-2009 and wait to worry about revenue until 2010 .
The recession changed that strategy , Mr. Williams said .
“ I do n’t want to have to raise money in 2009 . ”
Revenue is now a priority for the first quarter of next year .
Mr. Williams said that Twitter gets daily calls from companies who want to pay for sponsorships , but it plans to avoid making money from ads .
Instead , it will figure out a way to charge businesses who use Twitter to talk with customers or sell products .
Companies like JetBlue Airways , Dell and Whole Foods Market have used Twitter in these ways .
So far , though , “ we have n’t studied the business cases much , ” he said .
“ We literally have no business people in the company , so this is n’t an area we ’re really focused on . ”
Throughout the talk , he mentioned several big projects that Twitter plans to tackle but has n’t yet .
One is moving its search function , which is hard to find , to the home page .
Twitter also wants to make it easier for users to find their friends on the service , filter the people they follow and form groups so they can control which messages reach which of their followers .
Twitter has been so slow in taking on this “ low - hanging fruit , ” he said , “ that it ’s amazing anyone uses Twitter today . ”
Still , he said , he has grand plans for the company .
Mr. Williams founded Pyra Labs , which created Blogger , a decade ago , and sold it to Google in 2003 .
“ I worked on Blogger for six years and I do n’t think it ’s nearly as big as Twitter .
Twitter will dwarf that , ” he said .
The start - up ’s biggest threat , he said , “ is people who now see the concept … and say , ‘ Oh , we can do that better . ’
They could kick our butt . ”
Twitter has spawned many copycats , including Yammer , which is like Twitter for the workplace .
The idea that a big company such as Microsoft or Yahoo will start a microblogging service clearly keeps Mr. Williams up at night .
“ I ’m pretty sure they all are about to launch something like this , ” he said .
A decade ago , Blogger was one of the first services that allowed anyone on the Internet to immediately publish his or her own content .
It forever changed the face of media ( witness the blog you are currently reading ) and the way people communicate .
Twitter is an extension of that transformation , Mr. Williams said .
“ I was surprised by blogging .
It took me a while to realize the profundity of blogging , ” he said .
He is not surprised , though , that Twitter is being used in newsgathering , as it was during the terror attacks in India last week .
“ I ’ve actually been waiting for it to happen , ” he said .
The day Barack Obama was elected president was Twitter ’s most - trafficked day ever .
Twitter will complement other forms of media , he said , the way that blogs and newspapers co-exist .
“ New media never kill old media , ” he said .
“ It ’s all part of an ecosystem . ”
Mr. Williams emphasized many times that , despite its buzz , Twitter is still a tiny , two - year - old company with just 25 employees .
“ It ’s good that the expectations are high , but give us a minute , ” he joked .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - Armed robbers stole gems worth 85 million euros ( $ 108 million ) from luxury jewelers in the heart of Paris , during a raid described by French media Friday as the most lucrative heist in France ’s history .
The Harry Winston chain , long a favorite among the world ’s rich and famous , once provided jewels to the Shah of Iran for his wedding and to Richard Burton for his wife Elizabeth Taylor .
A spokeswoman at the Paris prosecutors ’ office said the Harry Winston store , located just off the Champs Elysees on an avenue of luxury outlets , had declared 85 million euros ’ worth of losses to its insurers after Thursday ’s hold - up .
“ These are experienced bandits .
They got through the main door without drawing attention to themselves .
In less than 20 minutes they got up to the first floor , emptied the safes and the display cases and left through the door , ” she said .
A police spokesman said the gang of four men , one or two of them disguised as women , threatened customers and pistol - whipped some of the staff .
They appeared very well - prepared .
“ Apparently they knew the names of several of the staff , ” the spokesman said .
The raid came a year almost to the day after the same store was attacked by robbers who forced staff to empty its safes , taking at least $ 16 million worth of jewels .
Experts at the prosecutors ’ office said the jewels and luxury watches stolen Thursday could not be sold in their present form as they would be too easily recognized .
They said organized crime networks capable of finding buyers for the gems outside of France were likely to be involved in the heist .
The firm shows on its website a gem bought by the late shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis to present to former U.S. first lady Jacqueline Kennedy as an engagement ring .
It also has more recent pictures of movie actresses Gwyneth Paltrow , Hilary Swank and Scarlett Johansson wearing its jewels .
The French celebrity press reported earlier this year that President Nicolas Sarkozy gave a Harry Winston ring to model - turned - popstar Carla Bruni for their engagement , though the information has not been officially confirmed .

Maura Murray Cold Case ( PHOTOS and VIDEO )
Maura Murray in 2003
Maura Murray , a 21 - year - old college student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst , disappeared on a snowy night in February 2004 .
Maura , a nursing student , sent an email to her boss and professors on February 9 , 2004 , letting them know she would be out of town for a few days due to the death of a family member .
Her family says there was no death .
Maura left campus around 4:00 p.m. heading toward New Hampshire after checking for information about the area on her computer .
She stopped by an ATM withdrawing $ 280 , leaving her bank account nearly empty , and purchased $ 35 - 40 in alcohol before leaving Amherst .
Police began receiving calls about an accident in Woodsville , NH at 7:29 p.m .
The first officer arrived on the scene less than ten minutes later , finding Murray 's black 1996 Saturn with a cracked windshield and two deployed airbags .
A damaged box of Franzia wine was found on the passengers seat .
Other items found in the car include her AAA card , the insurance forms she retrieved for an earlier accident , her gloves , music CDs , her makeup , directions for Burlington , Vermont and Stowe , Vermont , and the Nicholas Howe book , " Not Without Peril . "
A rag from Maura 's emergency roadside kit was discovered stuffed into the Saturn 's muffler pipe .
Maura is nowhere to be found .
Police did not begin the search for Maura until 36 hours after finding her abandoned vehicle .
A police dog followed the scent 100 yards east from the location of where the vehicle was found , in the direction of a resident 's house .
It is implied that she may have been picked up or placed in a vehicle at the end of the scent trail .
It is also possible that the scent had vanished due to the incident happening nearly two days earlier .
Police initially reported that they believed Maura had come to the area to run away or commit suicide , a theory debunked by her family and her fiance , an Army lieutenant stationed in Oklahoma .
Two days after her disappearance , Maura 's fiance , William Rausch , received a voicemail message that he believes is the sound of Maura sobbing .
His cellphone had been turned off so that he could pass through airport security on his way to help search for Maura .
The call was traced to a calling card issued to the American Red Cross .
Many believe this call was actually from Maura , not the American Red Cross , as it is unknown how the Red Cross would have his mobile number or why they would leave a voicemail with no actual message .
Murray 's credit cards and cell phone have not registered any activity since the night she disappeared .
There have been reported sightings of Maura since she vanished , however , none have been confirmed .
( photos and video below )
Monday , February 9 , 2004 * 8:00 - 8:30 PM
- A Swiftwater , NH local reportedly sees a young person moving quickly on foot eastbound on Route 112 , about 4 to 5 miles east of where Maura 's vehicle was discovered .
The young person was reported to have been wearing jeans , a dark coat , and a light colored hood .
The witness reports that the person , upon seeing him , quickly ran down a side dirt road .
There have been inconsistencies in multiple interviews .
Wednesday , February 11 , 2004 * Maura 's boyfriend receives a voicemail message that he believes is the sound of Maura sobbing .
A New Hampshire State Police investigation traced the call to a calling card issued to the American Red Cross .
Many believe this call was actually from Maura , not the American Red Cross , as it is unknown how the Red Cross would have his mobile number or why they would leave a voicemail with no actual message .
The voicemail has since been deleted .
June 2005 * A girl with blonde hair resembling Maura is seen at a church in Barton , Vermont .
A witness says that the girl said her name was " Raykel " and took off quickly when the minister started a Father 's Day sermon .
There are no security tapes of the incident available .
The sighting was not reported until a few months later when the witness saw photos of Maura on a television news program .
Murray is described as 5 feet 7 inches tall , 120 pounds , with brown hair and blue - green eyes .
She was last seen wearing a dark coat and jeans and carrying a black backpack and Samsung cell phone .
A $ 40,000 reward is being offered for any information leading to her whereabouts or the arrest of the person responsible for her disappearance .
The tip line is 603-271-2663 , New Hampshire State Police .

For the first time in seven years , Japan has slipped into a recession .
Slowly the US economy has been taking its toll on Japan , as well as the rest of Asian financial markets , which has led to today ’s 4.6 % drop in the Nikkei , Japan ’s stock market .
It is important to understand that recessions do not happen overnight , but are due to bigger issues , many of which culminated today .
Japan ’s economy has also shrank for a second quarter , meaning a 6 month slowdown .
Japan ’s output gap , a measure of supply and demand , has been negative since July .
1. American Recessions Create International Recessions
Whether you believe there is a recession in the US or not , there is a definite slowing in the US economy which has taken its toll globally .
According to the Bureau of Economic Research , via Yahoo News , “ the U.S. recession had begun a year ago , in December 2007 . ”
Recession or no recession , the US is the world ’s largest consumer and American job loss and decreased consumer spending hurts globally .
This means Americans ca n’t buy Japanese tvs , cars , toys , etc without paying a premium that they ca n’t afford currently .
2. Falling US Dow Means Falling Japanese Markets
Yesterday ’s 7.7 % drop in the Dow Jones had a ripple affect through out Asian Financial markets .
This is in part to blame for today ’s early Japanese market poor performance .
According to Yahoo Finance , “ Global markets had rallied last week , but any nascent investor confidence quickly wilted after grim U.S. economic data sent the Dow Jones industrial average plummeting nearly 700 points — or 7.7 percent — Monday , wiping out more than half of last week ’s big gains . ”
There are a lot of major US news announcements coming out this week , and if past performance is any indication , Japan may be looking at a very bumpy week .
3. A Strong Yen Means Less Dollars Are Spent
I know what you are saying , “ How can a strong Yen be bad for Japan ? ” A strong
Yen means that it is more costly for Americans to buy Japanese goods .
This is why Toyotas are starting to cost more .
Since Americans have less spending money , they can afford less Japanese goods .
Less Japanese exports leads to less money coming in and a slowing of their economy .
According to Yahoo News , “ Japanese exporters have been hurting from the yen ’s renewed appreciation , which erodes their overseas earnings .
The dollar was trading at 93.54 yen from 93.18 late Monday . ”
Keep in mind that a few short months ago the Yen was trading at 115 Yen to the dollar .
This almost 20 % increase in value means goods will cost 20 % more and consumers can afford less .
Japan is n’t the only Australasian country doing poorly today .
Just a few months ago the Australian economy was booming , now they too are at the brink of a recession .
Earlier today the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates to try to flood the economy with capital .
That may not be enough for Australia , as what the Asian markets really need is a strong US economy .

What a difference a couple weeks makes .
Two weeks ago , one of John McCain ’s top spokespeople dismissed the voters in Northern Virginia as not from “ real Virginia ” :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzeGtPeQZbs]
Today , McCain was begging those Northern Virginians to support him :
“ Fairfax County is key to this election .
You know that , ” McCain said .
“ You know how important it is for us to win here .
You know how important it is that we put this country in the right direction .
I need your help for the next three days . ”
Not real Virginians , but real voters .
And , they ’re not voting for John McCain :
Obama has an almost 2 to 1 advantage over McCain in Northern Virginia , surpassing even the 60 percent mark that Gov. Timothy M. Kaine ( D ) and Sen. James Webb ( D - Va. ) racked up in the region during their successful campaigns in 2005 and 2006 .
I just checked in with some friends who have been canvassing in Manassas , which is in Northern Virginia .
There are so many Obama volunteers that they had to set up three additional staging areas .
They just kept saying “ It ’s amazing . ”
And , more importantly , they ’re getting a very positive response from the voters .
Pardoned gaming executive made donations to Bush campaign Nick Cargo
Published : Friday December 26 , 2008
Print This Email This Another set of donations to the Republican Party made by a white - collar convict pardoned by President Bush has been revealed .
Alan Maiss , former president of Bally Gaming , made two contributions totaling $ 1,500 to President Bush 's 2004 re-election campaign .
That same year , he also donated $ 1,000 to former House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt 's presidential campaign on the Democratic ticket .
Maiss pled guilty in 1995 to charges that he failed to report a fellow executive 's ties to organized crime to Federal authorities .
Christopher Tanfield , founder of Worldwide Gaming , was reported to be an associate of amusement park operator Eugene Gilpin , found guilty of helping the Genovese crime family run a gambling operation .
Maiss was sentenced to one year of probation and fined $ 5,000 .
An appeal was denied in 2002 .
His pardon was one of 19 performed by Bush on Tuesday .
One of those pardons has been reconsidered by the White House after it took on the look of " impropriety , " according to a Wednesday statement .
Isaac Toussie , 30 , was convicted in 2003 of falsifying income information , sometimes without the subjects ' knowledge , to secure loans for homebuyers through the U.S. Departent of Housing and Urban Development .
He was sentenced to five months in prison , five months in house arrest and a fine of $ 10,000 .
He was not ordered to pay restitution .
The pardon was reconsidered in part , according to the White House , because of $ 28,500 in donations to the Republican National Committee made by New York real estate developer Robert Toussie , Isaac 's father .
In 2001 , Robert and Isaac Toussie were sued by a coalition of homebuyers who accused them of predatory lending practices and predatory marketing of shoddy properties to minorities .
Those plaintiffs were also vocal critics of the Tuesday pardon , calling it the " worst Christmas present ever . "
Maiss declined to comment Thursday .
WASHINGTON - Astronomers looking at the spectacular supersonic plumes of gas and dust shooting off one of Saturn 's moons say there are strong hints of liquid water , a key building block of life .
Their research , appearing in today 's issue of the journal Nature , adds to the growing push to explore further the moon Enceladus , as one of the solar system 's most compelling places for potential life .
Using images from NASA 's Cassini probe , astronomers had already figured that the mysterious plumes shooting from Enceladus 's icy terrain contain water vapor .
New calculations suggesting the gas and dust spew at speeds faster than sound make the case for liquid , said study lead author Candice Hansen of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Lab in California .
Her team calculated that the plumes travel more than 1,360 miles per hour .
Reaching that speed " is hard to do without liquids , " Hansen said .
While her paper offers more evidence building on what others have found , she added that her research is not the final proof of liquid water on Enceladus .
Other planetary scientists , such as Andrew Ingersoll at the California Institute of Technology , said the research is good , but that it is possible to achieve such speeds with ice particles and at cooler temperatures .
So Hansen has n't proved her case yet , he and other scientists said .

There 's an Internet buzz surrounding a " Price is Right " contestant who guessed to the dollar the price of his showcase of gifts during Tuesday 's episode .
Seems that such a precise " Double Showcase " guess has never happened in the show 's long history .
Contestant Terry 's on - the - nose response gave him the items in his showcase as well as the showcase of his opponent , Sharon .
So , how did this happen ?
Postings on message boards at golden - road.net , a website devoted to all things " The Price is Right , " say one of the site 's regular members was in the audience and had been shouting out pricing answers all during the show ( Contestants use these shouted answers for guidance ) .
In this case , the audience member , who calls himself " Ted " at golden - road.net , is an expert on pricing these items and has experience giving correct dollar amounts to contestants .
" Not sure if I 'm welcome at Studio 33 anymore , but I 'm sure I 'll find out one of these days , " Ted wrote on a golden - road .
net message board .
A Las Vegas radio station says that it landed an interview with Terry .
KQOL -FM identified him as Terry Kneiss .
In the interview , Kneiss said he added up the items on his own and got no help from shouts coming from the audience .
" I have a hearing problem , " he said .
He gave this advice to anyone who wishes to replicate his good fortune : " Do your homework .
Watch the show , watch the show , watch the show . "
Also peculiar was host Drew Carey 's understated reaction to the exact guess .
" You got it right on the nose , " Carey said to Kneiss , then he turned immediately to reminding viewers to have their pets spayed or neutered ( a nod to longtime host Bob Barker 's episode - ending sign - off ) .
And just what did Kneiss win ?
His showcase ( value $ 23,743 ) included a karaoke system , a pool table and a travel trailer .
Sharon 's showcase ( value $ 31,019 ) held trips to Chicago , Alberta , Scotland and South Africa .

Elaborating on last week 's post on the nature of wanderlust , today I have a practical example to share .
Here 's how wanderlust works .
You 're minding your own business , and then something lands in front of you -- say , this month 's issue of Mental_floss .
You flip to the back of the mag and devour a great feature article on Namibia , and you start to feel a funny tickle in your brain .
That sounds interesting , says the tickle , which leads you to the internet , where you start looking up Namibia on Wikipedia and a few hours later are looking it up on Kayak ( the plane ticket comparison site ) .
Since flights are north of $ 2,000 apiece , you settle for writing a blog about why it would be awesome to go there .
In short , Namibia is a safe and hospitable former German colony ( and the birthplace of homo sapiens -- check out the floss article ) thinly populated by about two million folk ( that 's just two per square kilometer ) , about 2 % of which are third - and fourth - generation German .
Its physical beauty is so diverse and stunning that Lonely Planet calls it " one of those dreamlike places that make you question whether something so visually orgasmic could actually exist . "
( How do you really feel , Lonely Planet ? )
Anyway , let 's get specific .
Here 's what sounds irresistible to me :
The skeleton coast
Aside from having geography 's coolest name ( I 'm always attracted to spots with forbidding names like " Furnace Creek " and " The Funeral Mountains " ) , it 's an extremely remote and formidable desert -- one of the world 's most arid and inhospitable places -- where the dunes march right up to the edge of the sea , and continue underwater -- creating a region of deadly hidden shallows that has wrecked hundreds of ships along its unwelcoming coastline over the years .
The crews ' grizzly fate is obvious -- they had survived shipwrecks only to die of burning thirst in the desert .
Over time , the shifting sands have encroached onto the sea , and wrecked ships that were once in shallow water are now surrounded by oceans of sand , far from shore , creating a surreal graveyard .
Locals call it " the land God made in anger " ; Portuguese sailors called it As Areias do Inferno , or Sands of Hell .
There are n't a lot of roads through the Skeleton Coast ; the best way to explore it is by small plane , touching down at remote landing strips throughout its length .
Sossusvlei
If amazing dunes are your thing , look no further : the towering , endless , ochre -red dunes of your dreams are in Namibia .
One of the oldest and driest ecosystems on earth , it 's the kind of place where you can feel like the last human on the planet , and explore the strange beauty of " singing " dunes .
The Atlantic 's Clive Crook , writing as if he spent a few too many days wandering among the dunes himself , eloquently describes their hypnotic power :
We drove to high points in the dunes and , despite the modest elevation , gazed out for what must have been 20 miles .
To the horizon in every direction , there was nothing but pristine , curving planes of sand — precise edges that might have been cut with a scalpel , and surfaces minutely poised at the limit of what the laws of mechanics allow , before they flow , fall , and cascade .
There is a wonderfully poetic technical term for that limit : the angle of repose .
Wind blows sand up a dune and drops it , at the crest , onto the leeward side , until the angle of the leeward surface to the horizontal exceeds the angle of repose ; when that critical slope is reached , the sand drops away on the leeward side , leaving a perfectly defined edge , until the angle of repose is restored .
When you disturb the sand on one of those edges , it moves like a viscous liquid , pouring over the surface beneath .
From an edge , say , a hundred feet up , this film of excess sand may take minutes to move slowly but unstoppably all the way down .
It is mesmerizing .
Fish River Canyon
It 's one of the world 's largest canyons , but few people have heard of it .
160 km long , 550 m deep and up to 27 km wide , it 's like nothing else in Africa : a bizarre and humbling moonscape carved by giants .
Pictures hardly do it justice :
Kolmanskop
A few miles outside the remote coastal town of Luderitz -- an oddity of cutesy German colonial architecture lost along an endless , inhospitable coast -- sits the ghost town of Kolmanskop , a small diamond - mining village built like a German town in 1908 , and abandoned to the encroaching sands after a diamond bust in the 1950s .
The town still remains , but the houses are slowly disappearing beneath the dunes .
Etosha National Park
One of the largest and best savannah conservation areas on the continent , vast Etosha ( it 's approximately the size of New Jersey ) protects 114 mammal species and some 340 varieties of bird .
Much of the park is an enormous saltpan that turns into a shallow lake during the rainy season , which attracts all the animals .

“ Gentlemen , as you can plainly see : workers ’ wages have gotten out of control ”
The recent anti-union rhetoric coming out of both the United States ( Re : Auto bailout ) and Ottawa ( Re : OC Transpo strike ) is simply disturbing .
The idea that all of the vitriol is directed toward workers as the cause of the problem is simply laughable .
A non-profitable , failing company is a non-profitable failing company no matter what it ’s employee pay structure is like .
But I find it interesting that nobody seems to be directing any hatred or anger toward the rate of pay of CEOs and executives who do n’t produce anything , but collect a very hansom salary on the backs of workers who actually do the work .
The average salary of CEOs is now more than 821 times that of minimum wage workers and more than 262 times that of the average worker ( both unionized and non-unionized ) .
But yeah , the problem is the workers .

Measles deaths had declined by 99.4 % (! ) before vaccination

When I first heard of alleged mistreatment at Guantanamo Bay , I went on record scoffing at it .
Pure Qaeda propaganda , it seemed to me .
Why was I so dismissive ?
Because I knew the US armed forces would never torture or mistreat prisoners systematically .
Maybe a few violations that would be disciplined - but the idea of a vast array of methodically planned and executed outrages against human dignity was absurd .
Besides , I told myself , no president would be so crazy as to launch a war of ideas against Jihadism by torturing Muslims and exploiting specific cultural Muslim taboos .
We know the rest .
But yesterday 's WaPo has some new detail .
It tells the story of how the military did indeed first approach Gitmo - humanely , in concert with the International Red Cross .
That 's not surprising and what most of us just assumed .
The rank and file have been relentlessly trained in humane treatment and the Geneva standards .
This was America , after all , and there are some things one just takes for granted .
But we did n't account for Bush .
Humane treatment was terminated when Donald Rumsfeld intervened to order torture and abuse out of a frantic pursuit of intelligence .
The Rumsfeld - Cheney - Addington axis keeps saying that the torture emanated from below and that they merely accommodated demands from soldiers and interrogators .
In Gitmo , at least , the reverse was true .
It was Bush and Cheney who intervened - judging that only torture could work and making successful prosecution of the worst terrorists now impossible .
It is Bush and Cheney and their civilian clique who need to be held accountable .

After a grueling eight - city coast - to - coast test of the 3G networks run by AT&T , Sprint and Verizon , we 've come up with some clear - cut test results .
Think you know who has the best network ?
Think again .

The Test
3G is more important now than ever before .
Obviously , AT&T made a big push over the summer to augment 3G for the arrival of the updated iPhone , but almost every smartphone and most standard phones in the three largest cell networks runs on a supposedly fast 3G network , and T - Mobile 's 3G network is in the works .
The technology can , at least on paper , rival home broadband .
AT&T 's HSPA network , for instance , is supposed to deliver data at up to 3.6 M bps downstream , while letting you upload at 1.4 Mbps .
Meanwhile , the EVDO Rev. A that Sprint and Verizon use promises a comparable " burst rate " of 3 M bps up , with 1.5 M bps down .
Like a lot of business travelers , we bloggy types have a particular interest in 3G USB dongles , since we 're often trying to file stories far away from any decent wi-fi .
Figuring out who has the best service quickly becomes a fixation , which becomes an obsession , which , as usual , becomes an ultimate Battlemodo .

In lieu of jetsetting all around the country , we FedExed our testing package from one staffer 's home to the next , until we'd hit eight of the country 's biggest cities .
In each city , testers were instructed to put the three cards — one each from AT&T Sprint and Verizon — through some pretty rigorous paces .
( Note :
In case you 're wondering why T - Mobile is n't represented , the carrier does n't yet have the coverage required , nor does it yet offer 3G USB dongles or cards like the ones we used in testing .
Next year , maybe . )
The testers chose three to five locations ( preferably including one suburban spot ) .
Parking themselves somewhere , they would connect each card to the laptop , running Speakeasy 's bandwidth test five times for each device , and then follow it up with an auxiliary battery of repeated pageload and file download tests , in order to verify Speakeasy 's readings .

The USB dongles we used for testing were typical 3G cards from the carriers : AT&T's Sierra USBConnect 881 , Sprint 's Sierra Wireless Compass 597 and Verizon Wireless 's Novatel USB727 .
We used both a Lenovo and a MacBook Pro , but at any given time the cards were being tested on one or the other , in order to keep hardware from being a comparative issue .
( After all this extensive testing , we do n't think results have much to do with your platform or laptop of choice — even the USB dongles ' antennae did n't have as much relevance as sheer position to cell tower . )
While it may sound like hopping around town testing cards is easy , rest assured it was plenty challenging .
Any test where any of the three cards was n't playing well with a laptop , and the whole test had to be scrapped .
This may not be a clean - room lab study , but we kept firm to our methods and the results speak to that .
There 's a reason this may be the most information anyone has gathered , independently , on the subject .

Download Performance
As far as download performance goes , Sprint won overall , beating AT&T five cities to three , and handily beating Verizon in four cities while losing close contests in four more .
To round it out , Verizon beat AT&T in four cities , tied in one , and lost in three .
Advertisement
These results are n't so random when you plot them on the map .
Besides proving that Sprint is a serious contender in almost any location — and should be taken seriously as a 3G and 4G data service provider , no matter what your feelings are about its basic phone service — we have confirmed what we thought , that the regional Bell heavies ( and the former GTE ) hold their own where their real estate holdings are most vast .
AT&T had troubles in the Northeast and Chicago , but down the coast in Raleigh and over in Austin , it 's probably no surprise that the southern Bell conglomerate came out victorious .
On the West Coast , it was a toss - up except in Portland , where Verizon could n't quite keep it together .

Upload Performance
What are more surprising are the upload performance results : AT&T totally kicked ass here , winning six cities and barely losing to Sprint in the other two .
Verizon was the slowpoke here , though it did nudge Sprint out of the way twice , and beat it soundly once .
Advertisement
Although the same regional attributes crop up here — AT&T is at its weakest in Boston and Chicago — AT&T clearly has a technological edge with HSUPA .
Well , it 's either that or all of the 3G build - out meant to lure iPhone 3G customers has left the carrier with an awful lot of unused upstream bandwidth , since smartphone users download a lot more than they upload .
( This is assuming that upstream and downstream operate independently , as they seemed to in AT&T's case . )
Even when the download performance was crappy , AT&T 's upload talents shined through , indicating that the congestion argument could hold merit .
So , for the time being anyway , if you 're into sending big files , or running some kind of masochistic mobile torrent service , AT&T is the right choice .

Thanks to Mark , Sean , Andi , Eric and Jack for testing .
Special shout - out to Mahoney for helping put together the testing regimen and instructions , and to my brilliant wife for working her Excel bar - graphing magic on our unwieldy spreadsheets .
On this evening we will think of the Führer , who is also everywhere present this evening wherever Germans gather ...
The flag and the Reich shall remain pure and unscathed when the great hour of victory comes .
Through your bravery , you give us at home a lovely Christmas season .
Each child , as he sees the candle 's glow and sings the songs , thinks of you , full of thanks .
Germans shopping for Christmas trinkets have been shocked recently to discover row upon row of Santa Clauses looking to all the world as if they are giving the Hitler salute — right arm , straight as an arrow , raised skyward .
Never mind that St. Nick is carrying a bag of toys and wearing a silly red hat complete with a white pom-pom .
Shoppers were sure — these Santas were Nazis .
The answer comes from a Michigan communications professor , who 's created a disturbing web collection showing the Third Reich 's attempt to convert the holiday into military propaganda .
But Christmas of 2008 also finds authentic reminders of the Nazi era turning up on eBay and YouTube .
The question is uncomfortable , inappropriate — and morbidly fascinating .
And fortunately , some comedians on YouTube have supplied the last word .
Randall Bytwerk teaches communications at Calvin College , and his web exhibit of Nazi propaganda offers an actual glimpse of the murderous dictator at Christmastime .
" Hitler had thousands of Autobahn workers as his guests in the Berlin Sportpalast at Christmas 1938 , " explains an upbeat pamphlet called Everybody 's Hitler !.
" Note the Christmas trees ...
Hitler 's enemies lie when they say that Christmas has been abolished in Germany . "
( After invading France , the Nazis were assuring its Alsace province that der Führer still celebrated the holiday . )
Another photo shows a decorated tree behind a festive Christmas dinner for Hitler and his soldiers .
The blitzkrieg is n't mentioned , but the site does remind us that later — of course — the pamphlet was translated into Dutch .
Professor Bytwerk shows that during the Nazi regime , Hitler 's culture department continued producing a Christmas booklet with magical stories , festive songs , and lavish illustrations .
( The 1944 edition was 200 pages long . )
Several pages quoted the fanatical Christmas Eve speeches of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels .
Like Santa Claus , Hitler is everywhere — and he probably sees you when you 're sleeping , and knows when you 're awake .
The book even includes an apparent Christmas card from der Fürhrer himself displaying a red flower with an inspiring Christmas quote : " All nature is a gigantic struggle between strength and weakness , an eternal victory of the strong over the weak .
" Another site actually shows Santa paying a visit on Nazi officers and their girlfriends in Christmas of 1944 .
But the Nazis ultimately had an insidious agenda for the holiday , and Hitler 's propaganda department could show Bill O'Reilly what a real war on Christmas looks like .
" The Nazis were out to transform Christmas from a Christian holiday to a celebration of the family in a National Socialist context , " writes professor Bytwerk .
In 1943 the Nazis released a 64 - page pamphlet for Advent which never mentions Jesus .
A drawing of lonely soldiers is captioned :
The most disturbing entry is a Christmas story about three men lost in the woods — a king , a soldier , and a wood - cutter .
Bright stars light a poor woman's hut where she holds her newborn child .
She advises her visitors that children fulfill the promise of the future , and the three visitors offer him gifts .
" Nazi propaganda intended to remove as much of the Christian content of Christmas as possible , " writes professor Bytwerk , " turning it into a family festival with German racial overtones .
" There 's a page for each day of the month , but each entry is intensely secular , like a sample children 's letter to a soldier on the front .
( " Mother is already baking for the soldier 's package ...
We think of you so often , especially when we hear the news on the radio ... " )
One YouTube user has even found a clip of a documentary showing Goebbels ' Hitler Youth propaganda for Christmas of 1942 .
More than 65 years later , it 's still a painful subject , and in 2006 the German magazine Spiegel uncovered a bizarre incident :
It 's still possible to buy Nazi artifacts on eBay , including Nazi-era coins and stamps — but not in every country .
" This item can not be sold in Germany , Italy , France , or Austria , " reads one page description , " as stated in Ebay Rules . "
But the web has found more than one way to remember a dark moment in world history .
In fact , 2008 ends with Hitler starring in his very own humiliating meme .
There 's at least half a dozen videos on YouTube swapping in silly subtitles for Hitler 's dialogue in an intense movie called Downfall .
The original film chronicled Hitler 's final 12 days in a bunker in Berlin , receiving bad news from subordinates as his military crumbles .
But now web wise guys have the dictator ranting insanely over trivial slights — poor attendance at Burning Man , the subprime mortgage crisis , getting his avatar banned from World of Warcraft , or struggling to upgrade Windows Vista .
Inevitably , last week someone appropriated the meme to show Hitler complaining about the cost of buying Christmas presents .
" Those of you that think I am being unreasonably cheap better leave now ... " a furious Hitler warns his staff .
Magically , the footage has been re-titled again and again , forcing Hitler to endure every possible insult of fate , and this latest video shows him being slowly bankrupted at Christmastime — by requests for iPads and 3DTVs .

I ’ve been lax about posting lately .
The two conferences in September and October have really knocked me off track .
It ’s not from lack of topics : here ’s an article I ’ve been sitting on for two months .
Back in September , Chandoo presented a difficult problem : Visualization Challenge – How to show market share changes ?
Specifically , how to show the change in market share among five competitors , for two products .
Chandoo came up with a pair of stacked charts , with the stacked columns staggered laterally .
Perhaps the staggering and the connecting lines make it a bit easier to discern the edges of the different colored bars than in an unstaggered stacked column chart .
But in general the charts have some deficiencies ( these are my versions of Chandoo ’s charts , by the way ) .
First , the stacking of bars make it more difficult to judge the magnitude of the segments between top and bottom , and having two charts forces the eye to move too much to see all the data .
The legends take up a large amount of space , though of course duplicate legends are overkill .
Here is Chandoo ’s sample data , if anyone wants to play along .
I approached this challenge by first investigating some different chart types .
The stacked column chart is less cluttered looking than the staggered charts above , but they do n’t really improve on the spatial difference between the two brands , and the large space needed by the legends ( we could delete one of the legends , of course ) .
How about a Clustered - Stacked Column Chart ?
Below is the data arrangement and resulting chart .
I ’ve colored the data range using the scheme that Excel uses to highlight data when a chart series is selected : the blue range contains Y values , the purple contains category labels , and green denotes series names .
The two columns of category label data produces the two - layer labels ( see Chart with a Dual Category Axis ) .
To preserve the lateral spacing , the purple cells with the hatching pattern contain spaces .
The rest of the cells in this table are blank .
The separation of brands and the excess real estate required for the legend (s ) are both improved , and it sure shows off a clever data arrangement .
But the values and trends are no easier to compare than in the other chart types above .
Since we ’re interested in trends , a line chart may help with comparisons .
Labeling the series directly is less obtrusive than the legends , and more effective at identifying the data .
The charts still look somewhat cluttered , and the slopes are all rather too shallow , flattening out the trends .
Perhaps clustering the data instead of stacking it can provide a better perspective ( see Stacked vs. Clustered ) .
The trends are visible even though the charts have bars instead of lines .
The legends are less obtrusive ; that ’s not an intrinsic property of clustered charts , but rather a consequence of having fewer series .
The separation of the two brands still makes comparisons difficult .
Maybe we can combine the good features of the line and clustered column charts .
Enter the panel chart .
The two charts below show the values and trends clearly , without a lot of clutter .
We still have the separation of the brands in the two panel charts above , but the openness of the panel chart allows us to display both brands in the same chart .
This is pretty effective , perhaps the best of all the types I ’ve reviewed .
Does anyone have any better ideas ?
Are there better approaches that I ’ve neglected ?
In the next few days , I plan to write a set of instructions for building this chart .
In addition , I thought this data would be a good vehicle to show a little exercise in data exploration , using pivot tables and pivot charts .
I ’ll comment on this post when I ’ve added each of these pages , so if you subscribe below ( comments are always welcome , but not needed to subscribe ) you ’ll receive a notification when I ’ve updated .
Update 16 November 2008
I ’ve written a couple of follow - up posts .
In Explore Your Data With Pivot Tables I used this data to show how pivot tables can be used to investigate the data quickly and easily .
Then in a second follow - up I showed How to Build a Simple Panel Chart .

This looks like it could be a lot of fun .
The Flee Digital Camera is designed specifically to take photos after you ’ve launched it into the air .
The casing for the camera actually looks like it was inspired by some of the fancier balls made for playing fetch with your dog .
The Flee is bluetooth enabled and will transmit the photos it takes directly to your cellphone .
No word on the size and quality of the pictures or on what the usable range away from the cellphone is .
I think this would be fantastic for taking photos of various sports .
Take it to the beach and throw it over your friends playing volleyball and get some great aerial shots .
It was designed by Turkish designer Hakan Bogazpinar .

HiRISE Camera Captures High - Resolution 3 - D Images of Mars A $ 2 pair of cardboard 3 - D glasses is a must - have on holiday gift lists .
By Lori Stiles , University Communications
The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment , or HiRISE , team based at The University of Arizona today released 362 three - dimensional images of Mars taken by the HiRISE camera on NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
Other Mars - orbiting cameras have taken 3 - D views of Mars , but the HiRISE camera â the most powerful camera ever to orbit another planet â can resolve features as small as one meter , or 40 inches , across .
" It 's really remarkable to see Martian rocks and features on the scale of a person in 3 - D , " said Alfred McEwen of UA 's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory , HiRISE principal investigator .
" The level of detail is just much , much greater than anything previously seen from orbit . "
The 3 - D images , or anaglyphs , can be viewed on the HiRISE Web site ( http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/anaglyphs) with inexpensive color filter glasses commonly used for viewing 3 - D images and movies .
The HiRISE Web site links to information on where to purchase and how to make 3 - D red-cyan filter glasses .
Without 3 - D glasses , the Mars images appear out of register .
( In Tucson , UA 's Flandrau Science Center , 1601 E. University Blvd. , and Starizona , 5757 N. Oracle Road , sell cardboard red-cyan glasses for $ 2 each . )
Seen in HiRISE 3 - D , Mars becomes a collection of deep panoramic views that leap out from the computer screen .
" You 'd swear you could touch the terrain , " HiRISE operations manager Eric Eliason said .
Striking stereo views include :
Sixty - meter tall , or 200 - foot - tall fractured mounds , probably composed of solidified lava , on the southern edge of Elysium Planitia .
The fractured surface suggests that lava pushed the surface into domes , uplifting some sides along the same fracture higher than others .
See image here .
Spectacular layers exposed on the floor about 2 - and - a - half miles , or 4 kilometers , below the rim of Candor Chasma , which is a large canyon in the Valles Marineris system .
The canyon may once have been filled to its rim by sedimentary layers of sand and dust - sized particles , but these have since eroded , leaving patterns of elongated hills and layered terrain that has been turned and folded in many angles and directions .
See image here .
Groups of gullies at different elevations along the wall of an unnamed crater in Terra Cimmeria .
The anaglyph image provides three - dimensional perspective on the depth of the gullies and the amount of material deposited below the gullies .
Geological evidence suggests that the gullies may have formed by subsurface water , rather than by snow or ice melting on the surface .
See image here .
Other dramatic anaglyphs show a huge jumbled mass of rock that includes megabreccia at a central peak in Ritchey crater , ejecta - formed channels and mudflows at Hale crater , tightly folded rock layers lining the floor of Tithonium Chasm , " spiders " created by carbon dioxide venting through south polar layered deposits , and Martian glacier flows .
Eliason and the team at HiROC , the High Resolution Imaging Operations Center on the UA campus , began processing stereo images in October .
They automated some of the software used in processing HiRISE images so two images of a stereo pair could be fed into the software " pipeline " and correlated automatically .
" The real advance here is making this process semi-automated so we can really crank through all these huge images , " McEwen said .
Producing anaglyphs from stereo pairs is otherwise a tedious , time - consuming effort .
The HiRISE camera has so far taken 950 stereo image pairs .
The camera features a half - meter , or 20 - inch , diameter primary mirror and a focal plane mechanism that can acquire up to a 3.6 megapixel image in about 11 seconds .
The anaglyphs are among 1,642 observations containing 3.6 terabytes of data and 148,000 image products that HiRISE released today to the Planetary Data System , or the PDS , the NASA mission data archive .
Since HiRISE began the science phase of its mission in November 2006 , the HiRISE team has released a total 867,430 image products , or 30.2 terabytes of data .
That is by far the greatest volume of data a space experiment has delivered to the PDS , and well more than twice the data volume some HiRISE team members expected to get during the primary science phase .
The HIRISE camera was designed to take images at high - convergence angles so researchers can calculate the thickness of surface features to within about 10 inches , or 25 centimeters .
High - convergence angles used to get quantitative measurements are n't always best for making anaglyphs , McEwen said .
In addition , if the two stereo images on two different orbits were taken far enough apart in time , the illumination or air opacity may have changed , or frost or dust devils may have appeared in one of the images , so paired images do n't always match that well , he added .
" Nevertheless , many of these stereo anaglyphs are very interesting and useful to us in understanding the topography , " McEwen said .
" There 's a lot of science to be done by just looking at these directly and understanding what 's up and what 's down , " he added .
" Anaglyphs can definitely change how we interpret things , and help us focus on how to proceed when it comes to prioritizing some science tasks . "
Binocular vision gives humans wearing 3 - D color glasses the ability to see anaglyphs in three dimensions the same way they see in three dimensions through a View - Master viewer or a Victorian - era stereoscope .
The same scene is viewed in two pictures taken from slightly different angles .
Each eye has its own slightly different view , which the brain fuses together into a single picture with depth .
With the colored glasses , the red filter for the left eye sees only red in the picture , the cyan filter for the right eye sees only blue - green in the picture , and the brain correlates the images .
The glasses work for viewing stereo pictures in print or on TV , movie and computer screens .
1 of 3 Lava apparently uplifted and formed fractured domes in this anaglyph image taken at Elysium Planitia , Mars , by the HiRISE camera on NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
The image becomes three - dimensional when viewed with red-cyan filter glasses .
2 of 3 Swirls of rock appear on the floor of Candor Chasma , about 4 kilometers , or 2.5 miles , below the crater rim in this anaglyph taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment on NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
The scene takes on a dramatic , three - dimensional aspect when viewed with 3D color filter glasses .

Iraq to probe ' custody abuse ' of Bush shoe assailant Agence France - Presse
Published : Tuesday December 16 , 2008
Print This Email This Iraq 's justice system is to probe the case of the journalist who hurled his shoes at US President George W. Bush , officials said on Tuesday , as his brother said he had been beaten up by security agents .
" Muntazer al - Zaidi has been transferred to the judicial authorities who have opened an investigation .
But it is too soon to say who was behind this act , " General Qassem Atta , spokesman for a Baghdad security plan , told AFP .
The journalist 's brother , meanwhile , said he has a broken arm and ribs after being struck by Iraqi security agents .
Durgham Zaidi was unable to say whether Muntazer had sustained the injuries while being overpowered during Sunday 's protest against Bush 's visit to Baghdad or while in custody later .
He said he had been told that his brother was initially held by Iraqi forces in the heavily fortified Green Zone compound in central Baghdad where the US embassy and most government offices are housed .
" He has got a broken arm and ribs , and cuts to his eye and arm , " said Durgham .
Zaidi , 29 , a journalist for private Iraqi television channel Al - Baghdadia , was swiftly overpowered by Iraqi security forces after he threw the shoes at Bush in a gesture seen as the supreme mark of disrespect in the Muslim world .
An AFP journalist said that blood was visible on the ground as he was led away into custody although it was unclear if it was his .
Bush , who was on a swansong visit to the battleground that came to dominate his eight - year presidency , ducked when the shoes were thrown and later made light of the incident .
But Zaidi's action won him widespread plaudits in the Arab world where Bush 's policies have drawn broad hostility .
The Lebanese television channel NTV , known for its opposition to Washington , went as far as offering a job to the journalist .
In its evening news bulletin on Monday , it said that if he takes the job , he will be paid " from the moment the first shoe was thrown " .
Zaidi
A manager at the channel told AFP that it had made its offer known to Zaidi and was ready to post bail on his behalf .
An Iraqi lawyer said Zaidi risks a miminum of two years in prison if he is successfully prosecuted for insulting a visiting head of state .
In Gaza , around 20 Palestinian gunmen from the Popular Resistance Committees , a hardline militant group that has been behind a spate of rocket attacks on Israel in recent weeks , staged a demonstration in support of Zaidi .
Wearing fatigues and brandishing Kalashnikov assault rifles , they stamped on photographs of the US president and held banners in support of the journalist .
Egyptian independent daily Al - Badeel carried a frontpage caricature of the US flag with the sole of a shoe replacing the stars in the top corner .
Even government - owned newspapers in Cairo praised Zaidi 's actions .
" Pelting the American president with shoes was the best way for expressing what Iraqis and Arabs feel toward Bush , " wrote Al - Gomhuria editor Mohammad Ali Ibrahim .
In Iraq , press comment was divided .
The pro-government Al - Sabah newspaper expressed concern about the potential impact on press freedom of what it called Zaidi's " abnormal individual behaviour . "
But the independent Al - Dustur newspaper hailed the journalist as the " only Iraqi whose patriotic feelings made him express his opinion in this way . "
" It is not a declaration by the Iraqi media only , but for all Iraqis who have suffered over the years and we demand that he not be handed over to US forces , " the paper said .
In further evidence of our rapidly eroding civil liberties , the Department of Homeland Security disclosed today that US Customs and Border Protection and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement have the right to confiscate and search a traveler 's laptop or other electronic device without any suspicion of wrongdoing .
The rules -- which we reported on in February -- allow for searches of hard drives , flash drives , cellphones , iPods , pagers , and video or audio tapes , and specify that the agencies can " detain " belongings for a " reasonable period of time , " ( i.e. , as long as they please ) .
Additionally , the DHS can share the data found with other government agencies or private entities for translation , decryption , or ( astoundingly vague ) " other reasons . "
The DHS says the policies apply to anyone entering the country -- including US citizens -- and claim the measures are necessary to prevent terrorism .
In other news , Big Brother issued a statement today guaranteeing a bonus for turning over family members suspected of crimethink to the Thought Police .

Ms. Palin could be turning to television to restore her tarnished image , jumpstart a 2012 presidential bid , or both .
But so far , viewers have mostly witnessed some of the very traits  disarming candor and staggering presumption  that drove some McCain campaign aides to leak damaging accusations about her .
Image Gov. Sarah Palin sat for an interview with Fox News 's Greta Van Susteren .

Fox News
The news media has moved on to President - elect Barack Obama and his transition team as they try to get a grip on the perilous state of the economy .
Ms. Palin ’s interviews dragged the subject back to her campaign woes , and she lingered there , feeding curiosity but making no real effort to steer her questioners to the present .
Her demeanor is as positive and peppy as ever , but the criticism evidently took a toll .
Even in her kitchen in Wasilla , Alaska , preparing dinner for the family and visiting reporters ( moose chili for Greta Van Susteren , a haddock and salmon casserole for Mr. Lauer ) , Ms. Palin seemed frozen in the bubble of campaign past , fighting to make her case above the whispers of aides , handlers and media consultants .
When Mr. Lauer asked her if she minded not being allowed to give more interviews during the campaign , Ms. Palin said she would not delve into that kind of “ inside baseball , ” and then she stole a base .
“ I would have loved more opportunities to speak to the American people about what I ’d like to see of  happen there with our country , ” she said pointedly .
Ms. Palin used the term “ Sarah - centric ” to describe her campaign rallies , arguing that fans were responding to her more as a symbol than as a person .
“ But not me personally were those cheers for , ” she said to Ms. Van Susteren in an interview shown Monday night on Fox News .
“ But it was just for the representation of a woman on the ticket , a mom , somebody who loves this country so much , somebody very , very committed to policies that I believe will progress this country in the right direction . ”
TOKYO ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Teens who skip breakfast as middle school students tend to have sex at an earlier age than those who start the day with a proper meal , a government - backed Japanese medical researcher said on Friday .
The link between breakfast and sex probably lies in the teens ’ family life , said Kunio Kitamura , executive director of the Japan Family Planning Association , who conducted the survey .
The survey examined sexual experiences as well as family relationships and lifestyle habits of Japanese females and males aged 16 to 49 .
It was carried out in September and was based on about 1,500 people .
The average age of first - time sex for those who said they ate breakfast every day as a middle school student was 19.4 , while for those who skipped breakfast , the average age was 17.5 .
“ The fact that people ca n’t eat breakfast may show something about their family environment , ” said Kitamura .
“ Before blaming individuals for having sex at an early age , it may be necessary to look into the sort of homes they are from . ”
The survey , intended to study how to reduce unwanted pregnancies , also showed the average age of first - time sex was lower for those who found their mother annoying .
People who said they disliked their mother had sex for the first time at the average age of 16 , while the average age for those who appreciated their mother was 19 , Kitamura said .

Note : I ’m going to be frantically finishing my next book _ Independence Days_ which is about the ties between sustainable food systems and food preservation and storage .
This means not as much time to post new stuff .
So I thought I ’d run a few old columns – after all , I ’ve been writing this blog for years now , and my readership has expanded a lot , so hopefully some of the old content will be valuable to people .
Apologies to those who are already familiar with this stuff .
More new come January , when I get to breathe again .
This one is from May , 2007 , just as we were about to start the Riot for Austerity , as I was thinking how to get our energy cost for cooking down .
In the spirit of our really riotous reduction , I ’ve been thinking about how to cut my cooking energy down as much as possible .
Here are 25 ways I ’ve come up with to cut cooking energy .
1 . Turn off the stove / oven before you are finished .
This is fairly simple – when you soup is almost hot , turn off the stove – it will continue to heat for a while .
When your bread is 15 minutes short of baked , turn off the oven and let it sit in the hot oven .
You can do this for longer with things that are hotter for longer , or less sensitive , like casseroles .
Be cautious with meat – you do n’t want food poisoning .
Experiment .
2 . Eat more salads , sandwiches and raw foods that do n’t require cooking .
3 . Make a hay box cooker – insulated a box with a blanket , hay or other good insulator .
Get your food nice and hot , and then put it in that insulated box and let the retained heat do the cooking .
4 . Use a pressure cooker – they save a lot of time when cooking beans , grains , stews and such .
Modern pressure cookers do n’t explode like the old ones did , so do n’t be scared !
5 . Capture heat whenever you can .
Instead of heating up several pots of water for tea or soup each day , heat that water and put it in a thermos , and use it for tea when you need it .
If the stove has residual heat , stick your kettle on the burner to warm up the water .
6 . Use a wood cookstove to heat your house and cook at the same time .
Save heavy canning and long cooking projects for times when you would be heating the house anyhow whenever possible – for example , canning applesauce can often wait until winter if you have varieties of apples that store well .
7 . Or , if you heat with wood but do n’t have a cookstove , cook on your heating stove .
Put your kettle on the stove .
Keep soup on the back of the stove .
Have someone build a sheet metal oven for you ( just a metal box with a door ) that will enable you to bake on the stove .
8. Build an earth or masonry oven outside and use twigs and other scrap wood to bake and cook .
A hot earth oven will stay hot enough for you to start by making pizza , then move down to bread , stew and finally dehydrating .
Info in _Build Your Own Earth Oven_ by Kiko Denzer and _Capturing Heat Two_ by Still , Hatfield and Scott of the Aprovecho Research Center .
9 . Build or buy a solar oven .
Instructions for making your own are available on many sites , and in _Capturing Heat : Five Earth Friendly Cooking Technologies and How to Build Them_ by Still and Kness of the source above .
The Maria Telkes Solar Cooker gets a bit hotter than some other models , as do the commercial ones .
Tom at Sustainable Choice ( who advertises on the sidebar of the blog ) sells commercial Sunovens , and we ’ve been very happy with ours , although we got along for a good long time with homemade versions .
10 . Build a solar dehydrator for food preservation instead of using an electric one .
Here ’s a cool one : http://greenbluebrown.blogspot.com/2006/10/tomato-dehydrating-update.html
11 . Do n’t preheat your oven – that is , put your food in while the oven is preheating to capture that heating energy .
The only exceptions where this is n’t a good idea are a few really delicate baked goods , but generally this works fine , although you may have to slightly adjust your timing .
Practice makes perfect .
12 . If you have an electric stove or oven , convert to natural gas or propane – they are much more efficient ways of making heat .
Or at least convert to convection heating , which uses less energy than conventional electric stoves .
13 . Build a rocket stove or rocket bread oven as seen in the first _Capturing Heat_ – a rocket stove uses biomass fuel much more efficiently than a woodstove or earth oven .
A rocket bread oven can cook 20 loaves at a time .
14 .
Have a baking day , or two a week .
Do all your oven work then and store your baked goods .
15 .
Use a crockpot if you have an electric stove – a crockpot generally will use less energy than an electric stove , although not a gas one .
It can also save a lot of time and energy if you ’ve been eating take out – it uses a lot less energy , generally , than driving for fast food .
16 .
Only bake in a full oven – plan ahead and while you are baking your bread , also consider roasting a pan of vegetables or baking that pie you ’ll want later .
17 .
Do n’t open your oven or remove pot lids more often than necessary .
Keep the heat in .
Never boil water or heat anything without a lid .
18 . Use a microwave instead of a stove ( I personally hate microwaves , but they are more efficient than conventional stoves ) .
19 .
Make large batches of things and reheat , cooking less often ( although this might not make sense if you could give up fridge or freezer otherwise – think it through carefully ) .
20 . Lactoferment pickles , kimchi , etc … and do n’t can them .
Just keep them in a cool place , and save the canning energy .
21 . Switch from a coffee percolator to a press coffee maker .
22 . Soak beans overnight in cold water to reduce cooking time .
23 .
Use cast iron or other heavy cookware that retains heat better than cheap aluminum .
That way , you can turn things off even sooner .
24 .
Make your own low - heat charcoal , cook over the process , and then use agrichar to improve your garden soil .
25 .
Get your cat to sit on the butter warmer ( covered of course ) when you need it melted .
Ok , this one is n’t a real suggestion , but I ’m one short , and it probably would work , if you could persuade the cat not to eat the butter .
Cheers ,
Sharon
Factors other than the economy that may also be at play in the prescription downturn include adverse publicity about some big- selling medications  like the cholesterol medications Zetia and Vytorin , marketed jointly by Merck and Schering - Plough .
And sales of Zyrtec , a popular allergy medication , moved out of the prescription category earlier this year when Johnson & Johnson began selling it as an over - the - counter medication .
Diane M. Conmy , the director of market insights for IMS Health , said the drop in prescriptions might also be partly related to the higher out - of - pocket drug co-payments that insurers are asking consumers to pay .
“ Some consumers are making decisions based on the fact that they are bearing more of the cost of medicines than they have in the past , ” Ms. Conmy said .
The average co-payment for drugs on insurers ’ “ preferred ” lists rose to $ 25 in 2007 , from $ 15 in 2000 , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation , a nonprofit health care research organization .
And , of course , lots of people have no drug insurance at all .
That includes the estimated 47 million people in the United States with no form of health coverage , but it is also true for some people who have medical insurance that does not include drug coverage  a number for which no good data may exist .
For older Americans , the addition of Medicare drug coverage in 2006 through the Part D program has meant that 90 percent of Medicare - age people now have drug insurance .
And in the early going , Part D had helped stimulate growth in the nation ’s overall number of prescriptions , as patients who previously had no coverage flocked to Part D .
But a potential coverage gap in each recipient ’s benefit each year  the so - called Part D doughnut hole  means that many Medicare patients are without coverage for part of the year .
The recent IMS Health figures reveal that prescription volume declined in June , in July and again in August , mirroring studies from last year suggesting that prescription use begins dropping at about the time more Medicare beneficiaries begin entering the doughnut hole .

Mother 's fury over Nintendo Scrabble game that taught her son a string of vile swear words
Ethan Carrington - Anderson and his mother Tonya with his Nintendo DS Scrabble game that has a tendency to come up with rude words when it is the computer 's turn to play
A mother who bought a Scrabble game for her eight - year - old son 's computer console to improve his vocabulary has told of her disgust after it produced a string of swearwords .
Tonya Carrington , 36 , gave her son Ethan the Nintendo version of the much - loved word game , enabling him to pit his wits against ' virtual ' characters .
But she was horrified to discover that the computer - generated players were laying down words containing crude slang and abuse .
Now she is urging other parents considering buying the popular package as a Christmas present to think again .
Mrs Carrington tried out the program for herself on Ethan 's hand - held DS console and was taken aback when her ' opponent ' laid down the word ' t * ts ' .
The game also gives a definition of words it uses , on this occasion giving the meaning ' a garden bird ' but also ' an informal word for female breasts ' .
Any doubt was removed when the next word the computer offered was ' f *ckers ' , which it defined as ' a slang word for chavs ' .
As if that was n't bad enough , it received a triple score and won the game for the character , whose name was Camilla .
' Ethan is doing really well with English at school , so I decided to get this to help boost his vocabulary - but obviously not like that , ' she said .
' I would have been horrified if Ethan had seen that word .
" Sh*t " had come up as well .
I was absolutely mortified .'
The word ' toke ' - defined as ' a draw on a cannabis cigarette ' - also came up during a game .
Mrs Carrington , from Lincoln , bought the game , Nintendo Scrabble 2007 , from Asda in a two - for - £ 25 deal after it was billed as family - friendly .
' The worst thing is that there 's an age rating of 3 + on the box and no advisory warning about adult language on the packaging at all , ' said Mrs Carrington , who also has a two - year - old daughter , Destiny .
' It 's disgraceful .
Scrabble is a game for families , but I 've had to ban Ethan from playing this version because of the horrible words it uses .
' It 's such a shame for him , because he loves Scrabble .
Nintendo is on the Christmas wish - list of every kid , and parents need to be warned . '
Foul - mouthed : This is the Scrabble game that shocked Tonya Carrington
Ethan added : ' I love Scrabble , so I was really disappointed when Mum told me I could n't play it on the DS because of the rude words . '
Along with her husband Paul , who runs a hair salon , they complained to Asda but were told to contact Nintendo .
It in turn blamed the game 's publisher , Ubisoft , and told her to contact video - games rating system Pan European Game Information .
She emailed them three months ago but has yet to hear whether any action will be taken .
A spokesman for Ubisoft said : ' We are sorry the game has caused concern , but it includes a " junior " option that stops it using unusual or offensive words . '
But Mrs Carrington insisted : ' I read the booklet that came with it , and there was no mention of a junior version .
It should be made much clearer . '

After initially proofreading this post I was thinking to myself that I would n’t post it because it ’s not a training article , and quite frankly some of the activities are pretty foo - foo .
But on second thought , some of these ideas apply more to men , while others apply more to women , so there is something in this list for everyone .
I recommend referring to this list on your next boring spring , summer , or autumn weekend .
When you are looking for something to do around the house or around the yard , these ideas might inspire you to create , clean , fix , or just burn extra calories .
After all being swole does n’t always have to be about squatting , benching , power cleaning ( the Olympic lift ) , or sprinting .
Being swole is much more about the path we take to get there , than the end result .
Although when you look great naked , the end result is pretty sweet .
13 Obscure Ideas for Accomplishing Stuff While Getting Exercise
Chop Wood
Put down that chain saw and grab your axes .
You should have a hatchet , a regular axe , a 10 lb wedge , and a sledgehammer to whack the top of the wedge .
Do n’t forget to wear gloves .
Use the hatchet for branches and sticks .
Use the regular axe to chop your typical log .
Use the wedge to chop knotty wood , or really large slabs of hard wood like oak .
Firstly you need to find some trees to cut down .
Grab your traditional axe and head out into the woods .
Find a tree to chop down and start swinging .
Dead and dying trees are much easier to chop than live trees .
FYI .
Do not chop straight into the wood , instead chop notches out of 1 /2 of one side of the tree .
Go around to the other side and continue to cut notches from that 1 /2 of the tree .
By chopping strategically , you can maintain total control over where and how the tree finally falls .
Now haul that tree back to your yard or chopping block .
You have to carry it on your shoulder Commando - style though .
Arnold in Commando
Decide if you want to chop your wood into pieces , or use it whole as training equipment .
With a solid tree trunk , you can mimic many of the exercises performed in the Highland Games and World ’s Strongest Man .
Chop that sucker up into 12 x 4 x 4 inch slices and stack them in a pile .
You can either sell this as firewood , take it camping , or burn it in your own wood stove .
Rake the Leaves
You wo n’t get much of a pump , but you will burn calories if you have big yard .
The kids benefit because they can then jump in the leaf pile and scatter the leaves all across the yard again .
You should inevitably pile these leaves in with organic waste to make a nutrient - rich mulch for next year ’s landscaping efforts .
Mow the Lawn
Turn off the tractor mower and instead choose the push mower .
If you have a self - propelled mower then you are out of luck .
Similar to raking the leaves , you ’ll burn more calories if you have a bigger yard .
Want to make it even harder ?
Do n’t use anything to catch the grass , that way you ’ll have to rake up the grass clippings once you ’ve finished mowing .
( OK , so that ’s a huge waste of time . )
Dig a Hole
No matter what you are digging , you will most surely get a workout .
Keep a steady rhythem and never stop digging until your whole body burns .
And it will .
Always remember to wear gloves or you will regret it the next day .
Snow , dirt , clay , rocks , ice , mud .
If there ’s anything for you to shovel , go shovel it .
Reasons to dig a hole :
Put up a basketball hoop or flag pole .
Make a swim hole , duck pond , or skating rink .
A booby - trap for the jerky neighbor .
Find rocks , which you can then use to build stuff … like a wall or fortress .
=P Build Something
Working with wood , rocks , and heavy equipment works your upper body , especially your arms and upper back .
Always remember to lift heavy objects with your legs for a great lower body workout too .
Things you could build : A shed , garage or man cave .
A tree house for the kids .
A dog house for Spike .
A dresser or bureau .
Cabinets
Build wooden furniture and start a business selling them online .
A stone wall or anything else requiring you to carry rocks around .
Clean the Garage
You know there are a ton of boxes and other junk out there to sort through .
If you spend one full day cleaning the garage , you will most likely not have to go to the gym that day … and probably not the day after either .
Help Someone Move
The opportunity to do this does n’t come around often , but when it does you should jump on it .
There ’s nothing quite as satisfying as walking around with a fridge or a washing machine in your arms .
Consider posting your services on Craigslist and you might even be able to charge money for it .
Walk the Dog
Many flabby folk have started their fat loss strategy by pledging to walk the dog for an hour in the morning and an hour at night .
Make puppy jog a bit and maybe even run for a while .
You and pup will bond and he will develop a strong cardiovascular system , which will help him live to a ripe old age .
Vacuum
Listen .
Pushing the vacuum around the house for an hour is not much of a workout , but the house has to be cleaned , so make the best of it .
This is probably more of a tip for a chubby mommy .
Wash Windows and Mirrors
Another mommy tip I suppose , but if you go clean some windows for an hour without stopping , you will know the true meaning of lactic acid burn .
A window washing workout once a week for a couple hours will definitely contribute to shoulder definition .
Walk or Ride Instead of Drive
Walk to where you have to go if possible .
Better yet , ride your bike .
Anything beats driving when it comes to burning calories .
Take Stairs Instead of the Elevator
This is one of those typical tips that all fitness experts put at the top of their list .
They have a good point though .
Why waste a perfectly good calorie burning opportunity ?
Besides , when terrorists bomb your city you will have a much greater chance of escaping if you are in the stairwell , than if you are stuck in the elevator .
Gardening and Landscaping
I got this idea from the same website that also mentioned washing windows and vacuuming .
The thing I like about gardening is that it is very relaxing , and when you ’ve finished you can really take pride in your yard .
For a better workout , consider landscaping .
When landscaping you will be digging holes , planting tress , excavating rocks , and carrying around various lawn and garden ornaments such as stones , bridges , and other heavy stuff .

Rebels from the Ugandan Lord 's Resistance Army ( LRA ) have killed 189 people during three separate raids in a remote part of Democratic Republic of Congo , the UN and aid agencies said today .
Attacks on the villages of Faradje , Doruma and Gurba , in north - eastern Congo , between December 25 and 27 came as LRA rebels fled a regional military offensive by neighbouring states .
Numerous adults and at least 20 children were kidnapped during the raids - a signature of the militia , which is led by Joseph Kony , a self - proclaimed mystic who is wanted for war crimes by the international criminal court .
According to the UN humanitarian agency OCHA , the worst attack took place at Doruma , 25 miles from the Sudanese border , on Boxing Day , killing 89 people .
Ugandan army officials and aid workers said dozens of the victims had been sheltering inside a Catholic church and were hacked to death with machetes .
The LRA terrorised northern Uganda for almost 20 years from the late eighties , killing and maiming more than 10,000 people , abducting 20,000 children to use as soldiers and sex slaves , and forcing at least 2 million civilians to live in camps .
Most of the victims were Acholis – the very people the rebels claimed to be acting for against the government of President Yoweri Museveni .
In 2006 the reclusive Kony emerged in South Sudan , calling himself " a man of peace " and agreeing to a truce with the Ugandan army .
But during more than two years of tortuous negotiations on disarmament and justice he failed to attend several planned signing ceremonies intended to formally end the rebellion .
Each time his negotiating team would insist that ICC warrants against Kony and two senior commanders remained the sticking point .
Meanwhile , Kony 's ragtag army , small yet extremely skilled in bush warfare , continued to launch raids in Sudan , Congo and Central African Republic .
On December 14 regional patience finally ran out .
Uganda , South Sudan and Congo announced a joint offensive to flush the rebels out of their bases in the Garamba national park , in north - eastern Congo .
Operation Lightning
Thunder , which was led by Uganda , saw airstrikes by MiG fighters and attack helicopters against several LRA hideouts , including Camp Swahili , Kony 's reported base .
While the rebels were forced onto the run , no LRA senior figures were reported to have been killed or captured .
Before the operation human rights experts and analysts applauded the regional cooperation , but warned that the attacks could result in significant civilian casualties and retaliatory raids .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Americans say the sagging economy is making the 2008 holiday season more stressful than previous years , according to a CNN poll out Monday , with up to two - thirds of them reporting some belt - tightening .
Four in 10 people questioned in the CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey said the recession is adding stress to their holiday season .
The poll found 67 % of the 1,096 adults questioned said they are cutting the amount they plan to spend on Christmas or Hanukkah gifts , and 65 % said they are cutting back on leisure travel , dining out or going to the movies .
" That means that cutting back on holiday is the number one way that Americans are reacting to the recession , " CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said .
" More Americans are cutting their gift - giving budget than are cutting back in any other category of spending , from leisure activities , like going to movies or restaurants , to clothing to major purchases such as furniture or other appliances . "
In the poll , 31 % of respondents said they had cut back on necessities such as food or medicine , and 38 % said they had cut heating or electric bills .
Half said they have postponed a major purchase like furniture or appliances -- always a bad sign for the economy .
" No wonder so many Americans are stressed out this holiday season , " Holland said .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted December 1 - 2 , with a sampling error of 3 percentage points .
On Monday most of Mumbai , India attempted a return to normal activity , in the wake of the 60 - hour - long siege last week .
Some facts about the attacks are a bit clearer now , others still hazy .
Based in part on the confessions of the only terrorist captured alive - Azam Amir Kasav ( also identified elsewhere as ' Ajmal Qasab ' ) , Indian officials now say that there were only 10 gunmen involved , all members of Lashkar - e - Taiba , a Pakistani militant group with links to the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir - though Pakistan officially denies any involvement .
According to recent reports , the ten attackers were responsible for the deaths of 172 people , including 19 foreigners , and 239 wounded .
While mourners of the victims attended to their loved ones , and people all over the world held vigils , a Muslim graveyard in Mumbai refused to bury the nine dead gunmen - an official saying that they were not true followers of the Islamic faith .

With the defeat of marriage equality for gays and lesbians in California , Arizona , and Florida , and the banning of adoption by gay and lesbian people in Arkansas in the last election , it ’s easy to believe that the majority of Americans oppose marriage and adoption rights for gays and lesbians .
A new poll commissioned by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ( GLAAD ) paints quite a different picture .
The Pulse of Equality Survey , conducted by Harris Interactive , found that 75 percent of the just over 2,000 US adults over 18 years old support either marriage or domestic partnerships / civil unions for gay and lesbian couples .
In addition , 69 percent opposed laws like the one passed in Arkansas that bans qualified gay and lesbian couples from adopting .
The numbers get even more interesting when the views of those who identified themselves as Christians are counted ( too few respondents identified as Muslim or Jewish to be quantified ) .
Among mainline Christians , 42 percent support domestic partnerships or civil unions , while 40 percent support marriage .
Catholics were not far behind , with 42 percent favoring separate but equal domestic partnerships or civil unions , and 36 percent favoring full marriage rights .
Among evangelical Christians , 37 percent support domestic partnerships or civil unions , while just 23 percent supported marriage .
Overall , that means 59 percent of evangelical Christians actually support some sort of legal protection for gay and lesbian relationships .
This squares with a Religion & Ethics NewsWeekly poll done before the last election that showed 58 percent of young white evangelicals support some form of legal recognition for gay and lesbian couples .
Talking to Neil Giuliano , President of GLAAD
Neil Giuliano , president of GLAAD , is encouraged by the results .
He attributes them to the fact that gay and lesbian people and the issues important to them have been in the public eye .
Apparently , gays and lesbians themselves are more visible ; the survey showed 73 percent of those polled know someone who is gay or lesbian .
Giuliano is especially heartened by the result among Christians .
“ What that means is that these conversations about LGBT inclusion are really making a difference and people in faith communities and religious communities who are having these conversations are playing a very important role .
Leaders in the various denominations need to know their members actually support equality and are open to those conversations , ” he said .
That ’s an important point .
Despite the anti-gay positions by many mainline religious leaders like Rick Warren , Pope Benedict XVI , and Tony Perkins — and the Mormon Church ’s well - financed push against marriage equality in California — the rank - and - file sitting in the pews each week are more open to granting full rights to their gay and lesbian neighbors .
Leaders who continually speak out against gays and lesbians might take notice that their congregations are already many steps ahead of them in tolerance , acceptance , and compassion .
Why Did Gay Rights Take Such a Hit ?
All this good news begs the question , though :
If so many people are feeling so positively about their gay and lesbian brothers and sisters , why did marriage equality go down in flames in three states and the citizens of yet another state voted down adoption rights ?
Guiliano believes it ’s all about the heated political rhetoric of the past election :
The electorate is always going to be swayed by the political campaign of the day , and what our data shows is that where the majority of US adults are moving and what direction they ’re moving with regard to full equality of the LGBT community .
When we look at those numbers it ’s positive to see the direction in which support is moving .
There will always be political campaigns and the misinformation in some of those campaigns will give us setbacks , and that ’s what we experienced in California .
It ’s no surprise that the fear - based rhetoric surrounding the anti-marriage equality measures may have led some otherwise supportive people to vote with their hysteria instead of their heart in November .
But it ’s instructive to note that when the idea of domestic partnerships or civil unions were stripped from the question , overall , only 47 percent of those polled approved of same - sex marriage with 49 percent opposing it .
If gay and lesbian people must rely on the tender mercies of the majority to grant them marriage equality , there ’s still much work to do .
… And Shut the Door Behind You
One thing LGBT folks need to do is take the brave step of coming out .
Of those polled , 79 percent said knowing someone who is gay or lesbian has helped to change their opinions on basic rights for that community .
The opinions of religious leaders only mattered to 21 percent — meaning it ’s not going to be the religious leaders who help change people ’s minds , but the people in the pews , in the streets , and in the workplace who come out and lock the closet door behind them .
“ When people know someone who is gay or lesbian they are more likely to stand with us for policies and legal protections for the community , ” Guiliano said .
“ So , we must continue to have those conversations , continue to be visible , and lead open and authentic lives . ”
The poll covered many other areas , from the military ’s Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell policy to hate crimes and laws prohibiting discrimination in housing and employment .

The addresses of websites visited would be recorded A private company could be asked to run a huge database containing details of all telephone calls , emails and internet use , it has been reported .
The option to tender out the management of the database will be included in a consultation paper to be published next month , according to the Guardian .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said access to such data was key to fighting terrorism but with proper safeguards .
Critics have said the idea poses a serious threat to civil liberties .
Former director of public prosecutions Sir Ken Macdonald reiterated his opposition to the plan in light of the Guardian 's report , dismissing official claims that additional legal assurances would ensure the information is not misused .
He told the paper : " All history tells us that reassurances like these are worthless in the long run .
In the first security crisis the locks would loosen . "
The database , which critics claim would cost up to £ 12bn , is not intended to record the content of communications , but only the details of internet sites visited and what emails and telephone calls have been made , to whom and at what times .
I think doing nothing is not an option here if we are going to see our ability to deal with serious crime and terrorism actually eroded in the future
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith Currently the information has to be requested from communications companies and internet service providers , but it is not always readily available .
On the issue of private sector involvement in the database , government sources said the consultation had not begun and it was premature to speculate on what it would contain and what the outcome would be .
As for the database itself , the home secretary said the UK had to adapt to technological changes if it wanted to get access to data necessary to fighting terrorism and organised crime effectively .
" It is a difficult and sensitive area , which is why we will consult on a range of options , " Ms Smith said of the issue .
" But I think doing nothing is not an option here if we are going to see our ability to deal with serious crime and terrorism actually eroded in the future . "
Addressing Sir Ken 's criticisms , she said she was " sure " he would want the state to do all it could to stop terrorist attacks and to catch dangerous criminals .
" Of course there are concerns , " she added .
" It is why we will consult with people about what sort of safeguards will be put in place . "
Opposition Ministers had initially intended to legislate this year on proposals to create a communications database but dropped a planned bill from December 's Queen 's Speech in favour of a consultation exercise .
Opposition parties have vowed to fight the proposal , describing it as an onslaught on personal privacy .
David Davis , the former shadow home secretary , has said a future parliamentary battle over the issue would make this year 's debate over extending pre-charge detention to 42 days - an issue which led him to resign his seat - look like a " picnic " .
The Lib Dems also oppose the plans , describing the idea of the database as " Orwellian " .

Ruby 1.9.1 Release Candidate 1 Released
By Peter Cooper
Yuki Sonoda has just announced the release of Ruby 1.9.1 Release Candidate 1 on the ruby - talk mailing list :
This is a release candidate of Ruby 1.9.1 , which will be the first stable version of Ruby 1.9 series .
Try it early and have a experience of modern , faster , with clearer syntax , multilingualized and much improved Ruby world .
We have fixed 72 bugs and implemented some features .
If you encounter a bug or a problem , please let us know it via the official issue tracking system .
If you 're a Ruby developer , particularly if you have any libraries out in the field , getting up to speed with Ruby 1.9 is becoming a necessity .
There are still bugs to be squashed ( recently , for example , I found one in edge Rails on Ruby 1.9.1 beta - now fixed ) .
Some libraries do not compile with Ruby 1.9 at all yet .
Yet Ruby 1.9.1's performance and general stability are so encouraging that popular migration to Ruby 1.9 is certainly on the horizon .
When Ruby 1.9.1 finally drops and the Ruby 1.9 branch is considered production ready , we 'll be doing a big round up of Ruby 1.9 news , links , and resources , but till then you might find Dr Nic 's guide " Future proofing your Ruby code - Ruby 1.9.1 is coming " to be very useful .
Sam Ruby 's OSCON presentation on Ruby 1.9 should also prove illuminating if your expose to 1.9 has been minimal so far .
( Update : Ryan Grove has written How to compile and install Ruby 1.9.1 on Mac OS X Leopard - a handy guide to downloading and compiling Ruby 1.9.1 for yourself on OS X. )
Former drug officer Barry Cooper debuts ' KopBusters ' trailer Stephen C. Webster
Published : Tuesday December 30 , 2008

An anonymous tipster appeared to be harrying cops .
It sounded like the plot of the latest TV pseudo - thriller : a rogue cop , a woman scorned , a helpless father , a drug grower , a small town pastor and police that play fast and loose with the constitution , all colliding after an anonymous letter tipped off police to an alleged marijuana farm in a Texas town .
Barry Cooper , a 39 - year - old former drug cop turned filmmaker , said that short , poorly written and unattributed letter was the key that tied together motley crew of characters in his latest documentary .
A preview of that documentary , a reality show Cooper has dubbed " KopBusters , " is available exclusively from RAW STORY at the bottom of this page .
" I 'm leaving Odessa because my boyfriend is out of control , " an anonymous female allegedly wrote to the Odessa police on Dec. 3 .
" I ca n't talk to the police because I have traffic warrants . "
The mysterious tipster claimed 80 marijuana plants were nearing harvest at a small house in the west Texas town , and that officers only had a few days to nab the culprit .
" He does not know I 'm telling and thinks I do n't know about him cheating on me , " she continued .
" He has been growing pot for a long time and never get caught and he is getting sloppy . "
Based on the tip , police conducted surveillance on the house and determined several of the general statements about the property to be factual .
Within 12 hours , Judge Bill McCoy of the 258th District Court had signed a search warrant based upon the letter and the police department 's periphery follow - up , and the raid was on .
Little did the officers know , inside the house , the flora bathed beneath bright , heat - emitting grow lights was n't marijuana but , instead , miniature Christmas trees .
As officers invaded with guns drawn , it quickly became apparent they 'd been had .
A handwritten poster proclaimed they had just become part of Cooper 's new reality show , ' KopBusters . '
And bust the cops , he did .
According to the Odessa American , Terry Pierce , who also works as an associate police chaplain , denies giving the officers any letter .
However , on Monday the American reported that the local police made a mistake filling out the affidavit .
Instead of the police chaplain , First United Pentacostal Church pastor Terry Pugh delivered the letter .
Odessa City Manager Richard Morton insisted it was a simple mistake : the letter was allegedly given to officers with " Pastor Terry " written on an open envelope .
" Someone played on my sentiments , " Pugh told the American .
" Had I known that , I would have never been involved in it .
I thought I was helping the police catch bad guys . "
" It was n't just this erroneous affidavit , but also the judge granted a bad warrant based solely on an anonymous tip , " said Cooper .
" The Supreme Court has said an anonymous tip is not enough .
Maybe we should make a new show called ' JudgeBusters . ' "
Cooper originally planned his first sting for an undisclosed location in Washington state .
But after being contacted by Odessa resident Raymond Madden , whose daughter Yolanda was arrested in 2005 for possessing methamphetamine , ' KopBusters ' shifted course .
" The police got the wrong person , " claims Yolanda 's father on the ' KopBusters ' trailer .
" They thought she was someone else .
Once they made the bust , they had to go through with it .
You can't say , ' Oh , excuse me , we planted drugs . ' "
A man who answered the telephone at the Odessa police department declined comment .
The sting was designed , Cooper said , to embarrass the cops that arrested Yolonda , and to put a public face on police neglect of the Fourth Amendment .
Of course , it likely crossed Cooper 's mind that several of his former partners are cops in Odessa .
Or that his former narcotics task force was once based there .
But the way he describes it , revenge is not atop his list .
To Cooper , ' KopBusters ' is almost a humanitarian mission .
" Free Yolanda ! " he yells in the footage .
" Ya'll planted drugs on Yolanda , and we 're gonna get her released and get the crooked cops busted .
If you 're a good cop , great .
But you 're not .
You raided my house , and nothing 's going on . "
The American quoted Cooper saying he believes the police " [ got ] together to make up this f--- ing letter . "
Thermal imaging cameras , he claimed to RAW STORY , were used to seek out heat from the grow lamps inside his rented house : an investigatory technique the Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional , but is still frequently used , especially in aerial observation .
" What I 'm telling people is that anyone could have sent that letter , " he said .
" Anyone who gets pissed off at someone else could have dropped a letter in the offering basket at church , or sent an anonymous tip to police .
That 's the point of the court 's logic : to prevent people from triggering false raids . "
RAW STORY pressed him on the letter 's origin , but Cooper stuck to his story .
" No , really , that 's all I 'm saying about the letter , " he insisted .
" Anybody could have written it .
It does n't matter who it came from .
An anonymous tip is not enough to raid a home . "
And while Cooper may be the most obvious suspected source of the letter , there 's no evidence thus far to tie him to it ; a good thing for him , because a false crime report is itself a crime .
Naturally , the Odessa police department is looking into pressing charges .
Likewise , Cooper said he plans to file a $ 10 million federal lawsuit .
Both remain to be seen .
Another sting , he boasted , is coming very soon .
" I could do it as quickly as 30 days . "
Cooper is asking the public to submit tips about dirty ' kops ' to [ email protected ] .
' KopBusters : Vol. 1 ' is set for release in July .

不知道有沒有人統計過，每天新誕生的blog有多少？而你寫blog的目的又是什麼呢？
拜網路發達所賜，不管是採用網路上BSP所提供的環境，或者是利用Wordpress這種開放性程式所架設的個人網站以及blog越來越多，在內地申請一個.cn的域名只要RMB
1塊錢，而申請一個空間一年也要不到幾百塊錢，也因此網路上面每天都有無數的新網站誕生...
最早期的時候，大家比較習慣在一些知名的BSP上面落腳，比如說：無名小站、博客中國等網站，而當時大部分的人僅僅只是寫寫當時的心情日記，或者是把一些自己的遊記、食記等等寫出來，並且貼上一些照片，然後請身邊的朋友來看看，如此而已，並沒有想要透過一些方法吸引更多的人來看，而就算有，其實當時的方法也很有限，因此經常會發現每天當日人數是零...
而隨著網路科技的發展以及時間的累積，網路上面出現了許多的blog名人，他們或者像電視明星一樣出現在一些談話性的電視節目當中，也或者成為了一些大型知名網站所網羅的人才，同時有更多串聯blog以及blog的流量與排名工具或網站，甚至是協助管理網站的服務因應而生...
不過當這些免費提供流量監控、網站排名以及網站價值的服務，甚至是越來越多讓blogger可以把文章的簡介與網址連接貼出來的書籤網站越來越多的同時，整個blog似乎有越來越娛樂、綜藝化的趨勢產生，或許很多blogger在追求用戶閱讀量的同時有了一些些的迷失，一方面希望有更多的人來閱讀，所以開始摸索用戶喜歡看的題材，另一方面則是商業化的現象出現，變成了一些產品或者活動的宣傳代言工具...
或許這也跟整個網路環境生態的發展有關係，首先即使是一些知名的網站，想要吸引網民的眼球，同時讓每個上線的用戶都可以創造出高的pageview，不外乎美女照片、旅遊照片甚至是談論政治問題或者是名人的隱私等等，此外因為大多數的網路重度用戶幾乎都是IT業界的從業人員，因此科技方面的話題也是眾所矚目的焦點之一...
尚且，也因為網路時代的來臨，因此很多廠商都開始嘗試所謂的blog行銷，透過建立blog宣傳產品與服務，並到許多人的blog去留言，除了宣傳又可以發揮SEO的效果，而看在「錢」的份上，不少人也因而淪陷了...
其實這也無可厚非，畢竟這麼多人願意把他的經歷，不管是旅遊的、美食的、科技面的、投資面的或者是關於職場上面的，也不管這些人是名人或者是平民百姓，他們之所以能夠擁有自己的粉絲，也絕對有其過人之處，因為在網路上更能顯露出個人魅力...
不過，當你訂閱了這些blog的RSS之後，你想要看的是這個blogger專業的一面呢？還是好奇的想窺探他生活瑣瑣碎碎的一面呢？亦或是看他推薦一些產品或者是服務給你呢？或許對於讀者來說，也有許多的複雜情緒在內...
應該說不管是寫的人或者是看的人，都面對著一種壓力，寫的人擔心沒人看，擔心砸了招牌，更擔心自己成為了看後即棄的消費品，而看的人，面對了如此多的網站，更是一種壓迫感，沒有選擇過於一言堂，但是過多的選擇卻無從下手，甚至失去判斷的能力...
綜藝化、娛樂化確實是一個有趣的現象，不過倒是有一些前輩們能一本初衷的經營著他們自己的網站，他們或許不常出現在大眾的面前，然而這種blogger的精神很令人敬佩...
The following two tabs change content below .
French businesses already fear informal boycotts of French goods , even if there is no further formal retaliation by the government .
Similar boycotts after attacks on the Beijing Olympic Torch in France by pro-Tibet demonstrators in April , though , had limited effect .
Obama met with the nation ’s governors to hear tales of economic pain – and won points by telling GOP - ers in the room that he welcomed disagreements .
Gov. at first sight
No one could remember a meeting quite like this .
President - elect Barack Obama met with the nation ’s governors Tuesday to hear their tales of economic pain – and won some points by telling Republicans in the room that he welcomed disagreements , “ so feel free , ” one participant recalled .
Advertisement
“ He said , ' I do n't know you as well , let me get to know you , give me a chance , you might be surprised how helpful I can be , ’ ” said New York Gov. David Paterson , a Democrat who recounted Obama ’s words to the Republicans .
“ He said , ‘ I ’m a good listener , and I ’m a better listener when people disagree with me , ’ ” added West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin , the outgoing head of the Democratic Governor ’s Association .
The gesture went over well with the GOP executives , many of whom were getting their first chance to take the measure of the new president up - close , including two who may challenge him for the White House in four years .
Obama used the hour - plus session today to discuss the upcoming stimulus package , and he pledged to partner with the chief executives as they grapple with budget deficits wrought by the economic downturn .
The meeting was not without political overtones .
Some GOP officials grumbled privately that Obama met first with the Democratic governors Monday night .
Two Republican governors also told Obama he risks exploding the national debt with a massive stimulus package .
But for the most part , the governors , meeting at historic Congress Hall in Philadelphia for the annual meeting of the National Governor ’s Association , were taken with Obama ’s openness , policy depth and just that he showed up to engage in a real back and forth , a move none could recall on the part of a newly elected president .
" For me , it was the Barack Obama I knew , but for a lot of the other people in the room , it was a president being unprecedented , " Paterson said .
“ It was a very productive meeting , ” recounted Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman .
“ Kind of like the days they used to meet in this grand old building , ” he said , alluding to the home of Congress when Philadelphia served as the nation ’s capital at the end of the 18th Century .
“ It was very much a working session , with brainstorming – which is so rare in the upper echelons of politics these day which are so staged and scripted . ”
Huntsman said Obama introduced his senior staff in the room – including top aides Rahm Emanuel and Valerie Jarrett — “ one - by - one ” and assured the governors that they ’d have a direct line to each .
And after Huntsman took the floor to recommend that the regional governor ’s associations be used to collect real - time data on the holdups in infrastructure projects and communicate that to the administration , he said Obama brought it back up to him as he walked out .
“ One of his greatest attributes is that he ’s a keen listener , ” said Huntsman .
“ The tone of the meeting was constructive and positive , ” said Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , noting that he was especially heartened by Obama ’s message at the end of the session .
“ ’ This is n’t goodbye , it ’s hello , ’ ” Obama said , as recalled by Pawlenty .
For Democratic governors , it was a welcome relief after years of meeting with a Republican president they found to be unfamiliar with details .
“ The contrast with our meeting with the sitting president was fairly stark , ” said Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen , recalling a “ much more controlled ” environment with President George W. Bush .
Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer , the incoming head of the DGA , was more blunt : “ Just to have an administration , a president , a vice president , who listened , engaged , and came to meeting prepared — it ’s a brand - new idea . ”
The good vibrations aside , there were some difficult facts staring both the governors and the incoming president in the face .
Twenty - five states have already identified shortfalls of $ 60 billion for the next fiscal year , according to the NGA .
While few governors pleaded with Obama for federal aid in covering those deficits , many did emphasize the urgency of their needs , especially with regard to infrastructure and health care .
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger spoke on the first score and was followed by pleas for an injection of federal dollars for aging roads and bridges by other big - state governors from Pennsylvania , New Jersey and Ohio .
Kansas Gov. Kathleen
Sebelius discussed the mounting social services needs prompted by the recession , and was followed by several other governors who raised the issue of Medicaid funding — a perennial federal - state dilemma .
Obama impressed the governors with his ability to get into the policy weeds on the thorny question , demonstrating a detailed knowledge of FMAPs , the state - by - state formula which determines how much money the federal government sends to help cover Medicaid costs .
Bredesen said the president - elect expressed a willingness to help states ease their budget crunch by having the feds cover the additional individuals who are coming onto the Medicaid rolls because of the economic dip .
There were some substantive disagreements .
South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford and Texas Gov. Rick Perry — respectively the incoming and outgoing chairs of the RGA — expressed concerns at today ’s session about the stimulus package , noting it would add to the government ’s mounting debt load .
“ What we risk is trashing the dollar , ” said Sanford later in an interview .
“ We undermine all this quote stimulus coming out of Washington D.C. if we crank inflation and sink purchasing - power . ”
On behalf of the Republican governors , Sanford gave Obama a letter reiterating his views about spending as well as taxes , trade and legislation that would make it easier to unionize .
While offering these “ earnest concerns , ” as the letter put them , it was largely a warm note , full of expressions of consensus and comity .
And Sanford had mostly praise for Obama ’s response to the question he raised in the meeting .
“ He was measured .
He was thoughtful .
He acknowledged the debt was clearly a problem and that he would have to do something about it . ”
But Sanford recounted that Obama said he was , in the short - term , focused on getting the economy moving .
He ’ll do so on a good footing with the nation ’s governors , a group never shy about complaining about Washington .
“ He starts off with a real reservoir of goodwill , ” said Bredesen .

It has proved one of the most endearing of cinematic legends - a loveable car with a mind of its own that can drive itself .
And for 40 years Herbie - or the ' Love Bug ' - as the Volkswagen Beetle was dubbed in its first movie outing - has enthralled millions of families in a series of Hollywood sequels .
Watch video footage of the self drive car here
But now German car giant Volkswagen has turned fiction into reality by unveiling a fully automatic car which really can drive itself - and at speeds of up to 150 mph .
It can weave with tyres screeching around tricky bends and chicanes , and through tightly coned off tracks - without any help or intervention from a human .
The remarkable car is the VW Golf GTi ' 53 plus 1 ' codenamed after the number ' 53 ' which Herbie carried when racing in his big screen adventures .
The GTi has electronic ' eyes ' that use radar and laser sensors in the grille to ' read ' the road and send the details back to its computer brain .
A sat -nav system tracks its exact position with pin-point precision to within an inch .
The car can then work out the twists and turns it has to negotiate - before setting off at break - neck speed through a laid out course on a test track .
On a race circuit , it drove itself faster and more precisely than the VW engineers could manage - and can accelerate independently up to its top speed of 150 mph .
To prove it is no trick , guests were invited to design for themselves a variety of different courses - using road cones - and then watch the car fly around them on its own at a test track near their world headquarters in Wolfsburg in northern Germany .
Prototype
The astonishing prototype was developed initially to help Volkswagen engineers test their vehicles .
But in an age when rapidly advancing technology and the Big Brother State is increasingly taking responsibility away from the driver - with the onward march of electronic speed limiters , collision avoidance systems , cruise control , satellite navigation , and pay - as - you - drive road tolling - the self - driving robot car is not such a distant prospect .
And many of the elements which make up its engine will be making their way into showroom cars within just a few years - just as sat-nav , collision avoidance sensors and anti-lock brakes have done in recent years .
A Volkswagen spokesman said : ' It really is a self - driving Golf .
It steers , brakes and accelerates .
And it races through handling courses independently .
It can accomplish this at full performance and at the limits of its capabilities . '
' We called it ' 53 ' because it is reminiscent of the cinematic Volkswagen bug Herbie , which made history as the first self - driving Volkswagen .
This time we 've done it for real . '
' The computer calculates where and at what speed the GTi has clearance between the cones .
The GPS satellite enables navigation to within less than an inch . '
