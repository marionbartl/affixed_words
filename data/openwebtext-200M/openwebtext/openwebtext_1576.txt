Glendale police said a woman invented a kidnapping hoax to avoid telling her parents that she had been lying to them about college .
Sgt. Tom Lorenz told The Times that Nancy Salas fled her family 's home Wednesday morning because she wanted to escape the embarrassment of revealing to her family and friends that she was not going to graduate from UCLA as she had told them for more than a year .
The young woman 's friends and family were under the impression that she would be graduating from the school with a degree in sociology next month , and had planned a party .
Salas , who UCLA officials said was enrolled until 2008 , employed an elaborate ruse , police said .
On her blog , she wrote about the stress of homework and finals .
To her friends , she spoke of applying for graduate school .
A woman whose children Salas used to babysit , Sheri Jennings , said the young woman sometimes asked to come to work late so that she could attend office hours with a professor .
Her parents , immigrants from El Salvador , used to wear UCLA T - shirts and kept a UCLA chair in their living room .
She went missing Wednesday and was found Thursday in Merced , claiming she had been kidnapped .
On Thursday night , after Salas was flown back to Glendale , she admitted that she had been lying about her life -- and about the kidnapping .
“ Up until she was going to face her family , she was sticking to her story , ” Lorenz said .
He said she confessed around 8:30 p.m. , telling investigators that she made up the story about being kidnapped because she was “ idolized ” by her family , friends and church for being a successful student .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Iran may be able to build a missile capable of striking the United States by 2015 , according to an unclassified Defense Department report on Iran ’s military sent to Congress and released on Monday .
“ With sufficient foreign assistance , Iran could probably develop and test an intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) capable of reaching the United States by 2015 , ” said the April report , a copy of which was obtained by Reuters .
A classified version was also submitted to Congress .
The timing of advances in Iran ’s long - range missile technology is being closely watched in Washington , which accuses Tehran of pursuing nuclear weapons and is pushing for a new round of sanctions .
Iran denies the charges and says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
“ Iran ’s nuclear program and its willingness to keep open the possibility of developing nuclear weapons is a central part of its deterrent strategy , ” the report said .
The U.S. military tried and failed to shoot down a simulated Iranian missile strike on the United States in January , in a botched $ 150 million exercise over the Pacific Ocean .
That attempt failed because of a malfunction in a radar built by Raytheon Co .
It was not immediately clear whether the latest estimate on Iran ’s missile technology was a departure from a May 2009 National Intelligence Estimate , which deemed Tehran unlikely to have a long - range missile until between 2015 and 2020 , according to U.S. officials who saw the report at the time .
The 2009 estimate was revised from an earlier range of between 2012 to 2015 .
Representative Ike Skelton , chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee , called the report a “ comprehensive view of the military situation in Iran . ”
LEBANON RE-ARMED , TALIBAN SUPPORT
The report also included an assessment of Iran ’s broader military capabilities and support for insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as groups like Hamas in the Palestinian territories and Hezbollah in Lebanon .
With Iranian support , Hezbollah has replenished its arsenal beyond levels it had in the 2006 war with Israel , the report said , without offering specifics .
“ Iran , through its long - standing relationship with Lebanese ( Hezbollah ) , maintains a capability to strike Israel directly and threatens Israeli and U.S. interests worldwide , ” it said .
The report cited recently uncovered caches of weapons that Iran ’s Qods Force gave to Afghan militants .
They contained “ large amounts of Iranian - manufactured weapons , ” including 107 mm rockets .
It estimated the size of Iran ’s “ Ground Force ” at 220,000 personnel and the Revolutionary Guard Corps ’s “ Ground Resistance Forces ” at 130,000 personnel .
It said Iran had between 1,800 and 1,900 tanks .
President Barack Obama ’s national security advisers are considering a broad range of options to curb Iran ’s nuclear program , among them military strikes , if diplomacy and sanctions fail .
Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the U.S. military ’s Joint Chiefs of Staff , said on Sunday the military options available to Obama would go “ a long way ” to delaying Iran ’s nuclear progress but may not set the country back long - term .
He called a military strike his “ last option ” right now and has repeatedly warned of potential , unintended consequences of any action against Iran .
The Obama administration has a plan to expand online innovation and boost national public safety .
And it wants to do it with more taxes and higher fees .
The massive national broadband plan the Federal Communications Commission released last month proposes creating a national framework for the taxation of digital goods and services and imposing a fee to establish and maintain a national public safety wireless broadband network .
The FCC says the national tax would eliminate the headaches that come with varying state and local taxes on digital goods and services .
And the public safety network would help avoid the communication failures among first responders to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita .
But the proposals are already drawing fierce criticism .
" Americans already suffering from a recession prolonged by Mr. Obama 's policies are being asked to concur that raising – yes , raising – taxes on a nationwide basis will somehow ' reduce uncertainty and remove one barrier to online entrepreneurship and investment , ' " Timothy Lee , vice president of legal and public affairs for the Center for Individual Freedom , wrote in an opinion article published in the Washington Times .
More On This ... Health Bill Extends Wage Tax to Investments
Lee said the FCC 's agenda echoes Ronald Reagan 's portrayal of government logic : " If it moves , tax it .
If it keeps moving , regulate it .
If it stops moving , subsidize it . "
But Lee 's description is " just not correct , " FCC spokesman Mark Wigfield says .
" It 's not adding taxes , " he told FoxNews.com .
" It 's just saying if there are going to be these taxes , let 's do this in a way that is consistent . "
Lee countered that , like the new health care law , the proposal gives federal agencies a " wide latitude to interpret , construct and enforce . "
And this proposal , he said , prevents consumers from making digital purchases in states with lower or no taxes .
" I think it opens the door for a nationwide tax , " he told FoxNews.com , adding that the tax is " Orwellian . "
Congress will ultimately be the judge of that .
The House Subcommittee on Communications , Technology and the Internet held a hearing on the plan last month , and its counterpart in the Senate will hold a hearing later this month .
Among the proposals lawmakers are exploring is the creation of a public safety network that would cost between $ 12 billion to $ 16 billion .
The FCC told FoxNews.com that the network would be built over 10 years if Congress approved the proposal this year .
But the fees would be generated within the next few years .
Brian Osborne , of Geek.com , said the network will be just too expensive .
" We simply can't afford to do it all , " he wrote on Geek.com .
" We can't continue to come up with these dream projects when the country is already drowning in debt .
I might also add the simple fix is not another tax . "
FCC spokesman Robert Kenny told FoxNews.com that the actual fee would be less than a dollar per month for broadband consumers .
" This is a critical and essential public safety need , " Kenny said .
" And we 're confident that people will realize the benefits that the whole nation will gain with the creation of this network for public safety . "
The FCC 's national broadband plan suffered a setback Tuesday when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the agency lacks the authority to require broadband providers to give equal treatment to all Internet traffic flowing over their networks .
The FCC needs clear authority to regulate broadband in order to push ahead with some of its key recommendations , including a proposal to expand broadband by tapping the federal fund that subsidizes telephone services in poor and rural communities .
The FCC struck a defiant tone in its response to the ruling .
" Today 's court decision invalidated the prior Commission 's approach to preserving an open Internet , " FCC spokeswoman Jen Howard said in a written statement .
" But the Court in no way disagreed with the importance of preserving a free and open Internet ; nor did it close the door to other methods for achieving this important end . "
Last month it became apparent that several Hollywood movie studios had threatened to take legal action against the owner of ISP CyberBunker , the current bandwidth provider for The Pirate Bay .
Now , according to fresh information from a reliable source , the studios have come good on their threats .
Last month TorrentFreak exclusively revealed that Disney Enterprises and Paramount Pictures in association with Sony Pictures , Twentieth Century Fox , Universal Studios and Warner Bros. ( collectively as the MPA ) had begun threatening CyberBunker owner CB3ROB Ltd with legal action over their hosting of The Pirate Bay .
The MPA stated that since CB3ROB knows that The Pirate Bay is “ an infringing site ” , then the company had to take responsibility for bringing those infringements to an end – in other words , stop providing the site with hosting and bandwidth .
Failure to comply would result in the MPA taking legal action against CB3ROB in Germany .
After receiving new information from a previously reliable source , we can now confirm that the MPA have made good on their threats .
It appears that Columbia Pictures , Disney Enterprises , Paramount Pictures , Twentieth Century Fox , Universal , and Warner Bros. have obtained a preliminary injunction against CB3ROB Ltd from the Regional Court of Hamburg .
The injunction , which was granted without an oral hearing , states that the CB3ROB company ( and its Managing Director Mr. Sven Olaf Kamphuis personally ) are hereby prohibited from connecting The Pirate Bay website and associated servers to the Internet .
The injunction relates specifically to The Pirate Bay offering torrents which allow users to download the following movies – The Bounty Hunter , Alice in Wonderland , Our Family Wedding , Green Zone , Repo Men and Cop Out .
The Court agreed that CB3ROB and Sven Olaf Kamphuis are liable for infringements on the above movies pursuant to the “ Störerhaftung ” principle .
Also known as “ disturber ” or “ interferer ” liability , it means that someone who is knowingly connected to infringements can become the subject of an injunction , without actually carrying out those infringements themselves .
From the information currently available , in order to satisfy the Court it appears that CyberBunker have to either disconnect The Pirate Bay from the Internet , or the operators of the site have to do something that has never happened in the site ’s history – remove the torrents listed in the injunction on copyright grounds .
The penalties for failing to comply appear to be very severe indeed .
The Court can fix a fine of up to 250,000 euros for each recorded case of infringement on the above movies .
In the event that the fine cannot be enforced , it appears that Sven Olaf Kamphuis is being threatened with up to 2 years in jail .
“ We have no information about this , ” CB3ROB told TorrentFreak .
“ No letters have reached us or our attorneys . ”

How Obama ’s Nuclear Weapons Strategy Will Save the World
In the last week , 47 nations were brought together by the President to discuss the issue of international nuclear weapons in a Obama ’s Nuclear Security Summit .
After the historic Nuclear Arms Reduction Treaty signed the previous week between the United States and Russia , the seemingly logical next step was to get as many nations together as possible to be on the same page .
The threat of nuclear weapons getting into the wrong hands like al Qaeda or rogue nations like North Korea or Iran , who are currently developing nuclear weapons , should be of grave concern to the entire world .
Advertisements
Here are two excerpts from Obama ’s historic International Nuclear Summit :
“ Today , we are declaring that nuclear terrorism is one of the most challenging threats to international security .
We also agreed that the most effective way to prevent terrorists and criminals from acquiring nuclear materials is through strong nuclear security — protecting nuclear materials and preventing nuclear smuggling . ”
“ It is a vital national security interest of the United States to reduce these conflicts because whether we like it or not , we remain a dominant military superpower , and when conflicts break out , one way or another we get pulled into them , ” Obama said .
Bringing nations together to establish more security for nuclear materials to prevent illegal trafficking and proliferation was a major intent in the President ’s summit .
The diplomatic approach has been extended to Iran , but continues to be a rogue nation .
As a result of the President ’s Nuclear Security Summit , here are examples of the following nations who have made commitments in this process .
Canada reduced a significant amount of highly enriched uranium .
Chili has given up it ’s entire stockpile of uranium .
Mexico and Ukraine have pledged to follow suit .
Pakistan and Argentina committed to new approaches to strengthen the security at their ports .
The goal is to prevent smuggling and illegal trafficking of nuclear materials .
Nations such as Thailand , Argentina , and Vietnam have agreed to join these international partnerships and treaties to make this strategy stronger and more unified .
China , Japan , India and others have made commitments to formulate Nuclear Security Centers for the technological training , and security of these materials .
The reduction of weapons grade plutonium by both Russia and the US will now be used for energy in their respective countries .
In a partnership , both Canada and the US have committed funds to establish nuclear security around the world .
Secretary Gates says the US is prepared to respond to nuclear ambitions from Iran .
Iran ’s foreign minister wants to discuss a security nuclear fuel deal withe UN .
This is significant progress and actual real commitments from the international community .
President Obama took this responsibility on as the primary and most powerful leader of the free world and this does more to improve our standing on the world stage as well as our efforts for a peaceful co-existence .
These are all steps in a greater strategy for world peace and security led by President Barack Obama and our ever expanding allies .
This is a dangerous world and I ’m sure the President has a lot more intelligence on these matters than most .
Common sense would tell you a lot of it ca n’t be discussed or revealed to the media outlets to prevent anxiety and for our own protection and so the intelligence does n’t get into the wrong hands .
I just wish the main stream media would dedicate more time to bringing more research , facts and a better understanding of what is actually taking place and how all the pieces are connected to the future of the world instead of giving us 24 hour sound bites on Sarah Palin ’s lack of knowledge on nuclear weapons .
Remember united we stand ; divided we fall .
As a country , the Democrats and the very deceptive GOP should also remember that phrase .
Obama ’s START treaty will save the world from the escalating nuclear weapons race , something every reasonable President has seen as a vital goal of their administration because it is the only way to truly bring security to the world .

PEP 376 has just been accepted .
This is a very important step in the packaging work we have been doing during the last year .
This PEP introduces a database of installed distributions , and therefore a standard that allows interoperability among all tools .
To summarize , a distribution that gets installed will have to create a . dist - info directory in Python , containing these files :
METADATA : contains the project metadata , as described in PEP 345 , PEP 314 and PEP 241 .
: contains the project metadata , as described in PEP 345 , PEP 314 and PEP 241 .
RECORD : records the list of installed files
: records the list of installed files INSTALLER : records the name of the tool used to install the project
: records the name of the tool used to install the project REQUESTED : the presence of this file indicates that the project installation was explicitly requested ( i.e. , not installed as a dependency ) .
Python will provide in the pkgutil module , a set of APIs that can be used to query installed projects .
This ressembles a lot to what the Setuptools project currently provides with its pkg_resources module .
An interesting side - effect of the RECORD file is that package managers will be able to uininstall projects .
As a matter of fact Distutils2 will provide a basic uninstall feature on the top of the pkgutil APIs , and I hope tools like Pip ( that already provide this feature ) will adopt the new standard .
This small PEP is the basis to a new PEP that is coming next , which will define a standard to describe and consume resource files in Python projects .
The ultimate goal will be to be able to get rid of setup.py and describe everything in static configuration files in your project .
But this is another story 😉
Thanks to all people involved in this PEP , and in particular , thanks to Philip J. Eby for his help ( PEP 376 is massively based on what he has created in Setuptools . )

The UK’s Sun and Daily Mail fooled by iPhone Ghost app Posted by Dr. Macenstein on Wednesday , March 3 , 2010 · Leave a Comment
We ’re not exactly ones to check our sources , but then again , we ’re a web page , and if it turns out we write something stupid , we can always hit “ delete ” and hope everyone forgets about it .
( Yes , I know , Google never forgets ) .
But unfortunately for UK papers the Sun and Daily Mail , their idiocy will live on in print for years .
Case in point :
Check out the following stories both papers ran when John Ware , a 47 - year old builder , sent in a pic he allegedly snapped of a 19th century ghost boy while his company tore down an old school house .
The Sun
The Daily Mail
Very Spooky , to be sure .
Yet , as you can see , that mysterious ghost boy is ALSO haunting the 99 ¢ iPhone app “ Ghost Capture “ , which allows you to place a variety of ghosts on top of any photo you ’d like .

Alexander Avtsin leaves KHL , joins Canadiens ( Photo © Getty Images )
Alexander Avtsin is going to join the Montreal Canadiens of the NHL this summer , as reported by sportbox.ru
The 19 years old wing spent the latest season with the Dynamo Moscow of the KHL , scoring nine points in 30 regular season games , before picking up a wrist injury that shut down his season in late January .
Most likely Avtsin will start the 2010 - 11 campaign with the Canadiens ’ AHL affiliates , the Hamilton Bulldogs .
The jQuery special events API is a fairly flexible system by which you can specify bind and unbind hooks as well as default actions for custom events .
In using this API , you can create custom events that do more than just execute bound event handlers when triggered — these “ special ” events can modify the event object passed to event handlers , trigger other entirely different events , or execute complex setup and teardown code when event handlers are bound to or unbound from elements .
Note that this article uses some advanced jQuery techniques and assumes you understand the concepts of custom events and event delegation using bubbling .
Also , because this article is rather long , it has been broken up into sections .
I ’d recommend reading it in order , one section at a time , because techniques used in subsequent examples often reference those used in previous examples .
Also , your brain is going to need a rest here and there , so take it slow .
That being said , I do hope that you stick with it , because there is a lot of useful information here .
Special events - related plugins I ’ve created that are referenced in this article :
Updates :
1 . Then and now
Back in the dark ages of jQuery development , if you wanted an arbitrary callback to be executed whenever a certain condition was met , you ’d just create a “ When Condition Met ” plugin , which would be used like $.whenConditionMet ( callback ) .
Inside the $ .whenCondition
Met method , magic would happen such that the callback was executed at the appropriate time , and that ’s that .
Of course , if you wanted to be able to de-register a callback , you ’d need to figure out how you wanted to handle that .. maybe $.whenConditionMet ( callback , false ) or perhaps a $ .noLongerCareAboutCondition method , or maybe even a polite note in the documentation suggesting the end - user “ refresh the page . ”
This was adequate for simple use - cases , but because a well thought - out , flexible API did n’t exist , more complicated scenarios could get really messy .
What if , instead of creating a $ .whenCondition
Met method , you could just create a custom “ conditionmet ” event that callbacks could be bound to ?
What if those callbacks could be bound , triggered or unbound , with or without namespaces ?
What if that custom event bubbled up the DOM tree , could have its propagation stopped and could even have a default action as well ?
What if this custom event , powered by advanced JavaScript magic hitherto undreamed of behaved exactly like every other jQuery event ?
You ’ve probably got the idea by now , so without further ado , let ’s get into the details .
2 . The special events API
A special event can be defined using the following five methods .
Each method is optional , and only needs to be specified if necessary .
The namespace for the special event is jQuery.event.special .myevent where myevent is the name of your event .
Also note that while you can have any number of other methods and properties attached to this namespace , all but these five will be ignored :
jQuery.event.special.myevent = { setup : function ( data , namespaces , eventHandle ) { // code } , teardown : function ( namespaces ) { // code } , add : function ( handle Obj ) { // code } , remove : function ( handle Obj ) { // code } , _default : function ( event ) { // code } } ;
2.1 . Methods
setup
Do something when the first event handler is bound to a particular element .
More explicitly : do something when an event handler is bound to a particular element , but only if there are not currently any event handlers bound .
This may occur in two scenarios : 1 ) either the very first time that event is bound to that element , or 2 ) the next time that event is bound to that element , after all previous handlers for that event have been unbound from that element .
Method arguments :
data - ( Anything ) Whatever eventData ( optional ) was passed in when binding the event .
- ( Anything )
Whatever ( optional ) was passed in when binding the event .
namespaces - ( Array )
An array of namespaces specified when binding the event .
- ( Array )
An array of namespaces specified when binding the event .
eventHandle - ( Function )
The actual function that will be bound to the browser ’s native event ( this is used internally for the beforeunload event , you ’ll never use it ) .
Notes :
Supported in jQuery 1.3.2 or newer .
Returning false tells jQuery to bind the specified event handler using native DOM methods .
tells jQuery to bind the specified event handler using native DOM methods .
this is the element to which the event handler is being bound .
is the element to which the event handler is being bound .
This method , when executed , will always execute immediately before the corresponding add method executes .
teardown
Do something when the last event handler is unbound from a particular element .
Method arguments :
namespaces - ( Array )
An array of namespaces specified when unbinding the event .
Notes :
Supported in jQuery 1.3.2 or newer .
Returning false tells jQuery to unbind the specified event handler using native DOM methods .
tells jQuery to unbind the specified event handler using native DOM methods .
this is the element from which the event handler is being unbound .
is the element from which the event handler is being unbound .
This method , when executed , will always execute immediately after the corresponding remove method executes .
add
Do something each time an event handler is bound to a particular element .
Method arguments :
handleObj - ( Object )
An object containing these properties ( same as the remove method ) : type - ( String )
The name of the event .
data - ( Anything )
Whatever data object ( optional ) was passed in when binding the event .
namespace - ( String )
A sorted , dot - delimited list of namespaces specified when binding the event .
handler - ( Function )
The event handler being bound to the event .
This function will be called whenever the event is triggered .
guid - ( Number ) A unique ID for this event handler .
This is used internally for managing handlers .
selector - ( String )
The selector used by the delegate or live jQuery methods .
Only available when binding event handlers using these two methods .
- ( Object )
An object containing these properties ( same as the method ) :
Notes :
Supported in jQuery 1.4.2 or newer .
this is the element to which the event handler is being bound .
is the element to which the event handler is being bound .
This method , when executed , will always execute immediately after the corresponding setup method executes .
remove
Do something each time an event handler is unbound from a particular element .
Method arguments :
handleObj - ( Object )
An object containing these properties ( same as the add method ) : type - ( String )
The name of the event .
data - ( Anything )
Whatever data object ( optional ) was passed in when binding the event .
namespace - ( String )
A sorted , dot - delimited list of namespaces specified when binding the event .
handler - ( Function )
The event handler being bound to the event .
This function will be called whenever the event is triggered .
guid - ( Number ) A unique ID for this event handler .
This is used internally for managing handlers .
selector - ( String )
The selector used by the undelegate or die jQuery methods .
Only available when unbinding event handlers using these two methods .
- ( Object )
An object containing these properties ( same as the method ) :
Notes :
Supported in jQuery 1.4.2 or newer .
this is the element from which the event handler is being unbound .
is the element from which the event handler is being unbound .
This method , when executed , will always execute immediately before the corresponding teardown method executes .
_default
The default action for the event .
This callback will be triggered unless event.preventDefault( ) is called .
Method arguments :
event - ( Object )
The jQuery event object .
Notes :
Supported in jQuery 1.4.2 or newer .
Because _default executes after the event has bubbled all the way up the DOM tree , this will always reference document , which is not particularly useful .
You ’ll probably want to use event .
target instead .
executes after the event has bubbled all the way up the DOM tree , will always reference , which is not particularly useful .
You ’ll probably want to use instead .
Because this method only executes for custom events triggered explicitly with the trigger method , it is n’t particularly useful for native browser events such as “ click ” or “ submit ” .
2.2 . jQuery version compatibility
The special events API has been evolving since jQuery 1.2.2 , when the setup and teardown methods were first added .
Initially , those methods accepted no arguments , but in jQuery 1.3 , the data and namespaces arguments were added , and in jQuery 1.4 , the eventHandle argument was added .
Also in jQuery 1.4 ,
The add and remove methods were added , but their signatures changed in jQuery 1.4.2 along with the addition of a _default method .
As such , due to a few special event - related issues in jQuery 1.4 and 1.4.1 , I strongly advise against using those jQuery versions , and recommend using jQuery 1.4.2 ( or newer , when available ) .
If you ’re stuck using jQuery 1.3.2 , everything pertaining to the setup and teardown methods still applies , so be sure to read on !
3 . A jQuery special event pattern , AKA code organization
While additional properties and methods can be added into the jQuery.event.special .myevent namespace , this approach should be avoided .
By using a closure , the code is easy to read , minifies smaller , allows internal methods and properties ( like some_var and init ) to be private , and allows you to use the much more terse ( and pretty ) $ instead of jQuery without fear of conflict .
Note that I did n’t include the remove or _default methods in this pattern example .
You should only include the methods you actually use , so if you just need a setup method , just include that method and none of the others .
If your event is called “ super- awesome ” , specify it like $.event.special [' super-awesome ' ] = {...} ; etc .
Above all else , use your best judgement , and try to write code that is readable and maintainable .
( All of the code examples in this article as well as all my jQuery special events plugins are based on this pattern , so feel free to examine their code : resize event , hashchange event , outside events and BBQ , with more on the way ! )
The code
( function ( $ ) { //
A private property .
var some_var ; // A public property .
$.myeventOptions = {} ; // Special event definition .
$.event.special .myevent = { setup : function ( data , namespaces ) { //
Event code. init ( this , true ) ; } , teardown : function ( namespaces ) { //
Event code. init ( this , false ) ; } , add : function ( handle Obj ) { //
Event code . //
Save a reference to the bound event handler .
var old_handler = handleObj.handler ; handleObj.handler = function ( event ) { //
Modify event object here ! //
Call the originally - bound event handler and return its result .
return old_handler.apply ( this , arguments ) ; } ; } } ; // A private method .
function init ( elem , state ) { //
Do something to `elem` based on `state` } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
3.1 . Supporting jQuery 1.4 , 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 +
If your code does n’t need to work with the jQuery 1.4 or 1.4.1 releases , you can ignore this section , and use the pattern above .
If , however , you created a special event plugin “ way back ” when jQuery 1.4 or 1.4.1 was released , you may have noticed that your code no longer works , due to a necessary signature change in the jQuery 1.4.2 add and remove methods .
While it ’s best to to upgrade your older copy of jQuery to the latest version , if you ’re unable to do that , use this add method ( instead of the simpler , 1.4.2 + compatible , add method in the pattern above ) , and everything will work again .
( Note that I have n’t documented the additional 1.4 / 1.4.1 add method parameters here , but if you were using them , you should be able to figure how they map to properties of the handle Obj argument .
See the add method documentation if necessary )
The code
( function ( $ ) { // Special event definition .
$.event.special.myevent = { add : function ( handle Obj ) { //
Event code . //
This will reference the bound event handler .
var old_handler ; function new_handler ( event ) { //
Modify event object here ! //
Call the originally - bound event handler and return its result .
return old_handler.apply ( this , arguments ) ; } ; //
This may seem a little complicated , but it normalizes the `add` // method between jQuery 1.4 , 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 + if ( $.isFunction ( handleObj ) ) { //
This is how 1.4 & 1.4.1 did it .
old_handler = handleObj ; return new_handler ; } else { //
This works in 1.4.2 or newer .
old_handler = handleObj.handler ; handleObj.handler = new_handler ; } } } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
4 . The setup and teardown methods
When binding an event handler for a “ special ” event , if no event handlers are currently bound to the element in question , the setup method is called .
This effectively allows you to setup or initialize complex code for that event on a per-element basis to “ enable ” it to work .
The teardown method works in exactly the same way , except that it ’s called when the last event handler is being unbound from an element .
In addition , if either the setup or teardown methods return false , jQuery will bind ( or unbind ) the event handler using native DOM methods .
This is useful when you want to augment an existing event with additional functionality , which brings us to our first example :
4.1 . Custom click event
In David Walsh ’s Adding Events to Adding Events in MooTools article , he expressed his frustration that while many site designers bind click event handlers to non-anchor elements , they do n’t update those elements ’
CSS styles to change the mouse cursor to “ pointer ” , signifying that the element is clickable .
It might be a minor detail , but as they say , “ the devil is in the details . ”
The traditional way to do this would be to set an inline style on the element every time a click event handler is bound , like $ ( ' div ' ) .css ( ' cursor ' , ' pointer ' ) .click ( fn ) ( or add a predefined “ clickable ” class ) , but that ’s potentially a lot of extra code in your application .
Another approach might be to to create a $ .fn. bindCustomClick method that is effectively a wrapper for just that , which results in less code .. but just ends up being an unnecessary abstraction .
Fortunately , the special events API can be used to make this automatic .
As in David ’s jQuery solution , in this example a special “ click ” event is set up such that whenever the first click event handler is bound to an element , an inline style is automatically set on that element , with the reverse happening when the last event handler is unbound .. and because the setup and teardown methods return false , jQuery binds the click event handler normally , using the native DOM methods .
Take a look at the code below , and then view the working example .
The code
( function ( $ ) { // Special event definition .
$.event.special.click = { setup : function ( ) { //
This is only done the first time a " click " event handler is bound , // per-element .
$ ( this ) .css ( ' cursor ' , ' pointer ' ) ; //
Bind the " click " event normally .
return false ; } , teardown : function ( ) { //
This is only done the last time a " click " event handler is unbound , // per-element .
$ ( this ).css ( ' cursor ' , '' ) ; //
Unbind the " click " event normally .
return false ; } } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
Sample Usage
$ ( function ( ) { //
All div elements will have their cursor automatically pointer - ified .
$ ( ' div ' ) . bind ( ' click ' , function ( ) { alert ( ' I have been clicked ! ' ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
4.2 . Custom tripleclick event
Unlike the native browser “ click ” and “ dblclick ” events , there is no native “ tripleclick ” event ( or “ trplclick ” event ) , but that did n’t stop Brandon Aaron from explaining one approach for creating a tripleclick event using the special events API .
At its core , the tripleclick event is powered by the click event .
Click three times within a certain time threshold , and the tripleclick event fires .
In the following example , because the tripleclick event does n’t exist natively , there ’s no need for jQuery to bind to it using the native DOM methods , so it makes no sense to return false .
And unlike the previous example , which “ piggybacks ” additional code onto an existing event , this special event creates an entirely new “ custom ” event that is powered by another , existing event .
Also , this custom event is made possible by event delegation .
Because events in jQuery bubble up the DOM tree , a catch - all “ click ” handler bound on document is used to see on which element that event was triggered .
When the “ tripleclick ” event is bound on one or more elements , those elements are added into an internal collection of elements and a “ click ” event handler is bound on document .
After that point , whenever an element on the page is clicked , the event will propagate up the DOM tree to document , where the document click event handler will execute .
Since that handler can use event .
target to know on which element the event was triggered , it can then trigger the “ tripleclick ” event on that element if the proper conditions have been met .
Note that the tripleclick threshold setting , $ .tripleclickThreshold , is a “ global ” setting , applying to all tripleclick event handlers , and can be changed at any time .
In addition , the tripleclick event is only actually triggered on event . target ( the actual element that was triple - clicked ) , but because it bubbles up the DOM tree , it can have its propagation stopped , just like a native event .
( Because Internet Explorer is super - extra - awesome , you will need to click five times for the tripleclick event to fire , due to the way it triggers the click event when selecting text .
Internally binding to both the selectstart and click events will work around this issue , but this approach is not included in the examples for simplicity ’s sake )
Take a look at the code below , and then view the working example .
The code
( function ( $ ) { //
A collection of elements to which the tripleclick event is bound .
var elems = $ ( [ ] ) , // Initialize the clicks counter and last - clicked timestamp .
clicks = 0 , last = 0 ; // Click speed threshold , defaults to 500 .
$ .tripleclickThreshold = 500 ; // Special event definition .
$.event.special.tripleclick = { setup : function ( ) { //
Add this element to the internal collection .
elems = elems.add ( this ) ; //
If this is the first element to which the event has been bound , // bind a handler to document to catch all ' click ' events .
if ( elems.length === 1 ) { $ ( document ) . bind ( ' click ' , click_handler ) ; } } , teardown : function ( ) {
//
Remove this element from the internal collection .
elems = elems.not ( this ) ; //
If this is the last element removed , remove the document ' click ' // event handler that " powers " this special event .
if ( elems.length === 0 ) { $ ( document ) .unbind ( ' click ' , click_handler ) ; } } } ; //
This function is executed every time an element is clicked .
function click_handler ( event ) { var elem = $ ( event.target ) ; //
If more than `threshold` time has passed since the last click , reset // the clicks counter .
if ( event.timeStamp - last > $.tripleclickThreshold ) { clicks = 0 ; } // Update the last - clicked timestamp .
last = event.timeStamp ; // Increment the clicks counter .
If the counter has reached 3 , trigger // the " tripleclick " event and reset the clicks counter to 0 .
Trigger // bound handlers using trigger Handler so the event does n't propagate .
if ( ++ clicks === 3 ) { elem.trigger ( ' tripleclick ' ) ; clicks = 0 ; } } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
Sample Usage
$ ( function ( ) { //
When '# foo ' has been triple - clicked within the default threshold of // 500 milliseconds , the message will alert .
$ ( ' # foo ' ) . bind ( ' tripleclick ' , function ( ) { alert ( ' I have been triple - clicked ! ' ) ; } ) ; //
When ' # bar ' has been triple - clicked within the default threshold of // 500 milliseconds , the message will alert .
$ ( ' # bar ' ) . bind ( ' tripleclick ' , function ( ) { alert ( ' I have also been triple - clicked ! ' ) ; } ) ; //
Change the tripleclick threshold to 1000 milliseconds , affecting any // already - bound event handlers as well as all future event handlers .
$.tripleclickThreshold = 1000 ; } ) ;
4.3 . Custom tripleclick event : per-element threshold
This example is similar to the previous example , with one major difference .
Instead of being limited to just “ global ” threshold ( the $.tripleclickThreshold property ) , the threshold can now be overridden on a per-element basis .
One very important thing to note about this approach is that because the tripleclick event is being triggered explicitly on each element ( instead of being triggered only on event .
target , like in the previous example ) , the event does n’t actually propagate and as such cannot have its propagation stopped .
This is an unfortunate side - effect of utilizing this per-element event - data approach .
A few things to note about the setup method ’s first argument , which may be specified as eventData when an event handler is bound ( see the official bind method documentation ) :
eventData can be any data type , except Function .
While an Object is usually passed , it can also be a String , Number or Boolean .
can be any data type , except Function .
While an Object is usually passed , it can also be a String , Number or Boolean .
Because the setup method only fires the first time an special event handler is bound to the element in question , using the approach outlined in this example will cause only the first bind ’s eventData to be used ( but see the custom tripleclick event : per-handler threshold example later in this article for a way around this limitation ) .
Take a look at the code below , and then view the working example .
The code
( function ( $ ) { //
Click speed threshold , defaults to 500 .
$ .tripleclickThreshold = 500 ; // Special event definition .
$.event.special.tripleclick = { setup : function ( data ) { //
When the event is first bound , initialize the element plugin data // ( including clicks counter , last - clicked timestamp , and a threshold // value if specified ) , and bind the " click " event handler that will // be used to power the custom " tripleclick " event .
$ ( this ) .data ( ' tripleclick ' , { clicks : 0 , last : 0 , threshold : data } ) . bind ( ' click ' , click_handler ) ; } , teardown : function ( ) { //
When the last event is unbound , remove all element plugin data and // unbind the " click " event handler .
$ ( this ) .removeData ( ' tripleclick ' ) .unbind ( ' click ' , click_handler ) ; } } ; //
This function is executed every time an element is clicked .
function click_handler ( event ) { var elem = $ ( this ) , // Get plugin data stored on the element .
data = elem.data ( ' tripleclick ' ) , //
Use the specified threshold , otherwise use the global value .
threshold = data.
threshold || $ .tripleclickThreshold ; //
If more than `threshold` time has passed since the last click , reset // the clicks counter .
if ( event.timeStamp - data.last > threshold ) { data.clicks = 0 ; } //
Update the element 's last - clicked timestamp .
data.last = event.timeStamp ; // Increment the clicks counter .
If the counter has reached 3 , trigger // the " tripleclick " event and reset the clicks counter to 0 .
Trigger // bound handlers using trigger Handler so the event does n't propagate .
if ( ++data.clicks === 3 ) { elem.triggerHandler( ' tripleclick ' ) ; data.clicks = 0 ; } } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
Sample Usage
$ ( function ( ) { //
When '# foo ' has been triple - clicked within the default threshold of // 500 milliseconds , the message will alert .
$ ( ' # foo ' ) . bind ( ' tripleclick ' , function ( ) { alert ( ' I have been triple - clicked ! ' ) ; } ) ; //
When ' # bar ' has been triple - clicked within the specified threshold of // 250 milliseconds , the message will alert .
$ ( ' # bar ' ) . bind ( ' tripleclick ' , 250 , function ( ) { alert ( ' I have also been triple - clicked ! ' ) ; } ) ; //
When ' # bar ' has been triple - clicked within the originally specified // threshold of 250 milliseconds , the message will alert .
Since `setup` // does n't execute for subsequent bound handlers , the only way to change // the threshould ( in this case ) would be to unbind and then rebind all // event handlers .
$ ( ' # bar ' ) . bind ( ' tripleclick ' , function ( ) { alert ( ' Another triple - click alert ! ' ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
4.4 . Custom resize event : heavy on the polling
Long ago , the powers - that - be decided that the “ resize ” event would only fire on the browser ’s window object , so it ’s unfortunately not available on all those other elements whose dimensions might change .
Of course , it could be , if the special events API were involved , so I recently created a jQuery resize event plugin to provide that functionality .
Because there is no event that gets fired when an element resizes , the custom resize event ca n’t be “ powered ” by another event as in the “ tripleclick ” event .
Instead , for each element to which the custom resize event is bound , a periodic measurement of that element ’s dimensions must be taken , triggering the event on that element if either its width or its height has changed since the last measurement .
So , in this example , for each element to which a resize event handler is bound , a polling loop is started which periodically checks for dimension changes and triggers the event when appropriate .
And thanks to the setup and teardown methods , the polling loop can be started only once the event is actually bound to an element , and can be stopped when all resize events are unbound from that element .
( See the next special event example , custom resize event : minimal polling for code that looks more like the actual jQuery resize event plugin )
Take a look at the code below , and then view the working example .
The code
( function ( $ ) { // Special event definition .
$.event.special.resize = { setup : function ( ) { var elem = $ ( this ) ; // Initialize default plugin data on this element .
elem.data ( ' resize ' , { w : elem.width( ) , h : elem.height ( ) } ) ; //
Start polling loop for this element .
poll ( elem ) ; } , teardown : function ( ) { var elem = $ ( this ) , data = elem.data ( ' resize ' ) ; //
Since no more " resize " events are bound to this element , cancel // polling loop .
clearTimeout ( data.timeout_id ) ; //
Remove plugin data from this element .
elem.removeData( ' resize ' ) ; } } ; //
As long as a " resize " event is bound , this function will execute // repeatedly .
function poll ( elem ) { var width = elem. width ( ) , height = elem.height ( ) , data = elem.data ( ' resize ' ) ; //
If element size has changed since the last time , update the element // data store and trigger the " resize " event .
Since the event should n't // propagate , use trigger Handler . if ( width !== data.w || height !== data.h ) { data.w = width ; data.h = height ; elem.triggerHandler( ' resize ' ) ; } //
Poll , storing timeout_id in element data so the polling loop can be // canceled . data.timeout_id = setTimeout ( function ( ) { poll ( elem ) ; } , 250 ) ; } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
Sample Usage
$ ( function ( ) { //
When any ' div ' element has resized , log the new size to the console .
$ ( ' div ' ) . bind ( ' resize ' , function ( ) { var width = $ ( this ) .
width ( ) , height = $ ( this ) . height ( ) , console.log ( ' Size : ' + width + ' x ' + height ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
4.5 . Custom resize event : minimal polling
While this custom “ resize ” event example provides the same functionality as the previous example , it has been structured differently to improve performance .
Whereas the previous example used one polling loop per element , this example uses a single polling loop for all elements .
In general , polling loops should be avoided wherever possible , and while it ’s not possible to avoid polling in the case of a custom resize event , there is no reason to create a separate polling loop for each element .
In addition to using the setup and teardown methods to initialize a specific element when an event handler is bound or unbound from that element , these methods can also be utilized to perform a much more “ global ” task , like updating a shared - across - all - elements private property inside the special event ’s closure .
In this example , the elems variable contains a collection of all elements to which the event is bound , that is iterated over each time the polling loop function executes .
And because this collection of elements has a length , the polling loop can be started only when it ’s needed , and stopped otherwise .
( Note that while the overall structure of this special event example is the same as the finished plugin , some additional logic had to be written to prevent double - firing of event handlers when the event was manually triggered .
See my jQuery resize event plugin for the complete , finished source )
Take a look at the code below , and then view the working example .
The code
( function ( $ ) { //
A collection of elements to which the resize event is bound .
var elems = $ ( [ ] ) , //
An id with which the polling loop can be canceled .
timeout_id ; // Special event definition .
$.event.special.resize = { setup : function ( ) { var elem = $ ( this ) ; //
Add this element to the internal collection .
elems = elems.add ( elem ) ; // Initialize default plugin data on this element .
elem.data ( ' resize ' , { w : elem.width( ) , h : elem.height ( ) } ) ; //
If this is the first element to which the event has been bound , // start the polling loop .
if ( elems.length === 1 ) { poll( ) ; } } , teardown : function ( ) { var elem = $ ( this ) ; // Remove this element from the internal collection .
elems = elems.not ( elem ) ; //
Remove plugin data from this element .
elem.removeData( ' resize ' ) ; //
If this is the last element to which the event was bound , cancel // the polling loop .
if ( !elems.length ) { clearTimeout ( timeout_id ) ; } } } ; //
As long as a " resize " event is bound , this function will execute // repeatedly .
function poll ( ) { //
Iterate over all elements in the internal collection . elems.each( function ( ) { var elem = $ ( this ) , width = elem. width ( ) , height = elem.height ( ) , data = elem.data ( ' resize ' ) ; //
If element size has changed since the last time , update the element // data store and trigger the " resize " event .
if ( width !== data.w || height !== data.h ) { data.w = width ; data.h = height ; elem.triggerHandler( ' resize ' ) ; } } ) ; //
Poll , setting timeout_id so the polling loop can be canceled .
timeout_id = setTimeout ( poll , 250 ) ; } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
Sample Usage
$ ( function ( ) { //
When any div element has resized , log the new size to the console .
$ ( ' div ' ) . bind ( ' resize ' , function ( ) { var width = $ ( this ) .
width ( ) , height = $ ( this ) . height ( ) , console.log ( ' Size : ' + width + ' x ' + height ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
5 . The add and remove methods
The add and remove methods , added in jQuery 1.4 ( and revamped in 1.4.2 ) , work much like their setup and teardown counterparts , except they are called every time an event handler is bound or unbound from an element ( unlike setup , which is called only the first time an event handler is bound , and teardown , which is called only the last time an event handler is unbound ) .
The single handle Obj argument passed into these methods contains a number of useful properties , most useful of which is the handler method .
This is the event handler being bound to the event , which is what gets called every time the event is triggered .
Since handleObj.handler is available at the time the event handler is being bound , it ’s possible to override the handler property to do something else every time the event is triggered , like augment the event object with a custom property or even override an existing event object property .
5.1 . Custom click event : clickDisabled
In Matt Snider ’s recent Switching Events On & Off Globally article , he suggested a scenario in which , at a certain point during the processing of a page , all bound click events needed to be temporarily disabled .
This scenario is not uncommon , and this technique can be especially useful when performing asynchronous tasks , like submitting forms or fetching data via AJAX , where you do n’t want the user to accidentally double - submit by clicking links or buttons before the task has completed .
While the traditional approach would be to either put an “ if ” statement inside every click handler or to wrap all click event binding code in another function that does just that , but automatically , those approaches are somewhat ugly and prone to mistakes .
For example , what if a developer does n’t use one of these methods , because they do n’t understand why it ’s there , or what happens if you need to temporarily disable a click event that you have no control over ?
In this example , you ’ll see that using the jQuery special events API makes this not only possible , but trivially easy .
Using the add method to override the originally bound event handler with a new method , we can add in a little bit of extra logic that works for every click event in a completely unobtrusive way .
Take a look at the code below , and then view the working example .
The code
( function ( $ ) { //
A public property that can be changed at any time .
$. clickDisabled = null ; // Special event definition .
$.event.special.click = { add : function ( handle Obj ) { //
Save a reference to the bound event handler .
var old_handler = handleObj.handler , //
The current element .
elem = $ ( this ) ; handleObj.handler = function ( event ) { if ( $.clickDisabled && elem.is( $.clickDisabled ) ) { //
If $. click Disabled is specified and the element to which the // callback is bound matches the specified selector , prevent the // default action without stopping propagation , and do n't call // the originally bound event handler .
event.preventDefault( ) ; } else { //
Otherwise call the originally - bound event handler and return // its value .
return old_handler.apply ( this , arguments ) ; } } ; } } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
Sample Usage
$ ( function ( ) { //
All nav linkss have a click event handler bound .
$ ( ' # nav a' ) . bind ( ' click ' , function ( ) { alert ( ' I have been clicked ! ' ) ; } ) ; //
At some point in the future , disable only those links .
$. clickDisabled = ' # nav a ' ; } ) ;
5.2 . Custom hashchange event
Right now , in Internet Explorer 8 , Firefox 3.6 , and Chrome 5 , you can bind event handlers to the native window .
onhashchange event to execute code whenever the location .
hash changes , and because the event is supported natively , you do n’t need a plugin .
Of course , what happens when you want your code to work in a browser that does n’t support the hashchange event ?
This simplified “ hashchange ” special event is a good segue between the preceding “ setup and teardown ” section and the current “ add and remove ” section because it not only uses the setup and teardown methods to start and stop a polling loop ( only in browsers that do n’t natively support the hashchange event , of course ) , but it also illustrates how the event object can be augmented with a custom property in the add method .
( Note that while the overall structure of this special event example is the same as the finished plugin , a fair amount of additional code must be written to make it work correctly cross - browser , which includes some special logic for IE to properly detect native support for the event as well as to enable “ back button ” support , which is not discussed in this article .
In addition , I have split the special event functionality such that while my jQuery hashchange event plugin actually creates the event , my jQuery BBQ plugin augments that event with an additional property and method , among other things )
Take a look at the code below , and then view the working example .
The code
( function ( $ ) { //
Store the initial location .
hash so that the event is n't triggered when // the page is first loaded .
var last_hash = location .
hash , // An id with which the polling loop can be canceled .
timeout_id ; // Special event definition .
$.event.special.hashchange = { setup : function ( ) { //
If the event is supported natively , return false so that jQuery // will bind to the event using DOM methods instead of using the // polling loop .
if ( ' onhashchange ' in window ) { return false ; } //
Start the polling loop if it 's not already running .
start ( ) ; } , teardown : function ( ) { //
If the event is supported natively , return false so that jQuery // will bind to the event using DOM methods instead of using the // polling loop .
if ( ' onhashchange ' in window ) { return false ; } //
Stop the polling loop .
Since this event is only evern bound to // the `window` object , multiple - element tracking is unnecessary .
stop( ) ; } , add : function ( handle Obj ) { //
Save a reference to the bound event handler .
var old_handler = handleObj.handler ; //
This function will now be called when the event is triggered , // instead of the bound event handler .
handleObj.handler = function ( event ) { //
Augment the event object with the location .
hash at the time // the event was triggered .
event. fragment = location.hash.replace ( /^#/ , '' ) ; //
Call the originally - bound event handler , complete with modified // event object !
The result from this call does n't need to be // returned , because there is no default action to prevent , and // nothing to propagate to . old_handler.apply ( this , arguments ) ; } ; } } ; // Start ( or continue ) the polling loop .
function start ( ) { //
Stop the polling loop if it has already started .
stop ( ) ; //
Get the current location .
hash .
If is has changed since the last loop // iteration , store that value and trigger the hashchange event .
var hash = location .
hash ; if ( hash !== last_hash ) { $ ( window ) .
trigger ( ' hashchange ' ) ; last_hash = hash ; } //
Poll , setting timeout_id so the polling loop can be canceled .
timeout_id = setTimeout ( start , 100 ) ; } ; // Stop the polling loop .
function stop ( ) { clearTimeout ( timeout_id ) ; } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
Sample Usage
$ ( function ( ) { //
Whenever the hashchange event is triggered , alert the `fragment` // property stored in the event object .
$ ( window ) . bind ( ' hashchange ' , function ( event ) { alert ( event.
fragment ) ; } ) ; // " foo " will be alerted .
location . hash = ' # foo ' ; } ) ;
5.3 . Custom clickoutside event
Just like in the initial tripleclick event example , the following “ clickoutside ” event is made possible by event delegation .
The difference here is that the document - bound click handler iterates over all elements in the aforementioned internal collection of elements , triggering the custom “ clickoutside ” event on all elements that are n’t the same as , or a parent of , the triggering element .
Whenever an event is triggered on an element , the event . target property refers to the element on which the event was triggered , which is useful for when the event bubbles up the DOM tree .
In this special event ’s document - bound click handler , event . target is necessary to know on which element the event was triggered .
Now , since the custom “ clickoutside ” event is triggered directly on the element to which the event handler is bound , event .
target and this will be the same .
Because the originating event is , by definition , being triggered on an element that is outside the element on which the custom “ outside ” event is triggered , it seems most useful to set event .
target to be the element on which the originating event was triggered , which is easy to do in the add method .
( While I had originally released a clickoutside event plugin , it became obvious shortly thereafter that it would be a good idea , and fairly trivial at that , to create a single outside events plugin that created not one , but fifteen outside events based on their native counterparts , along with a method that could be used to create an “ outside ” event from ANY native or custom event )
Take a look at the code below , and then view the working example .
The code
( function ( $ ) { //
A collection of elements to which the clickoutside event is bound .
var elems = $ ( [ ] ) ; // Special event definition .
$.event.special.clickoutside = { setup : function ( ) { //
Add this element to the internal collection .
elems = elems.add ( this ) ; //
If this is the first element to which the event has been bound , // bind a handler to document to catch all ' click ' events .
if ( elems.length === 1 ) { $ ( document ) . bind ( ' click ' , handle_event ) ; } } , teardown : function ( ) {
//
Remove this element from the internal collection .
elems = elems.not ( this ) ; //
If this is the last element removed , remove the document ' click ' // event handler that " powers " this special event .
if ( elems.length === 0 ) { $ ( document ) .unbind ( ' click ' , handle_event ) ; } } , add : function ( handle Obj ) { //
Save a reference to the bound event handler .
var old_handler = handleObj.handler ; //
This function will now be called when the event is triggered , // instead of the bound event handler .
handleObj.handler = function ( event , elem ) { //
Set the event object 's . target property to the element that the // user clicked , not the element on which the ' clickoutside ' event // was triggered .
event. target = elem ; //
Call the originally - bound event handler , complete with modified // event object !
The result from this call does n't need to be // returned , because there is no default action to prevent , and // nothing to propagate to . old_handler.apply ( this , arguments ) ; } ; } } ; //
When an element is clicked .. function handle_event ( event ) { //
Iterate over all elements in the internal collection .
$ ( elems ) .each ( function ( ) { var elem = $ ( this ) ; //
If this element is n't the clicked element , and this element does n't // contain the clicked element , then the clicked element is considered // outside , and the event should be triggered ! if ( this !== event.target && !elem.has(event.target ) .length ) { //
Use trigger Handler instead of trigger so that the event does n't // bubble .
Pass the ' click ' event. target so that the ' clickoutside ' // event. target can be overridden .
elem.triggerHandler( ' clickoutside ' , [ event. target ] ) ; } } ) ; } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
Sample Usage
$ ( function ( ) { //
Hide a modal dialog when someone clicks outside of it . $ ( " #modal " ) . bind ( " clickoutside " , function ( ) { $ ( this ) .hide ( ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
5.4 . Custom tripleclick event : per-handler threshold
If you recall , the per-element data “ tripleclick ” event example was somewhat handicapped because the setup method only executes the first time an event handler is bound to a specific element .
Because of this , only the eventData value specified in that first bind call is utilized , so if you wanted to bind multiple handlers to the same element , each with its own click threshold , you were out of luck .
Well , because the add method is called for each bound event handler , it is possible to use the aforementioned eventData argument ( again , see the official bind method documentation ) on a per- handler basis , instead of on a per-element basis like using only the setup method allows .
In this “ tripleclick ” example , instead of storing data on the element , it actually just persists in the add method ’s closure .
Since each handler now has its own threshold , clicks counter and last - clicked timestamp , this ultimately makes the event far more flexible .
Of course , just like the per-element data “ tripleclick ” event example , because the tripleclick event is being triggered explicitly on each element ( instead of being triggered only on event .
target , the originating element ) , the event does n’t actually propagate and as such cannot have its propagation stopped .
Since bubbling up the DOM tree is an expected behavior for events , you may ultimately decide to keep it simple as in the original tripleclick event example , but that decision is up to you .
Take a look at the code below , and then view the working example .
The code
( function ( $ ) { //
Click speed threshold , defaults to 500 .
$ .tripleclickThreshold = 500 ; // Special event definition .
$.event.special.tripleclick = { setup : function ( data ) { //
When the event is first bound , bind the " click " event handler that // will be used to power the custom " tripleclick " event .
$ ( this ) . bind ( ' click ' , click_handler ) ; } , teardown : function ( ) { //
When the last event is unbound , unbind the " click " event handler .
$ ( this ) .unbind ( ' click ' , click_handler ) ; } , add : function ( handle Obj ) { //
The event handler being bound to the event .
var old_handler = handleObj.handler , // Initialize this handler 's clicks counter and last - clicked // timestamp .
clicks = 0 , last = 0 ; //
When the event is triggered , instead of executing the bound // handler directly , `handleObj.handler` will be called , which will // then call the original `old_handler` function .
Notice that an extra // argument is being passed to the new_handler function , see the // `click_handler` function for more information .
handleObj.handler = function ( event , timestamp ) { //
Ignore all handler calls due to bubbling .
if ( this !== event.target ) { return ; } var elem = $ ( this ) , // Use the specified threshold , otherwise use the global value .
threshold = handleObj.data || $ .tripleclickThreshold ; //
If more than `threshold` time has passed since the last click , // reset the clicks counter .
if ( timestamp - last > threshold ) { clicks = 0 ; } // Update this handler 's last - clicked timestamp .
last = timestamp ; // Increment the clicks counter .
If the counter has reached 3 , // trigger the " tripleclick " event and reset the clicks counter .
if ( ++ clicks === 3 ) { old_handler.apply ( this , arguments ) ; clicks = 0 ; } } ; } } ; //
This function is executed every time an element is clicked .
function click_handler ( event ) { //
Trigger the " tripleclick " event , passing in the click event 's // `timeStamp` property as `extraParameters` .
$ ( this ) .triggerHandler ( ' tripleclick ' , [ event.timeStamp ] ) ; } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
Sample Usage
$ ( function ( ) { //
When '# foo ' has been triple - clicked within the default threshold of // 500 milliseconds , the message will alert .
$ ( ' # foo ' ) . bind ( ' tripleclick ' , function ( ) { alert ( ' I have been triple - clicked ! ' ) ; } ) ; //
When ' # bar ' has been triple - clicked within the specified threshold of // 250 milliseconds , the message will alert .
$ ( ' # bar ' ) . bind ( ' tripleclick ' , 250 , function ( ) { alert ( ' I have also been triple - clicked ! ' ) ; } ) ; //
When ' # bar ' has been triple - clicked within the default threshold of // 500 milliseconds , the message will alert .
$ ( ' # bar ' ) . bind ( ' tripleclick ' , function ( ) { alert ( ' Another triple - click alert ! ' ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
5.5 . A theoretical exercise
This is “ extra credit , ” but it would actually be trivial to simulate the “ first event bound / last event unbound ” setup and teardown functionality using add and remove like this .. but of course your code wo n’t be backwards - compatible with jQuery 1.3.2 ( in case you care ) and you wo n’t be able to return false to bind or unbind events with native DOM methods , so this should be considered a theoretical exercise only .
Take a look at the code below , and then view the working example .
The code
( function ( $ ) { // Special event definition .
$.event.special.myevent = { add : function ( ) { var elem = $ ( this ) , data = elem.data ( ' myevent ' ) ; if ( !data ) { elem.data ( ' myevent ' , data = { bound_count : 0 } ) ; // Simulated " setup " code here .
} data.bound_count ++ ; } , remove : function ( ) { var elem = $ ( this ) , data = elem.data ( ' myevent ' ) ; if ( -- data.bound_count === 0 ) { elem.removeData ( ' myevent ' ) ; //
Simulated " teardown " code here .
} } } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
6 . The _default method
By specifying a _default method , it is possible to create a default action for any custom event .
This default action , much like native events ’ default actions , executes after the event has bubbled up the DOM tree and all bound event handlers have been triggered .
Just like native events ’ default actions , a custom event ’s default action can be bypassed by calling the event .
preventDefault method .
Providing a default action for events offers another way in which a framework or plugin developers can abstract complex internals away from the end - user , allowing for simpler , more maintainable code .
for example , imagine that you ’re creating a widget framework , and while every widget has a “ close ” button , an arbitrary parent element might need “ veto ” power over a widget ’s ability to close itself ( because of some arbitrary logic like dirty form checking , or state saving ) .
6.1 . Custom destroy event
In this example , when the custom ‘ destroy ’ event is triggered , the element on which it was triggered will be removed from the DOM unless the event ’s default action is prevented .
Now , while the framework provides the default action , which is responsible for handling all the internal framework - level nuances of removing a widget , the implementation - specific code is responsible for deciding when the default behavior should be prevented , if at all .
Take a look at the code below , and then view the working example .
The framework code
( function ( $ ) { //
When the ' destroy ' event is triggered on an element , that element will // be removed from the DOM , unless prevented with event.preventDefault ( ) .
$.event.special.destroy = { _default : function ( event ) { $ ( event.target ) .remove( ) ; } } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
The implementation - specific code
$ ( function ( ) { //
Handle the ' destroy ' event for each widget .
$ ( '.widget ' ) . bind ( ' destroy ' , function ( event ) { //
Only allow the widget to be destroyed if it is n't preceded by any // other widgets .
if ( $ ( this ) .prevAll ( '.widget ') .
length ) { //
Note that the ' heavy lifting ' of removing the element is done // in the framework , thus abstracting away the internals from the // user .
All they need to do is prevent it , or not .
event.preventDefault ( ) ; //
An implementation - specific error message .
alert ( ' Widgets must be closed in order !' ) ; } } ) ; //
When an ' X ' close link is clicked , trigger the ' destroy ' event for // that widget .
$ ( '.widget .close ' ) . bind ( ' click ' , function ( event ) { $ ( this ) .closest ( '. widget ' ) . trigger ( ' destroy ' ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
7. Event delegation considerations
When a bound event handler executes , this inside that handler always refers to the element on which the event was bound .
Now , when you bind a event handler to an element using bind , it ’s simply bound to that element , and this is precisely what you ’d expect .
When you bind an event handler using live or delegate however , things work a bit differently .
You should n’t be surprised to know that in a live - bound event handler , this refers to document , and in a delegate - bound event handler , for each of the selected elements in the jQuery object on which the delegate method was called , this refers to that element .
( If you were surprised , please view the jQuery API documentation for live and delegate and then read Brandon Aaron ’s Event Delegation with jQuery article before continuing )
Because the setup , teardown , add and remove methods are also executed in the context to which the event handler is bound , things have to be structured quite differently for these methods to work correctly with bind - bound event handlers versus live - and delegate - bound event handlers .
While this could be taken for granted before , it no longer can .
For example , since both $ ( ' # foo ' ) .
live ( ' click ' , fn ) and $ ( ' # bar ' ) .
live ( ' click ' , fn ) actually bind their event handlers to document to be handled via delegation , and since the setup method only executes when the first event handler is bound to a particular element , setup will only be executed for that first live call but not the second .
Not only that , but inside the setup method , this will reference document and not #foo .
7.1 . Custom clickoutside event : delegation only
This custom “ clickoutside ” event example has been designed to enable event handlers bound with the live and delegate methods , but unlike the previous custom clickoutside event , will not enable event handlers bound with the bind method ( partially because I want to illustrate how the two approaches differ , but also because combining the two is too painful for me to contemplate at the moment ) .
A few things to note about this approach :
Because jQuery ’s live and delegate methods are based on selecting elements via a context + selector string at the time the event is triggered , a potentially very expensive element selection operation happens every time the event is triggered .
This can only scale so far , and if performance is more important than convenience , allowing for event delegation might be impractical .
and methods are based on selecting elements via a context + selector string at the time the event is triggered , a potentially very expensive element selection operation happens every time the event is triggered .
This can only scale so far , and if performance is more important than convenience , allowing for event delegation might be impractical .
Because this references the context on which the event is bound , event . target references the element on which the event is triggered and should n’t be modified , as in the previous custom clickoutside event example .
Because of this , a custom event .
clicked property is created to refer to the clicked element .
Take a look at the code below , and then view the working example .
( function ( $ ) { //
A collection of contexts to which the clickoutside event is bound .
var contexts = $ ( [ ] ) , //
An array of context + handleObj items .
When the click event is // triggered , these are iterated over to determine on which elements // the clickoutside event will be triggered .
handleObjs = [ ] ; // Special event definition .
$.event.special.clickoutside = { setup : function ( ) { //
Add this context to the internal collection .
contexts = contexts.add ( this ) ; //
If this is the first context to which the event has been bound , // bind a handler to document to catch all ' click ' events . if ( contexts.
length === 1 ) { $ ( document ) . bind ( ' click ' , handle_event ) ; } } , teardown : function ( ) {
//
Remove this context from the internal collection .
contexts = contexts.not ( this ) ; //
If this is the last context removed , remove the document ' click ' // event handler that " powers " this special event .
if ( contexts.
length === 0 ) { $ ( document ) .unbind ( ' click ' , handle_event ) ; } } , add : function ( handle Obj ) { //
Add this context + handleObj pair onto the array .
handleObjs.push ( { context : this , handleObj : handleObj } ) ; //
This function will now be called when the event is triggered , // instead of the bound event handler .
handleObj.handler = function ( event , elem ) { //
Set the event object 's . clicked property to the element that the // user clicked , not the element on which the ' clickoutside ' event // was triggered .
event.clicked = elem ; //
The ' clickoutside ' event should n't propagate up the DOM tree . //event.stopPropagation ( ) ; //
For a delegated special event that should n't propagate , we need // to call handleObj.origHandler manually , instead of calling the // original handleObj.handler method .
handleObj.origHandler.apply ( this , arguments ) ; } ; } , remove : function ( handle Obj ) { //
Remove this context + handleObj from the array .
var context = this ; handleObjs = $ .grep ( handleObjs , function ( v ) { return v.context !== context || v.handleObj !== handleObj ; } ) ; } } ; //
When an element is clicked .. function handle_event( event ) { var elems = $ ( [ ] ) ; //
Create a sorted , uniqued collection of elements selected by all // context + handleObj pairs .
Since element selection happens every time // the click event is triggered , this can be extremely expensive and // inefficient , which is probably the biggest negative side - effect of // supporting live or delegate in a special event .
$ .each ( handleObjs , function ( i, item ) { elems = elems.add ( $ ( item.handleObj.selector , item.context ) ) ; } ) ; // Iterate over all selected elements . elems.each( function ( ) { var elem = $ ( this ) ; //
If this element is n't the clicked element , and this element does n't // contain the clicked element , then the clicked element is considered // outside , and the event should be triggered ! if ( this !== event.target && !elem.has(event.target ) .length ) { //
We do n't want the ' clickoutside ' event to propagate , but the only // way it can work with delegation is for it to propagate .
In this // case , trigger Handler wo n't work , but trigger used in conjunction // with calling handleObj.origHandler in the `add` method will .
Pass // the ' click ' event. target so that the ' clickoutside ' event.
clicked // can be set . elem.trigger ( ' clickoutside ' , [ event. target ] ) ; } } ) ; } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
Sample Usage
$ ( function ( ) { //
Hide a modal dialog when someone clicks outside of it . $ ( " #modal " ) . live ( " clickoutside " , function ( ) { $ ( this ) .hide ( ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
8 . In summary
As you can see , the jQuery special events API is very powerful .
In the simplest use - cases , it allows you to modify existing events , but in more complicated use - cases , it allows you to create entirely new custom events or normalize newer not - yet - fully - supported events .
Not only that , but because of the flexibility of the API , there are many possible approaches that can be undertaken to accomplish the same task .
I encourage you not just to experiment with these code samples , but to create your own , and also to spend some time “ under the hood , ” looking at the jQuery source which , believe it or not , will answer many of your questions ( if you ’re patient enough ) .
I ’ve been working on this article for over a month now ( since before John Resig mentioned it in his jQuery 1.4.2 release blog post and in the process have uncovered a few jQuery bugs that will be fixed in the upcoming 1.4.3 release .

Yesterday , inflationists were out in full force after the Producer Price Index ( PPI ) release .
The Producer Price Index for Finished Goods rose 1.4 percent in January , seasonally adjusted , the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today .
This increase followed a 0.4 - percent advance in December and a 1.5 - percent rise in November .
In January , at the earlier stages of processing , prices received by manufacturers of intermediate goods climbed 1.7 percent , and the crude goods index jumped 9.6 percent .
On an unadjusted basis , prices for finished goods moved up 4.6 percent for the 12 months ended January 2010 , their third consecutive 12 - month increase .
Core CPI Drops First Time Since 1982
The cost of living in the U.S. rose in January less than anticipated and a measure of prices excluding food and fuel fell for the first time since 1982 , indicating the recovery is generating little inflation .
The consumer - price index increased 0.2 percent for a fifth straight month , led by higher fuel costs , Labor Department figures showed today in Washington .
Excluding energy and food , the so - called core index unexpectedly fell 0.1 percent , reflecting a drop in new - car prices , clothing and shelter .
Retailers such as Wal - Mart Stores Inc. have reduced prices to lure customers at a time when most employers are reluctant to hire .
Restrained inflation will allow Federal Reserve policy makers to keep the benchmark interest rate close to zero to help support the recovery .
Even with higher production and material costs , U.S. companies are reluctant to pass on the expenses to consumers .
Wal - Mart , the world ’s largest retailer , reported fourth - quarter sales yesterday that trailed its projection after cutting grocery and electronic prices .
No Pricing Power
Consumer Price Index Release
On a seasonally adjusted basis , the January Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ( CPI - U) rose 0.2 percent , the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today .
Over the last 12 months , the index increased 2.6 percent before seasonal adjustment .
The seasonally adjusted increase in the all items index was due to a rise in the energy index .
An increase in the gasoline index was the main factor , and the indexes for fuel oil and natural gas rose as well , though the electricity index declined .
The index for all items less food and energy fell 0.1 percent in January .
This decline was largely the result of decreases in the indexes for shelter , new vehicles , and airline fares .
In contrast , the medical care index posted its largest increase since January 2008 , and the index for used cars and trucks increased significantly for the sixth month in a row .

Geremi Adam , a member of the movie release group ‘ maVen ’ who was sentenced to two and a half months in prison recently , has died from a suspected drugs overdose .
According to his partner , Adam started taking morphine while trying to cope with the stresses of prison life .
The signs are that his habit could have killed him .
It is pretty safe to say that in piracy terms , few groups have released ‘ telesync ’ copies of mainstream movies onto the Internet in the quality and consistency of the group ‘ maVen ’ .
In 2006 all that came to an end when ‘ cammer ’ Geremi Adam was arrested after he recorded the movies “ How to Eat Fried Worms ” and “ Invincible ” at a Montreal movie theater .
Last month that process came to an end when Adams was sentenced to two and a half months in prison .
His lawyer had argued for community service because Adam suffered from depression and a troubled childhood , but despite these arguments the prosecution insisted on a prison sentence .
That request was granted by the court .
In the end , Adam served 7 days of his sentence but according to Cynthia Laporte , his partner of 2 years , in that time he started taking morphine to cope with his incarceration .
He was also taking prescribed anti-depressants and tranquilizers .
Laporte said that Adam had continued using morphine after his release , a habit he tried to hide .
On Sunday he was taken ill and an ambulance was called , but it was too late .
Just before midnight , Adam – aged just 28 – died from a suspected drugs overdose .
“ We had plans , ” said Laporte .
“ Geremi wanted to buy a duplex and move in and have tenants . ”
Laporte added that Adam was proud of being the best movie pirate around .
Illegality of his activities aside , most people familiar with his work were suitably impressed by his technical achievements which may never be bettered .
It will take one to two weeks for the authorities to establish the exact cause of death .

It is interesting to see how progressives interpret experiments in competition .
Matt Yglesias has a post entitled :
He makes the following observation :
The choice program does seem to lead to a lot of consumer satisfaction , but not actual improvements in performance .
In other words , actual parents like the results , and are trying to get their kids into the program , but central planners do n’t like the results .
They prefer to measure the effectiveness of schools by how well students do on tests .
I know I am in the minority in not being a fan of the testing approach to school quality ( probably even in the minority among my fellow right - wingers . )
So let ’s say I am completely wrong about tests , and the central planners are completely correct .
In that case Yglesias is still wrong , as the article he links to suggests that the voucher program has been a big success , even if test scores are the proper criteria for judging school quality :
Wolf , who has led this effort as well as the federally - endorsed evaluation of the DC voucher program , summarized , “ Voucher students are showing average rates of achievement gain similar to their public school peers . ”
Translation : when it comes to test scores , students with vouchers are performing no differently than other kids .
( It is worth noting that MPCP students are being educated more cheaply than are district school students ) .
So the voucher program achieved the same learning objectives at a lower cost , or more bang for the buck .
Since when is that regarded as failure ?
Let ’s consider the following two possibilities :
1. Spending more money on education ( at the margin ) increases learning .
2. Spending more money on education ( at the margin ) does n’t increase learning .
First assume case one is true .
This would imply that if we adopted vouchers , and spent as much per student as the Milwaukee public schools spend per student , we would get higher test scores .
That is called “ success . ”
Now assume case two is correct .
This would imply that there is no point in spending more money on education .
We should simply try to hold down costs .
This means that the voucher program in Milwaukee succeeded in the only way schooling can succeed ; it provided education at a lower cost than the public school system .
I ’m sure that case two sounds very cynical to a progressive like Yglesias .
I imagine that he thinks more spending can make a difference , perhaps if targeted to certain methods that have been shown to work .
OK , then how about taking the tax saving from voucher schools , and giving those schools a government grant to improve education in whatever area progressives like Yglesias think that money can still help at the margin ?
Would n’t that be a win - win for everyone except unionized public school teachers ?
I wonder why such a policy has almost no chance of happening .
I suppose the progressive counter - argument is that the policy failed according to the criterion set by the voucher proponents .
I have been a voucher proponent from the beginning , and certainly never thought success should be measured by test scores .
I ’ve always thought parental satisfaction was the proper criteria .
Indeed , I would hope that all free market economists agreed on this point .
There may be some conservatives who argued that test scores would improve , but why should we care what they think ?
Every day the progressive bloggers tell us that conservatives are morons .
I ’d rather judge the program on how well it actually did , using the standard economic criteria of costs and perceived customer benefits , not the single criterion used by central planners .
If a policy that leads to greater consumer satisfaction at lower cost , and produces no negative side - effects in test scores , is viewed as a “ failure ” by progressives , then I do n’t think we need to worry very much when progressives criticize the free market .
As Dylan once said : “ There ’s no success like failure , and failure ’s no success at all . ”
BTW , Has anyone else noticed that many of the same progressives who insist that we copy the European public health insurance model also tell us that the successful European voucher programs would n’t work here , because we are just too different ?
( This last point is not directed at Yglesias , I have no idea on how he views the Swedish and Dutch voucher programs . )

Police do drive - bys past her house to make sure she ’s safe .
Her office has been relocated to a more secure setting .
Welcome to the dangerous life of Helen Stevenson , the bureaucrat spearheading Ontario ’s controversial drug reforms .
The assistant deputy minister of health has been the target of death threats and thousands of angry letters , emails and phone calls .
While she admits the intimidation tactics have unnerved her , she says they are failing to move the province off course in implementing the biggest changes to its drug program in decades .
“ You have to believe in what you do and I absolutely believe the government has made the right decisions , ” she says .
The latest reforms are aimed at slashing the price of generic drugs by banning millions in payouts from drug companies to pharmacies .
Pharmacists argue this will drive smaller drugstores out of business and force others to cut back on hours and services .
Threats against Stevenson date back to 2006 when the Liberal government made its first attempt to control drug costs with new legislation requiring pharmacies to pass on volume - purchase discounts on generic drugs covered by the provincial benefit program .
“ I had someone on the phone tell me if he had a gun he was going to come and kill me , ” she recounts .
Also that year , an individual at an industry meeting threatened to chop her head off .
In both cases , the threats were made by pharmacists , Stevenson says .
Charges were never laid .
The 46 - year - old single mother of three school - age children says some strange things have happened around her Toronto home .
She ’s purposely vague on details , but says at one point someone tried to break in and she has found “ unusual things ” in her mailbox .
“ I wo n’t speak specifically , but in the middle of the night there were weird things happening and neighbours noticing strange things .
I think a little bit of this is probably harassment , ” Stevenson says .
Freedom of information requests have been made to the ministry for personal information about her and an ally in the pharmacy industry has warned her that a private detective is tailing her , she says .
Stevenson says that since 2008 , she has received as many as 400 postcards with a picture of a tombstone on them from members of the Independent Pharmacists of Ontario .
“ I get a huge amount of hostility and almost hatred from some pharmacists , but it ’s by no means all pharmacists , ” Stevenson says .
Representatives of industry associations say they know nothing of the threats and emphasize that they would never condone such action .
“ Certainly , we ’ve had our issues with Helen but under no circumstances would we ever , ever direct a pharmacist to take this type of action and whoever this individual was — and I do n’t think it ’s ever been proven that it ’s a pharmacist — probably has some sort of psychiatric disorder , ” says Dean Miller , chair of the Ontario Pharmacists ’
Association .
Still , he acknowledges that the reforms have caused emotions to run high , especially among the independent pharmacists whose livelihoods are at stake .
Miller notes that the serious threats against Stevenson date back four years : “ It ’s an old issue , but quite truthfully Helen tends to like to keep bringing it up .
She ’s not that fond of our industry .
I think you can probably tell that . ”
Ben Shenouda , president of the Independent Pharmacists of Ontario , says Stevenson has misinterpreted the postcard campaign , noting that the tombstones bear the message “ RIP Independent Pharmacists of Ontario . ”
It ’s meant to signal that smaller pharmacies are threatened with death because of the reforms , he says .
“ Every so often she comes to the media to say this to distract the media and to create sympathy with her .
Is it real ?
Is it not real ?
Is it that serious ?
Is it not that serious ?
To be honest with you , I have no idea . ”

The Ontario Provincial Police declined to comment .
But Stevenson says police have made decisions about what security provisions to put in place after assessing the level of risk .
Sometimes police accompany her to events and stand guard outside meetings .
Changes have also been made to the security around her home .
“ I always say that I have a pink Kevlar blazer , ” she jokes .
On a more serious note , she says she sometimes finds herself looking over her shoulder and admits that the animosity has on occasion brought her to tears .
The news of the death of at least 25 coal miners at the Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia is a reminder of the human costs that are incurred in the provision of fossil fuels .
Although American mines have grown considerably safer over the years , the nature of the work can mean that when there is an explosion in a mine , that there are multiple fatalities because of the layout which is most effective for getting the coal out .
It also underlines the higher costs that must be met when mining coal from underground operations , rather than the more visible , and criticized surface mining operations .
In the United States this is the largest mining disaster in more than 25 years at a mine that produced 1.2 million tons of metallurgical coal last year .
Because of the pressures on surface mining operations Massey Energy were moving an increasing percentage of their production to the underground .
The mine uses longwall techniques as the main means for producing coal and so I thought that it might be helpful if I reposted some of the information on that technique .
Part of the problem in controlling the ignition of gas in such an operation is that the mining machine breaks out the coal in relatively small fragments , by rotating a drum laced with picks against the coal face .
Surface test of a shearer used in longwall ( Bureau of Mines Bruceton )
The fine crushing of the coal can lead to the release of methane gas ( natural gas ) that is found and formed with the coal .
Levels of the gas are measured , and controlled by sending enough air down the face to dilute the level of the gas below that at which it is at risk of ignition or explosion .
However within the space that the drum is carving out it is not always possible to get that air flow into the area to ensure that dilution is immediate .
At the same time if there are layers of rock within the coal , then the pick can rub against these and generate sparks , and heat up the rock to the point that it becomes hot enough to ignite any methane pockets that have been released .
Once that ignition starts the very fine coal dust that is also a part of mining ( as the above picture shows ) means that this can also ignite , intensifying the resulting explosion .
That becomes particularly deadly , given the geometry of the longwall .
And to explain that let me repost something I had written about before .
Back in the mid-1800 's underground mining was usually carried out by crews of men and boys , where the coal was first removed by undercutting the coal seam manually with a pick , to a depth of about 3 ft .
The bulk of the coal was then broken down to this slot and the fragments ( ideally about 4 - inches in size ) were shoveled and hand - loaded into pit tubs , to be hauled away .
A good day 's work was about 20 tubs .
As the miners drove the tunnels ( also called entries , headings , drifts , drives etc ) into the coal they left pillars between the tunnels to hold the roof up .
However in about 1870 , and possibly in the Lancashire coalfield in the UK , they discovered that if they put these entries together , they could develop a way of getting all the coal out from that section ( or panel ) .
How could they get away with this ?
Well there are two things that make it possible .
Firstly , when you make a hole in the ground , the rock pressure that was applied to the rock ( about the same pressure as the depth of the hole ) has to move somewhere .
And it moves just a little so that the weight of the ground over the hole is carried by the rock on either side .
However , what happens if this additional load is too high for the rock and it fails ?
Well if the rock were just a thin column it would collapse , but if it were thicker , then the weight would just move further into the coal .
Now if we came along and moved the coal that had failed , then the hole would just continue to get bigger .
But if we leave the coal in place , then the broken coal acts to confine the coal further into the solid .
And this confinement gets higher , as the failing pressure continues to move into the wall .
And what happens is that this confinement builds up the strength of the coal , so that at some distance into the wall ( or face ) the coal strength reaches a point that it can carry the weight of the ground above the working area .
( For a simple analogy think of a deck of cards , which individually cannot bear weight , but when held together by a rubber band , or a carton , can support quite a bit of weight ) .
The second thing to know is that when a layer of rock breaks the rock lumps when piled together occupy more space than the solid rock .
As a rule - of - thumb the bulking is about 60 % .
So that if we let the roof over the working area break and collapse , after we have taken the coal out , then by the time about twice the seam height of rock has collapsed , it has filled the hole where the coal used to be , and reaches up to the solid layers of rock above , to hold them in place .
The confinement of the rock around each piece allows it to regain some strength , and so collectively the broken rock behind the working face ( called the goaf or waste ) will carry the weight of the ground from about twice the seam height , all the way to the surface , and with the other end of the " bridge " as it were resting on the confined coal ahead of the working face .
( While the width of this bridge varies with depth , coal and rock strength etc , for an initial estimate you can imagine it as being around 500 ft ) .
What this means is that the miner , working at the face , needs to support only the rock that is up about twice the seam height above his head ( in those days women did not do the actual mining ) .
And this could be done with relatively small tree limbs , called props .
However , because the rock could break into pieces , the prop support would be distributed , by having a plank , or half split timber , as a bar on top of the prop .
Putting one prop at each end thus gave a sort of " goal post " support .
Thus , along the face , there would be , at about 4 - 5 ft intervals , these prop supports holding the roof up .
( The coal is made slightly blue in the pictures to give a better contrast - sorry ! )
Now , to get the coal out it was possible to put in mechanical assistance .
The first step was to use a machine , rather like a large chain saw , that was pulled along the face , undercutting the coal , to give that first free surface .
At the same time holes were drilled along the face , about 6 ft apart , with a stick of dynamite in each one .
After the face was cut the coal was blasted down between shifts ( 7.5 hours ) then the collier shift would come in and each man would have about 10 yards of face to load the coal from , and to re-support .
To get the coal from the face , a rubber conveyor belt was run along the back end of the supports that were in place before the blast , and the coal would normally not break that far from the face .
As the miner shoveled he would also put in a new set of timbers , overlapping the old , and supporting the new working area .
Typically this would take another seven hours , with an ideal seam height being about 4.5 ft .
Above that the coal volume to move was much greater , and below that it got a bit awkward .
( For example , below 2 ft thick you lie on your back , with a prop under your shoulder and shovel over your head - how would I know ?
Yes , there was a reason to go to college ) .
In the third shift , the men would come in and break down and move over the conveyor belt , and then remove the last row of wooden supports , bringing the roof down , beyond the new line of supports .
[ Smart folk would use a come- along and a chain to pull down the props , young idiots ( guess who ) would go in with an axe to chop them first ] .
The process needed mechanization and this required three different components to work .
And these all came together in a period around 1960 - 65 .
Firstly there was a better way of removing the coal .
The machine that was developed initially took the coal cutter power pack , and turned it on its side .
By then putting a drum with picks on it , over the shaft to replace the cutter bar , the Anderton shearer was invented ( named after its inventor ) .
The drum rotated , and a shaped cover behind it moved the broken coal over onto the second part of the process .
This is a rigid framed conveyor , made up of segments that can move against one another , and with rigid metal walls .
The shearer can ride either on top of , or along side this conveyor , and load the coal onto it .
The conveyor then carries the coal to the end of the face , and onto a second conveyor , that carries the coal out of the panel .
It is the third part of the concept that makes the whole system viable , because we now add the powered roof support .
These are sets of hydraulic rams that ride on one plate of steel , pressing a second up against the roof .
They are connected to the conveyor by a horizontal ram .
The mining process is thus that first the shearer moves down the coal face , grinding off the coal to a depth of around 2 ft .
After it passes , the rams on the roof supports , in turn , are released , so that they drop away from roof contact .
The horizontal ram is retracted and the support moves forward until it contacts the conveyor .
It is then raised , and re-supports the roof .
Each support moves forward in turn , so that the miners ( who now include women ) are always under a roof of steel .
After the supports are re-established , the horizontal ram extends , pushing the conveyor over into the open space where the coal has just been mined .
The exposed roof rock then collapses into the open space behind the back of the supports .
If one were to look at the operation from above , and with the roof removed , it might look a little like this :
I have taken away some of the canopies of the shields so that you can see the conveyor snake after the shields move forward .
The view closer in shows the conveyor and supports better .
Because of the way the roof rock weight distributes , it is usual to drive entries out to the edge of the panel first , and then mine back to the main drive tunnels , rather than mining away from the mains .
In part this is to keep the excess weight from acting on the tunnels the miners travel through .
Because of the collapse of the roof as the coal is removed the panels usually start at the back of the section ( known as a panel ) and mine toward the main transport tunnel , with coal and people travelling in roadways on either side of the panel .
Initial stages of a longwall panel development , showing how the access tunnels from the main haulage are located .
Over time the ground movement works to the surface , and the surface of the ground will drop , by some significant percent of the height of the coal removed , since the rock in the waste will crush and consolidate .
This is called subsidence , and if the mining is carried out badly , then it can cause significant damage to surface buildings .
However , if done properly , it should not .
I will cite two examples of the latter .
Firstly in the height of mining and before North Sea Oil and Gas , Britain mined coal at a high rate of production , from where it was found .
This included under the city of Coventry , which was at the time home to large manufacturing plants , with precision lathes .
By back - filling behind the face props with the blown - in waste from the colliery treatment plant ( called stowing the goaf ) , the waste was filled , and the ground movement minimized to the point that I only heard of one factory being closed for less than a week to realign their lathes .
The second example was in Duisburg in Germany , and a different problem .
The town is a port on the Rhine , and over the centuries the river had eaten into the bed , so that the quays were becoming too high above the water for easy loading of the barges , and the town was losing business .
They went to the local coal company and asked them to mine out seams under the harbor , and thus to lower the quays to bring them back in reach of the water .
The miners complied , and lowered the area by over 11 ft .
The area that was mined included highway overpasses , and a Shell oil storage facility in the middle of the river .
The story goes that the tank farm manager went to the miners and asked them to tell him when they were going to start , so that he could drain the tanks as a precaution .
They pointed out that the farm had actually already been lowered about 3 ft , as I recall the story .
As usual this has been rather a superficial description of a process , but hopefully it gives you more of a sense as to what goes on in a longwall mining operation .
Additional comment :
It is possible to mine coal without using picks in a longwall , though it is a technology that has found much greater application in other industries , beyond mining .
Our thoughts and prayers go out to those in West Virginia at this time .
Fox refuses climate ad
Fox News last week refused to carry an advertisement from the liberal group VoteVets on the grounds that it was " too confusing , " a spokesman for the group said .
The ad , above , seeks to make the familiar case that climate legislation would have national security benefits by reducing the oil profits of hostile Middle Eastern states .
" Every day Congress does n't pass a clean energy climate plan our enemies get stronger , " says the ad , which focuses on Iran and presses Congress to pass a bill to " cut oil profits for hostlile nations . "
A Fox sales executive , Mike Mandelker , told the group 's ad buyer that the spot was too confusing , VoteVets spokesman Eric Schmeltzer said .
The ad is airing without objection on CNN and MSNBC .
Neither Mandelker nor Fox News spokeswoman Dana Klinghoffer responded to email inquiries about the decision .
Dan ( not his real name ) is a member of the US Marine Corps .
He 's based in Camp Foster , a military base near to Futenma , on Okinawa Island .
The Japanese military is pretty limited and the country has quite a peaceful mindset today .
In the US , every police officer has a gun .
Here , there 's one gun for a whole unit , and it's another one that has the pepper spray .
So I think we come in quite useful to them .
For example , we 're particularly watchful of what 's going on in North Korea .
It has to be said that Okinawa Island is a key spot for the US in the Pacific zone .
Closing bases here would mean moving 30,000 to 40,000 people ; it 's a big task ; not something you can do overnight .
But it 's true we do n't do much here .
We do daily training exercises and often go off to train in Australia , Thailand etc. , My work is mainly a computer job .
I went along to the demonstration and spoke to some of the locals .
They told me that what bothers them most is the noise of the fighter planes taking off and landing .
Another big issue , which I do understand , is that the base takes up a massive amount of space , leaving the town overcrowded .
The government talked about moving the base to Henoko in the north of the island , but the residents opposed the idea because the suggested spot was on the coast next to where dugongs live [ mammals related to the manatee whose population is decreasing ] .
On the whole , the island is divided about the base .
Some say that for economic reasons it 's better that we stay because we bring a lot of money to the area [ 40,000 Americans - soldiers and their families - live on the island ] .
But others want us to go because they think we 're monsters .
It 's true that a few of us have done some stupid things [ Close the Base has a list of accidents and criminals cases on its website ] .
There are some who think we 're all drunks who go around stabbing taxi drivers .
But the ones who do are a minority .
I walk around outside the base every day and I 've never met anyway who 's told me to ‘ go home ' .
The press reported that tens of thousands of people came to demonstrate on May 1 , but I do n't think there were any more than six or seven thousand . "
In the first tutorial for Cascalog , I showed off many of Cascalog 's powerful features : joins , aggregates , subqueries , custom operations , and more .
Since Cascalog 's release a couple weeks ago , I 've added a number of new features to Cascalog that seriously increase the expressiveness and performance of the language without compromising its simplicity or flexibility .
Like the first tutorial , go ahead and load up the playground by issuing the following commands :
lein compile - java && lein compile
lein repl
user= > ( use ' cascalog.playground ) ( bootstrap )
Outer joins
As we saw in the first tutorial , you can join together multiple sources of data in Cascalog by using the same variable name in multiple sources of data .
For example , given " age " and " gender " sources , we can get the age and gender for each person by running :
user= > (?<- ( stdout ) [? person ?age ? gender ]
( age ? person ?age ) ( gender ? person ? gender ) )
This is an inner join .
We will only have results for people that appear in both sets of data .
We can do a full outer join by running :
user= > (?<- ( stdout ) [? person !! age !! gender ]
( age ? person !!age ) ( gender ? person !! gender ) )
The results of this query will have null values for people with nonexistent ages or genders .
Cascalog 's outer joins are triggered by variables that begin with " !! " .
These variables are called " ungrounding variables " .
A predicate that contains an ungrounding variable is called an " unground predicate " , and a predicate that does not contain an ungrounding variable is called a " ground predicate " .
Joining together two unground predicates results in a full outer join , while joining a ground predicate to an unground predicate results in a left join .
Here 's an example of a left join .
To get all the follow relationships for each person in our dataset , or null if the person has no follow relationships , we run :
user= > (?<- ( stdout ) [? person1 !!person2 ]
( person ?person1 ) ( follows ?person1 !!person2 ) )
To get all the people who do not have a follows relationship , we can run :
user= > (?<- ( stdout ) [? person ]
( person ? person ) ( follows ? person !!
p2 ) ( nil ? !! p2 ) )
Notice that the ( nil ? !!
p2 ) predicate gets applied after !!
p2 gets joined to a ground predicate .
This is an important part of the semantics of outer joins in Cascalog .
Now let 's say we want the follows count for each person .
A normal " count " aggregation wo n't work because it counts the number of tuples and does n't distinguish between null and non-null follows .
In this case , we want null follows to be counted as 0 and non-null follows to be counted as 1 .
Cascalog has an aggregator called " ! count " that does exactly this :
user= > (?<- ( stdout ) [? person ?count ]
( person ? person ) ( follows ? person !!
p2 ) ( c/!count !!p2 :> ? count ) )
People that do n't have a follows relationship will have a count of 0 .
An ungrounding variable may only appear within a query one time .
Other than that , ungrounding variables behave just like regular variables .
Combiners and " Parallel Aggregators "
A regular aggregator transfers all tuples for a group to a single machine and computes the aggregation in a single pass over the data .
However , there are many aggregations , such as count , sum , min , and max , that can be computed in parallel .
For example , to compute " sum " , you can split the tuples into subsets , compute the sum of each subset , and then sum the sums together to get your final answer .
There are many other aggregators that can be computed this way , such as min , max , and count .
Cascalog now allows you to define " parallel aggregators " that compute as much as possible during the map phase before finishing the computation in the reducer .
These map side aggregations are called " combiners " .
Cascalog is even able to insert combiners when you use multiple parallel aggregators , such as both a count and a sum .
For example , the following query will make use of combiners :
user= > (?<- ( stdout ) [? count ?sum ]
( integer ?n ) ( c/sum ?n :> ?sum ) ( c / count ? count ) )
Cascalog automatically inserts combiners when possible - you do n't have to do anything to take advantage of the optimization .
If you try to use a parallel aggregator with a regular aggregator defined using defaggregateop or defbufferop , Cascalog will be unable to insert combiners and all the aggregation will happen in the reduce task .
For example , the next query that makes use of a custom aggregator will do all the aggregation in the reduce phase :
user= > ( defaggregateop product
( [ ] 1 )
( [ total val ] ( * total val ) )
( [ total ] [ total ] ) )
user= > (?<- ( stdout ) [? prod ? count ]
( integer ?n ) ( product ?n :> ? prod ) ( c/ count ? count ) )
Parallel aggregators can be defined using the defparallelagg function .
Examples can be found in cascalog.ops .
You 'll see a massive speed boost due to this feature for aggregations that operate on very few groups , such as global counts .
Implicit equality constraints
The " implicit equality constraints " feature is a neat way to specify equality constraints .
This feature is best explained by example .
The playground defines a source called " integer " that defines a set of numbers .
If we want all the numbers that equal themselves when squared , we can run :
user= > (?<- ( stdout ) [?n ] ( integer ?n ) (* ?n ?n :> ?n ) )
Cascalog detects that we are trying to rebind the ?n variable and will automatically filter out tuples where the output of the * predicate is not equal to the input .
There are other cases where you can make use of this feature .
To find all the pairs of numbers in the " num - pair " source where both numbers are the same , we run :
user= > (?<- ( stdout ) [?n ] ( num -pair ?n ?n ) )
If you want to know all pairs where the second number is two times the first number :
user= > (?<- ( stdout ) [?n1 ? n2 ]
( num - pair ?n1 ? n2 ) (* 2 ?n1 :> ? n2 ) )
There 's not much more to say about this feature , it should be intuitive to use .
Sorting
By default , aggregators receive tuples in some arbitrary order .
Cascalog now has " : sort " and " : reverse " predicates that let you control the order in which tuples arrive at an aggregator .
For example , let 's find the youngest person each person follows :
user= > ( defbufferop first - tuple [ tuples ] ( take 1 tuples ) )
user= > (?<- ( stdout ) [? person ? youngest ] ( follows ? person ?
p2 )
( age ? p2 ?age ) ( : sort ?age ) ( first - tuple ? p2 :> ? youngest ) )
To find the oldest person each person follows , we simply add a : reverse predicate :
user= > (?<- ( stdout ) [? person ? youngest ] ( follows ? person ?
p2 )
( age ? p2 ?age ) ( : sort ?age ) ( : reverse true )
( first - tuple ? p2 :> ? youngest ) )
Duplicate elimination
If your query does n't have any aggregators , Cascalog will by default insert a reduce step to remove all duplicate tuples from your output .
You can now control that behavior with the : distinct predicate .
Compare the following two queries :
user= > (?<- ( stdout ) [?a ] ( age _ ? a ) )
user= > (?<- ( stdout ) [?a ] ( age _ ? a ) ( : distinct false ) )
The second query will have duplicates in the output .
One use case for this functionality is making a subquery that does some pre-processing on an input source .
Conclusion
In my next post , I 'll show an end to end example of running Cascalog queries on a Hadoop cluster on real data .

The head of Kyrgyzstan 's new interim government yesterday revealed that her country was broke and said that the former president who was overthrown in a street - led revolution this week had left only $ 80 m in the budget .
In an interview with the Guardian , Roza Otunbayeva appealed for urgent international aid so that the impoverished Central Asian nation could meet its immediate bills .
" Tomorrow we should pay pensions .
This is a really serious problem , " she said .
Otunbayeva said that the ousted president Kurmanbek Bakiyev had plundered the economy , installing his sons in key government positions and flogging off strategic state industries for a fraction of their true value .
She said the country 's leading telecoms firm had been sold to an offshore company in the Canary Islands , belonging to a friend of the president 's son Maxim .
" We had an absolutely scandalous situation where Kyrgyzstan had become a family - run regime , " she said .
Otunbayeva , a former foreign minister , said popular anger against the president and his relatives exploded after he imposed new tariffs on 1 January on electricity and hot water .
She said the revolt started in the freezing mountain town of Talas in early March , then spread across the country .
On Wednesday elite police shot dead at least 76 people and injured 1,450 , when protesters tried to seize the main government building in the capital Bishkek .
Bakiyev– who fled to Jalal - Abad near the Tajik border – now had to answer for his crimes , she said .
" We guarantee him only his physical safety , " she made clear , ruling out any negotiations .
Otunbayeva , who served in London as Kyrgyzstan 's ambassador between 1997 - 2002 , said her new opposition - led government would allow the US to continue using the Manas airbase , near Bishkek , a vital supply post for the US military moving in and out of nearby Afghanistan .
" We will respect our existing commitments , " she said , adding she had n't seen the contract .
The base is a source of tension with Russia , which regards Central Asia as its backyard , and would like the Americans to leave .
Bakiyev fell out with the Kremlin last year after promising to evict the US from Manas in return for large loans , only to renege on the deal when the Obama administration offered to substantially up the rent .
Otunbayeva , however , hinted that the new government sees Russia as its most important strategic partner .
She said she had sent her deputy Almazbek Atambayev to Moscow to hold talks with Vladimir Putin , and to discuss economic aid .
" I had a talk with Mr Putin .
He was very keen to learn what was going on in Kyrgyzstan and whether we had control in the south , " she said .
She denied that the Russians had instigated Wednesday 's uprising .
Putin has quickly recognised the new regime .
" I met with the Russian ambassador two or three weeks before the revolution but I also met with the US , EU and Chinese ambassadors too , " she said .
The US also dismissed rumours of Russian plotting .
Michael McFaul , Obama 's senior director for Russian affairs , said : " The people that are allegedly running Kyrgyzstan ... these are all people we 've had contact with for many years , " McFaul said .
" This is not some anti-American coup , that we know for sure .
And this is not some sponsored - by - the - Russians coup , there 's just no evidence of that . "
The interim government was taking advice from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe over the drafting of a new constitution , she said .
It plans to hold elections in six months , and will probably replace the old presidential system with an European - style parliamentary democracy , she added .
Otunbayeva served for a year as Bakiyev 's foreign minister before quitting in disgust .
The events of the last week had seen history repeat itself , she said : " We 've had a very sad lesson in democracy learning .
If people are not respected , if they are totally depressed , then one day they will explode and rise up .
Unfortunately I have seen this for a second time with my own eyes . "
Yesterday mourners gathered in central Bishkek and at funerals around the city for the victims , many of them enraged by the actions of the security forces , who had fought running battles with armed protesters .
Cheers to Islanders 2009 sleeper pick Anders Lee , who won the USHL playoff MVP .
His reaction at the official site :
" It was a reflection of my teammates ... "
That response is no surprise if you remember the Lighthouse Hockey interview with Lee from earlier this season .
He gives the impression of a very level - headed kid .
The fact that there even was a fifth and decisive game was a near miracle and the comeback kids did not disappoint before the franchise record crowd and the largest to ever witness a Clark Cup finals game .
The Gamblers dropped the first two games of the championship series at the Resch , 2 - 0 and 4 - 1 and were trailing in game three in Fargo by a goal with under a minute to play .
With :49 left in regulation , Anders Lee tallied to force overtime and Green Bay won in the third extra session .
>>
Mark Waselchuk , Examiner
The Gamblers won on home ice , overcoming a 2 - 0 series deficit by taking back two games on the road .
Lee scored the tying goal in the final game .
His 31-35 - 66 line during the regular season was the 10th - highest point total in the league , including nine game - winning goals .
The 152nd overall pick last summer heads to Notre Dame in the fall .
Here 's local coverage -- thanks to BCISLEMAN's FanShot :
Well , this is awesome news for Cablevision , Time Warner and Comcast customers .
If you live in the NY / NJ / CT area , the three companies have just announced a Wi-Fi roaming agreement that opens all of their Wi-Fi networks to each other 's customers .
Advertisement
That means that if you 're a Cablevision customer and are in an area where Time Warner has a hotspot , you can jump on it .
And the authentication for this deal already kicked in today , so if you 're out and about , you can take advantage right now .
Man , I almost do n't even know how to write a post about cable providers actually doing something that is 100 % beneficial for their customers and does n't somehow screw them over , let alone three of the big guys at the same time .
I 'm ... scared .
Somebody hold me .

The LA boycott could affect up to $ 8 m in business with Arizona The Los Angeles city council has voted to boycott Arizona businesses in one of the strongest moves yet against the state 's new immigration law .
Council members agreed to bar official travel to Arizona and avoid new city contracts with state firms .
Last month , Arizona passed a law requiring police to check the immigration status of people suspected of being in the US illegally .
Opponents have rallied against the law , saying it encourages racial profiling .
Several cities have enacted resolutions condemning the law and tens of thousands of people across the US have joined protests against it .
Travel ban
The Los Angeles legislation now goes to the city 's mayor , who has pledged to sign it .
It could affect up to $ 8 m in city contracts and travel .
LA is the second - largest city in the US , and 39 % of its population is foreign born .
" As an American , I can not go to Arizona today without a passport , " Los Angeles Councilman Ed Reyes , one of the resolution 's sponsors , was quoted as saying by the LA Times newspaper .
Among other measures , the LA bill would bar most official city travel to Arizona and direct city departments to avoid signing new contracts with Arizona businesses .
Its cost to Arizona is unclear , although a co-sponsor of the measure estimated it would affect $ 7 m to $ 8 m in city contracts .
A spokesman for Republican Arizona Governor Jan Brewer called the boycott " thoughtless and harmful " .
" It also appears that the Los Angeles city council appears hopelessly out of touch with most of America on this issue , " spokesman Paul Senseman said in a statement .
' Reasonable suspicion '
The Republican - controlled Arizona legislature approved the controversial law last month after declaring Washington had failed to curb illegal immigration .
The Arizona law requires police officers to question people they stop for a " legitimate reason " about their immigration status if the officers have " reasonable suspicion " the person is in the US illegally .
It takes effect on 29 July .
Opponents of the Arizona law say it will encourage racial profiling of Hispanics , who make up three - quarters of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the US .
Several cities across the country have denounced the measure .
A non-binding resolution approved on Tuesday by San Francisco city supervisors asks sports leagues not to hold championship games or tournaments in Arizona ..

Ted , a friend , had a question about Cuba : “ What about that hunger striker who died in prison there . ”
He did n’t know Orlando Zapata was a criminal of the usual type , who had prolonged his jail time by defying rules .
He was no political prisoner .
His medical care included surgical removal of a brain tumor .
Ted did n’t know that Cuba ’s enemies had mounted a vicious , worldwide media campaign encouraging the hunger strike , one that afterwards painted his death as a human rights violation .
Nor did he know about 2,000 murder victims found late last year in a common grave in Colombia , killed and buried by the U.S. supported Colombian Army .
In March someone assassinated labor activist Jhonny Hurtado , weeks after he showed the grave to a visiting British delegation .
His was the seventh unionist murder since January .
Had the Cuban Army acted likewise , had a Cuban done the fingering , U.S. and European opinion shapers could have called upon massive reserves of venom .
Ted did n’t know that many so - called prisoners of conscience in Cuban jails were actually make - believe journalists , working for a handout .
At their trials in 2003 , video evidence showed almost 75 of them taking money and goods from U.S. officials in Havana .
He did n’t know that in 1996 the Helms Burton Law authorized U. S. funding of an internal Cuban opposition .
Cuba responded by passing laws identifying foreign mercenaries as criminals .
That ’s what sovereign nations do .
He does n’t know that U.S. government money still flows to Cuba , mostly by way of Miami .
The amounts dispensed rose from $ 3.5 million in 2000 to $ 20 - 25 million annually in recent years .
A recent State Department “ Congressional Notification ” suggests the intended purposes of money to be to be dispensed this year : http://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/Library/resources/documents/Cuba/cuban-triangle/economicsupportfunds.pdf).
In 2006 , investigations showed a lot of the money getting stuck in Miami rather than being sent on to Cuba .
CIA money headed for Cuba is not a matter of public record .
Jose Pertierra , Venezuela ’s lawyer in Washington , recently outlined where the money went this year .
The rundown includes : $ 750,000 “ to promote human rights , ” $ 250,000 for prisoners ’ families , $ 500,000 for prisoner liberation , $ 900,000 for artists , musicians , and bloggers via Freedom House , $ 500,000 to change Cuban labor policy , $ 500,000 towards religions practice by individuals , $ 2,000,000 for individual economic initiatives , $ 2,900,000 so the State Department can promote “ free expression , ” $ 2,500,000 so Creative Associates can widen change - oriented “ social networks , ” $ 400,000 so the Institute for Sustainable Communities can “ identify the new leaders , ” and $ 2,600,000 so Development Associates Inc can “ widen the support network . ”
Ted worries about the “ Ladies in White . ”
Cuban police , he said , beat up wives and mothers of jailed Cuban prisoners demonstrating on their behalf .
In fact , female police officers ushered them into vans and took them home , protecting them from young counter - demonstrators .
And the Ladies too are on the take .
He did n’t know their benefactor is Santiago Álvarez in Miami , that in 2008 Michael Parmly , head of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana , served as courier .
He did n’t know Santiago Álvarez sent arms to Cuba , masterminded bomb attacks , and plotted to kill former Cuban President Fidel Castro .
Álvarez is paymaster and protector of Luis Posada , wanted in Venezuela for having a bomb exploded on a Cuban airliner in 1976 , killing 73 people
He does n’t know why hyperbolized media accusations on human rights offend Cuba , especially when as in late March they arrived coupled with photos of Posada joining a demonstration in Miami for the Ladies in White .
Those accusations flourished earlier as five Cuban men were being railroaded to prison in Florida for defending their country against terrorism .
They are the Cuban Five .
Advice to Cuba on the rights of prisoners and their family members has a hollow ring . .
For over a decade , U.S. authorities have prevented two Cuban women , Adriana Pérez and Olga Salenueva , from visiting their husbands in U.S. jails , two of the Cuban Five .
U.S. pontification on human rights gains little mileage in Cuba .
Repeatedly commentary there returns to U.S. coups and violent repression in Latin America , civilians victimized in U.S. wars with Japan , Korea , Vietnam , and Iraq , and terrible prisoner abuse recently .
For “ a country blockaded , besieged and attacked by the United States , ” vilification comes naturally , says Jose Pertierra , who explains , “ Washington cannot tolerate the island being governed outside the scope of U.S. tutelage .
It has been this way for more than fifty years . ”

The US wants Toyota to pay a record fine - it has two weeks to appeal The US transport department is asking Toyota to pay a record fine of $ 16.4 m ( £ 10.7 m ) for holding back information about faulty accelerator pedals .
The department says the company failed to notify it about the flaws " in a timely way " .
The National Highways Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) said documents provided by Toyota showed the carmaker knew about the defect in September .
Reports of problems with the pedals prompted a massive recall in January .
Toyota has two weeks to appeal against this penalty .
Safety role A statement on Toyota 's website said it had not yet received a letter on the matter from the NHTSA .
The statement went on to say : " We have already taken a number of important steps to improve our communications with regulators and customers on safety - related matters as part of our strengthened overall commitment to quality assurance .
" These include the appointment of a new Chief Quality Officer for North America and a greater role for the region in making safety - related decisions . "
The January recall was one of three the Japanese car company has been forced to make - others related to floor pedals that stuck in mats and braking issues .
Toyota ended up recalling 2.3 million vehicles in the US over this fault - as part of a total of more than eight million vehicles recalled worldwide relating to the three faults .
Further investigations
The NHTSA said Toyota issued repair procedures in late September to distributors in Europe and Canada to deal with complaints of sticking pedals but did not report the problem to it .
The country 's Transportation Secretary , Ray LaHood , said in a statement : " We now have proof that Toyota failed to live up to its legal obligations . "
He added : " Worse yet , they knowingly hid a dangerous defect for months from US officials and did not take action to protect millions of drivers and their families . "
US safety regulators are still examining whether Toyota has committed other violations .
Toyota is in the process of fixing the fault by either replacing the pedal completely or by adding in a metal " shim " .
Latest figures from the US showed the carmaker 's sales bounced back in March - with hefty discounts helping to win back customers who had been shaken by the firm 's mass safety recalls .

Hello .
My name is Jaded Lostie .
You killed Sun and Jin. Prepare to die .
The LOST writers , led by Damon and Carlton , have consistently proven themselves to be murderers of love .
What they did to Sun and Jin in “ The Candidate ” was the last straw .
It still hurts .
Enjoy !
T- Virus ( Resident Evil Shot )
Ingredients :
¾ shot Silver Rum
¼ shot Everclear
1 Blue Twizzler
Directions :
Wind a blue Twizzler around a tall double shot glass .
It should stick to the sides of the glass .
Pour in the silver rum and top with the Everclear .
Drink , then eat the Twizzler for a sweet and tangy aftertaste .
You will have to fish out the Twizzler with your finger after you drink , as it will still be stuck to the side of the shot glass .
If you get infected with the T - Virus , do n’t worry .
Just take the T - Virus Antidote !
This is part of a series of Resident Evil drinks I ’ve been making .
More to come !

Despite recent changes to its personal privacy settings interface , Facebook is still under fire for past privacy - related mistakes .
This time , the U.S. House Judiciary Committee is getting involved .
In a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday , committee chair John Conyers ( pictured right ) wrote , " We would appreciate a detailed explanation of the information about Facebook users that your company has provided to third parties without the knowledge of the account holders — particularly in circumstances in which the users did not expressly opt for this kind of information sharing . "
The letter goes on to request an explanation of prior policies as well as details on how Facebook 's recent round of changes have altered these policies .
This is n't the first time Facebook has come up in a negative light in Washington .
About one month ago , Sentaor Charles Schumer asked the FTC to investigate Facebook 's newer features built around the Open Graph API .
The FTC has been reviewing Facebook 's privacy policies and those of other social networks , as well .
And just last week , Facebook 's D.C. office staged a special briefing for Congress staffers to explain the company 's response to the general privacy - issues - induced outcry from advocacy groups and users .
Apparently , the explanation given was n't satisfactory .
Conyers , a Michigan Democrat , has n't stated outright that Facebook will face a full - on investigation from the Judiciary Committee ; however , this initial letter is a telling signal of Washington 's growing interest in the social network .
Do you think the House Committee will — or should — investigate how Facebook treats user data with regard to third - party sites ?
Do you think Facebook 's recent changes will get the company off the hook where the U.S. government is concerned ?

PARIS / ATHENS ( Reuters ) -
In a bizarre twist to the Greek debt crisis , France and Germany are pressing Greece to buy their gunboats and warplanes , even as they urge it to cut public spending and curb its deficit .

REUTERS / Handout
Indeed , some Greek officials privately say Paris and Berlin are using the crisis as leverage to advance arms contracts or settle payment disputes , just when the Greeks are trying to reduce defense spending .
“ No one is saying ‘ Buy our warships or we wo n’t bail you out ’ , but the clear implication is that they will be more supportive if we do what they want on the armaments front , ” said an adviser to Prime Minister George Papandreou , speaking on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivity .
Greece spends more of its gross domestic product on the military than any other European Union country , largely due to long - standing tension with its neighbor , historic rival and NATO ally , Turkey .
“ The Germans and the French have them over a barrel now , ” said Nick Witney , a former head of the European Defense Agency .
“ If you are trying to repair Greek public finances , it ’s a ludicrous way to go about things . ”
France is pushing to sell six frigates , 15 helicopters and up to 40 top - of - the - range Rafale fighter aircraft .
Greek and French officials said President Nicolas Sarkozy was personally involved and had broached the matter when Papandreou visited France last month to seek support in the financial crisis .
FRIGATE PURCHASE
The Greeks were so sensitive to Sarkozy ’s concerns that they announced on the day Papandreou went to Paris that they would go ahead with buying six Fremm frigates worth 2.5 billion euros ( $ 3.38 billion ) , despite their budget woes .
The ships are made by the state - controlled shipyard DCNS , which is a quarter owned by defense electronics group Thales TCFP .
PA and may have to lay workers off in the downturn .
Greece is also in talks buy 15 French Super Puma search - and - rescue helicopters made by aerospace giant EADS EAD .
PA for an estimated 400 million euros .
The Rafale , made by Dassault Aviation AVMD .PA , is a more distant and vastly dearer prospect .
There is no published price , but each costs over $ 100 million , plus weapons .
Germany is meanwhile pressing Athens to pay for a diesel - electric submarine from ThyssenKrupp TKAG.DE , of which it refused to take delivery in 2006 because the craft listed during sea trials following a disputed refurbishment in Kiel .
Payment would clear the way for ThyssenKrupp to sell its loss - making Greek unit Hellenic Shipyards ( HSY ) , the biggest shipbuilder in the eastern Mediterranean , to Abu Dhabi MAR ( ADM ) , industry sources said .
ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems last year canceled a Greek order for four other submarines over the dispute , in which it said Athens ’ arrears exceeded 520 million euros .
Witney , now at the European Council on Foreign Relations , said German officials were embittered by Greek behavior in the long - running dispute , as well as previous payment problems over the purchase of German Leopard II tanks .
Greek Deputy Defense Minister Panos Beglitis told Reuters the dispute was on the brink of settlement but denied the timing had anything to do with Athens ’ bid to clinch German backing this week for a financial safety net for Greek debt .
“ ( The submarine ) Papanicolis has been carefully inspected by German and Greek experts .
It has been greatly improved and declared seaworthy .
We will take it , sell it and make a profit , ” he said in an interview .
“ We are paying 300 million ( euros ) and we will sell it for 350 million , ” Beglitis said .
Witney questioned Greece ’s chances of turning a profit on a second - hand submarine .
NO LINKAGE ?
Asked whether big European suppliers were using the crisis to press arms sales on Athens , he said : “ This has always been the case with these countries .
It is not because of the crisis , there is no link . ”
Beglitis said this year ’s defense budget was set at 2.8 percent of GDP , down from 3.1 percent in 2009 .
Non -government sources say the real level of military spending may be higher .
“ Our strategy is continuously and steadily to reduce spending .
This is also in line with the Greek stability and growth program , ” Beglitis said .
The program , submitted to the EU , pledges to reduce the budget deficit from 12.9 percent last year to below 3 percent by the end of 2012 .
Western officials and economists have advocated a radical reduction of the armed forces as a long - term way of reducing structural spending , but Greek officials say that would require a real improvement in relations with Turkey .
Despite warmer ties , the two countries remain in dispute over Cyprus and maritime boundaries and have sporadic aerial incidents over the Aegean Sea .
French economist Jacques Delpla said Greece could reap big savings if it moved jointly with Turkey and Cyprus to settle disputes in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean and engaged in mutual disarmament .
“ Unlike Portugal or Ireland , Greece could benefit from significant peace dividends to reduce its titanic fiscal deficits , ” he said .
Beglitis said Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan had mooted the idea of mutual defense spending cuts in public but not followed it up .
“ There was some rhetoric from Mr Erdogan on this but there are no negotiations at the moment , ” he said .
Ash from a volcano eruption in Iceland has prompted aviation officials to restrict flights over parts of Norway and the United Kingdom .
Norway 's aviation authority AVINOR closed roughly the northern half of the country 's airspace on Wednesday evening , from Trondheim to the north .
And U.K. air traffic control provider NATS said early Thursday it was restricting flights in northern Scotland .
NATS warned the ash cloud is expected to move south , hinting that the flight - restriction zone could expand .
Some Norwegian flights were canceled or delayed because of the airspace closure , according to information from AVINOR 's Web site .
The ash cloud came from an eruption of a volcano beneath Iceland 's Eyjafjallajokull glacier early Wednesday .
The eruption - the latest in a series that began on March 20 - blew a hole in the mass of ice .
In her quest to win the Republican nomination for California 's Senate race against Barbara Boxer , Carly Fiorina picked up what used to be an important endorsement : that of failed Vice - Presidential candidate and half - term Gubernatorial quitter Sarah Palin .
Needless to say , it backfired - - on both of them .
Even though conservatism and failure are usually synonymous and Carly 's track record of failure is comprehensive and well - documented , she certainly does n't have the strongest conservative credentials in the Republican primary .
That distinction arguably belongs to tea party favorite Chuck Devore .
So when Sarah Palin announced the endorsement , her base was devastated :
Though a handful of readers agreed with Palin 's decision , most were upset .
" This is very , very disappointing , " Rick Sheridan , one of her supporters , posted on Palin 's page .
" Sarah , you 've got to be more careful .
This woman does not represent conservative values .
And the choice is so clear .
Serious damage to your base here . "
" Wow , Sarah ... I 'm saddened and shocked by your decision to endorse Carly Fiorina , " commented another backer , Jennifer Goode .
" Had you done your research , you would have found that Chuck DeVore is the ONLY true conservative in the California Senate race . "
But it gets more interesting .
Because of the outcry , Palin has been forced to put up an addendum to her Facebook note justifying the endorsement .
In that update , there 's a curious little nugget :
Carly is also a strong supporter of the Second Amendment .
Like me , she is a member of the NRA , has a 100 % NRA rating , and she and her husband are gun owners .
She is pro-energy development and believes as I do in an all - of - the - above approach to energy independence .
She is against cap and tax .
Two things are worth pointing out here .
One : Carly Fiorina has never held elected office , so she has never cast a single vote on a piece of legislation .
( She has n't spent much time voting for anything , actually . )
So how could she have a 100 % record on anything ?
In addition , a brief check of the NRA 's Political Victory Fund seems to indicate that if the NRA has graded 2010 primary candidates in California , it 's certainly not public yet .
And regarding " cap and tax " -- Fiorina just happened to be a big supporter of cap - and - trade back when Sarah Palin 's running mate was supporting the idea .
So , it 's hard to know where Palin gets her notions about Fiorina 's positions , unless she has been secretly graded by the NRA and has had an epiphany recently .
Here 's hoping Sarah Palin qualifies her defense of her endorsement .
I 'll be here making popcorn .
Lessons from the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit vote
Here are some things that happened on the night the GOP pushed the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit through the House of Representatives :
A 15 - minute vote was scheduled , and at the end of 15 minutes , the Democrats had won .
The Republican leadership froze the clock for three hours while they desperately whipped defectors .
This had never been done before .
The closest was a 15 - minute extension in 1987 that then - congressman Dick Cheney called “ the most arrogant , heavy - handed abuse of power I ’ve ever seen in the 10 years that I ’ve been here . ”
Tom DeLay bribed Rep. Nick Smith to vote for the legislation , using the political future of Smith 's son for leverage .
DeLay was later reprimanded by the House Ethics Committee .
The leadership told Rep. Jim DeMint that they would cut off funding for his Senate race in South Carolina if he did n't vote for the bill .
The chief actuary of Medicare , Rick Foster , had scored the legislation as costing more than $ 500 billion .
The Bush administration suppressed his report , in a move the Government Accounting Office later judged " illegal . ”
Rep. Jo Ann Emerson , a " no " vote , spent the night " hiding on the Democratic side of the floor , crouching down to avoid eye contact with the Republican search team . "
Rep. Butch Otter , who provided one of the final votes after hours of arm - twisting from the Republican leadership , said , “ I thought there was a chance I would get sick on the floor . ”
Remember all this ?
Probably not .
There was n't much reporting on it at the time .
It was n't a major controversy , despite resulting in multiple official investigations .
I went back through the archives of National Review 's “ The Corner ” to see if they covered the scandal .
Not really .
There are four or five posts on it , and the most substantive is Ramesh Ponnuru telling some columnist that " it 's silly to act as though holding a vote open for a long time is an act of lawbreaking . "
They 're considerably more exercised about the use of reconciliation today .
Obama is " shoving health care down the throats of the American people in the teeth of overwhelming public opposition and any sense of parliamentary decency , " writes Mark Steyn , and I think he means " without " any sense of parliamentary decency .
But the point is n't to claim hypocrisy , as I think charges of hypocrisy are boring .
First , it 's to note that the health - care reform process has been a model of transparency and parliamentary decency in comparison to the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit process ( no actuaries have been intimidated into silence , for instance ) ; second , to note that Americans do n't really care about process , and people forget about even serious abuses of legislative power ; and third , to suggest that Republicans are a whole lot better at making controversies out of their opponents ’ behavior than Democrats are .
Whatever you think of the process that resulted in the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit , the bill today is settled , and even popular , law .
The abuses that ushered it into existence are mostly forgotten .
Democrats spoke of its repeal in the months after its passage but are now strengthening it in the health - care reform bill .
Republicans , meanwhile , were so confounded by Medicare 's popularity that they authored and passed a massive expansion of the entitlement state .
Democrats , who are currently trying to pass health - care reform in a way that does n't break congressional rules but does upset some Republicans , should take note .
US to start profiling as part of air security checks
The rules apply to all travellers heading to the United States The US has announced that it will begin profiling US - bound passengers to determine who should get extra screening .
The measures will replace mandatory enhanced screening of all travellers from 14 nations , brought in after the failed attack on a flight in December .
Travellers will be picked out according to how closely they match intelligence on potential terrorist threats .
The new strategy results from a review ordered by President Barack Obama .
' Intelligence - led ' Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the new measures would use " real - time , threat - based intelligence along with multiple , random layers of security , both seen and unseen , to more effectively mitigate evolving terrorist threats " .
The US began notifying air carriers on Thursday and the new protocols are being implemented immediately , a senior administration official told the BBC .
The New York Times says the new strategy will more precisely target those individuals about whom security officials have concerns .
" This is not a system that can be called profiling in the traditional sense .
It is intelligence - based , " the newspaper quoted an official as saying .
Passengers were told to expect increased use of explosives trace detection , advanced imaging technology , sniffer dogs and pat downs .
The measures will apply to US citizens , as well as foreigners travelling to America .
Congressman Peter King , the top Republican on the homeland security oversight committee , said making better use of intelligence was " a step forward " .
' No fly ' list The US government currently has a 6,000 - name " no fly " list of suspected terrorists , who are banned from flights to or within US territory .
This will be supplemented by cross-referenced information that may see passengers subject to further screening even if their names are not flagged , the Wall Street Journal reported .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The screening will take into account characteristics like nationality , age , recently visited countries and partial names , the newspaper said .
While the US does not have the authority to screen passengers in foreign airports , it can sanction air carriers if they do not agree to follow US guidelines for international aviation security .
A 23 - year - old Nigerian man - Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab - has been charged with attempting to destroy a plane after he allegedly tried to detonate a bomb on a passenger jet arriving in the US on 25 December 2009 .
He was overpowered by passengers and crew shortly before the Northwest Airlines plane landed in Detroit from Amsterdam .
In the wake of that incident new rules were brought in requiring extra screening for passengers from , or travelling through , Afghanistan , Algeria , Cuba , Iran , Iraq , Lebanon , Libya , Nigeria , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen .
The BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington says those hastily - imposed rules will now be replaced .
The specifics of these new measures remain mysterious , but they may involve elements like analysing an individual 's travel record and matching it against current intelligence , all before that individual boards a plane .
Reportedly the US government will give more information to airlines and foreign security staff to use at check - in , and officials said passengers flying to the US might notice more random screening , more checks for traces of explosives and more use of advanced imaging technology .

Lower the number of extensions and install only the most useful ones .

Here 's President Obama 's nominee for the Supreme Court , Solicitor General Elena Kagan ( left ) -- and former " King of Queens " star Kevin James ( right ) .
One of them is about to be probed by the Republican party .
The Roman Empire was vast at its peak and its influence is still felt today in our forms of military , government , and society in general .
Ruled over for a time by emperors , the Empire had periods of greatness and periods of decline .
This list looks at ten of the emperors who have left their mark on history for being so dreadful .
10 Domitian
The Apocalypse of Saint John is believed to have been written during Domitian ’s reign at the end of the First Century .
Domitian was a staunch advocate for the Roman gods and goddesses , the worship of whom had fallen out of practice by the time of his rise to power .
Eusebius of Caesarea , writing 300 years later , recounts that the first large - scale Christian and Jewish persecution began during Domitian ’s reign .
There is no non-Christian history of such activities , but Domitian is known to have been tyrannically opposed to all other religions other than Roman .
Like so many other emperors , Domitian dealt with dissent among his close advisors and friends by means of death .
He executed a few too many prominent politicians and wealthy citizens , and the straw that broke the camel ’s back was his murder of his secretary , Epaproditus .
A man named Stephanus , and several others , conspired to kill him , with Stephanus pretending to be wounded for several days , so he could conceal a dagger under his bandages .
He approached Domitian in his bedroom , and stabbed him in the groin , whereupon the emperor was beset by several men , one of which was a fearsome gladiator , who all stabbed him to death .
9 Septimius Severus
There is no doubt that Christians and Jews were persecuted severely during Severus ’s reign .
He believed in a draconian interpretation of Roman law , which did not tolerate any religion but the Roman one .
He did not seek out any particular religious culture , but simply persecuted all of the foreign ones .
Christians and Jews were the most common , and up to 1,000 to 3,000 were executed , after being given the option of cursing Jesus or Yahweh , or being beheaded or crucified .
He had absolutely no respect of care for anyone except his army , since they were the ones who could rise up and depose him .
He managed to stabilize the Empire through draconian fear , but this stability did not last long , once his son , # 4 , took the throne .
8 Maximinus Thrax
He was , by all accounts , a huge man , well over 6 feet tall , perhaps 7 feet or more .
He has been blamed as causing the Crisis of the Third Century , largely due to his murders of several dozen of his closest friends , advisors , and benefactors .
He did not trust anyone , and intended to make the people love him by conquest and expansion .
His first campaign was against the Alamanni people of Germania .
They were absolutely no threat to Rome at this time , but Maximinus invaded them and conquered them , albeit at a terrible cost to his army .
The people did not love him for this , but hated him .
But he went right on invading Sarmatia and Dacia , modern - day Ukraine and Romania , respectively .
These people had not instigated anything against Rome .
Meanwhile , a revolt began in North Africa , setting up two men as claimants to the Roman throne , Gordianus Sempronianus and his son .
The Roman Senate supported them , and in response , Maximinus marched his army on Rome , but his troops had been fighting for so long that they were exhausted and sick .
They were unable to enter the closed city gates , and many deserted .
His Praetorian Guard had finally had enough and stabbed Maximinus in the back , then his son and advisors , beheaded them and put their heads on poles around the city walls , whereupon they were let in .
7 Diocletian
Diocletian reigned at the end of the Crisis of the Third Century , and though he significantly stabilized and improved the Empire ’s military and economy , he will forever be remembered as the worst persecutor of Christians in history .
He issued several edicts in 303 removing all rights from Christians until they converted to the Roman religion .
Of course , the Christians refused , and from 303 to 311 , at least 3,000 were martyred .
At first , those who refused were simply imprisoned , but it was not long before they were executed by both crucifixion and beheading .
Christian churches were sought all over the Empire and burned to the ground , looted , and even Christian senators were stripped of their jobs , imprisoned and executed .
When the persecution did not seem to be working , as the Christians simply went into hiding and continued to spread their religion , Diocletian advocated their torturous and entertaining executions in the Circus Maximus and Colosseum , and this was the time when most Christians were thrown to the lions , much to the delight of the Roman citizens who worshiped Roman gods .
The murders did not truly stop until Constantine ’s rise to absolute power in 324 .
6 Tiberius
Tiberius was Emperor after Augustus , from 14 to 37 , and did not care for the job .
All he wanted was the luxury , and left the Senate to do all the ruling .
The Senate despised him for this , and told the criticized him to the Roman populace , until he no longer trusted his safety in Rome and left for the island of Capri .
He erected statues of his captain of the Guard , Lucius Sejanus , all over the city , and gave all the tasks of ruling to him .
Tiberius more or less retired to Capri for the rest of his long life , only returning to Rome a few times .
While he lived on Capri , he had a huge villa built for him , Villa Jovis , the Villa of Jove ( Jupiter ) , in which he indulged his pedophilia .
He swam naked with and raped infants , toddlers and young boys .
He did not otherwise physically harm them in any way , but even in his late seventies , sex with young children was one of his favorite pastimes .
5 Nero
Nero used the office of emperor to suit his desire for an opulent lifestyle , and had absolutely no care for the welfare of the people .
He never trusted his mother , Agrippina , rightly so , and tried to kill her by having her ship sunk .
This did n’t work , and he simply ordered her executed .
He routinely executed anyone close to him , whom he did not trust , always under mysterious circumstances , because he feared the Praetorian Guard .
He managed to reign for 15 years in this way , killing anyone who dissented .
He was accused of treason beginning in 62 , and simply executed the accusers , several dozen of them .
He loved to go to bars and whorehouses , not even disguising himself .
The Great Fire of Rome , in 64 , has given rise to the legend that Nero fiddled while Rome burned .
This is not true .
He was away in Antium ( Anzio ) , and returned to Rome to try to have the fire put out .
He even paid for this out of his own pocket .
He did help out the survivors tremendously , letting them stay in the palace until homes were rebuilt , feeding them , etc .
But the fire largely destroyed the city center , and Nero had a large part of this destruction rebuilt as his Domus Aurea .
This was his gift to himself , a gigantic palatial garden complex of 100 to 300 acres , for which he heavily taxed the citizens throughout the Empire .
The city wanted a scapegoat , so Nero blamed the fire on the Christians , and they were terribly persecuted .
He had many arrested , impaled , and burned to death as torches to light his gardens in the Domus Aurea .
He is said to have breathed in the stench and laughed heartily , then turned to his lyre and sung his own songs .
The taxes irritated the populace sufficiently to begin revolts in various provinces , until by 68 , Nero was no longer loved , but hated by all .
His Guards deserted him in the palace , and he fled to a nearby villa , where a messenger appeared to tell him that the Senate had declared him a public enemy , whom they would beat to death .
He had a grave dug , while he repeated , “ What an artist dies within me ! ”
Then he stabbed a dagger into his throat and bled to death .
It is believed by most scholars that Nero is the Great Beast whose number is six hundred and sixty six referred to in the last Biblical book The Apocalypse .
4 Caracalla
Caracalla was not insane .
He was malicious and sadistic .
From 211 to 217 he presided over an awe - inspiring spectacle of fearsome acts .
He had his brother and co-emperor , Geta , and Geta ’s wife , assassinated .
The citizens of Alexandria , Egypt ridiculed this crime with a public play , and when Caracalla got wind of it , he traveled with an army to Alexandria , invited the citizens into their city square , and slaughtered them , looting and burning the whole city .
20,000 died .
This was the sort of emperor he showed himself to be in almost every Roman province at that time , putting down all hints of rebellions , even where rebellions were not imminent .
At the slightest whiff of discord , he ordered death .
Wherever he went , his army killed , raped , and destroyed .
He was murdered by one of his Guardsmen , on April 8 , 217 , while urinating on the side of the road outside Carrhae .
Caracalla had had the Guard ’s brother executed on a false accusation .
3 Commodus
Commodus was the son of Marcus Aurelius , one of Rome ’s greatest rulers , and this only enhanced Commodus ’s crimes in the public mind .
He adored the gladiatorial games , so much so that he personally entered many of them and fought alongside the gladiators , who were all criminals and slaves , etc .
This severely offended the entire Empire , especially the Senate .
Commodus once ordered all the cripples , hunchbacks , and generally undesirables in the city to be rounded up , thrown into the arena , and forced to hack one another to death with meat cleavers .
He especially adored killing animals , and killed 100 lions in one day , to the spectators ’ disgust .
He killed three elephants singlehanded in the arena , beheaded an ostrich and laughed at the senators attending , brandishing the head and motioning that they were next .
He speared a giraffe to death , an animal which the spectators did not see as fearsome at all .
The senators conspired to have him killed , and poisoned him , but he threw it up .
They then sent in his favorite wrestler , a gladiator named Narcissus , who strangled him in his bath .
His reign lasted 12 years , from 180 to 192 .
2 Elagabalus
It can be argued that Elagabalus ’s assassination reign , from 218 to 222 , began the Crisis of the 3rd Century , during which 50 years or so , Rome was ripped to pieces from the inside out by civil war after civil war , rampant anarchy , uprisings , economic hysteria and assaults from Germania and elsewhere .
Elagabalus took the throne at the ripe old age of 14 , and immediately indulged his most sordid , depraved fantasies and desires .
He was a man , yes , but wanted dearly to be a woman , and offered gargantuan sums of money to the physician who could turn him into one for real .
Until then , he enjoyed cross-dressing , and whored himself out to common men in whorehouses throughout Rome , wearing female disguises and facial makeup .
He even solicited men in the Imperial Palace , standing completely naked in the doorway of his favorite bedroom and purring at every passerby , even his Praetorian Guards .
He confided to the head of the Guard that he would like to castrate himself , and asked what the most painful method would be , cutting , crushing , or cooking on open coals .
He had hundreds , perhaps thousands , of affairs with men and women while he was married to a Vestal virgin , which was a serious outrage among Romans .
He installed El - Gabal , the Syrian sun god , as the chief god of Rome , surpassing Jupiter , and it is this sun god from which we derive the emperor ’s nickname .
He transferred all Roman sacred relics from their respective temples to a new temple he had built for El - Gabal , the Elagabalium , and named himself the high priest .
After 4 years of this , Rome erupted into riots as the praetorian citizens demanded his death or deposition .
Elagabalus responded by walking right into the praetorian encampment and demanding the arrest and execution of everyone .
Instead , everyone descended on him and his mother .
He tried to hide in a large clothes chest , but they opened it and stabbed him to death .
He and his mother were beheaded , and dragged throughout Rome .
He was then flung into the Tiber and spat upon .
He was 18 years old .
1 Caligula
“ Little Boots ” took the throne on the death of his second cousin Tiberias , something of a great Uncle to him .
Some say Caligula ordered the head of the Praetorian Guard to smother him with a pillow .
Upon his ascension , everyone in the Empire rejoiced .
For the first seven months or so , he was loved by all .
He paid handsome bonuses to the military , to get them on his side , and recalled many whom Augustus and Tiberias exiled .
But he became very sick in October of 37 , and the disease has never been pinned down .
Philo blames it on his extravagant lifestyle of too much food , wine , and sex .
After the disease passed and Caligula made a full recovery , he had turned into one of the most evil men in human history .
Some Jewish , Christian and Muslim historians of centuries afterward even considered that Caligula might have been possessed by a demon .
He has been accused of the most awesomely disgusting , insane , luridly depraved crimes against humanity and morality , and this lister is sorry to say that the accusations are all absolutely true .
He began ordering the murders of anyone who had ever crossed him , or even disagreed with him on mundane matters .
He had a very good memory .
He exiled his own wife , and proclaimed himself a god , dressing up as Apollo , Venus ( a goddess ) , Mercury and Hercules .
He demanded that everyone , from senators to Guards to guests and public crowds , refer to him as divine in his presence .
When he was a boy , a seer told him that he would never be emperor until he walked on water .
So he built a pontoon bridge across the Bay of Naples , put on the breastplate of Alexander the Great , and paraded night and day across the Bay , throwing lavish sex orgies in the light of bonfires .
He attempted to instate his favorite horse , Incitatus ( “ Galloper ” ) , as a priest and consul , and ordered a beautiful marble stable built for him , complete with chairs and couches on which Incitatus never sat .
Once , at the Circus Maximus , the games ran out of criminals , and the next event was the lions , his favorite .
He ordered his Guards to drag the first five rows of spectators into the arena , which they did .
These hundreds of people were all devoured for his amusement .
A citizen once insulted him to his face in a fit of rage , and Caligula responded by having him tied down , and beaten with heavy chains .
He made this last for 3 months , having the man brought out from a dungeon and beaten , until Caligula and the whole crowds that gathered were too offended by the smell of the man ’s gangrenous brain , whereupon he was beheaded .
Caligula ’s favorite torture was sawing , which topped another list on this site .
The sawblade filleted the spine and spinal cord from crotch down to chest , and the victim was unable to pass out due to excess blood to the brain .
He also relished chewing up the testicles of victims , without biting them off , while they were restrained upside down before him .
He had another insulter , and his entire family , publicly executed one after another in front of a crowd .
The man and wife were first , followed by the oldest child and so on .
The crowd became outraged and began to disperse , but many stayed in morbid fascination .
The last of the family was a 12 year old girl , who was sobbing hysterically at what she had been forced to watch .
A member of the crowd shouted that she was exempt from execution as a virgin .
Caligula smiled and ordered the executioner to rape her , then strangle her , which he did .
He publicly had sex with his three sisters at banquets and games , sometimes on the table amid the food .
He was finally murdered by the Praetorian Guard and some senators , leaving the Circus Maximus after the games .
His body was left in the street to rot , and dogs finally ate it .
He had ruled for 4 years .

Since one of the authors of this book , Roger Schroeder , is visiting South Africa right now , and I hope to attend a missiological conference where he will be speaking in a couple of days ' time , I thought I would post this review , which I originally wrote six years ago for the International Bulletin of Missionary Research
This book is a survey of twenty centuries of mission history in the light of different models of mission theology , and ends with a proposal for a mission theology for the 21st century .
The theological models the authors use are based on those proposed by Justo L. González and Dorothea Sölle , which they refer to as types A , B , and C .
Type A is mission as saving souls and extending the church ;
Type B is mission as discovery of the truth ;
Type C is mission as commitment to liberation and transformation .
The three models are typified in the early church by Tertullian of Carthage , Origen of Alexandria and Irenaeus of Lyons respectively .
The authors go on to describe each model of theology in relation to six constants : Christology , Ecclesiology , Eschatology , Salvation , Anthropology , and Culture .
They then examine these constants in
six different historical contexts .
As an Orthodox Christian , I read the authors ' description of Type A and Type B theology , and felt repelled .
I could not identify with either of them .
Type C , however , was familiar to me ; it was Orthodox theology .
This is not surprising , since Irenaeus is regarded by the Orthodox Church as a saint and a Father of the Church ; Tertullian and Origen are not .
As I read on , however , I felt marginalized : in all six periods of mission history the authors identified Orthodox mission with Type B , and not with Type C , yet made no attempt to explain this ( to me ) glaring discrepancy .
It is a pity that the book lacks a bibliography .
The book is a good introduction to Roman Catholic mission history and theology .
Its coverage of Orthodox mission history and theology , however , is thin and misleading .
There is a flaw either in the models themselves , or in the authors ' application of them .
M15 accused over alleged torture of Briton in Bangladesh .
Credit : Wahid Adnan / DrikNEWS / Majority World guardian.co.uk
The Security service is facing fresh accusations of involvement in the abuse of terrorism suspects after a British man was detained in Bangladesh and allegedly tortured while being questioned about his activities and associates in both countries .
Lawyers representing Gulam Mustafa , a 48 - year - old Birmingham businessman , say there is evidence he has been severely mistreated since being arrested in the Bangladeshi capital , Dhaka , in mid-April .
The case appears to present an immediate challenge to a new government , and will give some insight into the manner in which it will deal with the growing number of allegations of collusion in foreign torture .
At their last party conference , the Liberal Democrats passed a resolution calling for a judicial inquiry into the UK 's role in torture and rendition .
The Conservatives , however , have said only that they will not rule out an inquiry .
Labour ministers have issued blanket denials of collusion in torture , but have declined to address specific allegations .
Mustafa appeared to have a swollen face when he was paraded before television cameras shortly after his arrest , according to his family .
When he appeared in court 11 days later , a journalist working for the Guardian could see that he was unable to stand throughout the proceedings , at one point sinking to his knees .
The businessman told a British consular official he had been forced to assume stressful positions for long periods during questioning at a detention centre known as the Taskforce for Interrogation Cell , where the use of torture is alleged to be common .
Lawyers for Mustafa 's family said there were strong grounds to believe that British officials had been complicit in his mistreatment and they were considering bringing legal action against the government .
They were angry that the UK High Commission in Dhaka had failed to secure consular access to Mustafa for more than two weeks after his arrest or arrange for him to be seen by a doctor .
The family 's solicitor , Gareth Peirce , said in a letter to the foreign secretary , David Miliband : " It is already well known that MI5 has been co-operating with the Bangladeshi authorities and providing and exchanging information with them about Mr Mustafa . "
She said a number of Mustafa 's associates in the UK had been questioned about him , adding : " There is serious reason to believe that the security services have therefore been mixed up in the ill - treatment carried out by the Bangladeshi authorities and this is still ongoing . "
In his reply , Miliband said Mustafa 's welfare was the " primary objective " of the Foreign Office , but he did not address the allegations of MI5 complicity in the mistreatment .
Asked about the allegations , a Foreign Office spokesperson said : " The government 's position on torture is clear .
We condemn it wholeheartedly .
" We do not torture people , and we do not ask others to do so on our behalf .
We take all allegations of torture and mistreatment very seriously .
With an individual 's permission , we can take up any justified complaint about ill - treatment with the relevant authorities . "
The Foreign Office told the Guardian it had made repeated requests to see Mustafa before finally being allowed access to him on 2 May .
The Bangladeshi foreign ministry rejected this statement , saying it had received only one such request – the day after Mustafa 's lawyers wrote to Miliband – and that the request had been promptly granted .
Mustafa has been of interest to MI5 for several years .
In April 2007 , a month after he travelled to Bangladesh , leaving his wife and six children at the family home in the Sparkhill area of Birmingham , the Bank of England employed counter - terrorism powers to impose financial sanctions upon him , freezing his assets and prohibiting others from making funds available to him .
Mustafa 's family said he was frightened to return to the UK after this happened .
After his departure , a number of his associates in Britain were questioned by MI5 officers , close relatives said .
Shortly afterwards , Mustafa moved into a flat in an upmarket suburb of Dhaka and told his family the rent was being paid by one of the country 's intelligence agencies , the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence ( DGFI ) .
His wife repeatedly asked him to return to Birmingham , and he told relatives , in a telephone call in November that year , that he was planning to do so .
Five days later , he was arrested and charged with a firearm offence .
Mustafa 's defence was that he watched police officers plant the weapon during a search of the flat and , when he demanded to know why they were doing it , he was told it was at the instigation of British authorities .
He was convicted and sentenced to 17 years in prison , but was released on bail in January pending an appeal .
He was re-arrested on 16 April and accused of distributing funds to Harakat - ul - Jihad al - Islami , a militant Islamist organisation banned in both Bangladesh and the UK .
Twelve months ago , Jamil Rahman , another British terrorism suspect who had been detained and allegedly tortured in Bangladesh , told the Guardian British intelligence officers had threatened him with reprisals if he did not give evidence against Mustafa in an English court .
" They told me that they would arrange for somebody to give evidence against me in court if I did n't agree , " he said .
Rahman , 32 , a former civil servant from south Wales , said that , after being tortured by DGFI officers , he was repeatedly interrogated by men who identified themselves as MI5 officers .
He was never charged with any offence and eventually returned to the UK , where he began civil proceedings against the government .
The next government will inherit this case and a number of others lodged by British citizens and residents who were victims of rendition or who allege they were tortured before being questioned by British intelligence officers .
One of the litigants has been convicted of terrorism offences .
None of the others has been charged with any offence .
The government is expected to offer out - of - court settlements to a number of the men after the court of appeal earlier this month dismissed an attempt by MI5 and MI6 to suppress evidence of alleged complicity in torture .
The politics of John Yoo and Bob Dylan could n’t be any more different .
After all , one wrote legal exceptions that sanctioned the use of torture , while the other inspired a generation .
In a sense , it seems logical to blend the two , right ?
And that ’s just what activists Margaret Flowers and David Swanson did , rewriting the lyrics to Dylan ’s “ Tangled Up In Blue ” into a lick protesting the former Bush administration attorney .

The title — “ Tangled Up In Yoo ” — is catchy , albeit obvious .
This video was published to YouTube by user davidcnswanson on Feb. 28 , 2010 .
The song was apparently created to help promote a civil action against John Yoo , who plans to speak in Charlottesville , Virginia on March 19 .
Swanson , who oversees activist web site AfterDowningStreet.org and rewrote the song ’s lyrics , is also promoting the video under the address hoosagainstyoo.org .
The term “ Hoo ” ( short for “ Wahoo ” ) is the unofficial nickname for University of Virginia students and alumni .

“ Yoo has claimed that a president has the right to crush a child ’s testicles , massacre a village , or drop nuclear bombs on cities , ” the group says in a flier [ PDF link ] promoting their protest .
“ The Dept. of Justice found that Yoo ‘ committed intentional professional misconduct ’ .
Spain is seeking to indict
Yoo but is facing strong resistance from the White House .
Aggressive wars , torture , lawless imprisonment , and warrantless spying are continuing because Yoo and his
co?conspirators have not yet been prosecuted .
And they are not being prosecuted because the new president is continuing the crimes .
We must raise our voices for the rule of law .
Yoo does not deny his crimes ,
but claims power on behalf of a president to commit them in a time of war .
But war is the supreme crime , and Yoo has the blood of over a million Iraqis and Afghans on his hands .
We should give
Yoo what he has helped deny to thousands : a fair trial . ”
According to the results of a DoJ probe , Yoo and fellow Bush attorney Jay Bybee were both found guilty of “ professional misconduct ” in authorizing torture by the Bush administration , but will face no civil or criminal liability .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ These memos contained significant flaws , ” Associate Deputy Attorney General David Margolis wrote in a 69 - page memo dated January 5 .
“ But as all that glitters is not gold , all flaws do not constitute professional misconduct … .
I conclude that Yoo and Bybee exercised poor judgment by overstating the certainty of their conclusions and underexposing countervailing arguments . ”
The long - awaited and repeatedly delayed release of the final report by the ethics unit , which capped a two - year review , was hundreds of pages long and included emails exchanged between the Justice Department , the White House and the Central Intelligence Agency .
It was dated July 29 .
ADVERTISEMENT
It also cleared Steven Bradbury , who headed the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel where Yoo and Bybee worked .
The report criticized former attorney general John Ashcroft , then - chief of the Justice Department ’s Criminal Division Michael Chertoff and others for not critically examining the memos or recognizing the documents ’ shortcomings .
But it did not cite the officials for misconduct .
MUMBAI , India — Laxmi Tripathi stands tall and proud .
She — who used to go by he — wears her hair long , her eyes decorated with thick black eyeliner and a low - cut top that reveals a hint of cleavage .
Bangles adorn her wrists .
Hailed as a success story in India , Tripathi has spoken at the United Nations and addressed conferences around the world on the rights of the transgender community .
And yet , being somewhat of a celebrity activist did not shield Tripathi from the very discrimination she has denounced .
Last week , officials at the Bombay Gymkhana in South Mumbai interrupted a dinner party there to kick Tripathi out of the exclusive club .
“ I could never believe this could happen to me .
I have been to so many places in the world , treated with so much dignity , ” Tripathi said as she took a break from dubbing a new Bollywood film on the transgender community .
And yet this incident happened “ in a town where I ’m more famous than anywhere in the world . ”
While gradual progress has been made to garner more rights for and reduce the stigma against India ’s transgenders , the episode at the club illustrates that the community still faces serious discrimination — even among the elite , said Tripathi and other activists .
A certain segment of Mumbai ’s middle and upper class thinks of itself as cosmopolitan , said Parmesh Shahani , author of " Gay Bombay , " who was at last week ’s dinner party .
However , if one scratches below the surface , he said , there are many undercurrents at play .
“ Over the past two decades we 've been very wrapped up in this whole ‘ India Shining ’ [ idea ] , ” he said .
“ But I think true modernity lies in having a plural and accepting mindset and really embracing diversity in all its forms . ”
The transgender community in India , known as hijras , number up to a million people and occupy a unique role in society .
On the one hand , they are called upon to offer blessings during auspicious occasions like weddings and at births .
The rest of the time , they are not only ignored but often ostracized from society .
Discrimination has prevented most hijras from obtaining decent education , jobs and housing , say transgender and human rights activists .
The vast majority live in slums and , with limited job opportunities , resort to sex work or begging .
They weave in and out of Mumbai ’s traffic or come onto the women ’s compartments of local trains , clap loudly and take money in exchange for a blessing .
The “ life of transsexuals or transgenders is not miserable simply because of club prejudice , ” Meenakshi Ganguly of Human Rights Watch wrote in an email .
“ What is much harder is rejection by community , by relatives and the police abuse they suffer . ”
She added that many are HIV positive and face difficulty getting medical treatment .
The hospital staff cannot determine whether they should be placed in the male or female wards .
While hijras continue to face discrimination , they have also made significant social and legal gains in recent years .
Last July , the Delhi High Court decriminalized gay sex , and in November , transgenders won the right to be listed as “ other ” rather than “ male ” or “ female ” on electoral rolls and voter identity cards .
A Bollywood film called “ Queens ! , " scheduled to be released later this year , will feature professional actors as well as hijras themselves and present the community in a “ dignified ” and thereby new light , said David Atkins , the writer and director of the film .
The movie could not have been made a decade ago , he said , because both Indian society and the hijras were not ready for it .
“ Ten years ago , they had not come out of the closet , ” Atkins said .
“ With Laxmi backing them , they are no longer afraid to show themselves . ”
In some ways , the incident at the club also highlights these changes in society .
After the CEO of the Bombay Gymkhana told the dinner party ’s organizer that Tripathi must leave , the entire group walked out of the club .
Some members of the club have since galvanized around Tripathi to show their support , and the local media has run numerous stories bringing attention to what happened .
Such outrage at the club ’s behavior might not have happened five years ago , Shahani said .
Prejudice has not gone away , he said , " but people are being sensitized to the rights of certain populations . "
The Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission has taken up the case , and Tripathi says she plans a lawsuit against the club claiming gender discrimination .
The Bombay Gymkhana did not return GlobalPost 's calls for comment .
Update at bottom : Gov. Jindal ’s office calls claims of bribery ‘ ridiculous ’
MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann on Tuesday named Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal “ the worst person in the world ” over claims the Republican governor “ blackmailed or bribed ” his Democratic attorney general into joining a multi-state lawsuit challenging the health care overhaul .
ADVERTISEMENT
Noting that Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell is now “ debasing himself ” by joining the lawsuit , Olbermann pointed to an article in Eunice Today that alleges Caldwell did n’t want to be the “ token Democrat ” joining the lawsuit but was “ backed into a corner ” by Jindal .
[ T ]he Attorney General said the decision was made more out of the necessity of saving jobs in his agency than any real hopeÃ¢â‚¬â€ or desireÃ¢â‚¬â€ of overturning the health care law .
One employee said Caldwell , in a candid admission , claimed that a deal was made with Jindal .
Under terms of that agreement , the governor would not make additional cuts in the attorney generalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s budget if Caldwell joined in the litigation .
Caldwell agreed to be the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ token Democrat , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he said , so that he might save additional job cuts by an administration whose state goal is to reduce the number of state employees by as much as 5,000 per year over three years .
“ In other words , Governor Jindal either blackmailed Attorney General Caldwell or bribed him , ” Olbermann said .
“ ‘ Support this moronic , pathetic , partisan , legally flimsy lawsuit on behalf of the insurance companies or we ’ll fire your employees . ' ”
The allegations suggest that Republicans may not be immune to the spirit of deal - making for which Democrats were criticized during the health reform debate .
Conservative commentators pointed to the individual deals made with some Democratic lawmakers as evidence the health reform process was corrupt .
Among those deals was one involving Louisiana : Democratic Sen.
Mary Landrieu ’s deal with the Democratic leadership that would see Louisiana get $ 100 million to help fund health care for the poor , in exchange for her support of health care reform .
ADVERTISEMENT
Landrieu hailed the deal , saying it would help provide drug coverage to some 116,000 Louisiana seniors , as well as fund an increase in Medicare reimbursements to doctors .
Reporting on the Jindal controversy , Amanda Terkel at ThinkProgress notes that Caldwell “ has been facing significant blowback for his decision to pursue JindalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s right - wing case .
LouisianaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Black Caucus recently rallied against Caldwell , with state Rep. Regina Barrow ( D ) saying the services provided by the Affordable Care Act ‘ could approximately save us $ 500 million .
These savings could be used to cover a majority of the state budget crisis that we currently face , inclusive of higher ed . ' ”
UPDATE
Gov. Jindal ’s office is forcefully denying claims of a deal between the governor and Attorney General Caldwell .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ridiculous and completely false , ” Kyle Plotkin , Jindal ’s press secretary , told Raw Story Wednesday .
“ There Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s no truth to it . ”
Plotkin added that “ thereÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s absolutely no connection between budget reductions and the lawsuit . ”

Nick Berg and Zacarias Moussaoui : More Evidence That They Knew Each Other
by Michael P. Wright
December 5 , 2004
Ever since his decapitation in Iraq last spring , I have suspected that Nick Berg was a CIA - sponsored infiltrator at the University of Oklahoma , and was the one who bought the 9/11 hijacker 's airline ticket from an OU library computer terminal .
I believe the CIA set him up to be killed in Iraq , so the secret would die with him .
Another very important fact supporting this suspicion came to mind today .
On May 14 , 2004 , CNN reported that Moussaoui had used Berg 's email account and password , when he was in Norman , Oklahoma .
Apparently the FBI discovered Berg 's information on his computer hard drive when they searched it in the fall of 2001 .
Relying on Berg 's father , CNN accounted for Berg 's information being on Moussaoui 's computer by reporting that when Berg was attending the University of Oklahoma , during a bus ride he allowed a stranger to use his email .
The stranger , they said , turned out to be one of Moussaoui 's associates , and gave him Berg 's email account and password .
This story is not credible .
Nicholas Berg was enrolled at the University of Oklahoma only for the fall semester of 1999 .
According to his indictment , Moussaoui did not arrive in Norman , Oklahoma , until February 2001 .
An FBI affidavit confirms that Moussaoui was using free anonymous hotmail accounts , and therefore did not have the motive to steal anyone 's password .
See the May 26 and May 28 entries for links to these documents .
Another reason to doubt the story is that wireless connections were very expensive in 1999 and not standard on laptops , yet Berg 's father said that the " stranger on the bus " used his son 's email .
City buses in 1999 were not equipped with the antennas necessary for facilitating wireless connections to the internet .
Here 's the important fact I overlooked earlier .
Nowhere on Moussaoui 's federal indictment is he accused of stealing Berg 's password .
I know of no other criminal charges against Moussaoui .
It appears that he was never charged with this " password theft . "
Why not ?
The most likely answer is that he did n't steal Berg 's password .
Berg , in the course of conducting his infiltration activity , gave it to Moussaoui voluntarily .
To have charged Moussaoui with this crime would have meant obligating Berg to commit perjury and expose him to cross-examination .
I do n't think the spooks wanted to go that far .
Too many dirty secrets implicating David Boren , George Tenet , and David Edger could have come out .
If Cat Stevens Is Guilty Then So Is David Boren
by Michael Wright Norman , Oklahoma
September 23 , 2004
According to CNN , Yusuf Islam ( Cat Stevens ) was on a terrorist watch list because of suspicion arising from reported associations and financial support for Muslim charities with terrorist connections .
This was recently used by U.S. authorities as a reason for obstructing Islam 's entry into the country .
By these criteria , then David Boren also ought to be on a watch list .
Boren , now president of the University of Oklahoma , as a U.S. Senator chaired the Intelligence Committee for seven years .
He is widely known as the mentor and sponsor of now repudiated former CIA boss George Tenet .
In 2002 , at OU Boren hosted Saudi Prince Bandar Bin Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz , ambassador to the United States for Saudi Arabia .
Prince Bandar addressed a dinner audience at 7 p.m. in the OU student union .
Boren was there to glow in the Prince 's limelight and moderate the question - and - answer session between the ambassador and audience members .
I do not know how large an honorarium in OU funds was paid to Boren 's good friend the Prince .
Tenet and CIA agent David Edger were also present for the events .
This was reported by the OU student newspaper .
Members of the Saudi royal family appear to have rather peculiar notions of noblesse oblige .
The Washington Post reports that Princess Haifa al - Faisal , wife of Prince Bandar , has provided " charitable support " to Osama Bassnan , described by the FBI as " an extremist and [ an Osama ] bin Laden supporter . "
Bassnan also befriended 9/11 hijackers Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi .
Why is n't Boren on a terrorist watch list ?
See my website for more reasons to be suspicious about Boren .
New Freedom of Information Act Request About 9/11 Hijacker 's Ticket Purchase from the University of Oklahoma Library
by Michael Wright

Below is a new Freedom of Information Act request I sent to the FBI .
Readers are encouraged to see their reply to the first request , made in 2002 .
Recordings of telephone communications with KOCO - TV personnel can be accessed with the control panel beneath the May 18 column .

Dear FBI Officials :
In the fall of 2001 , a librarian at the University of Oklahoma library informed me that she was present when an FBI agent conducted an interview of library personnel in order to identify an employee of that facility who purchased an airline ticket for a 9/11 hijacker from a computer terminal there .
She told me that he was not a hijacker .
He was a white American male and he knew he was assisting the hijackers .
She said the ticket was for United Airlines flight 93 .
It is an interesting coincidence that the Moussaoui indictment reports the incidents of ticket - purchasing for only 14 of the 19 hijackers .
For United 93 it only reports one of four .
Three different people have confirmed to me that they saw a TV news broadcast reporting this event by KOCO - TV of Oklahoma City .
In October 2003 I called KOCO and requested a copy of the videocassette of this broadcast .
An employee at the news desk named Melissa confirmed to me that the station had made the broadcast .
She then told me that I would have to speak to the reporter , Terri Watkins , in order to purchase a videocassette .
I left a message on Watkins ’ voice mail and requested it .
To my surprise she returned the call with a message on my answering machine and denied that the station had reported this event .
I am quite confident that this was a lie and a cover-up .
In October 2002 I assisted Bill Crozier in preparing an FOI request to the FBI and asked for more details about this event .
The FOI request letter was dated October 15 and used this language :
Under the Freedom of Information Act I request information about a report I heard involving purchase of airline tickets for the 9/11 terrorist hijacking from the public computer terminals in the University of Oklahoma library .
My information is that tickets from the terrorists who seized the aircraft and crashed it in Pennsylvania were purchased by a terrorist collaborator operating in the OU library .
The letter additionally asked for the identity of the ticket purchaser , and whether he had been arrested .
The FBI ’s answer to this is enclosed .
My questions are :
For the five tickets not reported in the Moussaoui indictment , where and for whom were each purchased and why was this information originally suppressed ?
It has now been 21 months since the FBI informed Crozier that the material he requested " is located in an investigative file which pertains to a pending investigation . "
Is that investigation complete ?
Will you now release the name of the person who bought the 9/11 hijacker ’s airline ticket from an OU library terminal and inform me about whether he was ever arrested ?
What information does the FBI possess about the decision by KOCO - TV to suppress its report about the ticket - purchasing incident ?
I intend to copy this request to reporters , associated with several prominent news organizations , who have expressed interest in these questions .
I shall also share your reply with them .
Sincerely ,
Michael P. Wright

Another TV News Station Makes a 9/11 Story Disappear
by Michael Wright
August 23 , 2004
Below the May 18 column there is a control panel which activates voice recordings of two women employed by Oklahoma City 's KOCO - TV .
One of them confirms that the station broadcast the fact that a 9/11 hijacker 's ticket was bought from a University of Oklahoma library computer terminal .
The other denies it .
The truth is that the station did make such a report .
Now another ABC affiliate has joined KOCO in making a 9/11 story disappear .
In early August , by email I received a link to an article posted by WCPO TV in Cincinnati .
The date was 9/11/01 , and it contained the extraordinary statement that United Flight 93 landed in Cleveland that morning because of a bomb scare .
This was startling , since all major news organizations had reported that the flight was hijacked in mid-air and crashed in Pennsylvania .
Following my question , sent by email , about whether this article was a mistake , WCPO decided to yank it from the internet instead of answering me .
Fortunately I was able to locate the Google cache of the article , in order to preserve the information for this column .
Here is the current WCPO website , which says that the story ( without revealing its contents ) was " factually incorrect " and has been removed .
It also attributes the report to a " preliminary AP story . "
The original WCPO post did not say that AP was the source .
At the very least , we have a serious issue of journalistic ethics .
Imagine the example of a conventional hard - copy newspaper .
If an erroneous report is brought to their attention , then we expect them to publish an apology and correction .
Now , suppose they went around to all the libraries and tried to yank and burn all copies of the issue with the mistake .
This would be considered outrageous .
By analogy , that is exactly what WCPO in Cincinnati has done .
They have made disappear a record of ( what they are now calling ) a mistake they broadcast and published online .
More than likely , the original story they posted on 9/11/01 was an error arising from that day 's atmosphere of panic .
Other news reports state that it was a Delta jet which landed in Cleveland that morning , due to a bomb scare ; nonetheless , making the WCPO record vanish from history was done on purpose .
The unscrupulous conduct they exhibit is another example of the decline of American journalism .
9/11 Truth - Seekers Must Call for Special Prosecutor
by Michael Wright
Norman , Oklahoma
August 6 , 2004
Scroll down to the control panel beneath the May 18 column and hear the recordings of telephone communications with Oklahoma City KOCO TV news personnel .
The recordings confirm that the station broadcast the fact that a 9/11 hijacker 's ticket was purchased from a University of Oklahoma computer terminal .
They also confirm that the station later chose to deny having made this broadcast .
In doing so , they are concealing knowledge of a serious crime : treason .
The ticket was not purchased by a hijacker , but by a white American male , who has not been arrested .
FBI agents visiting the OU library were able to gain cooperation in identifying him and confirming that he was an OU employee .
I have voiced the suspicion that the ticket purchaser was infiltrating Al Qaeda under the CIA 's instructions and participating in an attempted sting operation .
I brought this to the attention of the 9/11 Commission last fall , but they chose to ignore it .
They have issued their report , which is a whitewash , placing blame on no one in particular , in spite of the fact that earlier their Chairman Thomas Keen said the attack was preventable .
Now that the 9/11 Commission has issued their whitewash , what are truth - seekers to do ?
I encourage a grass roots demand for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the hijacker 's ticket purchase at OU and all the people involved in it .
He also needs to expose the cover - up completely .
Of course , this would start with KOCO TV news .
His first step would be to question Terri Watkins , the reporter who made the broadcast and then lied and said she did n't , and find out who ordered the lie .
The truth will unravel from there .
The Outrageous Albany Sting Operation
by Michael Wright
Norman , Oklahoma
August 6 , 2004
This is the story which emerges from observing the facts presented in today 's AP story , appearing in The Oklahoman , page 13A .
A convicted felon , desperate to reduce his sentence , makes a deal with federal prosecutors to try to go out and find a couple of Arab suckers and entrap them into coming up with some money to buy a grenade - launcher .
The fink finds a couple of prospects in a Mosque in Albany and makes up a story that the weapon will be used to kill the Pakistani Ambassador to punish that country for cooperating with non-Muslims .
The fink comes back to the feds and tells them exactly what they want to hear -- that the two targeted Muslims agreed to help out .
The two Muslims are arrested .
I have no reason to believe that the suspects actually did what the fink is saying .
The fink has a powerful motive to lie in order to please the feds for the reward of a sentence reduction .
Deputy Attorney General James Comey described the two suspects as " potentially " dangerous and said the sting operation " was meant to send a message to terrorists . "
There is no claim of any actual plot to assassinate anyone .
One reason making this story is interesting is that it calls attention to the fact that stings are a common tactic used in espionage and law enforcement .
I have argued that the 9/11 attack was enabled by David Boren and the now discredited George Tenet as a consequence of their effort to conduct a sting operation against Al Qaeda .
Boren and Tenet stumbled all over themselves , and it blew back in their faces .
See my website and earlier columns here for details .
Senate Report Blasts Tenet
Media Covering for Pal Boren
by Michael P. Wright
July 10 , 2004
There are three interesting news items about the recent Senate Intelligence Committee report criticizing the CIA and former director George Tenet .
Unfortunately , providing links has become problematic because so many newspapers have opted for requiring online registration and allow unrestricted access to breaking news only for a limited amount of time .
An AP story , temporarily available at Yahoo on July 10 , says that the Senate report " repeatedly blasts departing CIA Director Tenet , accusing him of skewing advice to top policy - makers with the CIA 's view and elbowing out dissenting views from other intelligence agencies overseen by the State or Defense departments . "
The article does not mention his close relationship to his mentor David Boren , former U.S. Senator and now president of the University of Oklahoma .
The Senate report makes clear that the CIA was adjusting its prewar communications to satisfy the Bush political agenda .
What needs to be emphasized is that in 1991 , as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee , Boren did a big favor for the senior Bush by pushing through the confirmation of his nominee Robert Gates as CIA director .
During the 80s , Gates had been instrumental in corrupting the CIA analytical division by turning it into a chorus of political stooges willing to echo Reagan 's " evil empire " crusade against the Soviet Union .
That story is told by former AP correspondent Robert Parry .
What we are witnessing today is the legacy of the Boren - Tenet solidification of the CIA 's earlier corruption initiated by Gates .
Boren has a long history of using his influence over government agencies to install crony networks composed of his friends and loyalists .
This is documented by a 1978 Oklahoma legislative audit exposing this kind of conduct when he was governor .
It was reported by The Oklahoma Journal on January 26 , 1979 , and is available at the archives of the Oklahoma Historical Society museum near the Capitol .
I suspect Boren has polluted the intelligence community in the same fashion .
He has certainly continued with this kind of behavior by maximizing opportunities provided by his reign as OU boss .
Evidence at my website from two sources indicates that Tenet himself had no background in intelligence when Boren made him chief of staff of the Intelligence Committee in 1987 .
Another AP story at Yahoo says that the current report's " across - the - board criticism of the CIA could indicate that any nominee from within the intelligence community would have a tough time winning confirmation by the Senate . "
Maybe some of the Senators share my suspicion .
Finally , there is an LA Times article at Yahoo which reports that Tenet is telling CIA employees to resist unnecessary and unwanted changes .
He appears to be addressing the Boren crony network when he says : " This institution is your own .
We who serve as your leaders are stewards for limited periods of time . "
If I am correct , then Tenet is indicating his desire for the Boren crony network to defend itself and carry on in the tradition established by his mentor .
Note :
Yahoo news articles have a temporary shelf life and the links in this column will no longer function after the online items expire .
Readers are encouraged to print this column out and mail it to Senators on the Intelligence Committee .

If You Believe Nick Berg 's Story to the FBI I 'll Sell You One
by Michael Wright
Norman , Oklahoma
May 28 , 2004
The FBI searched Zacarias Moussaoui 's computer after the 9/11 attack and found Nick Berg 's email account and password on it .
When interviewed by them , Berg reportedly explained that when he was a student at the University of Oklahoma in the fall of 1999 , he allowed a stranger on a bus ride to use his email .
The stranger turned out to be an associate of Moussaoui , we are told , and gave him Berg 's password and email account name .
This was reported by CNN and other news organizations .
There are several big reasons to be extremely skeptical about this story and to wonder what kind of fools the FBI agents were who bought it .
One glaring fact is that , according to his indictment , Moussaoui did not show up in the United States until February of 2001 .
Conceivably the stranger on the bus was already an associate of Moussaoui in the fall of 1999 , but is n't that kind of a reach ?
The indictment states that Moussaoui was doing a lot of world traveling in the late 90s .
He was present at an Al - Qaeda training camp in 1998 and was in Pakistan in 2000 .
He did n't start to get interested in Norman until he contacted the Airman Flight School in September 2000 .
He did n't use Nick Berg 's email account for that .
He used one he set up that month with an internet service provider in Malaysia .
A year and a half elapsed from the time of the reported bus ride until Moussaoui 's arrival in Norman , the home of OU .
If the stranger did not know Moussaoui in 1999 , did he retain Berg 's information for 18 months while just hoping that some time he would be able to share it with a terrorist ?
We wonder if FBI agents ever research their own files in the organization .
Just for fun , readers , try a Google search with these terms , without quotes : moussaoui fbi computer email .
The second hit on the list is going to be this FBI court document , which is all about Moussaoui 's computer accounts !
Would an FBI agent not be bright enough to conduct this simple search , in the process of evaluating Berg 's story ?
From the FBI document we see that Moussaoui , like anyone else , was able to obtain free anonymous Hotmail accounts .
Why would he need to snatch Nick Berg 's password for purposes of sending email ?
It seems unlikely that Berg 's email account and password were on Moussaoui 's computer because he needed to steal one for his own communication purposes with his Al Qaeda cell members .
An alternative hypothesis is that Berg actually was a friendly associate with Moussaoui , but did not want to admit this to his father when he discussed the FBI interview with him .
CNN had relied on Berg 's father for their report .
This is not to suggest that Berg was a terrorist .
More than likely , he had been working very covertly under the CIA 's direction to infiltrate Al Qaeda during his period of residence in Norman , which extended into 2001 .
Giving the FBI the benefit of the doubt and exempting them from the judgment of incompetence , it is possible that Berg was able to mobilize his CIA supervisors to influence the FBI agents to clear him of suspicion .
New York Times Blunders in its Nick Berg Article of 5/26/04
by Michael P. Wright
Norman , Oklahoma
5/26/04
On this date , the New York Times published an article by James Dao under the headline : Tracing a Civilian 's Path to Gruesome Fate in Iraq .
Dao described Nick Berg 's life and travels from his college years until his untimely demise in Iraq .
Dao 's work was not altogether accurate .
He reported that Berg quit his studies at the University of Oklahoma in 2000 .
Following this , Dao writes that " for more than a year " Berg " wandered across Oklahoma and Texas working as a freelance contractor replacing lights , painting girders , and fixing cables . "
Now we 've heard the New York Times ' fiction .
What is the truth ?
It is true that Berg 's last and only semester at OU was the fall of 1999 .
This is confirmed by the official OU record obtained and displayed here earlier in May .
We have also displayed other records demonstrating some of Berg 's activities in 2000 .
The Norman city court record reveals that he was arrested for trespassing in April and May of that year .
The 2000 - 2001 OU personnel directory confirms that Berg was working for the university 's Lloyd Noble Center during that period .
We do n't know what he was doing for the entire twelve months , but it is an error to say that he spent the whole year wandering across Oklahoma and Texas .
It exposes sloppiness by the New York Times and perhaps susceptibility to manipulation by press officers of OU , who would like to keep the lid on the true Berg story .
Perhaps Berg did conduct some successful endeavors as a contractor during 2000 .
This would only make one more suspicious in regard to the question of whether his appearance as a vagrant during the spring was an honest expression of his circumstances or a facade .
Nick Berg Enjoys Favored Treatment from Norman City Court
by Michael P. Wright
Norman , Oklahoma
5/26/04
Readers are invited to take a close look at Nick Berg 's Norman city court record , which I obtained on May 18 .
There are some strange paradoxes in it .
First , observe that there were two arrests for trespassing , and two columns with dates .
On the left are the dates for the arrests , and on the right are the dates of consequent court actions .
For the arrest of 5/28/00 , we see the symbol BF , meaning that Berg forfeited bond in the amount of $ 162 .
He did not make a court appearance .
The bond forfeiture amounted to a guilty plea , and a conviction went on the record .
Earlier , he had been arrested on 4/11/00 .
After this we see the symbol DISM CO , which means dismissal complied .
We also see the date of 11/21/00 for the court action .
The clerk explained this .
It meant that on 5/21/00 , six months earlier , Berg appeared in court and received a deferred sentence .
He was told that the complaint would be dismissed six months later if he committed no other offenses within that time interval .
As the record demonstrates , it was dismissed .
The paradox in this record is that he violated the terms of this deferred sentence by being arrested seven days later but enjoyed obtaining a dismissal in November in spite of this .
The clerk stated that this was done at the city attorney 's discretion .
How do we account for this ?
Now we must move from fact to informed speculation .
It looks like the city attorney did a favor for Berg .
In my column of 5/18/04 , I state the suspicion that Berg was a CIA operative and infiltrator taking instructions from David Boren , George Tenet , and David Edger .
Boren is a powerful political patriarch in Oklahoma .
It would be a trivial matter for Boren to ask a little favor from the city attorney , in order to help out one of his operatives .
Take another look at the record .
Notice that for both arrests , financial sums in the amount of $ 162 were assessed against Berg .
Why did he have to pay this amount for the charge which was dismissed ?
The clerk explained that for this charge , the sum was a fee instead of a fine .
The amount was $ 100 .
Additionally he had to pay $ 32 for court costs and $ 30 for time spent in jail .
For the conviction , the $ 100 went on the record as a fine .
I had never heard of anything like this before , and it strikes me as a questionable and extraordinary arrangement .
I suspect a little horse - trading went on behind the scenes .
The city attorney , in the process of granting the favor of dismissing the complaint , simultaneously and paradoxically came up with a way to snatch a little money from Berg for the court .
He was sneaking in the back door .
In Oklahoma , that 's the way good ol boys " do bi'ness . "
Nick Berg Was Arrested Twice At OU During Spring 2000
by Michael P. Wright
Norman , Oklahoma
5/18/04
Today from the Norman city court clerk I obtained a document confirming that Nicholas E. Berg , who reportedly was decapitated by militants in Iraq , was arrested twice for trespassing on the University of Oklahoma campus during the spring of 2000 .
Earlier , OU police had reported that he had been sleeping on couches around the campus .
He appeared to be living as a vagrant during that period .
The OUPD actually contacted him six times .
Today I gave the arrest record to the editor of The Norman Transcript .
Friday , I ascertained that Berg had been an OU employee during academic year 2000 - 2001 .
The OU personnel directory for that year listed him as a facilities attendant at the Lloyd Noble arena .
The thought crosses one 's mind that Berg might have been the one who bought the 9/11 hijacker 's airline ticket from the OU library computer terminal .
I have not been able to ascertain whether he was ever an OU library employee .
Most likely , he would have been a temp .
Still , there are things about Berg 's story which do n't add up .
Are we to believe that someone would really voluntarily surrender his email password to a stranger he met on the bus ?
This is apparently the story which Berg told the FBI to account for the fact that the password and Berg 's email address were on Moussaoui 's computer when they searched it , after 9/11 .
If Berg was the one who bought the ticket , then appearing to be a vagrant would have been a way to gain the trust of Al Qaeda , for infiltration purposes .
They would be likely to trust someone who appeared to be a misfit and alienated from mainstream American society .
Also , it has been reported that Berg had been in possession of anti-Semitic literature .
That would be another tactic for gaining the trust of Al Qaeda .
How does a one who was a vagrant in spring 2000 make the transition to independent businessman in Iraq , doing telecommunications work , in 2004 ?
Maybe with the help of funds paid by the CIA to its operatives ?
If he bought the plane ticket , then the CIA had a good reason to set him up to be snuffed : dead men tell no tales .
The execution also served the propaganda purpose of taking the focus of off American mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners .
Three different people have told me of watching a Channel 5 TV news broadcast reporting the event of the hijacker 's ticket purchase from the OU library .
During an October 2003 phone conversation , a Channel 5 employee at the news desk confirmed this , but reporter Terri Watkins later denied it .
These communications were recorded , and readers can hear them by clicking on the play button below .

University of Oklahoma Newspaper Gives Misleading Information about Berg
by Michael P. Wright
Norman , Oklahoma
5/20/04
The Oklahoma Daily misinformed its readers about Nicholas Berg in its issue of May 19 , 2004 .
The Daily reported that Berg was " listed for trespassing in the union on April 12 , 2000 . "
Norman city court records confirm that Berg was arrested twice for trespassing in April and May of that year .
The Daily did not report both arrests .
More importantly , the Daily gave the false impression that Berg was an OU student at the time of the arrest .
They quoted Danny Akins , a former co-worker with Berg at the Lloyd Noble Center , who said that " Berg often lacked a home because of OU housing problems . "
The truth is that Berg was not an OU student in the spring of 2000 .
This fact makes the reference to " OU housing problems " irrelevant .
I have obtained a document from OU Records officer Richard Skeel , who said that Berg was an OU student during the fall 1999 semester , and was not enrolled in any prior or subsequent terms .
When he was being arrested , Berg was either a vagrant or he had chosen to give the appearance of being one .
OU directory information confirms that in the fall of 2000 , he was employed as a facilities attendant at Lloyd Noble Center .
The comments from Akins suggest that he was also working there in the spring of that year .
The Oklahoma Daily , in its bungling amateurish sort of way , has inadvertently helped expose the likelihood that Nick Berg was a liar .
From whom would one expect Akins to get the idea that Berg was a student having " problems " with OU housing , in the spring of 2000 , except from Berg himself ?
The letter from the OU Records office confirms that Berg was not a student at that time .
Deception of course is the very nature of the infiltration business .
Did the CIA Have Berg Snuffed ?
His Father Said U.S. Caused Son's Death Indirectly
by Michael P. Wright
Norman , Oklahoma
5/23/04
In the May 18 column , I speculated that Nick Berg , while at the University of Oklahoma , might have been the one who bought the 9/11 hijacker 's airline ticket from the OU library computer terminal , while infiltrating Al Qaeda under CIA direction .
In that event , I said that the CIA would have a motive to set him up to be killed in Iraq because of their desire to ensure that he never disclosed this incident .
An interesting quotation by Berg 's father came to my attention today .
The Boston Herald writes : Berg 's family said U.S. officials deserved part of the blame because their son was wrongly jailed for 11 days in Mosul as violence worsened there .
If Berg had not been detained , he may have evaded the unrest , they said .
" They caused his death indirectly by detaining him , " Berg 's father Michael told reporters at his West Chester , Pa. , home .
Were the jailers instructed to put the " adventurous " Berg out on the street at a time when violence mixed with anti-occupation sentiment were known to be peaking ?
The New York Times also reports that Berg 's father has complained that U.S. officials did not do enough to protect his son .
The article mentions " accusations that the actions of the military in Iraq exposed their son to worsening danger . "
At my 9/11 website , I report that the person who purchased the hijacker 's ticket was a white American male .
A pretense of being a neo -Nazi sharing Al Qaeda 's hatred for Jews and Israel would serve as a plausible strategy for infiltrating the terrorist organization .
In its online edition of May 17 , 2004 , the Philadelphia Daily News reported that U.S. officials told them that Berg was seen to be in possession of a copy of the Koran and what they called " anti-Semitic " literature .
A link to this article is not feasible since the publication requires online viewers to register .
By the way , I do not contend with those who argue that the beheading video was a hoax .
It is quite possible that the CIA had him killed by conventional means and then orchestrated the video as a means of presenting the American audience with an " atrocity " in order to deflect attention from the prison abuse scandal .
[ Note : In case the links are taken down , the online New York Times article was dated May 13 , 2004 , and the Boston Herald article was May 12 , 2004 ]
Why Does George Tenet Have Such a Guilty Look on his Face ?
by Michael P. Wright
Norman , Oklahoma
4/15/04
CIA boss George Tenet lied to the 9/11 Commission during his April 14 testimony .
The AP reported that on that day Tenet appeared before the Commission and testified that he did not speak with President Bush in August 2001 .
On August 6 of that year , the CIA 's report led the President to believe that if any hijackings of aircraft took place , the hijackers would land the planes , make demands , and then negotiate for release of the hostages .
Obviously , this expectation was an incredible blunder , and Tenet had every interest in distancing himself from responsibility for it .
Why is n't Tenet in jail for perjury ?
The next day , the news came out that the CIA disclosed that Tenet personally briefed the President in August 2001 .
This was reported by AFP news of France .
Tenet 's lie is also exposed by this White House memo of August 25 , 2001 .
While he was conducting a tour of his Texas ranch , Bush mentioned Tenet 's visit there the day before .
This is not to excuse or defend Bush , but it is clear that in 2001 , he was leaving matters of national security and defense against terrorists in the hands of George Tenet , who was given all the room he needed to operate without close supervision from the commander - in - chief .
On April 11 , 2004 , Bush insisted that in August 2001 he was satisfied that federal agents were on top of the terrorist threat .
One can fault Bush for poor judgment in allowing his old Skull and Bones pal , Oklahoma 's former Senator David Boren , to talk him into keeping Tenet as CIA director in January 2001 , but primary responsibility for the failure to obstruct the 9/11 attack before it happened lies in the hands of Tenet and his mentor Boren .
CIA agent David Edger is also part of this gang .
Earlier the chief of surveillance over the Hamburg cell of Al Qaeda , Edger was summoned to Norman by Boren in the summer of 2001 , ostensibly to take a visiting professor post .
Edger , who was in Chile in 1973 when Allende was being overthrown , is a specialist in infiltration and covert action .
USA Today has reported that the CIA was infiltrating Al Qaeda cells .
What kind of strange brew were the three spooks cooking up ?
Why is Tenet so anxious ?
What was driving him to lie before the 9/11 Commission ?
Why does he want to distance himself from responsibility for the August 6 report ?
Why did he have his mind set on the naive expectation that hijackers would land the aircraft for hostage negotiation ?
Readers are invited to see my website for answers , details , many links , and references .

UPDATE -- The Erroneous August 6 Memo Explains Why NORAD Was Slow
4/26/04
Philip Shenon of The New York Times reported on April 25 , 2004 , that the 9/11 Commission is expected to offer " sharp criticism " of the Pentagon 's domestic air defense command ( NORAD ) in the panel 's final report .
The Commission suggests that quicker military action might have prevented the crash of a hijacked passenger jet into the Pentagon during the 9/11 attack .
The Commission seems to be forgetting the most important part of the contents of the August 6 CIA briefing , which was finally disclosed by the President in April 2004 .
The briefing , for which CIA boss Tenet would like to deny responsibility , embraced the expectation that any hijacked aircraft would be landed for a negotiation over hostages instead of crashed into buildings .
With that erroneous information circulating in the intelligence community , why is anyone surprised that NORAD was slow to respond with military aircraft that morning ?
Assessing the Alleged Terrorist Photographer of 2001
4/29/04
Some members of the 9/11 truth movement are making much ado about an article which appeared in the New York Post in July 2001 and which reported that the feds in that city let a suspected terrorist slip through their hands after he was caught taking photos of federal buildings in lower Manhattan .
The article was also summarized by The Village Voice .
This is being taken as another " smoking gun " demonstrating that Bush and his gang are liars and should be blamed for 9/11 .
I do not support Bush , but this kind of thinking seems to be far too tainted with partisanship and the goal of electing Kerry .
An effective 9/11 truth movement has to be non-partisan and leave no stone unturned in the search for dishonest and corrupt official behavior .
Is this type of " truth - seeker " willing to admit that some Democrats might be culpable too ?
The kind of photos being taken by the suspected terrorist indicates a plan for a bombing done like the one at the WTC in 1993 -- not suicide crashes of airliners .
Suicide bombers do n't need to know where the security cameras are for that .
The other possibility is that the terrorists were taking these photos as a decoy to throw U.S. intelligence off guard .
Some of the activists have accused Bush and Rice of lying under oath about questions of judgment involving their response to the August 6 , 2001 report .
Poor judgment it was , but it would be very difficult to nail them for perjury for making statements about what their assessments were regarding the significance of the report .
As shown by evidence available in the top item at this webpage , Tenet lied under oath .
That 's a clear and simple fact .
The question of his motive is a matter of judgment .
I believe it was to distance himself from responsibility for the erroneous August 6 report .
The August 6 report demonstrates that Tenet assumed that any hijacked aircraft would be landed for negotiations over hostages instead of crashed into buildings .
Why was he clinging to this illusion ?
Those who want the truth need to leave partisan concerns on the back burner and put the harsh spotlight on David Boren , George Tenet , and David Edger .
In 2001 , they were the inner circle of U.S. intelligence .
Skull & Bones Society Must Return Geronimo's Skull
5/5/04
Question : What do John Kerry , George W. Bush , and David Boren all have in common ?
Answer :
They are all three members of Skull and Bones , the Yale " secret society " which was recently the subject of research and publication by journalist Alexandra Robbins , author of Secrets of the Tomb .
The members of the organization , she discloses , believe that the ancient Greek goddess Eulogia came to inhabit their " tomb " in 1832 .
Over the years they have engaged in such vicious pranks as grave - robbing in order to present Eulogia with " tributes . "
One of the thefts was conducted in 1918 by Prescott Bush , the President 's grandfather .
When he was an officer at Ft. Sill , he robbed Geronimo 's grave and plundered it for the skull , which he brought to the Bonesmen 's clubhouse in New Haven .
She describes an unsuccessful effort by an Apache official to arrange its return .
Kerry , Bush , and Boren should all be confronted with demands that the skull be returned .
Boren , in particular , represents himself as a great admirer of American Indians .
His hypocrisy is disgusting .
Another issue is that , by accepting Eulogia as a goddess , the organization has identified itself as essentially pagan .
Roman Catholics should be demanding that Kerry either renounce Skull and Bones or be ex-communicated .
One should not be allowed to have it both ways .
Although nominally a Methodist , Boren 's pagan leanings come out in other , more subtle ways .
There 's a fellow here in Norman , Elmer Z. Million , who likes to say that Boren wakes up in a different fantasy world every day .
One of his favorites is being a Roman emperor .
Boren has built several new Roman fountains on the University of Oklahoma campus since he showed up there to be boss in 1994 .
One of them is on the large grass oval south of the main library .
It was paid for by a wealthy alumnus named Pitman .
This is what the chiseled inscription says :
Huc veni hospes ad lymphas fontis Pitmani ubi discipuli se ex laboribus studiorum reficiunt .
Translation :
Here I have come as a guest to the water of the Pitman fountain where students restore themselves after the labor of studies .
The important thing here is that the word lympha is used for water , instead of the more common aqua .
Lympha designates healing water .
Further , Lympha was the name of a rural goddess .
Adding two and two , this suggests that Boren wants us to believe the water has divine , magical qualities .
Microsoft finally announced KIN , a new Windows
Phone designed specifically for people who are actively navigating their social lives .
The phone is brought to life through partnerships with Verizon Wireless , Vodafone and Sharp .
KIN supports Microsoft ’s new cloud computing service with an optimized GUI .
The hardware design was developed in partnership with Sharp .
There are two models called KIN ONE and KIN TWO .
Both phones feature a touch screen , slide - out keyboard and very simple interface .
ONE is small and compact ; TWO has a larger screen and keyboard , in addition to more memory , a higher resolution camera , and the ability to record high - definition video .
The 5 and 8 megapixel cameras in ONE and TWO , respectively , have image stabilization and a bright LumiLED flash .
KIN automatically brings together feeds from Microsoft and third - party services such as Facebook , MySpace and Twitter .
The home screen of the phone is called the KIN Loop , which is always up to date and always on , showing all the things happening in someone ’s social world .
Another new feature , the KIN Spot is a new way for people to share what ’s going on in their world .
It lets them focus first on the people and stuff they want to share rather than the specific application they want to use .
Videos , photos , text messages , Web pages , location and status updates are shared by simply dragging them to a single place on the phone called the Spot .
Once all the people and content are in the Spot to share , the consumer can choose how to share , and start broadcasting .
KIN Studio is a phone online .
Almost everything created on the phone is available in the cloud from any Web browser .
Photos and videos are freed from the confines of the phone and presented in an online visual timeline .
The KIN Studio automatically backs up texts , call history , photos , videos and contacts , and populates a personalized digital journal .
It also gives customers tons of storage to keep all those photos , videos , contacts and texts .
KIN will be the first Windows Phone to feature a Zune experience — including music , video , FM radio and podcast playback .
With a Zune Pass subscription , users using Zune software on their PC can listen to millions of songs from Zune Marketplace on their KIN while on the go .
KIN will be exclusively available from Verizon Wireless in the U.S. beginning in May and from Vodafone this autumn in Germany , Italy , Spain and the United Kingdom .
It was for decades the most enduring piece of ephemera in New York City and is still among the most recognizable .
Trim , blue and white , it fits neatly in the hand , sized so its contents can be downed in a New York minute .
It is as vivid an emblem of the city as the Statue of Liberty , beloved of property masters who need to evoke Gotham at a glance in films and on television .
It is , of course , the Anthora , the cardboard cup of Grecian design that has held New Yorkers ’ coffee securely for nearly half a century .
Introduced in the 1960s , the Anthora was long made by the hundreds of millions annually , nearly every cup destined for the New York area .
A pop-cultural totem , the Anthora has been enshrined in museums ; its likeness has adorned tourist memorabilia like T - shirts and ceramic mugs .
Like many once - celebrated artifacts , though , the cup may now be endangered , the victim of urban gentrification .
The Anthora seems to have been here forever , as if bestowed by the gods at the city ’s creation .
But in fact , it was created by man — one man in particular , a refugee from Nazi Europe named Leslie Buck .
Once the gold particles are well distributed and widely attached to the parasite , the laser heats up the gold , incinerating the parasites .
According to the researchers , the laser could be tuned to the so - called " tissue window " , a wavelength of light to which the human body appears transparent .
That way , the laser can pass harmlessly through the skin , burning up the parasites along the way .
I just finished researching how to achieve persistent sessions with Compojure .
The default way of doing things did n’t really look appealing to me .
This whole threadsafeness business is more of a hindrance than an asset when it comes to web development IMO .
Sandbar ‘s stateful sessions looked just like what I want from session handling though so I decided to try it out .
To get things to work this time I had to basically replace the contents of my lib folder I ’ve used for the prior tutorials in this series with the ones from sandbar , the dependency hell saga continues .
A really crappy and frustrating feature of Java development it seems .
( ns hello - world ( :use compojure.core ring.adapter.jetty sandbar.stateful-session ) ) ( defroutes main - routes ( GET " / fname * " [ fname ] ( do ( session - put ! : name fname ) ( str fname " was put in the session . " ) ) ) ( GET " / hi* " [ ] ( str " Hi " ( session - get : name " unknown " ) ) ) ( ANY " * " [ ] {:status 404 , : body " < h1 > Page not found < / h1 > " } ) ) ( def app ( -> main - routes wrap - stateful - session ) ) ( run-jetty ( var app ) {: join ? false : port 8080} )
So if you first go to http://localhost:8080/hi you will get “ Hi unknown ” , then go to http://localhost:8080/fname/?fname=henrik and back to http://localhost:8080/hi and you get “ Hi henrik ” .

Nothing is more exciting than the promise of a story in your head , but in order to get it on the page you need to figure out exactly what you need to do to make it work .
Here are 4 steps to help you build the framework of your story .
by N.M. Kelby
Nothing is more exciting than the promise of a story in your head , but in order to get it on the page you need to figure out exactly what you need to do to make it work .
You need to realistically outline and throw out what bogs the readers down .
You need to set up a game plan to hook your readers and keep them reading .
Here are some simple steps to help you build the frame that you hang your story on .
STEP 1 . ALWAYS BEGIN WITH YOUR PROTAGONIST .
The readers need to discover who the hero is and why they should root for him .
Introduce your protagonist , either directly or indirectly , within the first 300 words .
STEP 2 . ESTABLISH TIME AND PLACE .
Your readers should know exactly where they are .
If they are wondering , they lose focus and may stop reading .
They have to trust that you are in control of the story .
Nobody likes to be left alone in the dark .
STEP 3 . ANNOUNCE THE STAKES .
Great prose will go a long way — about 2,500 words , more or less .
After that , even the most literary readers want to know why they ’re reading .
Just a simple sentence can do the trick .
At the end of the first section of The Things They Carried , Tim O’Brien writes of the letters that Jimmy Cross received from a girl back home named Martha .
He mentions that they ’re signed “ Love , Martha , ” but acknowledges that using the word “ love ” is a custom and not anything more .
At the end of this section , O’Brien writes , “ Slowly , a bit distracted , he would get up and move among his men , checking the perimeter , then at full dark he would return to his hole and watch the night and wonder if Martha was a virgin . ”
Right there , the author lets us know what ’s really on the mind — and at the heart of the story — of this young man who is so very far away from home .
STEP 4 . ORGANIZE .
Once you have your story structured around the beginning you ’ve set in place , look at all the bits of writing you ’ve done and all the notes you ’ve taken and ask yourself one simple question : “ Where the heck was I going with this ? ”
If you do n’t know , or if where you ’re going now does n’t match where you were going when you set out , focus on better defining those areas before you go any further .

Oil from a leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico began washing ashore in the southern US state of Louisiana , threatening an ecological disaster , a local official told AFP .
Blown by strong southeast winds , a sheen of oil reached the fragile coastal wetlands of South Pass late Thursday near the mouth of the Mississippi river , said Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , where the oil first hit the shoreline .

It marks the beginning of what environmentalists fear could be one of the worst US ecological disasters in years , with experts still unable to cap the ruptured underwater well which federal officials estimate is spewing about 200,000 gallons of oil per day into the Gulf .
An officer with the US Coast Guard , which is helping coordinate the response to the widening disaster , late Thursday would not confirm that the oil had reached the Louisiana coastline .
“ We have BP teams out in the field trying to confirm those reports . ” Coast Guard Petty Officer Erik Swanson said .
The US government declared a national disaster Thursday as the giant oil slick threatened to wreak economic and environmental havoc along hundreds of miles of the US Gulf Coast , following a deadly explosion April 20 on an oil rig leased by British Petroleum ( BP ) .
The rig collapsed two days later , and three leaks were discovered in the well head and the riser pipe that had connected the rig to the well more than 5,000 feet ( 1,500 meters ) below the surface .

The Gulf Coast region is teeming with hundreds of species of wildlife , and is also home to a massive fishing and seafood industry which experts warn could be ruined should authorities fail to prevent the spill from spreading .

How to Deal with Complaints — 7 Steps
How do you deal with someone who complains — whether it ’s a customer of your company , a customer of your department , or even an employee or family member ?
How do you turn the complainer into a supporter ?
Here are some steps to take :
1. Listen
If you ’re going to make the complaint go away , then first you have to listen to what the complainer has to say .
Take notes so the complainer will see that you ’re serious .
If there is a factual basis to the complaint then get those facts using the old reporter ’s list of questions : who , what , where , why , when , how .
If there ’s no factual basis — it ’s just the way the customer “ feels ” — then try to determine why the customer feels that way .
2. Take Responsibility
If it ’s a problem you ’ve caused ( or your department has caused ) , then take responsibility for the problem .
Even if there ’s the slightest chance that your department has caused the problem , you still need to take at least partial responsibility .
Many times the customer will be much happier just having someone acknowledge that the problem exists , even if there ’s nothing you can do about it .
3. Apologize
Acknowledge the customer ’s feelings .
Say something like “ I ’m sorry you feel that way ” or “ I ’m sorry you ’re having difficulties ” even if your department did n’t cause the problem .
Showing empathy puts you on the same team as the customer and lets you work together to solve the problem .
4. Offer a Solution If a Solution Exists
Some problems have immediate solutions — or at least workarounds .
If a solution or workaround exists , then offer it .
5. Offer a Future Solution
If a solution is coming in the future , then tell the customer .
But be careful not to build false hopes or commit to something that ca n’t be delivered .
Do n’t be specific about a date unless you ’re absolutely sure , and even then you should use qualifying terms .
For example , you could say , “ We expect this problem to be solved in the v3.0 release which is currently scheduled for next June .
But if difficulties are encountered then the solution may not appear until the software release after that . ”
6. Deal with Disappointment
Many times a customer will be unhappy with news of a future solution .
After all , the customer has the problem now and wants it solved immediately .
Let the customer know if there ’s something that he / she can do to influence the priority of the solution .
Would a letter or email to the right person help ?
Could the solution be implemented sooner if other tasks were delayed ?
Help a disappointed customer deal with the priority issues .
7. Follow Up Later
Add the customer to a list of follow - ups related to the particular problem the customer is having .
When a solution is implemented , let the customer know .
If the solution is moved up in priority ( or down in priority ) , let the customer know as well .
Keeping the customer informed will go a long way toward turning an irate customer into a supporter .
When the Complaint Is n’t Something in Your Area
Many non-work - related complaints fall into this category .
It ’s not your fault that the government is doing this and not that .
It ’s not your fault that human nature causes people to make mistakes — sometimes huge mistakes .
Here ’s what I think about people who complain about this sort of stuff :
They see people and organizations doing things that they fundamentally disagree with ( or just do n’t understand ) , and they do n’t like it .
They feel helpless and out of control .
Many times they ’re afraid .
They talk about their concerns because it makes them less afraid .
Talking about a fear — sharing the fear with others — makes them feel like they ’re not alone in having the fear .
These people are not looking to solve a problem .
They ’re not looking for the truth .
They ’re just looking for a companion in fear — someone who can acknowledge the fear and make them feel better .
Fear is the difference between a solution - seeker and a complainer .
Sometimes you have to recognize the fear , validate it , and separate it from the problem before you can begin to actually seek a solution .
Researchers in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Thomas Jefferson University have found that the level of a single protein in the tiny roundworm C. elegans determines how long it lives .
Worms born without this protein , called arrestin , lived about one - third longer than normal , while worms that had triple the amount of arrestin lived one - third less .
The research also showed that arrestin interacts with several other proteins within cells to regulate longevity .
The human version of one of these proteins is PTEN , a well - known tumor suppressor .
The study , to be published in the online edition of the Journal of Biological Chemistry , was chosen by the journal as the " Paper of the Week " -- considered in the top one percent of published articles .
Because most proteins in worms have human counterparts , these findings may have relevance to human biology and the understanding of cancer development , said Jeffrey L. Benovic , Ph.D. , professor and chair of the department .
" The links we have found in worms suggest the same kind of interactions occur in mammals although human biology is certainly more complicated .
We have much work to do to sort out these pathways , but that is our goal , " said Dr. Benovic .
Researchers use the roundworm as a model because it offers a simple system to study the function of genes and proteins that are relevant to human biology .
The worm , for example , has one arrestin gene , whereas humans have four .
Worms only have 302 neurons compared to the 100 billion or so in the human brain .
In addition , their short lifespan of two to three weeks allows for timely observation of effects on longevity .
Dr. Benovic and the study 's first author , Aimee Palmitessa , Ph.D. , a postdoctoral research fellow , studied signaling pathways activated by G protein - coupled receptors .
These receptors bind to all kinds of hormones , sensory stimuli ( such as light , odorants and tastants ) , neurotransmitters , etc. , which then activate a cascade of signals inside the cell .
They regulate many physiological processes and are the target for about half of the drugs currently on the market .

" When it comes to receptors , worms are actually more complex , " said Dr. Benovic .
" Humans have about 800 different kinds of G protein - coupled receptors while the worm has about 1,800 .
It relies upon these receptors to respond to sensory stimuli as well as various neurotransmitters and hormones . "
Arrestins were initially found to turn off the activation of G protein - coupled receptors inside cells .
" Their name comes from the fact that they arrest the activity of receptors , so the worm offers a good way to study how its single arrestin protein interacts with protein receptors , " says Dr. Benovic .
Two of the four arrestins that humans have are devoted to regulating receptors that respond to visual stimuli while the other two regulate most other receptors .
In this study , Dr. Palmitessa deleted the single arrestin gene in worms to see what would happen , and found , to her surprise , that these worms lived significantly longer .
She also found that over - expressing arrestin in worms shortened their lifespan .
" A little less arrestin is good -- at least for worms , " Dr. Benovic reported .
This is n't the first discovery made regarding longevity in worms .
Researchers have already found that activity of the insulin - like growth factor - 1 ( IGF - 1 ) receptor can influence longevity in worms -- a finding that has also been replicated in fruit flies , mice , and humans .
Like arrestin , a little less IGF - 1 receptor activity is good , Dr. Benovic explained .
Further research has shown that caloric restriction can also reduce IGF - 1 receptor activation and , conversely , over - expression of the IGF - 1 receptor is found in some human cancers .
In this study , Dr. Benovic and Dr. Palmitessa dug a little deeper and found that in the worms , arrestin interacted with two other proteins that play a critical role in its ability to regulate longevity .
One of those proteins is the tumor suppressor PTEN ; mutations in PTEN are involved in a number of different cancers .
Dr. Benovic said the connection between human arrestin and PTEN is not clear .
" We do n't know at this point if human arrestins regulate PTEN function or if anything happens to arrestin levels during the development of cancer , " he said .
" Do increasing levels turn off more PTEN , thus promoting cancer , or do levels decrease and allow PTEN to be more active ?
" If it turns out to be the first scenario -- that increasing amounts of arrestin turn off the tumor suppressor activity of PTEN , then it may be possible to selectively inhibit that process , " he says .
" We have some interesting work ahead . "
The study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health .
In the early 1970s , Hannah Blue Heron was starting her life over .
Blue Heron , who was coming to terms with the fact that she was a lesbian , was in her late 40s and had recently left a Catholic convent ; some friends invited her to join them at a commune in Oregon .
While it did n't prove to be the best example of communal living , it was enough for Blue Heron to realize that she liked much of what the counter - culture movement offered .
After trying communes in a co-ed setting , Blue Heron , now 83 , moved to Corvallis , Ore. , for a few years and ran a small business , baking and selling protein bars through a local food co-op .
She eventually sold the business to move to a women 's - only commune near Wolf Creek in Southern Oregon .
" It was womyn's land .
It was the first time I saw a woman going around without a shirt .
I found out how beautiful breasts were — large , small .
It was a magical time for me , " says Blue Heron , with a broad smile across her face .
Penelope Starr and Luanne Withee first heard Blue Heron 's life story while videotaping her as part of " A Colorful Life , " a storytelling series on LGBT community elders then sponsored by Wingspan , Tucson 's LGBT community center .
Starr is probably best known around Tucson as the founder and director of Odyssey Storytelling , a monthly storytelling event .
Starr at the time was working for Wingspan 's Senior Pride program , and Withee — who then worked as Wingspan 's community - center coordinator — felt their elders ' stories needed to be shared .
" If we do n't do this , no one else will , " says Withee , who now works in membership development for the Loft Cinema .
Starr and Withee say that when they heard Blue Heron 's story , they were particularly intrigued by her tales about the womyn's land movement — a part of lesbian and feminist history they did n't know much about .
As Blue Heron shared everything — from coming out to finding love in her 70s with her current partner — she explained how she eventually left the Pacific Northwest for the dryer environs of Tucson 's own womyn's land , called Adobeland .
" When we were doing ' A Colorful Life , ' it was interesting for a younger lesbian to hear how hard it was to be queer back in the day — it is very moving and inspirational , " says Withee .
" So when the subject of Adobeland came up , here is a subject that I have never heard of .
I consider myself to be pretty sophisticated ; I 've lived mostly in big cities , but I had never heard of womyn's land .
I had never heard of lesbian separatists , and I had no concept of what that even meant .
" As I 've heard stories now , I get it :
They had felt oppressed by men previously , and their reaction to that was to become separatists .
I think a lot ( of lesbians ) might not agree with it anymore , but it was part of this movement .
I 'm so intrigued and interested in documenting this , because if I had never heard of it , I bet a lot of other people have n't , either . "
Although the LGBT elder - story series is no longer part of the post - Great Recession , trimmed - back Wingspan , Starr and Withee have continued to find seniors to interview , and they 've created a new organization , StoryArts Group ( www.storyartsgroup.org), that encompasses the " A Colorful Life " series , Odyssey Storytelling and a documentary - filmmaking arm .
And Adobeland is the focus of the documentary arm 's first project .
When Starr and Withee started the Adobeland project , they brought in Withee 's partner , Pat Woelke , a former Wingspan staff member who helped develop Senior Pride , a program for Tucson 's LGBT seniors .
The trio thought their documentary was going to focus on the property 's owner , a woman everyone called Adobe .
Adobe was the name chosen by Joan Pepper , a retired Tucson physical - education teacher who purchased the land , west of Gates Pass in the Tucson Mountains , more than 30 years ago .
Many Adobeland residents and visitors adhered to a womyn's - land custom of taking a " post- patriarchal " name .
Starr says many people described Pepper as charismatic and strong .
However , Pepper suffered a stroke about five years ago , leaving her paralyzed on the left side of her body .
She was forced to leave Adobeland and now lives in an assisted - care facility in Tucson .
" We thought the documentary would be about Adobe , and we went to visit her in order to get permission to visit the land .
We told her what we wanted to do ; she thought that was amazing .
But at that first meeting , and then at subsequent meetings with women who had lived there , ( we realized there ) was a bigger story that needed to be told , " Withee says .
Over the past year , the filmmakers have reached out to interview dozens of women around the world .
While some women did n't feel comfortable talking about Adobeland and felt their stories should remain private , many others have been grateful to have their stories told , Starr says .
Withee says they 've heard a wide variety of tales .
" I think because Adobeland is a place with a 30 - year history , and it was so many things for so many different women , ( the commune life ) evolved and changed depending on who was there at the time .
Some people were there for only a few weeks or months , and others several years at a time , " Withee says .
Those who refused to be interviewed or filmed offered a variety of reasons for saying no , but Starr says she thinks that most women did n't feel safe identifying with Adobeland , with womyn's land — or even with being lesbian .
" They felt that they can't be associated with a lesbian project , for whatever reason , which I think is part of the story .
We heard from women that , ( for example ) , ' It 's not safe for me ( with a job ) in education . '
It 's not safe for numbers of different women to come out as a lesbian or even be associated with a lesbian project , " Starr says .
" Also , another thing we are finding is that some women went there because they were wounded , and they needed a place to heal , and they may not want that stuff to come up again .
But ( other ) women are finding us and saying , ' I was there for two weeks .
I have to talk to you about this .
It changed my life . '
If people are hesitant , we are respectful , and I think that 's helped people feel comfortable . "
Withee says that when she 's visited Adobeland , she 's been asked to turn off her camera at times — and she 's never hesitated .
Sometimes , taking that extra step of showing respect has paid off , she says .
" Women who 've said no to us at first have reconnected with us , because we ended up talking to their friend , and they said , ' They really are good , and they have good intentions , ' " Withee says .
One former Adobeland resident who agreed to be interviewed is Kate Randall , co-owner of Antigone Books on Fourth Avenue .
" Kate Randall 's story is great , " Withee says .
" She was reading a book about womyn's community and womyn's land .
I guess in this book are some references to Adobeland .
She said something that attracted her ( to Adobeland ) was that there were n't too many rules .
We learned that at the different lands , there were different rules .
At no time did Adobeland have real rules , and that 's what caused people both joy and frustration .
...
Some people wanted structure , clearly , and others did n't want rules . "
Randall says the ideals behind communal living attracted her to womyn's land .
At 23 , after college , she traveled to a womyn's land in Tennessee and then another in Mississippi before heading to the Southwest for a womyn's land in New Mexico .
" I was interested in living in the country , and these places were rural , " Randall says .
" I liked the idea of living communally .
When I was in college , it was really exciting to read about these womyn's lands .
It gave you a feel for different ways women were organizing then , and what was working and not working , " Randall says .
Those rules — or , rather , that lack of rules — proved to be important to Randall , who lived at Adobeland for more than two years .
" Sometimes , women were hammering out rules years before they bought the land , " Randall says about other womyn's lands .
At Adobeland , residents met once a month to discuss issues — usually regarding maintenance — but there were n't a lot of discussions on how people had to live , like she saw at other womyn's lands , where residents may have argued , for example , about vegetarianism , or whether to allow males on the property — even male children .
Like Blue Heron , Randall looks back at her years on womyn's lands — and specifically , at Adobeland — as some of the best times of her life .
" It was so wonderful .
... I loved the desert and had never been here before , " Randall says .
" I was really drawn to the desert and the way Adobeland seemed to be—very , very friendly , and not too uptight .
What was wonderful about it was a loose community of neighbors who did get together for potlucks or helped each other with projects on the land , like the garden , or building the bathhouse .
And it was such a great atmosphere with a lot of creativity .
...
We had a group that shared writing , music and art . "
When Randall first arrived at Adobeland , she lived in a tent , and then in a little cabin someone else had built ; eventually , she moved into a rammed - earth structure .
During that time , Randall and others started Tucson 's first lesbian - feminist magazine , LunaSea , which included illustrations of life on Adobeland .
One illustration shows the way a lot of people , like Randall , moved : using a wheelbarrow .
The picture is called " Moving Day . "
Randall and Blue Heron at one point lived at Adobeland at the same time , and Randall remembers when Blue Heron , at 60 years old , used her own hands to dig out a large hole to build her own rammed - earth structure .
" It was amazing .
She had a little help from two other older women .
I took a photo of them — three crones .
It was this incredible , huge place she built , " Randall says .
Randall says there was also a spirituality at Adobeland for people who were interested in getting in touch with the land .
The moon was an important part of life on the property ; for the first time in her life , Randall says , she became aware of the cycles of the moon — because its light made it easier to get around at night .
Telling these stories for the documentary has been enjoyable for Randall ; she loves the fact that three women who do n't have a history with womyn's land wanted to tell Adobeland 's story .
" They are really interested in it , and because they come to it with a fresh perspective , it 's so much fun to think about that time again , " Randall says .
While Randall spent two years of her life at Adobeland , Blue Heron spent almost 20 years there , after arriving in the mid-1980s .
Blue Heron says she met Adobe in Oregon , while Joan Pepper escaped Tucson summers for cooler womyn's lands up north .
" I remember teaching her tai chi , " Blue Heron remembers about Adobe .
" She 's an athlete .
She just looked beautiful following through on the motions . "
The thought of moving to Tucson did n't dawn on Blue Heron until she helped a friend make the trek to Tucson .
She noticed the fibromyalgia she suffered from in Oregon was drastically reduced , and the next year , she decided to make the move herself .
At first , Blue Heron shared a trailer with Adobe , but she realized that in order to remain friends , she needed to build her own place .
She bought an acre of the property from Adobe , and during an early summer after Adobe left for cooler Oregon , Blue Heron started work on her home .
" I dug out a 17 - foot circle that was 4 or 5 feet deep , at age 60 , with a pick shovel and wheelbarrow , " says Blue Heron , with a little disbelief in her voice .
" I think the whole thing was a back - to - the - land movement .
There were hippies and communes , and I think womyn's lands were just a part of it .
I think it was an important part of history , and it is still an important part . "
While Blue Heron says she still loves Adobeland , she sold her acre about seven years ago after she fell in love with her partner in Tucson .
A couple of years ago , Blue Heron went back to visit , and was saddened to see a lot of the land trashed , and many of the buildings in disrepair .
" I could n't get out of there fast enough , " Blue Heron says .
Blue Heron continues to meet with the writers ' group she started at Adobeland , has published four books , and is finishing a CD of music she wrote and recorded in a studio / office at the retirement - community home she shares with her partner .
" Life is fine .
I feel very fortunate for an almost - 84 - year - old woman .
My philosophy has been that as you lose your ability to do something in one area , you throw your heart into others , " Blue Heron says .
With Adobe living in an assisted - living center , the nine acres no longer have an owner living on site , although several women still live there part - time .
Starr says the land continues to be promoted in some lesbian publications as a womyn's land , so people still come there to camp or live , albeit temporarily .
" When Kate first moved ( to Adobeland ) , it was nine acres , and there was an adjoining property that did n't have anyone living on it , and they were pretty isolated .
Now , it 's just trailer , trailer , trailer , trailer .
The whole idea of being isolated is gone .
The world is now there , " Withee says .
As for Adobeland 's future , perhaps the property will be sold to another lesbian or lesbians to continue the womyn's land tradition .
Or perhaps Adobe 's next of kin could sell the land to non-lesbians .
While they saw the same trashed - out areas that Blue Heron saw the last time she visited Adobeland , Starr and Withee say they also witnessed the magic that brought people there .
" When I was out there the second or third time filming , Pat and Penelope were off interviewing someone , and I was wandering around , just getting footage , and I just started crying .
Things out there are rusted , and it 's obvious that in some areas , no one has treaded there in a long time .
There 's a house called the group house , and the sign is askew , and it 's not a group house anymore .
I think about the fun they had , and what could have been , and the great time I could have had , too , " Withee says .
" This is the saddest thing in the world , yet when I 'm there , I feel the joy that once was .
The women told us , ' We used to have a big bonfire and go naked and play guitar . '
When I hear those stories , I romanticize it , and I recognize those are the happy times , and there were bad times , too .
" It just seems like such a passionate and wonderful place . "

Canada 's top military commander is rejecting a claim that Canadian soldiers killed an unarmed Afghan teenager three years ago , an accusation that emerged at a parliamentary committee hearing earlier this week .
A former military translator told a parliamentary committee on April 14 that his information was second - hand , but said he had heard that Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan shot a teenager in the back of the head and then tried to cover up the death .
The translator and interpreter , Ahmadshah Malgarai , worked for the Canadian Forces in Kandahar , and claims they were in cahoots with Afghanistan 's notorious security service .
Late Friday night , Chief of Defence Staff Gen. Walter Natynczyk released a letter written to the Special Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan , saying the June 18 - 19 , 2007 raid did not happen the way the translator described in his testimony .
He said that the events were well documented , and the killing was justified .
" The compound was suspected to be a staging area for rocket attacks against Kandahar airfield as well as improvised explosive device attacks against Canadian and coalition soldiers , " he stated in the letter .
The compound had been under surveillance for almost a year before the raid , and the person who fired the shot was someone " providing support to the operation . "
" During the mission an armed individual posed a direct and imminent threat to Canadian Forces soldiers as they entered the compound , " Natynczyk wrote to committee chair Kevin Sorenson .
" A shooter who was providing support to the operation identified the individual and assessed that he was a threat , and shot the individual .
The acts of the shooter were an appropriate application of the rules of engagement and saved the lives of a number of Canadian Forces members that night . "
Natynczyk said in his statement that 10 prisoners were taken during the raid , and nine of them tested positive for explosives residue .
Two of them made allegations that coalition troops planted a weapon on a deceased insurgent .
" It is worth noting that one of the two individuals later retracted his allegation , " the general said .
Malgarai had alleged in his testimony that the prisoners were innocent civilians , and that the soldiers rounded them up as part of a cover - up operation .
" After the Canadian Forces wrongly killed a man , they panicked .
They swept through the neighbourhood , arresting people for no reason , " he said .
Malgarai also claimed in his testimony that an Afghan security commander suggested that a Canadian diplomat shoot a wounded detainee instead of handing him over to authorities .
" Colonel Yassin removed his pistol put it on the table and said ‘ here 's my gun , go shoot him , give me the body and I will justify it for you ' . "
While the Conservative government first dismissed his evidence as second - hand , Laurie Hawn , parliamentary secretary to the Defence Minister , later confirmed the gun incident by saying the threat was just bravado on the part of an Afghan working for the National Directorate of Security .
" The NDS official in question did not propose murder .
He was dramatic , I assume , " Hawn told reporters .
Natynczyk said the Canadian Forces national investigation service is conducting an assessment and urged anyone with information about the raid to come forward to give a sworn statement .
BUENOS AIRES ( Reuters ) - Argentina ’s lower house passed on Wednesday a gay marriage bill that , if also approved by senators , will put the South American country among a handful in the world that allow homosexual couples to marry .
Small groups of gay rights supporters and opponents of the marriage bill gathered outside Congress where deputies approved the measure with 125 votes in favour and 109 against after 12 hours of heated debate .
“ Love is n’t owned by heterosexuals , ” said Deputy Felipe Sola , who backed the bill .
“ If we ’re all equal before the law , why do we want to give a different name to unions between same - sex couples ? ”
The bill permits gay couples to adopt children for the first time , one of its most controversial provisions .
If the law is passed in the upper house , Argentina would be the first country in predominantly Roman Catholic Latin America to allow same - sex marriages .
Neighbouring Uruguay grants extensive rights , including adoptions , to gay couples in civil unions but does not allow them to marry .
Mexico City is the only other place in Latin America where gays have the same marriage and adoption rights as heterosexual couples .
With regard to the bill ’s chances of passing the Senate , Maria Rachid , president of the Argentine Federation of Lesbians , Gays , Bisexuals and Transsexuals , told Reuters on Tuesday : “ We ’ve talked to the heads of the political blocs ( in the Senate ) and the majority are in favour of this , so we think we could get a favourable vote in the Senate as well . ”
Catholic Church leaders in the region have described gay marriage as “ perverse ” and immoral , but the marriage bill has not sparked much public controversy in Argentina .
Argentina ’s cosmopolitan capital , Buenos Aires , is known among foreign tourists as being gay friendly , with some bars , hotels and shops catering to that clientele .
Five gay Argentine couples have already gotten married in recent months after local judges authorized the ceremonies .
In Congress , the different parties and factions gave their members freedom to vote how they wanted on the marriage bill .
Deputies from President Cristina Fernandez ’s faction and a diverse range of opposition groups , from the rightist PRO to the leftist Civic Coalition and the centrist Radical Civic Union all supported the bill .
Among the small number of countries in the world that permit gay marriage are the Netherlands , Sweden , Portugal and Canada .
In the United States , gay couples can get married in five states and in Washington , D.C. , although most states have bans in effect .
Conservatives rounded on their shadow home secretary today after he attracted fresh concern about intolerance at the top of the party by saying owners of bed and breakfasts should be allowed to turn away gay couples .
Colleagues of Chris Grayling sought to limit the damage done by his comments , made to a thinktank last week , that he believed individuals running B& Bs from their homes should be allowed to turn homosexual guests away .
Increasing speculation that he would not become the home secretary should the Tories win the election , one shadow minister said today : " There 's an attempt [ by Labour ] to suggest Grayling 's comments reveal party - wide homophobia , whereas the real reason this is running is that Chris Grayling is just not up to the job . "
On Wednesday Grayling was recorded as saying : " I think we need to allow people to have their own consciences .
I personally always took the view that , if you look at the case of should a Christian hotel owner have the right to exclude a gay couple from a hotel , I took the view that if it's a question of somebody who 's doing a B &B in their own home , that individual should have the right to decide who does and who does n't come into their own home . "
Today the Tories fielded a minimal defence of their shadow home secretary , only pointing to Grayling 's own statement and highlighting that these comments were not an expression of his current point of view but a recollection of his previous opinion .
He had since changed his mind , reflected in his more recent vote in favour of legislation banning B&B owners from discriminating against gay people , the party said .
The recorded comments emerged on the eve of a general election in which the Tory party is attempting to woo Liberal voters and gain seats in the south currently held by the Liberal Democrats by proving it will be tougher on discrimination and embrace equality .
Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell called on Grayling to apologise and said Cameron needed to speak out on the issue .
On Friday Mirek Topolánek resigned as head of the ODS party in the Czech Republic for homophobic remarks .
The ODS party has worked with the Conservatives to create the new anti-federal grouping in the European parliament in which both the Tories and ODS now both sit .
In a recent interview with Gay Times , Cameron was unable to recall that his MEPs have voted against European legislation that would protect homosexuals from discrimination .
Labour seized on the comments , saying Grayling was not fit to be home secretary .
Ben Bradshaw , the culture secretary , said : " What is critical at this election is whether David Cameron is for real and whether his party has actually changed .
Yet again the mask has slipped showing the Conservatives have n't . "
Defending his comments , Grayling said : " Any suggestion that I am against gay rights is wholly wrong – it is a matter of record that I voted for civil partnerships .
I also voted in favour of the legislation that prohibited bed and breakfast owners from discriminating against gay people .
However , this is a difficult area and on Wednesday I made comments which reflected my view that we must be sensitive to the genuinely held principles of faith groups in this country .
But the law is now clear on this issue , I am happy with it and would not wish to see it changed . "
But Tory blogger Iain Dale criticised the shadow home secretary for presenting the Labour party with an open goal , and also took issue with Grayling 's argument about being sensitive to faith groups .
He said in his blog : " I fundamentally disagree with him on the main issue .
This is not about property rights .
If you open your house to paying guests , it is no longer just your house .
" Do I believe Chris Grayling is homophobic ?
No , I do not .
Do I believe that his views , as expressed , will be damaging .
Yes I do .
" I do not think we must be sensitive to faith groups who promote discrimination and bigotry .
We would n't be sensitive to groups who provoke racial discrimination , so why should we be sensitive to those who appear to condone sexual discrimination ...
He is shadow home secretary and will have to defend himself .
Because I am afraid I can't . "
Grayling had been known as the Cameroons ' messenger to middle England .
But he has run into trouble , most notably at last year 's
Tory party conference when he criticised the appointment of Sir Richard Dannatt , the former chief of the army , as an adviser as a stunt .
He thought the government was hiring Dannatt but later discovered that it was actually his own party .
Case study
Keith Flood , retired
I will have been with my partner for 40 years , next year .
From the start of our relationship , we 've been on holiday all over the place : Paris , London , the Lake District .
It was always amusing in the Lakes when you went as part of a group somewhere and you would see people trying to work out who was with who .
We have never experienced any huge problems with discrimination , but I do remember a time in a rather nice hotel in Harrogate about 12 or so years ago .
My partner was checking in , while I parked the car .
When I arrived there was some sort of mild panic as the young man realised that we were two men and he only had a room with a double bed to offer us .
We reassured him that was perfectly fine .
There was another occasion in Scotland when there was a slight raising of eyebrows as we were checking in .
But it 's very much in my makeup to say : " So what ? "
If I feel there is a problem , I just confront it .
I think in the past we would always head for places that were gay - friendly , but that was more for fun than to avoid confrontation .
Anyway , now you do n't even think about it .
There used to be that slight nervous apprehension , but nowadays there is no embarrassment at all .
For Chris Grayling to say it 's OK to discriminate just feels like he is 50 years out of date .
Still , it has become easier in all aspects of life – insurance , flights , next - of - kin .
In my lifetime , the major social changes , such as gay rights , have come under a Labour government .
Tony Blair changed the Tory party ; he made it far more acceptable [ to be gay ] .
I can't imagine the Tories going back on that now , even if David Cameron does n't have a particularly good record on gay rights .
As far as B& Bs are concerned , I think the idea that anyone running a business should even think of asking about your sexuality is absurd .
What on earth has it got to do with them ?
What do they ask ?
" Are you planning to touch each other ? "
Our money is just as good as anyone else 's .
If you are offering a service , you have no right to impose your so - called moral values on others .

Nicolle Earley was just 16 when she killed the Fife grandmother A teenage girl has been jailed for life for killing a Fife grandmother during a row over £ 5 and a borrowed cigarette .
Nicolle Earley - one of Scotland 's youngest female murderers - was 16 when she killed Ann Gray in her home in Crosshill on 14 November 2008 .
At the High Court in Edinburgh , Earley , now 18 , was ordered to serve a minimum of 14 years in prison .
The victim 's family said the sentence was " a joke " and said Earley should have had a minimum term of 30 years .
Mrs Gray , 63 , died as a result of a head injury after she was knocked to the ground and repeatedly stamped on .
Earley pleaded guilty to the murder last month .
Judge Lady Dorrian said she had reduced the minimum sentence from 15 years because of Earley 's guilty plea .
The judge said : " There is only one sentence I can pass following a plea of guilty to murder and that is detention for life . "
Outside court , Mrs Gray 's daughters said they hoped Earley would never be freed from custody .
Anne - Marie McLeod , 44 , said she was " very angry " following the hearing .
Ann Gray was well known in the Crosshill community " Fourteen years , it 's nothing .
It 's shocking , it really is , " she said .
Ms McLeod said she would have liked to have seen a minimum sentence of 20 to 30 years for her mother 's murder .
She added : " Obviously that was n't going to happen .
I hope she never gets out .
She does n't deserve it .
" There 's no justice today . "
Andrena Gray , 37 , added : " It 's a joke .
My mum 's life was worth more than that .
The justice system 's a joke . "
Unemployed Earley was living with her grandmother , who stayed in the same street as Mrs Gray and was friends with the victim , at the time of the murder .
Advocate depute Morag Jack said that on the day before the fatal attack Mrs Gray had apparently borrowed a cigarette from Earley on the understanding she would get two in return the next day .
Ms Jack said Earley left her grandmother 's home to go to see Mrs Gray " to retrieve the cigarettes she was owed " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" When the deceased came to the door there was an argument about the cigarette and money the accused was due for going shopping , " said the advocate depute .
Mrs Gray was pushed to the ground and suffered a fractured jaw and broken cheek bone along with a fractured bone in her upper neck .
Defence solicitor advocate Gordon Martin said Earley , who has a previous conviction for assault , came from " a particularly troubled background " and was involved in trouble at school .

What are these ?

When I get into cocktail - party conversation about language and politics , someone inevitably says “ and of course there ’s the rise of China . ”
It seems like any conversation these days has to work in the rise - of - China angle .
Technology is changing society ?
Well , it ’s the flood of cheap tech from China .
Worried about your job ?
It ’s the rise of China .
Terrified of nuclear Iran ?
If only that rising China would stop resisting sanctions .
What ’s for lunch ?
Well , we ’d all better develop a taste for Chinese food .
I was reminded of this walking down New York ’s Park Avenue last night , when I saw a pre-school offering immersion courses in French , Italian , Spanish and Chinese .
For years now , we ’ve been seeing stories like this : Manhattan parents , always eager to steal some advantage for their children , are hiring Mandarin - speaking nannies , so their children can learn what some see as the language of the future .
But while China ’s rise is real , Chinese is in no way rising at the same rate .
Yes , Mandarin Chinese is the world ’s most commonly spoken language , if you simply count the number of speakers .
But the rub is that they ’re almost all in China .
Yes , we ’ve also read that Mandarin is advancing in Hong Kong , Taiwan and overseas Chinese communities ( which have traditionally spoken one of China ’s other languages , such as Cantonese ) .
And China is trying to expand the use of the language through the expansion of its overseas Confucius Institutes .
But English remains the world ’s most important language .
America ’s superpower status has made it everyone ’s favourite second language .
This is where its power lies .
A Japanese businessman does deals in Sweden in English .
A German airline pilot landing in Milan speaks English to the tower .
English is also the language of writing intended for an international audience , whether scientific , commercial or literary .
Could Chinese gradually assume this role as the world ’s language of communication ?
I 'll venture a prediction : No .
Not as long as Chinese is written in traditional Chinese characters .
It ’s not terrifyingly hard to learn to speak Chinese .
Mandarin has few of the blistering array of case - and verb-endings that make languages like Russian or Arabic so difficult .
Sentences are built on a simple system that can seem odd and ungrammatical to outsiders .
( Sentences like wo shi zhong guo ren can be translated bit - by - bit as I yes middle country person , meaning “ I am Chinese . ” )
The hardest part for non-Asians is probably mastering the “ tones ” : “ shi ” pronounced with a falling pitch means something completely different than “ shi ” pronounced with a rising , flat or dipping pitch .
But writing is a different story .
Normal adult literacy requires a knowledge of about 6,000 characters , which must be memorised to be deciphered .
Recurring symbols within characters can offer clues to sound and meaning , but they do n't quite clarify the whole .
Chinese people take years to learn the basics and many more to comprehend a full range of characters ( the biggest dictionaries have more than 60,000 of them ) .
For a foreigner , the task is immense — a mammoth memorisation challenge on top of the ordinary one of learning to speak a foreign tongue , usually undertaken in adulthood , without the benefit of immersion .
There is , of course , an alternative .
Chinese can be written with the Roman alphabet ( there ’s an official system called pinyin ) , for the benefit of foreigners .
Chinese people also use pinyin to enter Chinese characters on a standard computer keyboard .
But China has resisted all attempts to simply switch to the alphabet for typical reasons : tradition and nationalism .
So should you teach your kids Chinese ?
Well , foreign languages are always a good thing to know , and if you really want them to live and work intensively in China , sure .
But despite China ’s rise , Chinese is n’t the world language of the future ; the writing system simply makes it far too hard for the vast majority of the world ’s people to use if they care to reach for the widest possible audience .
I simply ca n’t imagine a Dutch physicist in 2110 learning Chinese in order to write up his research , or Finnish musicians recording in Chinese , the language “ everybody ” knows .
If China switches to an alphabet ?
That ’s a different story .
According to 2010 research published in the journal Pediatrics , if mothers would breastfeed their babies for the first six months of life , then 911 lives would be saved in the United States and billions of dollars saved annually .
The paper ' The Burden of Suboptimal Breastfeeding in the United States : A Pediatric Cost Analysis ' that is a summary of their research is published in the Aprl 2010 issue of the journal Pediatrics ( doi:10.1542/peds.2009-1616 ) .
According to the CNN Health article ' Study : Lack of breastfeeding costs lives , billions of dollars , ' the paper in the journal Pediatrics states , " The United States incurs $ 13 billion in excess costs annually and suffers 911 preventable deaths per year because our breastfeeding rates fall far below medical recommendations . ' The authors are quoted in the CNN article to have said , ' If 90 % of US families could comply with medical recommendations to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months , the United States would save $ 13 billion per year and prevent an excess 911 deaths , nearly all of which would be in infants ( $ 10.5 billion and 741 deaths at 80 % compliance ) . '
Other health and medical organizations throughout the world state very similar suggestions for breastfeeding .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , the American Academy of Pediatrics , the American Academy of Family Physicians , and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) all state that six months of breastfeeding is healthy for babies .
Dr. Melissa Bartick , from Department of Medicine , Cambridge Health Alliance and Harvard Medical School , is one of the authors of the study .
Dr. Bartick states a lot of money could be saved each year by breastfeeding longer .
She states , such savings could be realized ''¦ if 80 to 90 percent of women exclusively breastfed for as little as four months and if 90 percent of women would breastfeed some times until six months .' [ CNN ]
Page two continues .
Dr. Arnold Reinhold , from the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics , Boston , Massachusetts ) is the second author of the study .
Reinhold and Bartick found that much money is needlessly wasted each year due to premature deaths due to lack of breastfeeding .
They state the specific causes of 95 % of these deaths are from ' sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) ; necrotizing enterocolitis , seen primarily in preterm babies and in which the lining of the intestinal wall dies ; and lower respiratory infections such as pneumonia .' [ CNN ]
The U.S. researchers conclude , ' Current US breastfeeding rates are suboptimal and result in significant excess costs and preventable infant deaths .
Investment in strategies to promote longer breastfeeding duration and exclusivity may be cost - effective .'

The body of a trans woman was found decapitated in Chihuahua , Mexico .
Her body was found a kilometer away from her head .
Authorities believe she was still alive during the decapitation because fear was frozen on her face .
According to Carlaantonelli.com
En una nueva forma de ataque contra la comunidad de transexuales , ayer fue encontrado el cuerpo de un una mujer transexual , en Chihuahua , México , que fue decapitada y cuyo cuerpo fue tirado en una colonia a un kilómetro de donde fue encontrada su cabeza .
Medios / Diario Digital transexual -.
De acuerdo con los hechos , el hallazgo se realizó a las seis de la mañana , en las calles 25 y Salvador Zubirán , al sur de la ciudad .
En ese lugar fue encontrada la cabeza cercenada de una chica transexual .
El rostro presentó signos de haber sido decapitado en vida , ya que tenía los ojos abiertos en señal de miedo y terror .
The House Financial Services Committee today said its securities subcommittee plans to hold a hearing next week to examine the operational issues surrounding the U.S. stock market plunge Thursday .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 1,000 points in a half hour Thursday before bouncing back to within 348 points of the day 's opening .
Industry sources said the precipitous drop was likely due to both human error that was exacerbated by high - speed trading platforms rolled out over the past decade .
The Dow fell to 9,867 points from its previous day's close of 10,868 before rebounding to 10,464 points by the close of the market Thursday .
Industry experts said it was obvious that there was some sort of " algorithmic error " in the computerized trading systems that caused the pricing in the markets to collapse .
For example , TD Ameritrade said one of its client 's stock price orders started at $ 60 and dropped to 11 cents before rebounding .
In another example , The Wall Street Journal 's MarketBeat blog reported Accenture 's stock price plummeted from more than $ 40 at 2:47 p.m. to a penny at 2:48 p.m .
The House Financial Services ' securities subcommittee plans to hold a hearing at 3 p.m. Tuesday to address the causes of the dramatic drop in the Dow before it recovered .
House subcommittee Chairman Paul Kanjorski , ( D - Penn . ) , said in a statement that Thursday 's stock market seemed " just as volatile as it did in the fall of 2008 . "
" Reports have surfaced that much of this movement was potentially as a result of a computer glitch , " Kanjorski said .
" We cannot allow a technological error to spook the markets and cause panic .
This is unacceptable .
In this day and age and with the use of such complex technology , we should be able to make sure that our financial markets are effectively monitored and investors are protected . "
Kanjorski also called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the problem .
Earlier this year , the SEC sent a letter to brokerage houses saying it was conducting a " broad review " of the equity market structure and asking them for comments .
The review would include an evaluation of equity market structure performance in recent years and an assessment of whether market structure rules have kept pace with , among other things , trading technology .
The SEC asked for comment on a wide range of market structure issues , including high frequency trading , order routing , market data linkages , and undisplayed , or " dark , " liquidity .
" The Commission intends to use the public 's comments to help determine whether regulatory initiatives to improve the current equity market structure are needed and , if so , the specific nature of such initiatives , " the letter stated .
In 2005 , the New York Stock Exchange dropped its manual system where floor traders shouted out buy and sell orders and adopted hand - held computers .
" What took place yesterday was absolutely crazy , " said Sean O'Dowd , senior capital markets analyst at IDC's Financial Insights business .
O'Dowd said this wo n't be the last time computer errors cause market crashes .
The automated trading systems running off software algorithms put in place over the past five years have raised volatility in the marketplace .
" You 're going to see this , and you have seen this .
The NYSE shut down a year ago , " he said .
" You 've seen a lot of these hiccups on the exchange side over the past couple of years .
They 're random events , but I think you 'll continue to see these .
This wo n't be the last time you 'll see a freak market reaction largely influenced and exponentially pushed beyond what it might normally have been because of the automation of things . "
One human error can create a landslide effect that under a manual order entry system would be easier to spot and stop , O'Dowd said .
Thursday 's market drop was reportedly kicked off by a human error - a trader entering 16 billion shares of S&P 500 stock for sale versus the intended 16 million on an automated trading platform .
As the shares flooded the market , buyers stepped back to evaluate what was going on and market liquidity evaporated , O'Dowd said .
" Because of the automation in [ trading systems ] and the dynamic way in which they react to market changes and then execute on that information without human intervention ... the result ends up in trading patterns that were unintended , " he said .
" It 's happening so fast , it 's hard to catch it and correct it as quickly as you would want it . "
But O'Dowd said he was also impressed with how quickly the market corrected itself after the drop .
" What 's interesting is the dynamics of this highly automated trading ecosystem . "

In a baffling reversal on yet another environmental issue , the Obama administration has decided to defend in court a Bush - era regulation that allows unlimited dumping fo hard rock mining waste on public land , in Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management holdings .
The May 30 government filing in Earthworks et al. v. Department of the Interior et al. , currently before the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia , indicates that although the White House had an opportunity to either reverse the rule or study its effectiveness , it has chosen to defend it in court ....
The lawsuit challenges a pair of Bush - era decisions , made in 2003 and 2008 , that collectively allow private mining firms to dump their waste on public land without compensating the government for any environmental damage .
There are two Bush administration rules at issue , one which allows for the unlimited dumping of toxic mine waste from large - scale industrial mining on public lands , and the other which reverses a requirement that the government receive compensation from the mining companies for the use of the public land .
The Obama administration decision to defend these rules comes after Interior Secretary Ken Salazar 's promise last summer that the new administration would " make reforming the nation 's 137 - year - old hardrock mining law a top priority . "
Salazar told a Senate committee considering reform legislation that " it is time to ensure a fair return to the public for mining activities that occur on public lands and to address the cleanup of abandoned mines . "
The General Mining
Act of 1872 , which gives mining preference over other uses on much of the nation 's public lands , has left a legacy of hundreds of thousands of abandoned mines that are polluting rivers and streams throughout the West .
Mining companies also do n't pay royalties on gold , silver , copper and other hardrock minerals mined on public land .
It also comes after a notice issued in July of last year from the EPA that " identifies mining as a taxpayer burden and the nation ’s top polluter , documenting billions spent over the past decade on cleanup of mining industry toxic ' mega - sites . ' ”
The taxpayer burden from hard - rock mining is a double whammy .
Mining companies do n't pay royalties back to the treasury for the precious metals they extract from public land , nor do they - - under the Bush rules that the Obama administration is now backing -- now have to pay any recompense for the environmental damage dumping the waste will cause .
Which makes the antiquated and damaging 1872 mining law even worse .
These rules represent a huge liability to the taxpayer , and a massive gift to the industry that the EPA has identified as the sector " posing the highest financial risk for taxpayer cleanups , " noting :
“ [ T ] he hardrock mining industry has experienced a pattern of failed operations , which often require significant environmental responses that cannot be financed by industry . ”
The hardrock mining industry “ releases enormous quantities of toxic chemicals ” — according to the 2007 Toxic Release Inventory , 28 percent of the total releases by U.S. reporting industries .
EPA estimates the cost of remediating all hardrock mining facilities between $ 20 and $ 54 billion .
EPA ’s expenditure data shows that between 1988 and 2007 , approximately $ 2.7 billion was spent on cleanup of hardrock mining facilities , with $ 2.4 billion going to National Priority List sites .
The largest portion of these expenses has been incurred since 1998 .
This administration decision has sort of flown under the radar this week , with the offshore drilling decision receiving much more attention .
It has n't , however , gone unnoticed entirely in Congress .
Rep. Raul Grijalva blasted the decision , saying that it " puts short - term profits above longer - term considerations . "
“ Federal land is n’t a taxpayer - funded dumping ground , and it ’s time the administration said so .
Allowing mining companies to profit by using the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management as waste heaps is a decision that will be long remembered by the American people , and it should be reversed without delay . ”
The administration could heed the words of its own EPA and reverse this decision , settling the lawsuit and revising the rule .
It would be the environmentally and fiscally responsible thing to do .
' We want to be No 1 " : at a time of relative gloom for the music business , you can't accuse the industry body UK Music of ducking a challenge .
In Liberating Creativity , the glossy report in which it lays out its aims for the decade , UK Music says it wants Britain to " challenge the United States " for the position of the world 's top music producer .
At first it sounds preposterous , but who knows , maybe we can do it – if Taio Cruz can get a US chart - topper then anything 's possible .
But it 's interesting to see who gets a part in this national epic and who does n't .
In Liberating Creativity , the organisations – of artists , labels , publishers and licensing bodies – that make up UK Music lead the way , and then the report names other stakeholders : " producers , engineers , studios , promoters , distributors , A&R , designers , marketers , retailers , lawyers … "
It mentions the other creative industries , the infrastructure of live music , media old and new .
The future of music is an orgy of business models , a whirl of " new partners " from brands to ISPs to pie-makers .
After all of those have been dealt with , it mentions the fans .
" As consumption changes , " the report says , " so does music 's relationship with fans . "
And we move swiftly on to more figures about how many jobs the biz creates .
The fans , after all , are a bit of a sticking point on UK Music 's path to glory .
Because they will keep on using those pesky unlicensed services and downloading copyrighted material – problems Liberating Creativity expresses fears about .
UK Music is right to be worried – music is valuable and musicians should be compensated for making it .
But if anyone 's a " new partner " in the music business these days , it 's the fans .
They 're the ones promoting the music on social networks , uploading fan videos and homebrew remixes .
They 're creating the atmosphere that makes live music more of a draw than ever before , they 're the ones buying – yes , buying – more singles than at any time in British music history .
And they 're doing this at the same time as they 're downloading whole discographies via BitTorrent and sending leaked MP3s on Gmail .
Underlying UK
Music 's report is the assumption that the licensed activity and the unlicensed activity are separable , that you can punish the latter without hurting the former .
But what if that 's not true – what if , as several studies of piracy and music purchasing seem to suggest , the good fans and the bad fans are the same people ?
The music biz is n't the first British leisure industry to have a suspicious , even adversarial relationship with its own fans .
Another of last week 's news stories hints at a way out of it .
The government 's startling proposals to require football clubs to let fan organisations take a stake of up to 25 % in their ownership – with windows of opportunity for full takeovers in certain cases – represent possible legal recognition of the principle of fan involvement .
As Dave Boyle , head of fans organisation Supporters Direct , put it , this is " long overdue recognition that clubs are n't businesses like any other " .
Football fans have a long history of being ignored , belittled and viewed with suspicion both by the authorities and the businesses that rely on them .
The parallels are far from exact , but back in the 1980s , fans of some clubs endured a near - presumption of criminality that mirrors the music industry 's perception of file - sharers now .
Football has undertaken a long journey away from this , and even now fan involvement is n't the norm – a lot of clubs still prefer to treat their fans as walking piggybanks .
But the Labour proposals at least recognise that without the fans , there is no sport .
And without the fans , there is no music business either , let alone a world - beating one .
No need to talk about 25 % takeovers of record labels , but why not a vocal and strong fan organisation under the UK Music umbrella ?
If one existed it could be a powerful ally in their many positive campaigns – for live music and music education – as well as a corrective voice in defence of music lovers .
I 'm not trying to suggest that music fans are always right , and of course there are freeloaders who contribute nothing to art , fandom or business .
But if UK Music really is serious about becoming the best and most productive music industry in the world , it has to take us with it .
Jesus : he 's all around us .
When he's not turning water into wine , or knocking over tables at his local church community center , he 's popping by to say hi to some of his most loyal followers .
But instead of ghostly apparitions , Jesus chooses a much more convenient method : he puts his face on everyday household things .
This way , the people who he visits can sell his likeness on eBay for upwards of $ 200 per potato chip , bread mold , coffee stain , etc .
Check out this list of people who believe they saw Jesus in a random object and documented it for all the world to see .
Whether you think it 's crazy , believable , or a mixture of both , there 's no doubt that some of these things look just a bit like the Big Guy .
Some are a bit of a stretch , but maybe that 's because you 're not believing hard enough .
Vote up the best images of Jesus that make you feel #blessed .
TENT , INDIA —
As sarpanch , or chief , of this northern Indian village , Maya Yadav has fought hard for local women over the past five years .
She has encouraged more parents to send their daughters to school and fewer to shell out fat dowries when their girls marry .
But her proudest moment came when she negotiated a discount on a bulk purchase of latrines .
Today , Tent , in Haryana State , is one of the few villages in India to boast an indoor toilet in every house .
“ Before this , pregnant women had to walk into the fields , ” Ms. Yadav , 50 , said as she sat in her living room — and office — dressed in a scarlet sari .
“ No man would have thought of this . ”
Despite her self - confident manner , Ms. Yadav concedes that she is unlikely to have come to power had the Constitution not been amended in 1993 to reserve at least one - third of the seats for women in India ’s 265,000 village governing bodies .
More than a million women across India have since been elected into the reserved positions in these panchayats , which administer public services and resolve disputes on matters ranging from marriage to property .

EU finance ministers have agreed a € 750bn ( £ 650 bn ) bailout plan to prevent the Greek debt crisis from spreading to other countries .
Of this money , € 500bn will come from the EU , while up to € 250bn will be contributed by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
Under the three - year plan , the 16 member states of the single currency will have access to € 440bn of loan guarantees , and €60bn of emergency European Commission funding .
Talks were called on Friday night amid fears that the Greek financial crisis was spreading to other financially troubled states , such as Portugal and Spain .
After the talks , which lasted for 11 hours , Spanish finance minister Elena Salgado said : " We are placing considerable sums in the interest of stability in Europe . "
The euro has strengthened in the Asian stock markets , whose opening coincided with the announcement of the deal .
On Friday , eurozone leaders ratified a € 110bn loan package to Greece , backed by the EU and the IMF .
Under the original scheme , Britain was already exposed to a potential £ 7 billion cost .
Treasury officials say that its ultimate liability under the enhanced plan will be a further £ 8 billion .
This brings the total cost of Britain 's involvement to £ 15 billion .
Chancellor Alistair Darling told the BBC that it would cost Britain this much only in the event of the " 100 per cent default " by an EU country .
IN THE headlines about Europe 's economic woes , one country stands out .
Its public finances are a disaster .
It has systematically fiddled its statistics .
Its overpaid , underworked public - sector employees are a laughing stock across Europe .
Rigid labour and product markets , and membership of the euro , have imprisoned it in an economic - policy straitjacket .
It urgently needs a big bail - out .
Call it the “ Country That Needs Help ” ( CTNH ) .
Its next - door neighbour in south - eastern Europe is the “ Country That Can't Be Named ” ( CTCBN ) .
The name it would like to have annoys CTNH , which regards it as an implicit territorial claim on its northern province with the same name .
So the country is often called by a cumbersome five - letter acronym .
What a FYROre
The dispute has consumed an enormous amount of diplomatic time and energy over the past 15 years .
It has prevented CTCBN , a small , poor country , from joining NATO , and has blocked the start of talks over its membership of the European Union .
The details of the dispute are so mind - bogglingly silly that they make the Polish - Lithuanian row over spelling seem serious .
It is difficult to know what sort of adjective or other qualifier , in what language or languages , with or without a hyphen , in what documents and in what contexts , would be enough to satisfy CTCBN 's feeling of identity without prompting paranoia in CTNH .
Neither side is blameless .
Politicians in CTCBN have provoked their southern neighbour .
The controversial renaming of an airport and the erection of a prominent statue of a historical figure claimed by both sides are the main charges ( no kidding : this is Europe in 2010 and people are getting seriously cross about statues ) .
For its part , CTNH has been ridiculously obdurate : having said it would not let the name issue stop CTCBN 's integration into Euroatlantic organisations , it has done exactly that .
Delay means playing with fire : CTCBN is divided ethnically and has weak national institutions .
One of the things that keeps the country together is the prospect of integration into international organisations , chiefly the EU and NATO .
CTCBN 's minority Albanian population has no dog in the fight .
But if the name dispute goes on long enough , they may lose faith in CTCBN 's future as a country .
Violence is not likely , but is certainly possible .
If it does break out , CTNH 's foot - dragging will be largely to blame .
So a lot rests on the meeting of the two countries ' prime ministers at an EU summit on March 25th .
Matthew Nimetz , the American diplomat charged by the United Nations with mediating the issue , sees some signs of hope .
( He deserves a Nobel prize for patience , if nothing else ) .
What is missing is more muscular outside intervention .
America thought of getting serious before the 2008 Bucharest NATO summit , but failed to push CTNH hard enough .
Being realistic , even with health - care reform successfully passed , it is unlikely that the White House is now buzzing with excited talk about this arcane dispute as its next big priority .
The EU is a more hopeful source of help .
It is good at solving problems by being boring .
Faced with the prospect of a near - death experience in a meeting room in Brussels , people often discover new possibilities for compromise .
But the EU does n't want to get involved .
That 's a pity .
Without getting into crude arm - twisting , it should be possible to suggest to CTNH that talks about the bailout might go faster if the government showed a bit more flexibility .
Sighs of relief would echo round the world .
And the indefatigable internet propagandists insisting on either unadorned Macedonia or Greece - sanctioned FYROM would have to find something else to do .
Whether it's for money , marbles or chalk , the brains of reward - driven people keep their game faces on , helping them win at every step of the way .
Surprisingly , they win most often when there is no reward .
That 's the finding of neuroscientists at Washington University in St. Louis , who tested 31 randomly selected subjects with word games , some of which had monetary rewards of either 25 or 75 cents per correct answer , others of which had no money attached .
Subjects were given a short list of five words to memorize in a matter of seconds , then a 3.5 - second interval or pause , then a few seconds to respond to a solitary word that either had been on the list or had not .
Test performance had no consequence in some trials , but in others , a computer graded the responses , providing an opportunity to win either 25 cent or 75 cents for quick and accurate answers .
Even during these periods , subjects were sometimes alerted that their performance would not be rewarded on that trial .
Prior to testing , subjects were submitted to a battery of personality tests that rated their degree of competitiveness and their sensitivity to monetary rewards .
Designed to test the hypothesis that excitement in the brains of the most monetary - reward - sensitive subjects would slacken during trials that did not pay , the study is co-authored by Koji Jimura , PhD , a post - doctoral researcher , and Todd Braver , PhD , a professor , both based in psychology in Arts & Sciences .
Braver is also a member of the neuroscience program and radiology department in the university 's School of Medicine .
But the researchers found a paradoxical result : the performance of the most reward - driven individuals was actually most improved -- relative to the less reward - driven -- in the trials that paid nothing , not the ones in which there was money at stake .
advertisement
Even more striking was that the brain scans taken using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) showed a change in the pattern of activity during the non-rewarded trials within the lateral prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) , located right behind the outer corner of the eyebrow , an area that is strongly linked to intelligence , goal - driven behavior and cognitive strategies .
The change in lateral PFC activity was statistically linked to the extra behavioral benefits observed in the reward - driven individuals .
The researchers suggest that this change in lateral PFC activity patterns represents a flexible shift in response to the motivational importance of the task , translating this into a superior task strategy that the researchers term " proactive cognitive control . "
In other words , once the rewarding motivational context is established in the brain indicating there is a goal - driven contest at hand , the brain actually rallies its neuronal troops and readies itself for the next trial , whether it 's for money or not .
" It sounds reasonable now , but when I happened upon this result , I could n't believe it because we expected the opposite results , " says Jimura , first author of the paper .
" I had to analyze the data thoroughly to persuade myself .
The important finding of our study is that the brains of these reward - sensitive individuals do not respond to the reward information on individual trials .
Instead , it shows that they have persistent motivation , even in the absence of a reward .
You'd think you 'd have to reward them on every trial to do well .
But it seems that their brains recognized the rewarding motivational context that carried over across all the trials . "
The finding sheds more light on the workings of the lateral PFC and provides potential behavioral clues about personality , motivation , goals and cognitive strategies .
The research has important implications for understanding the nature of persistent motivation , how the brain creates such states , and why some people seem to be able to use motivation more effectively than others .
By understanding the brain circuitry involved , it might be possible to create motivational situations that are more effective for all individuals , not just the most reward - driven ones , or to develop drug therapies for individuals that suffer from chronic motivational problems .
Their results are published April 26 in the early online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

Everyone knows of competitive people who have to win , whether in a game of HORSE , golf or the office NCAA basketball tournament pool .
The findings might tell researchers something about the competitive drive .
The researchers are interested in the signaling chain that ignites the prefrontal cortex when it acts on reward - driven impulses , and they speculate that the brain chemical dopamine could be involved .
That could be a potential direction of future studies .
Dopamine neurons , once thought to be involved in a host of pleasurable situations , but now considered more of learning or predictive signal , might respond to cues that let the lateral PFC know that it 's in for something good .
This signal might help to keep information about the goals , rules or best strategies for the task active in mind to increase the chances of obtaining the desired outcome .
In the context of this study , when a 75 - cent reward is available for a trial , the dopamine - releasing neurons could be sending signals to the lateral PFC that " jump start " it to do the right procedures to get a reward .
" It would be like the dopamine neurons recognize a cup of Ben and Jerry 's ice cream , and tell the lateral PFC the right action strategy to get the reward -- to grab a spoon and bring the ice cream to your mouth , " says Braver .
" We think that the dopamine neurons fires to the cue rather than the reward itself , especially after the brain learns the relationship between the two .
We 'd like to explore that some more . "
They also are interested in the " reward carryover state , " or the proactive cognitive strategy that keeps the brain excited even in gaps , such as pauses between trials or trials without rewards .
They might consider a study in which rewards are far fewer .
" It 's possible we 'd see more slackers with less rewards , " Braver says .
" That might have an effect on the reward carryover state .
There are a host of interesting further questions that this work brings up which we plan to pursue . "
Iraq gunmen kill at least 25 in attack on Sunni village
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Iraqi gunmen have killed 25 people believed to be linked to Sunni militias opposing al - Qaeda , police say .
Five women were among those killed , as the gunmen in army uniforms pulled the victims out of their houses in a village south of Baghdad on Saturday .
The victims were reported to have been tied up before being shot in the head .
Sunni militias turned against al - Qaeda and its militant allies two years ago in what was a key turning point in the campaign to quell the Iraqi insurgency .
Baghdad security spokesman Maj Gen Qassim al - Moussawi said police found seven survivors handcuffed in the same area .
" Also we confiscated the vehicle which was used in this attack , " he said .
Local resident Muhammad Mubarak described what happened as " a tragedy " .
" A group wearing National Guard uniforms and carrying night vision equipment stormed the homes of the victims and took them to their front gardens , " he said .
They knocked at the door , called out a name , then took the man or the woman who came out to a grove and killed them
Mohammad al - Askari , Iraqi defence ministry
Iraq 's Awakening Councils " Then they handcuffed them with plastic tape and shot them in the head with guns fitted with silencers . "
Mohammad al - Askari , of the defence ministry , said 24 people had been arrested from another Sunni village nearby with links to al - Qaeda .
" According to our investigation the perpetrators came from a village around 500 m away .
" They are from the same tribe .
They were around 25 armed men , wearing military uniform .
" One of them could say a few words in English to give the impression that this was a joint Iraqi - American patrol .
" They had with them a list of names , they knocked at the door , called out a name , then took the man or the woman who came out to a grove and killed them . "
He added : " Our investigation has shown that they came from a village loyal to al - Qaeda network . "
Insurgent stronghold
The village of Sufiya where the attack happened lies in a mainly Sunni area that used to be an insurgent stronghold .
In the past two years there have been many attacks aimed at punishing or intimidating Sunnis , but this is one of the bloodiest for some time , says the BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad .
It shows that al - Qaeda or its allies are still in business , though much less effective than in the past , he adds , and there is no evidence they are regaining hearts and minds within the Sunni community .
The Sunni militias that lent their support to the government are known as Awakening Councils , or the Sons of Iraq .
US authorities set up the militias , paying , arming and training their members before Iraqi authorities took control of them in late 2008 .

In common with so many problems involving young men in modern London , it was a squall about reputation and respect
After a lifetime at the helm of the world 's most powerful media organisation and in the crosshairs of the left , Rupert Murdoch has , of necessity , developed a reasonably thick skin .
The Dirty Digger is how he is disrespectfully referred to by Private Eye .
Spitting Image always portrayed him as a shouty figure , irredeemably uncouth .
But his son James seems less ready to turn the other cheek , as it were .
And this would seem to be the most plausible explanation for why Murdoch the younger , the chairman and chief executive News Corporation Europe and Asia , caused a media sensation on Wednesday by striding across the editorial floor at the Independent newspaper to berate its editor - in - chief , Simon Kelner .
In common with so many of the unpleasant episodes involving angry young men in modern London , it was a squall about reputation and respect .
The newly relaunched Independent had produced a series of relatively innocuous promotional ads assuring readers : " Rupert Murdoch wo n't decide this election .
You will . "
There is no evidence that Murdoch senior has even seen the ads , but witnesses report that directly upon seeing Kelner , who was supervising the final production stages of that night 's paper , Murdoch the younger began angry remonstrations .
" What are you fucking playing at ? " was his opening gambit .
A bewildered Kelner quickly ushered his visitors into his office , where they remained for what have been described as " frank and full discussions " for another 20 minutes .
All were grim - faced as Murdoch , carrying a promotional copy of the Independent , accused the rival editor of breaking the unwritten code that proprietors do not attack each other and of besmirching his father 's reputation .
With his piece said and with the matter unresolved , the aggrieved media mogul left .
The episode left experienced journalists shocked .
" They strode in like a scene out of Dodge City , " said one .
" Murdoch scanned the room , you could almost hear him saying ' Where is he ? ' "
Another likened the arrival in the newsroom of Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks , the chief executive of News International , to a mafia visit .
" It was so bizarre .
He came in all menace .
You know the sort of thing : ' The boss has heard what you have been saying about him .
He does n't like it . ' "
There was indeed a family style closing of ranks today , as both News International and the Independent declined to comment .
But then , on one level , what occurred had elements of a family squabble .
Earlier that day , Brooks had telephoned Kelner to raise concerns about the personalised ad .
It appears to have been a relatively cordial conversation .
The two have in the past socialised as part of a high - powered media set centred in Oxfordshire .
Blenheim is the Murdoch family retreat and it is said that Kelner has spent time " chatting to Rupert " while staying in the area as Brooks 's guest .
He will have been unprepared for a such an attack from Murdoch junior , another familiar face in Oxfordshire , but then the outburst took everyone by surprise .
Brooks and Murdoch actually travelled to Kensington to see Lord Rothermere at Associated Newspapers , publishers of the Daily Mail and the proprietor 's group managing director , Kevin Beatty .
Associated say they discussed commercial matters such digital and electronic media and iPads .
It is acknowledged that Murdoch has been meeting other heavyweight figures in the media industry to forward his father 's belief that newspaper websites should be shielded from free use by a revenue - raising paywall .
The Times and Sunday Times will erect a paywall in June .
The Daily Mail has set its face against the idea , but still Murdoch and Brooks appeared to be in good spirits when they ended their meeting with Rothermere and Beatty on the sixth floor , merely asking for directions to the Independent office on the second .
Even then there was no immediate sign of trouble .
Brooks 's first comment to Kelner was " Surprise – look who 's here to see you ! "
There are , of course , reasons why Murdoch junior might be particularly cranky right now .
The paywall experiment is an acknowledged gamble which other British outlets seem reluctant to take .
And there is unease that despite the full blooded , war - footing support of the Sun , David Cameron 's Conservatives are failing to establish the sort of lead that was expected of them .
Blogging today , Murdoch 's biographer Michael Wolff said jitters among the two lieutenants are inevitable because Brooks persuaded James Murdoch to throw the company 's weight behind Cameron 's Conservatives and the young Murdoch persuaded his father .
The magnate does not like bad advice , says Woolf .
" Murdoch likes winners , even more than he likes Conservatives . "
The fallout continued elsewhere today , as Associated complained bitterly about a Channel 4 blogpost suggesting that James Murdoch may have had a political motive for his visit the Mail – to construct a joint strategy to counteract the rise of the Liberal Democrats .
Absolute rubbish , say Associated .
Repercussions for the Independent , too , which engaged the publicist Matthew Freud to work on its relaunch , only to find that the unsolicited actions of his brother - in - law James Murdoch have done the job just as effectively .
Practical repercussions as well .
This afternoon , for the first time since the paper moved to Kensington 11 months ago , the newsroom door was secured with a swipe - card lock .

That ’s from an International Monetary Fund report released today titled “ Navigating the Fiscal Challenges Ahead . ”
The takeaway from this chart is that the surging public debt in advanced countries is driven mostly by huge declines in taxes as a result of less economic activity in the last few years .
From the report :
Of the almost 39 percentage points of GDP increase in the debt ratio , about two - thirds is explained by revenue weakness and the fall in GDP during 2008 - 09 ( which led to an unfavorable interest rate - growth differential during that period , in spite of falling interest rates ; see pie chart below ) .
The revenue weakness reflected the opening of the output gap , but also revenue losses from lower asset prices and financial sector profits .
Fiscal stimulus — assuming it is withdrawn as expected — would account for only about one - tenth of the overall debt increase .
This is somewhat more than the contribution of direct support to the financial sector .
Finally , a fairly sizable component arises from lending operations in some countries — Canada , Korea , the United States — involving student loans , loans for consumer purchases of vehicles , and support to small and medium enterprises — arguably in response to the crisis .
While structural spending pressures unrelated to the crisis are also projected to continue in the medium term , including for health and pensions , these are projected to be increasingly offset by measures from 2011 onwards .
Here is a related chart on the United States from last year .
It shows how much the recession has contributed to the country ’s widening deficit .

Nope !
These people have no idea .
There ’s a lot of good new hip hop .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil prices rose more than 2 percent on Monday to their highest since October 2008 , after U.S. manufacturing , home sales and jobs data boosted optimism about a recovery in the world ’s top economy .
The U.S. service sector grew in March at its fastest pace in nearly four years while pending home sales also rose , according to the ISM industry survey and a National Association of Realtors report on Monday .
That added to optimism following Labor Department data released on Friday showing U.S. payrolls rose by 162,000 last month , the fastest rate in three years .
U.S. crude oil for May delivery settled up $ 1.75 to $ 86.62 a barrel .
Prices have risen by 8.3 percent since March 26 , in their steepest 5 - day winning streak since December .
Brent crude rose $ 1.87 to settle at $ 85.88 a barrel .
“ Economic optimists have taken control of the market , ” said Gene McGillian , analyst at Tradition Energy in Connecticut .
“ We ’re in uncharted territory .
I think we can keep trending higher . ”
U.S. markets reopened after a three - day weekend that included the Good Friday holiday .
London markets remained closed on Monday for Easter .
Economic recovery bodes well for higher fuel demand in the United States , the largest consumer of oil .
Flagging demand has helped bolster U.S. crude oil stocks , which are currently well above the five - year average .

ANALYSTS EXPECT LARGER SUPPLIES
Analysts polled by Reuters forecast weekly inventory from the American Petroleum Institute , due out on Tuesday , and data from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday will show the 10th straight week of inventory gains .
Oil , natural gas and heating oil all rose sharply in a broad commodities market rally .
U.S. equities moved higher , led by shares in energy companies .
GSPE , as the Standard & Poor 's 500 Index rose to an 18 - month high .
The U.S. dollar weakened against a basket of foreign currencies , often an indication that investor funds are flowing away from safe haven assets and into those deemed riskier , such as commodities or equities .
OPEC members , including the world ’s largest crude exporter Saudi Arabia , said last week at the International Energy Forum in Cancun , Mexico , that they favored an oil price in the $ 70 to $ 80 a barrel range .
But OPEC , which pumps more than a third of the world ’s oil , has no immediate plans to revise output targets and produce more crude even with oil near $ 85 , a person familiar with Saudi oil policy told Reuters last week .
Crude prices also rose after reports that a South Korean supertanker was hijacked by Somali pirates off of East Africa over the weekend .
The tanker , chartered by U.S. refiner Valero Corp. , was carrying around 2 million barrels of Iraqi crude oil -- around 2.4 percent of daily world supply -- toward the U.S. Gulf Coast .
LITTLE RESISTANCE
Technical analysts , who follow the movement of prices on historical charts , have become more bullish and suggest the oil market could move higher in the next few weeks .
“ Our take on crude oil prices in the short - term is that we likely will push higher from here , ” said senior commodities analyst Edward Meir at brokers MF Global .
“ Technically , there is very little resistance showing on the charts given the upside breakout evident . ”
The Icelandic volcano ash cloud that has halted air traffic in Europe for several days will keep “ Judo ” Jim Wallhead from his appearance at Bellator Fighting Championships 15 this Thursday at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville , Conn .
Ryan Thomas will replace Wallhead in the welterweight tournament quarter - finals .
Thomas , given a second chance in the welterweight draw , will collide with unbeaten prospect Jacob McClintock .
He lost to Ben Askren by technical submission after the Olympian locked him in a guillotine choke in the first round on April 15 .
Thomas and his corner protested the stoppage and claimed he gave no indication he wanted the fight stopped .
“ While I am very disappointed that Jim wo n’t be able to make it to the U.S. this week , at least some good comes out of this situation , as Ryan will get the opportunity to step back into our welterweight tournament , ” Bellator founder and CEO Bjorn Rebney said in a release .
“ After the fight , I promised Ryan that he would be our first alternate for the tournament and , based on a natural disaster , his opportunity came much sooner than anyone would have guessed .
” The 25 - year - old Thomas has never gone the distance in 14 professional bouts .
He was pruned from the UFC roster following back - to - back submission losses to American Top Team ’s Ben Saunders and “ The Ultimate Fighter ” Season 7 quarter - finalist Matt Brown in 2008 .
McClintock , based out of Arizona Combat Sports , has finished all six of his foes in the first round .
However , the 22 - year - old Brazilian jiu - jitsu brown belt has not set foot in the cage since he stopped Beau Baker on strikes at an Ultimate Warrior Challenge event six months ago .
US president Barack Obama , whose 2008 election victory has been acclaimed as the first to be " won on the internet " , has warned university graduates against relying on technology for information .
In a commencement speech to more than 1,000 graduates , and thousands of their family and friends gathered at Hampton University , Obama said the era of the iPod and the Xbox has not always been good for the cause of a strong education .
The president 's election campaign has been seen as the first to rely heavily on social media .
His team used Facebook – Obama had over 8 m fans at the time of writing – YouTube , MySpace , Twitter , Flickr , Digg , BlackPlanet , LinkedIn , AsianAve , MiGente , Glee , and other web sites to get information to voters .
The campaign also saw an iPhone " Obama app " , which allowed supporters to spread the message to their contacts .
Yesterday however , the president admitted he could not operate an iPod or iPad , as he warned the students against becoming distracted by technology when they are already graduating " at a time of great difficulty for America , and for the world " .
" With iPods and iPads ; Xboxes and PlayStations – none of which I know how to work – information becomes a distraction , a diversion , a form of entertainment , rather than a tool of empowerment , rather than the means of emancipation , " Obama said .
" All of this is not only putting new pressures on you .
It is putting new pressures on our country and on our democracy . "
Graduates face a tough economy for jobs , two wars and a 24/7 media environment not always dedicated to the truth , the president added , as he stressed the importance of a good education to adapt to what he called " a period of breathtaking change , like few others in our history " .
However Obama said education can fortify students to " meet the tests of your own time " .
Addressing graduates at the historically black university in south - eastern Virginia , Obama said black students face more difficult headwinds than others and are typically outperformed by their white classmates .
He urged the Hampton graduates to be role models and mentors to younger people to teach them the importance of education and personal responsibility .
Obama also said an education can help people sift through the many voices " clamouring for attention on blogs , on cable , on talk radio " and help them find the truth .
" Let 's face it , even some of the craziest claims can quickly gain traction .
I 've had some experience with that myself , " Obama said .

KDE has enjoyed great success over the years and today marks another important step in the evolution of our growing community .
Many years ago when KDE was just beginning we had a small user base and similar expectations of how the software should work .
But with growth and success also comes new users and new expectations .
As an effort to meet the growing demands of our user community KDE has identified 3 key areas in which we would like to better cater to users ' needs .
In order to achieve this it has been determined that there will be , going forward , 3 separate releases of each Software Compilation tailored to these areas .
Ultimate Freedom Edition
The first focus area is geared towards users who prefer the ultimate in customization .
KDE has long been unmatched in its ability to give the user full control of their software and we would like to take that to the next level .
Starting with KDE SC 5 we will be creating a KDE SC " Ultimate Freedom Edition " .
This compilation will include one hundred percent customization of every option , including full maintenance of backports of every feature ever supported by KDE back to v3.0 .
For quick access , all menu options will be provided on the toolbar and the settings screens have been enhanced with double , tripple and quadruple tabbars to make it contain more settings .
Dwarfed Freedom Edition
The second focus area is aimed at users who enjoy the freedom of open source , but prefer a simple set of default behavior from their software so that they are not bombarded with constant decision making and choices when setting up their software .
This version of the KDE SC has been code named " Dwarfed Freedom Edition " .
This compilation will bring all of the normal KDE software you 've come to love , but with scaled back numbers of options in all desktop environment and application menus so as to make life a little bit simpler for our users .
Initial modifications in KWrite to enable more customization .
Initial modifications in KWrite to enable more customization .
Basic Freedom Edition
Last but not least , we would like to reach out to new users transitioning to KDE from outside the world of open source .
We know that many people in this category could probably care less about messing with any options at all and want their computer to " just work " .
To better meet this group 's needs we will be releasing KDE SC " Basic Freedom Edition " .
This compilation will focus on providing rock solid functionality without any customization that might impair their ability to operate the computer .
For your protection this compilation will be closed source , not allow you to access root level functionality , and will fully enforce security through obscurity thanks to the " black box " development processes that will be used in creating this edition .
Conclusion
We are very excited to bring to you these great new compilations in the coming months and will continue to bring up to the minute coverage here on the Dot as the KDE community continues to drive software development into the future !
Meanwhile , IT - Wire has the scoop on another great move by the KDE community : KDE picks Kim Kardashian to promote next release .
The Dot editors would like to publicly express their unhappiness about the fact they did not have the insider perspective here .
Have n't we faithfully licked the right boots over the past few years ?
I ’m posting about the artwork again to follow - up on the contest and the desktop backgrounds for Linux Mint 9 .
Wallpapers included by default :
The following wallpapers will be included by default in Linux Mint 9 ( click on the pictures to see them in full size ) .
From “ 29A ” :
From “ Talento Design ” :
From “ At your service ” :
From “ 96works ” :
From the Linux Mint community , ( from left to right : “ Emotion ” from distro hopper , “ AirMint ” from dkreations and “ LM9 ” from Zwopper ) :
Note : “ LM9 ” from Zwopper will come without the label shown on the above picture .
Note :
If space does n’t allow it , some backgrounds could be removed .
The pictures which are sure to be included by default are marked with a thick border .
The default background :
At the moment , the default background is the one from “ Talento Design ” ( first one below ) .
Alternative choices include a design from “ 96works ” and “ AirMint ” from dlkreations .
See below :
Poll : I ca n’t promise I ’ll follow the majority vote , as always I ’ll do what I think is best but I ’m interested to know your thoughts on this .
[ poll : 12 ]
Other backgrounds :
A number of packages will appear in Linux Mint 9 :
“ mint - wallpapers - extra ” will contain many wallpapers made for Linux Mint 9 which were n’t installed by default , unbranded versions of 96 works ’ artwork , variations from Talento Design and At your service , and a few others .
“ mint - wallpapers - previous - releases ” will contain the wallpapers used by past releases , such as the very popular “ Dew ” used in Linux Mint 7 Gloria , and the black wallpapers used in Linux Mint 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ..
“ mint - wallpapers - source ” will contain the .
PSD , .XCF , .SVG sources of the wallpapers and also the Linux Mint logos .
We bought the copyrights on the artwork from 29A , At your service , Talento Design and 96 works and we ’re freeing it all for everyone to use .
This package will give artists in our community great resources to start from , to modify and to reuse for their own creations .
We ’ll also probably include a community package which will grow bigger as the community adds to it , but this is likely to happen after the release of Linux Mint 9 .
Blue , green , black :
Many of the backgrounds shown above are also available in blue and will be featured in the KDE edition of Linux Mint 9 .
The plan to design a metal - looking theme was postponed to Linux Mint 10 .
Black backgrounds are likely to come back into fashion at that stage .
At the moment , we ’re using a black panel and so we ’re happy to stick to green for the background ( as you can see there ’s a lot of green in the pictures shown above ) .
Focus and efforts :
We ’re working really hard on the upcoming release .
We ’ve looked at a lot of things , we ’ve made many improvements and there ’s been a huge amount of coding done for Linux Mint 9 .
I ’ve no doubt people will be pleased with the release as we ’ve significantly made things better .
I know some people are upset when we talk about artwork , either they do n’t see the importance of it when it comes to users ’ first impression , or they think that the time we put into this is time taken away from more important things .
This is the icing on the cake , something that comes very late in the release cycle … something which priority was low but which is extremely important to us as we ’re getting ready to release .
Attention to details is something we can’t oversee .
When it comes to look & feel , things are so subjective and trends change so fast that it ’s easy for us to make a mistake , but we ’ll spend a few days at the end of each release cycle , like we ’re doing right now , and whether we get it right or not , we ’ll try our best to relax and to put efforts in making Linux Mint look the best we can .
At last , Google is revealing its split on AdSense : 68 % to publishers for content ads , 51 % for search ads .
I had two primary complaints about Google in my otherwise admittedly and obviously wet - kiss book , What Would Google Do? : Google ’s policy aiding government censorship in China and its opacity on advertising relationships .
The first is pretty much fixed and this morning , Google is addressing teh second .
so is the second .
( Uh - oh , now I have fewer excuses not to be a fanboy . )
At a press meeting with Google execs in Davos in January , I pressed them about the advertising openness , having discussed the issue with publishers at DLD in Munich right before .
In Davos , Google ’s president of global sales , Nikesh Arora , replied that the company was reconsidering its transparency on AdSense .
This morning , they ’re revealing the deal in a blog post ( to which I ’ll link as soon as it ’s up ; this news was embargoed for 10a ET ) .
From the post :
Today , in the spirit of greater transparency with AdSense publishers , we ’re sharing the revenue shares for our two main AdSense products — AdSense for content and AdSense for search .
. . .
AdSense for content publishers , who make up the vast majority of our AdSense publishers , earn a 68 % revenue share worldwide .
This means we pay 68 % of the revenue that we collect from advertisers for AdSense for content ads that appear on your sites .
The remaining portion that we keep reflects Google ’s costs for our continued investment in AdSense — including the development of new technologies , products and features that help maximize the earnings you generate from these ads .
It also reflects the costs we incur in building products and features that enable our AdWords advertisers to serve ads on our AdSense partner sites .
Since launching AdSense for content in 2003 , this revenue share has never changed .
We pay our AdSense for search partners a 51 % revenue share , worldwide , for the search ads that appear through their implementations .
As with AdSense for content , the proportion of revenue that we keep reflects our costs , including the significant expense , research and development involved in building and enhancing our core search and AdWords technologies .
The AdSense for search revenue share has remained the same since 2005 , when we increased it .
We also offer additional AdSense products including AdSense for mobile applications , AdSense for feeds , and AdSense for games .
We are n’t disclosing the revenue shares for these products at this time because they ’re quickly evolving , and we ’re still learning about the costs associated with supporting them .
Revenue shares for these products can vary from product to product since our costs in building and maintaining these products can vary significantly .
Additionally , the revenue shares for AdSense for content and AdSense for search also can vary for major online publishers with whom we negotiate individual contracts .
Of course , we ca n’t guarantee that the revenue share will never change ( our costs may change significantly , for example ) , but we do n’t have any current plans to do so for any AdSense product .
Over the next few months we ’ll begin showing the revenue shares for AdSense for content and AdSense for search right in the AdSense interface .
They ’re also not revealing splits for YouTube , a program that just started .
Note also that big publishers , such as the New York Times Company , have long known — and negotiated — their splits , which also are n’t revealed .
A Google spokesman told me last night that these splits hold for classic AdSense pay - per- click ads and also for newer display , CPM ads .
They also hold globally .
How do the splits compare ?
It ’s not uncommon for ad networks to take 50 % or more .
BlogAds , one of the more generous networks , customarily takes 30 % on sales it makes and has other models ( if sales come through a publisher site , only 14 % ; they also offer networked sales ) .

Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg not only found himself widely judged to have been the winner of the first ever televised leaders debate ahead of a General Election , but he also managed to get people searching for more information on his party .
Clegg , Conservative leader David Cameron and Labour 's Gordon Brown took to the television studio to argue the toss over domestic policy , in the style of the celebrated US presidential debates , and it was the former who came
out
on
top
.
With Facebook already measuring approval on its live metre , Google ( as ever ) was also watching , and a post on the Official Google Blog showed a big rise in people seeking out the Liberal Democrat manifesto and more information on the only party to vote against the controversial Digital Economy Bill as it was forced through parliament .
Many queries
" Nick Clegg , his Liberal Democrat Party , and its manifesto generated many queries as people searched for Lib Dems and Liberal Democrat manifesto 2010 , " said Google 's blog .
" Searches for David Cameron and the Conservatives beat out the well - known incumbent Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Labour , but the two parties ' manifestos generated about the same number of searches .
" Many Brits sought to watch the debate , searching for ITV election debate and live political debate , while others sought real - time polling information with queries such as debate polls , leaders debate poll and who is winning the debate . "
Trident is n't a gum ?
Interestingly , several terms that were used in the course of the debate were also tracked ; including major issues like the replacement of Britain 's ageing Trident nuclear deterrent , what exactly Quangos do ( even Google does n't really know ) and what the reference to jobs tax might mean .
In truth , we 're just waiting for the PlayStation and Xbox Parties to arrive and sweep all the Luddites away in a sea of fanboy politics .
Although , actually , with childish debates , making things needlessly personal and an inability to accept that the opposition has ever got anything right , they 'd probably fit right in .
The Australian Red Cross Blood Service is set to review its policy which prevents many gay men from donating blood .
Men who have had sex with other men in the past 12 months are banned from donating blood because of concerns about higher rates of HIV in the gay community .
But gay activists say the Red Cross should be screening for safe sex .
To ensure the safety of its supplies the Red Cross Blood Service asks many questions of its donors .
It says one in nine people are turned away because they are low in iron .
Others are turned away because they have had a recent dental filling or some may be rejected because they have had a body piercing .
But one question in particular stops healthy gay men from donating .
Red Cross spokesman Nicholas McGowan says being gay does not mean a man would be deferred under the current policy .
" The people who are deferred under this policy are males who 've had sex with males in the last 12 months , " he said .
" Males who have n't had sex with males in the last 12 months are actually eligible to donate blood so it does n't exclude everyone .
" It is a specific type of act if you will and that act , of course , and the decision is based on the prevalence of HIV - AIDS in that particular community . "
Mr McGowan says numerous questions of a highly personal nature are asked of everyone who donates blood in order to identify behaviour which would pose a threat to the blood supply .
" People obviously fill those questions down in good faith and respond in good faith and that will continue to be the way until , of course , we review this particular policy , " he said .
Campaign for change
It is a policy that Tasmanian man Michael Cain has been campaigning to end .
" This is where we have a problem because it is not a matter of gay sex .
Gay sex is n't what transmits HIV or any other blood borne diseases .
It is unsafe sex and this is what we said from the outset , " he said .
In 2008 Mr Cain took the Australian Red Cross Blood Service to the Anti-Discrimination Tribunal and lost .
He says there was not enough research to prove that some gay men are low - risk donors .
But he says the tribunal did recommend the Red Cross review its policy .
" As far as the statistics go this is the problem that we had in court .
The research that has only ever been done has been done on areas where there is a higher risk , " Mr Cain said .
" So what we want to do is more of a lifestyle study , a gay community lifestyle study where it assesses the greater gay population so we understand that not all of us are as high risk as some of us that live in inner city suburbs or visit on sex premises sites .
" Some of us do live in suburban areas .
Some of us are perfectly fine to live in monogamous couples , monogamous relationships and so on and practice safe sex . "
Mr Cain points to the example of Spain , which has changed laws so that they screen for the sexual safety of the person donating blood as opposed to the gender of the person that they are sleeping with .
" I think Italy has done the same thing .
Other countries like South Africa have for six months and a lot of other countries are under review , " he said .
" At the moment we are seeing in the United States senators petitioning to the FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ) to even review their blood ban , their lifetime ban , so around the world we are starting to see this change in understanding of what is high risk and what is safe . "
The Red Cross Blood Service has not set a date for the review to report , but it says it will consult widely with federal and state health authorities and it will include the latest international medical research .
Stagecoach has resumed testing of an amphibious bus service in Glasgow after technical problems halted the first trial .
The " amfibus " was grounded less than an hour after taking to the River Clyde on Monday when an airbag popped out from part of the suspension .
The £ 700,000 Dutch - made vehicle can carry up to 45 passengers .
The vehicle runs like a normal coach on the road but when in water uses a hull to float and is powered by twin jets .
It is one of several schemes which could be used to replace a ferry service between Renfrew and Yoker , which is to be scrapped by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport in March to save money .
Tony Perkins urges conservatives to stop giving money to RNC
Tony Perkins , head of the Family Research Council and an influential social conservative , is urging his members to stop giving money to the Republican National Committee , POLITICO has learned .
" I 've hinted at this before , but now I am saying it : Do n't give money to the RNC , " Perkins will tell FRC members in the group 's next e-mail newsletter .
" If you want to put money into the political process , and I encourage you to do so , give directly to candidates who you know reflect your values . "
Perkins ' move comes two days after it was disclosed that the committee spent nearly $ 2,000 at a lesbian bondage club near Los Angeles — a revelation that has revived Republican griping about Chairman Michael Steele and the national party .
" This latest incident is another indication to me the RNC is completely tone - deaf to the values and concerns of a large number of people they are seeking financial support from , " Perkins writes .
His move comes a few weeks after Mark DeMoss , a prominent Christian conservative P.R. executive and donor , said after the disclosure of the RNC 's controversial fundraising presentation that he would stop giving to the national party .
In his missive , Perkins also lamented that the RNC had touted their hiring super - lawyer Ted Olson to represent them in a campaign finance case .
" Yes , this is the same Ted Olson that is trying to overturn the results of the marriage amendment in California , " Perkins writes .
" The outcome of Olson 's challenge to Prop 8 goes far beyond nullifying the votes of nearly 7 million voters in California ; his efforts could lead to the overturning of amendments and laws in all 45 states that currently define marriage as the union of one man and one woman . "
These actions raise a potentially more serious threat to the RNC than the mere embarrassment of using party money to pay for a night out at a establishment dubbed Voyeur West Hollywood .
The committee has $ 9.46 million in the bank and already likely wo n't be able to offer the congressional committees and GOP candidates the sort of financial help they have in the past .
If social conservatives — the core of the party base — withhold contributions , the RNC 's money problem could become far worse .
" Women -- you can't live with them , and you can't live without them . "
This male quip captures something essential about the face of sexism : an ambivalence , or doubled - edged way of thinking , in which women are sometimes treated with contempt and sometimes adored .
How can adoration qualify as sexism ?
To answer this question , you are invited to take the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory and explore the dual nature of prejudice toward women .
The inventory takes roughly 5 minutes to complete , and afterward you can compare your level of sexism with the scores received by people from around the world .
Sure , a WiFi- equipped scale may be good enough for most people -- since , you know , you 're likely to keep your scale in your house -- but it looks like those not satisfied do now have another option in the form of BodyTrace 's new GSM - enabled eScale .
Of course , the big advantage here is ease of setup rather than portability , since you 'll be able to automatically ( and privately ) upload your weight to the BodyTrace website without having to first mess with WiFi settings and whatnot .
Somewhat surprisingly , the eScale is also actually cheaper than something like Withings '
WiFi scale , with it running just $ 59.99 including a year of service -- or , alternatively , $ 9.99 a month with a $ 9.99 up - front setup fee ( which also includes the scale ) .

The case , chilling and ghoulish , raises thorny issues in the Internet age , both legal and otherwise .
For instance , many states have laws barring assisting suicide , but rarely have cases involved people not in the same room ( much less the same country ) or the sharing of only words ( not guns or pills ) .
Image William F. Melchert - Dinkel . Credit ... Robb Long / Associated Press
The case also brings up questions about the limits of speech on the Internet :
How does one assign levels of culpability to someone who shares thoughts with people who say they are already considering suicide ?
And for some who counsel against suicide , it points to a growing area for worry , an online world where the most isolated and vulnerable might be touched in a way that they would not have in the past .
Groups that work to prevent suicide compare suicide chat rooms to “ pro-ana ” sites , Internet sites that portray anorexia as a lifestyle as opposed to a disease .
Anti-suicide advocates say that there has been more than one instance recently where a person killed himself on a Webcam as others watched .
Papyrus , a charity in Britain that works to stop young people from killing themselves , says it has tracked 39 cases in that country alone where young people committed suicide after visits to “ pro-suicide ” chat rooms .
It was the untrained , unpaid Internet sleuthing by Celia Blay , a 65 - year - old from a tiny community in Britain , that helped lead to charges in April against Mr. Melchert - Dinkel .
“ He was practically invisible , ” she said .
“ I tried to talk to any police I could , and most of them would have nothing to do with it .
The first one I talked to told me , ‘ If it bothers you , look the other way . ’
And that really bothered me , because by then I was pretty sure people had died . ”
About four years ago , Ms. Blay , who describes herself as a “ computer illiterate , ” became friends online with a young , depressed woman who had entered into a suicide pact .
Ms. Blay persuaded her not to proceed , but the incident sent Ms. Blay searching for the other member of the pact .
It was someone who called herself Li Dao , another screen name that the police later said Mr. Melchert - Dinkel used .
I get a lot of worried mail along the lines of “ how on earth will we ever be able to pay off our debt ” ?
Look , there are real worries — but the math per se is n’t very hard .
The Obama administration ’s budget ( pdf ) predicts that by 2020 we ’ll have net federal debt of around 70 % of GDP and a budget deficit of around 4 percent of GDP .
Now , you do n’t have to go to a zero budget deficit to make headway on the debt — a budget deficit of 2 - 3 percent of GDP would imply a steadily declining debt / GDP ratio .
So if you believe the administration ’s budget estimates , we ’ll need to find another 1 - 2 percent of GDP in revenue or cost savings .
Many independent sources are moderately more pessimistic ; they think that on current policies we ’d be looking at a deficit of 5 - 6 percent of GDP .
So that makes it more like a 3 or 4 percent of GDP adjustment .
That ’s not , in economic terms , a huge number .
We could raise taxes that much and still be one of the lowest - tax nations in the advanced world .
Or we could save a significant share of that total by not being totally prepared for the day when Soviet tanks sweep across the North German plain .
The only reason to doubt our ability to get things under control a decade from now is politics : if we ’re still deadlocked , if sane Republicans are cowed by the Tea Party , then sure , we can have a fiscal crisis .
And longer term , we ’ll be in a mess unless we get health care costs under control — which is exactly what we ’re trying to do , in the face of cries about death panels .
The numbers are n’t that bad ; if we go wrong , the fault will lie not in our debt , but in ourselves .

Congressman Paul , long the leader in American public life for sound money , sound banking , and the free market , talks about the progress of his Audit the Fed bill – and why the Fed , the Treasury , and the banksters fear it .
He also discusses the crisis in Europe and especially Greece , and the Fed ’s sinister and secret role .
We know why the Fed wants its secrets kept safe from the American people , about what banks and other institutions it bails out by printing new money .
But why do they so fiercely resist a physical audit of the gold at Ft. Knox and the vaults of the NY Fed ?
What are they hiding ?
Did far more US gold flow overseas under LBJ and Nixon than is admitted ?
Has some or all of the remaining gold been sold , though it is still physically in the US ?
Ron Paul , and all of us , wants some answers .

He has written many other books .

PARIS ( Reuters ) - Europe may be months , conceivably weeks away from an expanded debt crisis that cuts more countries off from access to the markets and forces fresh emergency action by rich governments or the European Central Bank .
The many potential triggers for an expanded crisis include a failed bond auction , any signs that Athens or donor nations were backing away from a 110 billion euro ( $ 141 billion ) bailout of Greece , and a freezing up of Europe ’s interbank money market .
For now , Portugal , Ireland and Spain , widely seen as the next possible “ dominos ” after Greece , remain in significantly better shape .
The interbank market is far from grinding to a halt as it did after Lehman Brothers collapsed in late 2008 .
But the spread of investor jitters in the past 24 hours , affecting markets as distant as yen swaps in Tokyo , suggests market conditions could deteriorate as rapidly as they did during the global financial crisis of 2007 - 2009 .
“ In my view there is a 10 - 20 percent chance that at least one more country will need rescuing as it finds itself shut out of the markets , ” said Marco Annunziata , chief economist at Italy ’s UniCredit bank .
“ If it happens , it is most likely to happen in the coming six months . ”
Lena Komileva , head of G7 market economics at money broker Tullett Prebon , said the crisis over Greece ’s solvency had morphed into a capital markets crisis , and the markets had begun to feed on their own momentum .
“ Another credit event similar to Greece can happen within weeks , ” she said .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and top economic policy makers in the euro zone appeared to recognize this in their warnings about the risk of an expanded crisis on Wednesday .
“ It ’s absolutely essential to contain the bushfire in Greece so that it will not become a forest fire and a threat to financial stability for the European Union and its economy as a whole , ” said European Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn .
TRIGGERS
Greece became unable to finance its debt at affordable rates when its 10 - year government bond yield soared near 10 percent in April .
The euro zone ’s other weak countries have not reached that stage ; Portugal ’s yield was below 6 percent on Wednesday .
Portugal sold 500 million euros in six - month Treasury bills on Wednesday at a yield of 2.955 percent , which was about four times the rate at the last such sale on March 3 but was well below maximum levels in the secondary market .
This was seen as a moderately positive sign by analysts .
Spain is expected to succeed in selling 2 - 3 billion euros of government bonds on Thursday , although at a much higher yield than in its last auction , analysts said .
Nevertheless , every debt sale by weak euro zone states in coming months is likely to be viewed as a potential flashpoint for an expanded crisis .
Portugal plans to offer more T - bills on May 19 and Spain plans another bond sale on May 20 .
Annunziata estimated Spain ’s bond spreads were still low enough for it to borrow at current rates for at least a year or more without doing serious damage to its finances .
Portugal can keep borrowing at current rates for at least a year , he said .
But he added , “ The problem , as for exchange rates , is also the speed of the movement .
If spreads keep widening then markets could more quickly lose confidence and the problem would be the quantity of available financing , not the cost . ”
Meanwhile , the Greek bailout package announced this week imposes such harsh austerity measures on Greece that the markets will continue doubting the country ’s political will and economic ability to stick to the package .
Any sign that the government of Prime Minister George Papandreou was backing off from key fiscal reforms in the face of public opposition could raise the prospect of a Greek debt restructuring or default , triggering an expanded crisis .
The European Commission and the International Monetary Fund will monitor Greece ’s progress every quarter and link aid disbursements to those reviews .
The reviews could become triggers for an expanded crisis if Germany , where public opinion strongly opposes helping Greece , decides Athens is not meeting aid conditions and balks at a disbursement .
The markets could also panic if commercial banks around Europe , which have cut off funding lines to Greek banks , decide to do the same to banks in Portugal , Ireland and Spain .
So far the stresses in the money markets do not approach those seen at the peak of the global crisis .
The two - year euro zone swap spread , which measures the aversion of lenders to deal with any but the most creditworthy borrowers , has widened to 65 basis points , its widest since mid-March 2009 , but is far below the record 130 bps hit in October 2008 .
However , large Spanish and Portuguese banks are having to pay a higher price to access the interbank market , and this premium could widen if sovereign debt markets sink further .
EMERGENCY STEPS
The political difficulty of assembling an international bailout for a country -- the Greek bailout was preceded by months of wrangling between angry governments -- suggest the ECB would be the first institution to respond to an expanded crisis .
It could reintroduce emergency measures taken during the global crisis , resuming a programme of lending in dollars and Swiss francs over six - and 12 - month maturities , or extending its promise to lend banks all the weekly funds they need at fixed rates beyond mid-October .
It might also abandon minimum credit rating requirements for more countries ’ sovereign bonds when they are used as collateral in its money market operations , as it did for Greece this week .
Its most radical step would be to buy countries ’ bonds from the secondary market , shouldering their debt -- though that would be hugely controversial and hurt the ECB ’s reputation for conservative monetary policy .
Analysts think it might pledge some 200 billion euros in such purchases .
“ They ’ve a huge amount of armoury at their disposal .
They can do a huge amount of things and I think they will be able to stabilize the market at some point , ” said UBS chief European economist Stephane Deo .
An expanded crisis could also prompt a fresh bailout effort by rich euro zone governments desperate to preserve confidence in their currency and protect their banks from defaults .
Analysts estimate a bailout of Portugal , Ireland and Spain might cost around 400 billion euros .
But the political difficulties of agreeing on an expanded bailout could dwarf the challenge which Greece posed .
The European Commission is to propose a permanent mechanism for handling such crises on May 12 , possibly drawing on a German proposal for a European Monetary Fund .
But actually creating the mechanism might require contentious changes to the European Union Treaty that would require many months .
Regardless of how Europe resolved an expanded debt crisis , the reputation of its key economic institutions , which failed to act quickly and decisively to address Greece ’s troubles , would likely suffer lasting damage among investors .
Stephen Jen , managing director of macroeconomics and currencies at BlueGold Capital , said Portugal would probably also need emergency aid from the EU and the IMF .
“ This short - term fix could have serious negative ... consequences for Europe , the IMF , the ECB and the euro , ” he said , predicting both Greece and Portugal would likely reschedule their debts eventually .
“ I maintain my view that there will be no happy ending for Greece . ”

US sample of young adults
In the US sample 99 young adults from low - to - moderate income families ( 59.6 % female ; age range 18 - 22 ) participated in a study of adolescent - parent relationships [ 13 ] .
Forty one of the families had been participating in a longitudinal study of attachment relationships since infancy , and were recruited at child age 0 - 18 months .
All 41 families were at or below federal poverty level at intake , and half of the families were referred to clinical services during the young adult 's infancy for concerns about the quality of care provided ( the other half were socioeconomically - matched controls ) .
An additional 48 crossectional families were recruited as part of the young adult follow - up study and matched to the longitudinal sample on socioeconomic status .
Hence , the combined study sample of 99 young adults is regarded as an at - risk sample ( 53.5 % of the families had an income of $ 40,000 per year or less ; 43.4 % of mothers had a high school education or less ; 37.4 % were single parents ) .
The study was conducted in compliance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association and with the requirements of the Hospital Institutional Review Board and the National Institute of Mental Health .
All young adults and their mothers provided written informed consent for their participation .
Ethnicity / race data was obtained from the mother of the young adult during the interview by asking her to classify the ethnicity and race of both herself and the father ( possible options for ethnicity : Hispanic or Latino ; Not Hispanic or Latino ; possible alternatives for race : American Indian or Alaska Native ; Black or African American ; White ; Asian ; Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander ; more than one race ) .
Of the 99 young adults , 66 had two parents reported as White , 26 subjects had one or two African American parents , and 7 subjects had one or two parents who were Hispanic .
The genetic analyses yielding significant association for the total sample ( N = 99 ) were repeated for the non-Hispanic Caucasian subgroup ( N = 66 ) .
US sample symptom assessments
Young adult psychopathology was assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis ( SCID ) for DSM - IV Axis I and II [ 33 , 34 ] , which was administered in the laboratory by trained clinicians ( see clinical characteristics for Axis I disorders in Table 1 ) .
Among the 99 young adults 2 were diagnosed with both BPD and APD , 2 with BPD , 5 with APD , and 14 with other personality disorder (s ) .
The pattern of antisocial or borderline personality disorder traits among the young adults were the following : 4 % met criteria for a diagnosis of BPD , however , 20 % endorsed two or more borderline symptoms ; 7 % of the sample met diagnosis of APD ( i.e. 3 or more APD symptoms and 2 or more conduct disorder symptoms before age 15 years ) , and 26 % showed two or more antisocial symptoms .
In the categorical analyses ( chi-square and binary logistic regression ) borderline and antisocial traits were coded as present if two or more features of the disorder were endorsed .
Table 1 Clinical characteristics in the US young adult sample and in the Hungarian sample of depressive patients
Full size table
In the analyses a severity of abuse variable was also used :
An overall rating for severity of abuse from birth to age 18 was assigned by reviewing the Conflict Tactics Scale second version [ 35 ] , the Traumatic Stress Schedule [ 36 ] , and the Childhood Traumatic Experiences Scales - Revised coded from one - hour semi-structured Adult Attachment Interview [ 37 ] , and any history of state protective services involvement .
The severity of abuse scale was coded as 0 - no occurrence of violence ; 1 - harsh punishment or witnessed violence ; 2 - emotional / verbal abuse ; 3 - one type of physical or sexual abuse ( using state guidelines for abuse ) , or protective services / foster care involvement ; 4 - two or more forms of abuse / trauma out of the three listed previously .
Reliability of the severity of abuse scale was assessed by having two coders independently rate 37 of the 99 participants on severity of abuse by reviewing the above set of assessments ; reliability between the two coders assessed by intraclass correlation was high , r i = 0.99 .
Hungarian patient sample
The independent replication sample consisted of psychiatric inpatients diagnosed with mood disorders , recruited from the Department of Psychiatry , Kútvölgyi Clinical Centre ( Budapest , Hungary ) during their depressive periods requiring treatment .
Unrelated participants of Caucasian ( Hungarian ) origin were included in the present study , thus creating an ethnically homogenous population [ 38 ] .
The study was conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration , and was approved by the Local Ethical Committee ( TUKEB ) , all participants provided written informed consent .
After screening out organic causes of psychiatric disorders , DSM - IV psychiatric diagnoses [ 39 ] were obtained by a clinical psychiatrist , the Axis I disorder frequencies are presented in Table 1 .
Among the 136 patients ( female 76.5 % ; mean age : 46.3 ± 10.5 , age range : 21 - 64 years ) 14 ( 10.3 % ) were diagnosed with personality disorders .
For the genetic analyses borderline symptoms were assessed from the self - report SCID Screen questionnaire , which showed good correlations with SCID - II interviews [ 40 ] .
The number of BPD symptoms ( 0 - 9 ) was used as the borderline scale ; the internal consistency of the scale was found to be satisfactory ( Cronbach 's alpha : 0.729 ) .
Genotyping and genotype grouping
Non-invasive DNA sampling was applied , and DNA was isolated from buccal cells using the DNA - purification kit obtained from Gentra ( Minneapolis , US ) .
Genotyping procedures for the DRD2 TaqIA ( rs1800497 ) , TaqIB ( rs1079597 ) , TaqID ( rs1800498 ) , and DAT1 40 bp VNTR in the 3 ' untranslated region were carried out using published protocols [ 41 – 44 ] .
Whereas VNTR genotyping methods of the DRD4 48 bp VNTR in exon III and 120 bp duplication in the promoter region , and the allele - specific amplifications of the DRD4 - 616 C/G ( rs747302 ) , - 521 C/T ( rs1800955 ) and COMT Val158 Met ( rs4680 ) were developed and optimized in our laboratory [ 45 – 47 ] .
The genotyping accuracy was checked by parallel genotyping of two independent DNA samples per person , and by calculating chi-square tests for deviation from the Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium using Knud Christensen 's program [ 48 ] .
Except for the - 616 C/G SNP in the Hungarian psychiatric sample , no significant deviations from the Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium were detected in either populations .
We assume that the slight deviation from the equilibrium ( χ2 = 4.099 , df = 1 , p = 0.043 ) in the Hungarian patient sample originates from possible association of the - 616 C/G SNP with psychiatric disorder (s ) .
In order to support this assumption , control subjects ( with no psychiatric history ) were recruited at the Institute of Psychology , Eotvos Lorand University ( N = 178 , age : 23.2 ± 5.0 ; 72.5 % female ) and genotyped for the studied dopaminergic polymorphism ( see additional file 1 ) .
Our data demonstrated that the non-clinical Hungarian sample was indeed in Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium for - 616 C/G SNP ( χ2 = 0.104 , df = 1 , p = 0.747 ) .
In the genetic analyses the VNTRs were analyzed according to the number of the risk allele , i.e. the DRD4 48 bp VNTR 7 - repeat allele and the DAT1 40 bp VNTR 9 - repeat allele ( see Table 2 and 3 ) .
In the second set of analyses the genotypes were grouped according to the presence of the risk allele , resulting in DRD4 7 - present ( 7+ ) and 7 - absent ( 7- ) groups .
At the DAT1 VNTR the grouping was based on the presence of the 9 - repeat allele , resulting in 9 - present ( 9+ ) and 9 - absent ( 9 - ) groups ; the rare 3/10 , 6/10 , 10/11 , and 10 / 12 genotype were grouped together with the 10/10 genotype in the 9 - group , whereas the rare 3/9 and 8/9 genotype were regarded as having one 9 - repeat allele , and grouped to the 9 + group .
At the SNP markers , homozygotes for the minor allele were grouped together with heterozygotes in the second round of analyses , i.e. DRD2 A1 + group consisted of A1 / A1 ( TT ) and A1 / A2 ( CT ) genotypes , DRD2 B+ group consisted of B1 / B1 ( AA ) and B1 / B2 ( AG ) genotypes .
The DRD4 - 521 C/T SNP was analyzed in CC + CT vs. TT setting , and at the - 616 C/G SNP CC vs. CG + GG groups were compared .

Table 3 Dopaminergic polymorphisms and borderline personality symptoms in the Hungarian patient sample Full size table
Statistical analyses
The SPSS program for Windows ( 17.0 version ) was used for the statistical analyses .
In the US young adult sample Pearson chi-square analyses were conducted using the symptom cut - off scores at 2 to assess the effect of dopaminergic polymorphisms .
In the binary logistic regression analyses gender and severity of abuse were also entered beside the dichotomous genetic variable in the same step ( block 1 ) .
In the exploratory interaction analyses of DRD4 48 bp VNTR , dichotomous genetic variables ( DRD4 7 + vs 7 - , DRD2 A1 + vs A1- , DAT1 9 + vs 9 - ) , gender , and the 5 - point scale of severity of abuse were entered at block 1 , whereas the created interaction variable ( DRD4 × DRD2 , DRD4 × DAT1 , or DRD4 × abuse ) was entered in block 2 .
Genetic association analyses within the Hungarian clinical sample were conducted by univariate analysis of variance using the borderline scale as the dependent variable and the dopaminergic genotypes as the grouping factor , with sex and age used as covariates .
To control for multiple comparisons , the False Discovery Rate adjustment of significance levels was used at α = 0.05 level [ 49 ] .
Haplotype analyses were conducted by likelihood - based association analysis using the Unphased program [ 50 ] , also direct molecular haplotyping was applied for the DRD4 promoter - 616 C/G and - 521 C/T SNPs [ 46 ] .
Linkage disequilibrium between the DRD2 SNPs was calculated by the Haploview program [ 51 ] using the Hungarian control sample genotype data : the DRD2 TaqIB SNP was in linkage with TaqIA ( D'= 0.947 , LOD = 29.77 , r2 = 0.701 ) and with TaqID ( D'= 1.0 , LOD = 12.17 , r2 = 0.212 ) .
Linkage disequilibrium for the DRD4 promoter polymorphisms has been previously reported [ 46 ] .

Of all the harmful actions of modern psychiatry , “ the mass diagnosing and drugging of children is the most appalling with the most serious consequences for the future of individual lives and for society , ” warns the world - renowned expert , Dr Peter Breggin , often referred to as the “ Conscience of Psychiatry . ”
“ We ’re bringing up a generation in this country in which you either sit down , shut up and do what you ’re told , or you get diagnosed and drugged , ” he points out .
Breggin considers the situation to be “ a national tragedy . ”
“ To inflict these drugs on the growing brains of infants and children is wrong and abusive , ” he contends .
The kids who get drugged are often our best , brightest , most exciting and energetic children , he points out .
“ In the long run , we are giving children a very bad lesson that drugs are the answer to emotional problems . ”
Dr Nathaniel Lehrman , author of the book , “ Coming Off Psychiatric Drugs , ” believes that giving infants and toddlers “ powerful , brain - effecting psychiatric medication is close to criminal activity . ”
“ Giving them these drugs , ” he says , “ has no rationale , and ignores the basic fact that youngsters are very sensitive to their environments , both social and chemical , with the juvenile brain easily damaged by the latter . ”
During an interview on ABC Radio National in August 2007 , Dr David Healy , the noted British pharmacology expert , and author of the book , “ Mania : A Short History of Bipolar Disorder , ” told reporter Jane Shields : “ Just to give you a feel for how crazy things have actually got recently , it would appear that clinicians in the US are happy to look at the ultrasounds of children in the womb , and based on the fact that they appear to be more overactive at times , and then possibly less active later , they ’re prepared to actually consider the possibility that these children could be bipolar . ”

White is doing a little promo around the release of the White Stripes movie Under Great Northern Lights , and he has found himself leaping to the defense of Meg White ’s drumming skills .
At times it feels like the White Stripes could have spiraled off into a muso bore nightmare without Meg on hand to steady the ship , but apparently not everyone sees things that way .
“ Her femininity and extreme minimalism are too much to take for some metalheads and reverse - contrarian hipsters , ” White said in an interview with the New York Post .
“ She can do what those with ‘ technical prowess ’ can ’t .
She inspires people to bash on pots and pans .
For that , they repay her with gossip and judgment . ”
I ’m with Jack on this one , and believe Meg adds an enormous amount to the band that she does n’t get credit for .
But the real question here is : who has got up Jack ’s nose with these allegations ?
Who is this reverse - contrarian hipster , and where can we find him ?
( I ’m assuming it ’s a him ) .

Advertisement Thailand 's Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has declared a state of emergency in Bangkok amid escalating anti-government protests .
In a televised address , Mr Abhisit said the move - which gives sweeping new powers to the security forces to tackle protesters - would help restore order .
It comes hours after thousands of " red- shirt " protesters marched on parliament - forcing MPs to flee the building .
The protesters want Mr Abhisit to resign and call elections .
Thailand has lurched from one crisis to another since 2006 when the government of Thaksin Shinawatra was overthrown .
This is the fourth state of emergency in the capital since 2008 .
' Stay put '
The current bout of red - shirt rallies began on 12 March .
The government had vowed not to use force against the red-shirts , and the protesters too had said their demonstrations would not be violent .
COLOUR - CODED PROTESTS
Many rural dwellers and urban poor support red-shirts , while yellow - shirts comprise mainly middle classes and urban elite
In September 2008 yellows rally against government , reds counter - rally , clashes in Bangkok Yellows blockade airport in November 2008 , government collapses , yellow - friendly government installed In April 2009 red protests halt Asean summit , two people die in Bangkok clashes , rallies called off Reds relaunch protests in March 2010 , splash blood on government buildings , march on parliament
Reds and yellows Q&A : Thailand protests
But Mr Abhisit said in his televised address that the protesters could no longer be considered peaceful after their march on parliament .
" Our goal is to restore normalcy , " he said .
" We need to plan and implement everything to the last detail and with thorough care .
The last thing we want is for the situation to spiral out of control . "
Mr Abhisit said the state of emergency applied in the capital and surrounding areas , but it is not yet clear how the authorities will implement the new laws , the BBC's Rachel Harvey in Bangkok says .
Emergency law gives sweeping powers to the security forces and in theory bans public gatherings of more than five people , our correspondent says .
But tens of thousands of anti government protesters remain in the commercial heart of Bangkok and show no signs of moving voluntarily .
They regard Mr Abhisit 's government as illegitimate as it was brought to power with military support .
One red - shirt leader , Veera Musikapong , told the protesters after Mr Abhisit 's announcement : " We have to prepare for another war .
If the military comes you should not panic - just stay put . "
A minister attached to Mr Abhisit 's office said the authorities would disperse protesters , detain protest leaders and search their houses .
Helicopter escape Thousands of red-shirts had earlier gathered outside parliament and were faced with similar numbers of riot police .
The parliamentary session was abandoned shortly after it had begun and senior politicians , including Mr Abhisit , were ushered out of the building by security guards .
While some MPs used ladders to scale walls as they escaped parliament , others were picked up by a military helicopter which landed on the roof of the building .
A group of protesters then barged their way into the grounds of parliament , but retreated shortly afterwards and there were no reports of violence .
Most of the support for the red- shirts comes from rural areas and the urban poor , who benefited from many of Mr Thaksin 's populist policies .
On the other side of Thailand 's political divide , the urban middle classes and traditional political elite - who protest dressed in yellow - back the current government .

We jumped into this discussion with an atheist after a challenge to prove that God exists .
But , I would like to note that sometimes in the atheist discussion rooms there are bystanders who will mock , insult , and say vile things about the Lord while the conversation between a Christian and an atheist goes on .
Of course , the insults are hurled at the Christian .
This was happening here .
I have edited out all of the foul language by them .
But , it did detract slightly from my ability to concentrate .
This is one of the tactics I have seen atheists use in text based chat rooms on the Internet .
So , be aware of it and be prepared .
Nevertheless , here is the dialogue I had with " Bill , " an atheist .
Bill : Alright , try and prove God exists ..
Matt : Okay . . .
Are there such things as logical absolutes ?
For example . . .
A cannot be both A and not A at the same time .
Bill : I believe so .
Matt :
There are logical absolutes .
Now , in an atheistic presuppositional worldview , how do you account for the existence of logical absolutes ?
Matt :
Do they reside in matter ?
Can they be quantified , tested , put in a jar ?
Bill :
Well , that depends .
According to Quine 's holism there are no absolutes and any principle can be held eternally by changing any number of other principles
Matt :
But to say there are no absolutes is an absolute and is self - defeating .
Bill : Not really .
Matt : Yes .
To say there are no absolutes is an absolute statement .
It is either true or false .
If it is true , then it is false . . . which is logically contradiction which proves my premise to begin with .
Therefore , it can only be false , and there are such things as logical absolutes .
Bill :
If one rejects the principle of non-contradiction .
Of course , most people would n't want to do that because things get messy quickly
Matt :
But on what basis do you reject the principle of non-contradiction ?
Bill : Because we can arbitrarily choose to accept any statement eternally if we make enough changes to other parts of our total system of knowledge .
Matt :
If you do so based on logic , then you are using logic to defeat itself which is not logical .
Then you have nothing but relativism .
Bill : well , according to Quine all knowledge is subjective .
Matt :
Is it subjective that all knowledge is subjective ?
If so , how can he say that since it is subjective ?
Bill :
No , you just do n't understand .
It is perfectly acceptable to say that subjectively all knowledge is subjective .
You 're just dismissing the possibility because you do n't like it .
Matt :
Not at all .
I am using logic to address it .
Logic is not subjective .
Subjectivity is relativism .
If all things were subjective , then nothing is true . . . except the notion that all things are subjective . . . which means the statement itself is subjective and not absolute .
Bill : and the problem with that is ?
Matt :
The problem is that it is self - defeating .
I 'm not saying that some forms of knowledge cannot be subjective .
I am saying that there ARE logical absolutes .
That is the issue .
Again . . . do logical absolutes exist ?
If you say no , then you are giving me an absolute ; namely , that no logical absolutes exist .
Here is the point .
Logical absolutes exist .
They are , by nature , conceptual absolutes .
Conceptual absolutes exist in the mind .
They do not reside in matter .
These logical absolutes cannot be quantified or tested in a lab .
Yet , they exist .
In fact , scientists USE these logical absolutes as a basis for verifying their science .
The problem for the atheist is accounting for their existence .
Since the logical absolutes are conceptual , they transcend all people at all time and are absolute in all circumstances . . . since they are absolute .
Conceptual Absolutes cannot be accounted for in an atheistic worldview .
But they can be accounted for in a theistic one .
The Absolute God with and absolute mind has conceived of the logical absolutes .
They are a reflection of His mind .
At least I can offer an explanation for their existence where the atheist cannot .
Bill :
The basis of science and scientific knowledge is exactly why Quine discussed the possibility of rejecting certain aspects of knowledge and logic including the law of non-contradiction .
Matt : if the law of non-contradiction is dismissed , then it is n't a law , is it ?
That would also mean that we could go around contradicting ourselves all the time , and that 'd be fine . . . right ?
Bill : I have not yet been convinced of the necessity for logical absolutes
Matt :
If there are not logical absolutes , then you have no logical basis for your statements .
It would then be purely subjective and meaningless .
Bill :
The criterion of meaning is not necessarily based on logic .
Matt :
How do you know ?
Are you using logic to substantiate that or subjectivity ?
Bill : Quine specifically spoke of the relation of knowledge to observation .
If an observation conflicted with a statement of theory or knowledge , than that statement could be held in spit of this ' contradiction ' with observation by making modification to knowledge systems elsewhere , such as modifying or even rejecting laws of knowledge if necessary .
Matt :
What logic is he using to say that ?
( No response ) You have yet to justify the necessity of logical absolutes .
Without them , you cannot prove anything .
( No response ) You have yet to justify that statement .
Unless you can refute that statement , it is true .
Bill :
You can say they exist all you want , but that does n't mean anything .
Matt : Alright . . . well , I guess , I 'll see you later . . .
In this dialogue , I had to filter out all the insults and foul language from the other atheists that were interjected in our conversation .
Their foul behavior , combined with Bill 's unwillingness to acknowledge the existence of logical absolutes , made continuing the discussion very difficult , and it became fruitless .
I suspect Bill saw the logical problem of his system ; namely , that to say there are no logical absolutes leads to relativism .
With a relativistic system , there can be no real truths .
This is a philosophically dangerous slope to rest on .
Nevertheless , I suspect that with him the alternative of not being able to account for logical absolutes as an atheist and my assertion that they reflect God 's thinking ( therefore , God exists ) was something he could not and would not allow to occur .
Therefore , I suspect he tried to keep the argument away from absolutes and into subjectivity .
Nevertheless , this is a good example of the need to define terms and establish the necessity of absolutes .
You see , without them , no truth can really be known .

Questa serie di Tommaso Ausili mi ha colpito molto , mi ha fatto tornare in mente la serie “ Mattatoio ” di Mario Giacomelli del 1961 , realizzata nei macelli comunali di Senigallia , di cui disse :
“ Serie iniziata e finita in pochi minuti per il grido spaventato , pauroso dei poveri impotenti animali che mi hanno straziato l’anima e mi hanno portato a scappare da quel posto maledetto . ”
( verso di una stampa della serie )
“ Al mattatoio volevo capire da vicino come avveniva l’uccisione delle bestie , perchè il solo pensarci mi metteva tristezza .
Al maiale io sapevo che tagliavano la gola , ho visto invece che lo colpiscono alla tempia , in fronte , qui , con una rivoltella e allora stramazzavano al suolo ; gli tiravano su le gambe con un colpo e poi… tan !
Ma non è questo che mi ha messo paura .
Da sopra buttavano giù i maiali , si vede nelle fotografie ; dal camioncino che avevano scivolavano giù , così .
Li vedevo da dove stavo a fotografare .
I maiali , poverini , si mettevano , se questo è il muro , con la testa a ventaglio , così : qui c’era la testa di uno , qui la testa di un altro , come un ventaglio… E gridavano , con una tale forza !
Questo fatto mi ha messo un tale male dentro l’anima che ho preso e sono fuggito subito , di corsa .
Mi sembrava che capissero proprio .
Capiscono : un uomo con un bastone e una grossa corda non riusciva a tenere ferma una mucca che stavano portando dentro per ucciderla ; per fortuna era legata con la corda , perchè se no sarebbe fuggita !
Mica ce la facevano a tenerla !
Solo dopo è riuscito a darle una legata ; c’erano dei pali di ferro , l ’ha legata lì .
Non ci riusciva perchè lo senti che loro sanno che le uccidono .
Gridano proprio , non vogliono .
Quello dei maiali era proprio un grido …
Sai quando i bambini piccoli tutto ad un tratto si mettono a piangere ?
Mi ha fatto così male il cuore che ho preso e ho detto : basta , vado via , non voglio saperne più niente .
Potevo ritornare , conoscevo chi ci lavorava , avevo il permesso , ma non sono tornato più , non ne ho più avuto il coraggio . ”
( dalla lunga conversazione di Mario Giacomelli con Simona Guerra )

Le parole di Tommaso Ausili :
“ Il vertice della catena alimentare consiste in un lungo processo che inizia da una fine : la fine della vita di un animale .
Tra un animale vivo e qualsiasi pezzo di carne ( sia asetticamente impacchettato sugli scaffali del supermercato o in bella mostra dietro il vetro del bancone del macellaio ) c’è il mattatoio .
Queste vere e proprie “ catene di smontaggio ” sono nascoste in anonimi edifici , circondati da muri di cinta , solitamente lontani dal centro delle città e sorprendentemente silenziosi dall ’esterno .
Lontano dagli occhi del consumatore , operai specializzati accompagnano gli animali verso gli ultimi istanti della loro vita , seguendo fredde e chirurgiche procedure .
Nel “ corridoio della morte ” , compiendo gli ultimi passi verso la cosiddetta “ trappola ” , gli animali sembrano consapevoli del loro inevitabile destino .
L’odore della morte è nell ’aria , la paura serpeggia tra gli animali che aspettano il loro turno quando vedono quello che li precede scomparire dietro la porta d’acciaio della trappola .
Le urla di terrore , il disperato scalpitare degli zoccoli sulle pareti metalliche della trappola sono il inequivocabile segnale , che perfino gli animali “ irrazionali ” comprendono , che una volta varcata quella soglia nessuno esce vivo . ”

AN end to poverty .
A cure for divorce .
The elimination of unwed pregnancy .
Fifty years ago next month , when the Food and Drug Administration announced that it would approve the oral contraceptive , these were the highest expectations for it .
At the same time , few of its promoters in 1960 imagined how the pill , as it quickly became known , would become a powerful tool for transforming women ’s lives .
In 1954 , John Rock , the doctor who was leading the research on the pill , expressed the breathless excitement shared by many of his colleagues :
An oral contraceptive , he said , “ would be the greatest aid ever discovered to the happiness and security of individual families  indeed , to mankind ” because “ the greatest menace to world peace and decent standards of life today is not atomic energy but sexual energy . ”
At an international medical conference in Bombay a few years after F.D.A. approval , another doctor unfurled a rolled package of birth control pills into the packed auditorium and announced that the pill would solve India ’s problems of hunger and poverty by leveling off its population .
As it turned out , the pill had little effect on India ’s or any other developing country ’s population  because most women lacked access to medical clinics that could provide them with prescriptions and follow - up exams .
In the United States , some people claimed the pill would free married couples from fears of unwanted pregnancy , improving their sex lives and lowering the divorce rate .
“ With my wife on the pill , any moment is the right moment for love , ” one euphoric husband said in 1969 .
“ Unpremeditated sex is marvelous ! ”

Antagonistic forest nymph Joanna Newsom gave an interview to the Guardian yesterday in which she said a number of backlash -y things about Lady Gaga and Madonna , whom she accuses Gaga of emulating .
“ Gaga ’s approach to image is really interesting , but you listen to the music , and you just hear glow sticks .
Smart outlets for musical journalism give her all this credit , like she 's the new Madonna ...
Although I 'm coming from a perspective of also thinking Madonna is not great at all .
I 'm like , fair enough : she is the new Madonna , but Madonna 's a dumb-ass ! ”
Cue overrated harp - playing in a minor chord , please .
In a follow - up email , Newsom did a terrible impression of someone who ’s apologizing : “ I should n't have called Madonna a dumb-ass .
Her music and she have just gotten so boring to me , this last decade . ”
And regarding Lady Gaga , Newsom justifies her distaste with a thoughtful reference to dialectical materialism : “ [ Gaga ] seems to take herself so oddly seriously , the way she talks about her music in the third person , like she 's Brecht or something . ”
Can Newsom atone for the cardinal sin of Madonna slander with a single nod to Marxism ?
A toss - up , in our book .

" Dieting is a lifelong career for women , " says Agatha Yau , 22 , of Hong Kong .
Yau says she 's 5 - foot - 2 and weighs 100 pounds , but she says she could stand to lose a few more pounds .

HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER HONG KONG 
This glamorous Asian city is known for its mouth - watering dim sum .
Its high fashion .
And its 100 - pound - and - under women .
Agatha
Yau , a marketing executive , is one of these women .
She has done many things over the years to stay trim : taken diet pills , eaten meals of boiled vegetables and practiced delaying gratification .
BODY IMAGE : Tween girls convene for learning , support Q&A : Danielle Steel writes of weight , body image in ' Big Girl ' CHINA : 1 in 10 has diabetes as obesity increases " Sometimes , I 'll look at the food and just smell it , " Yau , 22 , says one morning as she has her breakfast — a skim caramel macchiato from Starbucks .
" I think to myself that once I get married and have kids , I 'll be able to eat it " because there 'll be less pressure to diet .
" Guys here are so small and skinny , " she adds .
" They need to feel masculine , and they do n't if you 're bigger than them . "
In most developed parts of the world , women feel pressure to be thin .
But such pressure is especially intense in Asia — in places like Hong Kong , Seoul and Tokyo — where scores of skinny women seem always to be looking for ways to get even skinnier .
Experts say dieting in Asia tends to be more extreme than in the West because of cultural perceptions of beauty .
" The magic number is to be below 100 pounds , no matter your height or your weight , " says Philippa Yu , a clinical psychologist at the Hong Kong Eating Disorders Association .
In Asia , women want to stay skinny without exercising because muscles are n't considered a feminine feature , says Sing Lee , director of the Hong Kong Eating Disorders Center at Chinese University .
That 's why , " when they want to control their body weight , they eat less or take pills " instead of exerting themselves , Lee says .
Hong Kong dieters also flock to slimming centers throughout the city for ultrasound , electrical stimulation and infrared radiation treatments that promise to whittle away inches of fat .
( The Hong Kong Consumer Council has called some of the slimming centers ' weight - loss claims " dubious . " )
The newest dieting fad in Hong Kong ?
Swallowing parasites .
This radical form of weight loss has become popular enough that the Hong Kong Health Department issued a warning in February that these worms — which are sold on Chinese websites — can cause abdominal pain , vomiting , diarrhea and even death .
Eating disorders on rise
As extreme weight - loss methods take hold in Asia , eating disorders are also increasing .
In Beijing , at Peking University 's Institute of Mental Health , more than 100 patients were hospitalized last year for eating disorders , says Darong Zhang , director of the institute 's treatment center .
That compares with about 20 patients hospitalized 10 years ago .
In Hong Kong , the number of patients treated for eating disorders at one clinic has nearly doubled — to 128 — from 1998 to 2007 when compared with the prior 10 - year period , Lee 's research shows .
Eating disorders also are becoming more common in Korea , but many women do n't want to admit they have a problem , says Mirihae Kim , a psychology professor at Duksung Women 's University in Seoul .
" The last time I tried to run an eating disorder group , only one person showed up , " Kim says .
" So I changed the group 's name to Overeaters Group Therapy . "
The reality is that in Korea , being thin is the " main standard of beauty , " Kim says .
" People say that if you are overweight , you can't study , you will fail the exam .
That 's the attitude here . "
Koreans also say weight plays an important role in whether someone can find employment and how good a job he or she can get .
Duksung Women 's University senior Hyun - Jung Lee , 25 , says she 's dieting because she wants to land a job as a sales representative for a pharmaceutical company .
" If I am in good shape , other people will judge me as diligent and successful in life , " says Lee , who is 5 feet , 4 inches tall and weighs 150 pounds .
" But on the other hand , if I am fat and out of shape , people will think : ' She 's lazy .
Maybe she does n't care about herself . ' "
Unlike others ,
Lee says she 's choosing the " healthy " way to lose weight .
She eats low - fat food and exercises five times a week , two hours each time .
She has lost about 10 pounds and hopes to lose an additional 22 pounds .
" The better you look , the more opportunity you have , " she says .
As Asian societies become wealthier — and people have more options about what to eat — it 's only natural that some will struggle with their weight , experts say .
A new kind of competition With the shift from an agrarian to an urbanized society , " there are definitely more opportunities to overeat , " says David Schlundt , an associate psychology professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville , who researches eating habits .
In Asia , obesity is becoming more common among adolescents , although it 's less of a problem than in the USA .
For now , in cities such as Hong Kong , health professionals say their biggest challenge is dealing with young women who do n't eat enough , not those who eat too much .
" You can see how pervasive slimming is in this culture , " says Yu , of the Hong Kong Eating Disorders Association .
In the old days , Asian women competed with one another to see how many children they could have , but now they compete to be the most successful , and the thinnest , she adds .
Slimming centers have cropped up all over Asia to cater to such desires .
In Shanghai , at Chuanye Slimming Center — a popular Chinese chain — women buy packages of 10 sessions .
They can choose from treatments such as " ultrasonic liposuction , " which claims to vibrate your fat away , or one in which they 're covered with Chinese herbs and bandages , then encased in an Austin Powers - esque , heat - emitting machine that 's said to draw out toxins while toning the body .
During the treatments , " we do n't recommend exercise because it'll turn into muscle , " says manager Xu Wenli , whose clients include brides - to - be who are eager to fit into their wedding dresses .
" After you lose a certain amount of weight , then you can exercise . "
Another slimming center , Marie France Bodyline , which has locations throughout Asia , promises results with " no vigorous exercise . "
One treatment applies heat and a pulsating suction to remove 2 inches of body fat after just one treatment , the company 's brochure says .
Wing Yim , a customer service manager at a Marie France slimming center in Hong Kong , says that women want to be thin , but they already work long hours , so they " do n't want to sweat " to achieve their goal .
Yau , the Hong Kong marketing executive , says slimming centers are too expensive ( a package of treatments can cost hundreds to thousands of dollars ) and she 's not sure they work .
So she loses weight the inexpensive way , she says : via portion control .
For dinner sometimes , she 'll have two spoonfuls of rice with vegetables and soup .
" Dieting is a life - long career for women , " Yau says .
" It 's true for women everywhere , but especially in Hong Kong . "

Why Sen. Ensign should be worried about possible indictment
In the federal penal code , it is known as “ structuring . ”
And it is a word Sen .
John Ensign should remember because it is very likely to be on any indictment with his name on it .
That ’s what I am told by a reliable source familiar with the deliberations occurring inside the Justice Department as federal authorities in Washington try to do with Ensign what they could not do with former Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens :
Get their man .
Or , because they had Stevens and then lost him because of misconduct , Justice wants to make sure if it goes to the next step with Ensign , the charges stick .
Structuring is a broad term that refers to the crime of creating financial transactions to evade reporting requirements — for example , a $ 96,000 payment to your mistress laundered through a trust controlled by your parents and calling it a “ gift ” instead of what it obviously was : a severance payment that had to be reported .
That the feds are looking at structuring as a possible crime will not surprise many old hands who have watched the sordid Ensign saga play out , morphing from a fairly grotesque he - slept - with - his - best - friend ’s - wife - who - was - also - his - wife ’s - best - friend story to a fantastically creepy tale of a senator trying to keep the cuckolded husband quiet by any means necessary , including , perhaps , structuring transactions with businesses in exchange for campaign contributions .
Maybe Ensign wo n’t be indicted .
Maybe he will resign in exchange for not being indicted .
Maybe he will serve out his term or even be re-elected .
Would that be any more incredible than anything else we have seen ?
Two former federal prosecutors in the past two weeks have said there is enough evidence to indict Ensign .
“ Just based on what the senator has said himself and what Mr. ( Doug ) Hampton has said … under the federal standard of probable cause , there ’s enough to indict the senator now , ” ex-prosecutor Stan Hunterton , a well - respected local attorney , said March 19 on “ Face to Face . ”
Then , Thursday on the program , Melanie Sloan , the former federal prosecutor who now heads a D.C. watchdog group that has filed several complaints against Ensign , said , “ I completely think ” Hunterton is right .
The question is how Justice might , ahem , structure a deal with Ensign .
It is clear from observers — and from those who know the thinking inside the Justice Department — that the Stevens debacle has cast a shadow over the Ensign case .
The department is being very deliberate in assembling a case against Ensign .
But Justice has a mountain of documents and e-mails that , combined with the senator ’s own admissions or statements in e-mails , would seem to amount to a formidable case .
And last week ’s New York Times story , showing how Ensign ’s contacts with a local company ( similar to several other interactions ) , show how far the senator was willing to go to get Hampton work , mostly while he was employed by ex-Ensign aides who had formed a lobbying / consulting firm .
The structure , so to speak , is becoming more transparent all the time .
This drip - drip - drip of revelation seems to have left Ensign unfazed , like a man who is slowly drowning but believes he can rise above it — or , perhaps , deludes himself into thinking he can walk on water .
But as Republicans here and in Washington play the pathetic see - no - evil , hear - no - evil , speak - no - evil game vis-a - vis Ensign , it is becoming more obvious that their craven behavior could be self - defeating .
If Ensign gets indicted , he will become a national and state nightmare for the GOP .
National Democrats will brandish him as a symbol of corruption ( they may anyhow ) and local Democrats will wrap the junior senator around the GOP Senate nominee ’s neck , especially because Sue Lowden and Danny Tarkanian foolishly have said they would welcome his support .
I would n’t even be surprised to see Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid directly go after his pal to boost his sagging fortunes .
I can hear it now : “ Sorry , John .
But now you know how Doug Hampton feels — how it feels to be screwed over by your best friend . ”
Why are the national and state Republicans mute ?
Cowardice , perhaps ?
Or is it , as NBC political guru Chuck Todd tweeted Friday , repeating something he previously said on “ Face to Face ” a couple of weeks ago : “ NV / DC GOPers desperate to wait for Gov. Gibbons to be out of office before pushing Ensign out but can they really ( http://nyti.ms/91kElt)?”
The Web link in Todd ’s tweet is to last week ’s Times story , emphasizing the point that if the Republicans wait too long , their silence could be very costly .
And if Ensign gets indicted and no prominent Republican has called for him to resign , there ’s no way to structure that deal to the GOP ’s benefit .
Kepler : Hold the Data ?
Not long ago I sent out a ‘ tweet ’ on the Centauri Dreams Twitter feed talking about the number of planet detection candidates the Kepler mission was working with .
Almost immediately I discovered that the story had become unavailable at the Nature News site , making me wonder whether the figures were right , but the story is back up ( available here ) and I can cite it once again .
Thus :
Since its launch on 6 March 2009 , Kepler , with its 0.95 - metre telescope , has been staring at the same field of stars near the northern star of Vega , looking for tiny reductions in starlight caused by a planet passing in front of a star ’s face .
In January , the Kepler team announced the discovery of five new exoplanets .
[ Kepler principal investigator William ]
Borucki says that the team , as of last week , has found 328 more candidates — but that as many as 50 % of these may be false positives , where objects such binary stars confuse the picture .
328 candidates , and much work ahead in weeding out the genuine planets from the false positives .
But that ’s what this kind of work is all about , a reminder that we ’ll need to let Kepler run its three - year course before we really have the data nailed down and have identified ( we assume ) some terrestrial worlds around Sun - like stars , not to mention small planets around M - dwarfs that may prove to be in the habitable zone .
No need to be in a hurry for results , in other words , and if you read the Nature News story , you ’ll see that there ’s no point in hoping for quick answers anyway .
That ’s because , in addition to the inexorable rhythms of good research , the Kepler team ’s new policy , as recommended by a NASA advisory panel , may be to hold back data on 400 ‘ objects of interest ’ until February of 2011 , by which time some false positives will be eliminated .
The issue is tricky : Researchers are usually allowed to keep data private until publication , which allows for the kind of rigor to be applied that will ensure the work ’s accuracy .
Caution in making media announcements that could lead to later retractions is completely understandable .
The question is how long a delay is reasonable , given the multi- year period Kepler needs to confirm some detections .
We should have a final decision soon on whether the strict policy will be put in place .
This comes up now because in June , Kepler is supposed to be releasing data , exposing the information to a wider audience that can work with the material to confirm planets .
That original policy would have required the team to have turned over its first 43 days worth of data , but now we wait for a final decision on possible policy changes that is due in a week or so .
According to Nature News , the Kepler team hoped to censor 500 objects until mission ’s end in late 2013 , so the subcommittee ’s recommendation actually represents a compromise .
From the article :
Many astrophysics programmes allow researchers a proprietary period with the data .
For instance , guest observers on the Hubble Space Telescope get exclusive use of their data for a year before public release .
But the tradition for NASA Discovery missions — small , principal - investigator - led missions like Kepler — is to make calibrated data available immediately .
That policy has already been changed once for Kepler , last year , when the team was given more than a year to pursue confirmations and work out the kinks in its data processing .
But Borucki says more time is needed because a mission launch delay meant that the team missed out on a season of the ground - based follow - up observations that are needed to verify candidate exoplanets .
He also worries about releasing “ half - baked ” candidates that the media will jump on without an understanding of their uncertainty .
“ My worry is less of being scooped than it is of putting out inaccurate estimates of what exoplanets are really like out there , ” he says .
The mission team ’s views are n’t unanimously held by other astronomers , and the paper quotes dissenting remarks from Scott Gaudi ( Ohio State ) , who believes that other teams could help the Kepler crew work to confirm candidate planets .
ESA ’s Malcolm Fridlund , project scientist for CoRoT , is working under a system where data are kept proprietary for one year , but he ’s quick to note that the upcoming PLATO ( Planetary Transits and Oscillations of Stars ) mission will set a different agenda , one that will require the immediate dissemination of data .
I ’m with Fridlund in believing that with fast release , “ You get a larger community and you get a bigger workforce for free .
It ’s clear that the more people you get involved , the more support you get . ”
After Detroit Red Wings goaltender Jimmy Howard gave up four goals to the Phoenix Coyotes in a 4 - 2 Game 3 loss , many are wondering if it 's time for coach Mike Babcock to replace him with veteran Chris Osgood .
Though he 's been strong in the net all season , critics say , Howard 's inexperience places the Detroit at a disadvantage in the postseason .
So who does Fox Sports Detroit 's Red Wings announcer Ken Daniels think should start in goal for Game 4 ?
" Jimmy Howard , and there 's no doubt about it , " he says on
.
Never in question , really .
He 's got you to this point .
Does he have to be better ?
Yes .
The main thing I liked about Jimmy , he owned the bad goals – ' untimely goals , ' he said .
" He owns them .
He said he should 've had them , and he knows it .
"
This
is the turning point in the series .
This
is what we 've talked about all year : ' Jimmy Howard up for the Calder Trophy .
Jimmy Howard 's had a great season .
Boy , he 's got them through there in big games .
These guys played playoff hockey down the stretch . '
" Uh-uh .
There 's no playoff hockey until ( the ) playoffs start .
And
this
is where you see how Jimmy Howard bounces back from a bad game . "
Hear Daniels talk about where the Red Wings need to improve , defensively , to help support Howard :
One of my favourite old games is Theme Hospital by Bullfrog .
I still have my original disc , and play it a lot .
It has a lot of charm , but it 's not always simple to get running .
So I 'm writing up this guide on playing Theme Hospital on a modern PC .
It has been re-released a couple of times , but my disc has both the Windows and DOS versions on the one disc .
First of all , if you are running a 32 bit version of Windows , have the Windows version , and have no intention of playing the multiplayer mode , just insert your disc and install away .
It still runs perfectly up until XP .
On Vista on my PC , I had to set the compatibility mode to Windows 95 , and turn " Run as Administrator " on and it worked from then on .
The same steps should work the same on Windows 7 32 bit , but I do n't have a computer running that to check .
[ EDIT : A friend informs me that it does n't work on his Windows 7 32 bit , but I still have n't tested for myself .
Try the DOSbox instructions if it does n't work for you ]
If you want multiplayer , or you have the DOS version , things become more complex .
For Vista , the IPX network protocol , which was used by Theme Hospital , along with many games of it's time has been removed .
There is a hack to enable IPX in Vista , but it does not allow you to change the settings , and did not work for me .
If you have XP or earlier , installing IPX to the Hamachi VPN software apparently works but I do n't have access to a XP computer to test it .
The final option which I eventually resorted to using is to install Theme Hospital to DOSbox .
This works on all Windows versions from 2000 up , and for Mac OS X and Linux aswell .
Download and install DOSbox .
Make a folder to store the files .
I recommend you make it something easy to type such as C: \hospital on windows on / home / user / hospital on Linux / OSX .
Then open up DOSbox .
You will be presented with a DOS prompt .
Type the following :
Linux
mount C " /home/user/hospital " mount D " / media /cdrom " -t cdrom
Or Windows ( replace E : with the actual drive letter of your CD rom drive )
mount C " C:\hospital " mount D " E: \ " -t cdrom
Next we need to install Theme Hospital to DOSbox .
First , when your cursor is stuck in the DOSbox window ( as happens later in the process ) , to get it out press Ctrl - F10 .
Now , in dosbox type :
D:/setup.exe
This will open up the Theme Hospital DOS installer .
Click the install button and let it install to C: \HOSPITAL ( note : For windows users , this is equal to C:\hospital \HOSPITAL on the actual system ) .
Then go to the configuration screen .
Configure your sound card and music card .
I found selecting Creative Sound Blaster Pro worked fine for me on Linux and Windows .
I did have to turn my system volume up to full on Linux to hear it as the volume was stuck down low , however .
To avoid typing in the mount commands each time edit your configuration file .
On Windows click the edit configuration file shortcut .
If you are using Linux , you first have to issue the command CONFIG - writeconf dosbox .conf inside of DOSBox .
Afterwards , the dosbox .conf file will be written to your home directory .
At the very end of the file , add the mount commands you entered before installing the game .
Afterwards click exit .
The DOS version of theme hospital is now installed on DOSbox .
To launch the game , first start up DOSbox , then enter in the commands shown :
C : cd HOSPITAL HOSPITAL.EXE
If you want to play multiplayer , read on .
Otherwise , you can stop now .
Edit your configuration file again and replace the line :
ipx=false
with
ipx=true
For each additional computer you wish to play it on , repeat the above process .
Finally pick one computer as the host .
On that computer start DOSbox and type the same instructions as startup last time , but add this before starting the game
ipxnet startserver ipxnet connect 127.0.0.1
Find the host 's IP address .
For internet play , try whatismyip.com .
For local network play , check your network connections dialog .
Now on each client computer type the following ( replace the 10.0.0.5 with your host computer 's IP address ) :
ipxnet connect 10.0.0.5
And start the game on all the computers , enter the network game screen and play away .
Some Final Notes
Gameplay performance on the same system was much better on Vista than it was on Linux .
The game played perfectly under Vista , while under Linux the sound was noticeably choppy .
Whether this is a problem with DOSbox or with my computer 's drivers is not certain .
I 'm not sure if it is possible to play the Windows version against the DOS version .
I have not tried .
Roundtable Occupy Everything : A Roundtable on US Student Occupations Kelly Fritsch / Issue 10 / 5/18/2010
A wave of occupations has swept the coasts of the United States .
In December 2008 , students at the New School for Social Research in New York City occupied their main building for three days while hundreds of supporters cheered outside .
After winning some demands , they left and vowed to be back .
On February 19 , 2009 , students and friends at New York University occupied their student centre , in solidarity with the people of Gaza , to protest high tuition , and to demand the disclosure of all of NYU ’s investments .
After three days , the students were detained by security and forced to leave .
On April 10 , 2009 , students and allies occupied the New School again , claiming the building at 65 Fifth Avenue as a free social space and demanding the resignation of the university president .
This occupation lasted only seven hours before hundreds of police , called in from all over the city , arrived and arrested 19 people inside and three outside the building .
On September 24 , 2009 , students at the public University of California schools walked out across the state in protest of the UC schools ’
Regents , who were that day debating an historic 32 percent tuition hike to solve their budget crisis .
At UC Santa Cruz , students successfully occupied the Graduate Centre for a week .
The lesson was learned : occupation is on the table .
On November 18 and 20 , when the Regents met , schools up and down the coast were occupied , locking down hallways from UCLA to Berkeley , Santa Cruz to Davis , SFSU to Fullerton .
On the March 4 , 2010 national day of action , more students occupied , resisted , blockaded , rioted , and disrupted the normal functioning of their universities and cities .
This roundtable brings together three groups who have been active in the occupations in New York and California to consider the role of these occupations , and their implications for radicals outside the university .
Anti-Capital Projects ( California ) –
One of the groups involved in some of the occupations at UC Berkeley and elsewhere in the Bay Area .
Architects of the Negation ( Santa Cruz , California ) – A group interested in putting occupation as a tactic on the table and seeing where it can go .
Dead Labour ( NYC ) – After barricading doors and fighting leftists at the first New School occupation , facilitating a Hegel reading group in the middle of the NYU occupation , mooning the crowd in the second New School occupation , and after studying Das Kapital and reading some Endnotes , this group came together to answer other people ’s questions .
Why occupy the university ?
Anti-Capital Projects ( ACP ) : As a state - funded institution , the university is an obvious site to mount our retaliation against the past 40 years of neoliberal counter - revolution .
Other major institutions do n’t have the clear advantages the university does : young people confined in a physical space tagged with largely unfounded abstractions like “ experimentation , ” “ exploration , ” and “ learning . ”
The university is a meaningful place to begin because its population is made up of energetic youth who interface with one another regularly .
And who would n’t gravitate toward occupation after years of petitions , button wearing , and voting campaigns aimed at holding on to legislative gains won during the 1930s and 1960s ?
What student would n’t want to apply experimentation , exploration and learning in reality ?
The university produces future labour .
As such , it is one of the places in which the future , or its absence , can be contested .
By creating disruptions here , we render visible and materially oppose the future that awaits most students – the debt , the shitty jobs , the empty obedience .
We would never suggest that this is the only place where one should fight , or even that it ’s a better place than others .
At the same time , we see nothing else to do but fight as hard as we can where we are .
Architects of the Negation ( AN ) :
The university is a place through which many bodies pass waiting to be fully deployed into particular sectors of production .
It is the transition space from either “ youth ” to “ adult ” or from one job to another .
While an occupation within the university may be ephemeral , the traces left from an occupation are embedded in the bodies that travelled the terrain of such an autonomous space and can be deployed within the greater social field once these bodies exit the university .
Since the university is this juncture of transition , it is fertile ground for disseminating the tactic of occupation and generating the kind of social fabric that can counter the fabric of capital .
Dead Labour ( DL ) : Occupation is not merely a means to an end , it is also an expansion of power over the territories in which we circulate .
Occupying the spaces in which we work , live , study , consume , and reproduce the social relations of our world is the most obvious of actions .
In repossessing the spaces that possess us , we liberate their use .
Occupying an institution stops it from functioning normally .
During the occupation , the question becomes : what is happening to the university ?
In New York , universities were occupied in response to issues particular to each institution : budget cuts , the elimination of student space , and the predictable behavior of the President and Board of Trustees .
While the impetus for each action was particular , as the crisis of capital deepened , our actions gained a wider resonance .
The university is a site where the reproduction of knowledge meets the reproduction of capital .
On the one hand , the most minor event becomes universally significant in its theatrical novelty and theoretical strength ; on the other hand , the most significant of actions seems unable to escape the university form , trapped in the very structure it seeks to shatter , incapable of situating itself beyond itself .
In other words , people all over the world understood and contemplated the occupation of a university on Fifth Avenue , but this did not necessarily help the later occupations expand beyond the walls of academia .
This contradiction will only be resolved when the struggle in the universities is no longer limited to the universities , when the buildings and knowledges that compose universities are used in struggles that have nothing to do with education .
If the social relations that confine us to the set of behaviors that make up the university are n’t completely destroyed , if the space is not opened completely , and if the act of disrupting existing social relations is not expanded , then our struggle will not be successful .
What is the significance of these occupations ?
AN : At UCSC , the occupations have provided the foundation for building a community against capital .
More generally , UC - wide occupations have given Governor Schwarzenegger reason to consider a realignment of priorities , with important consequences : a shift of funding has been considered from prisons to public education .
Occupations have also been recomposing the discourse on violent versus non-violent direct action , and resituating the terms of the debate in terms of private property on a wider scale than before .
These occupations have confused university administrators .
They have been unsure of how to respond to these situations , and on several occasions have even preemptively shut down several administrative buildings for fear of another occupation .
This shows the political presence established by the occupations .
DL : The significance of these occupations lies in the limits of struggle they reveal : the division between those who want to manage struggles for their own activist capital and those who want to release them in every unpredictable way .
They reveal the ability to use and abuse spaces and the extent to which we are used and abused by them .
How does the movement transcend the dilemmas and failures of earlier student movements ?
How does it not ?
ACP : The will to act as a single bloc – in the manner of , say , SDS in the 1960s – and according to procedural logics of assembly and voting appears increasingly hollow to many people , even though many vanguard groups try to push this political form .
There is no real possibility for this kind of unity of action anymore : the commonalities that seem real to people are subterranean ones , based upon resonances and friendships , common tactics , and common targets .
Of course , the collapse of faith in formal organizations has both advantages and drawbacks – it makes coordination harder and it ’s not as easy for people to plug into these kinds of actions .
But we ’re better off as an informal , anonymous group of actors .
We ca n’t be as easily targeted , infiltrated , or neutralized .
The current occupation movement remains isolated from the moment of value production and employment proper , from the formal working class under the chains of trade - unionism and the restructuring of the capital - labour relationship over the last 40 years .
There are attempts now – by more moderate groups within the student movement , in coordination with teachers unions and public sector workers – to coordinate a general day of student - worker strikes and school walkouts across a broad swath of the public sector ( March 4 was the first attempt but there were far fewer strikes outside of those by students than many of the organizers hoped for ) .
A general strike seems like a worthy goal to many activists in the US only because they are so infrequent here .
We are a long way from Rosa Luxemburg ’s mass strike , and most activists here seem unaware that the one - day general strike , common in other countries , is often not very effective at winning anything , let alone questioning the nature of the mode of production .
To do that , we ’d need an indefinite , unbounded general strike organized outside of the unions , and in open opposition to them .
If such a thing plays a part in social upheaval in the US , it will probably come in response to riots and conflicts caused by the unemployed , by students , by immigrants cast out of the workplace .
The restructuring of work and the workplace over the past 40 years has been too effective at fragmenting , neutralizing , and subsuming labour actions – and too few workers in the US are organized , in any case .
As a result , we are forced to attack first in the spheres of circulation and reproduction .
This is where the initial victories will come .
The university is just one of those fronts .
AN : We think it ’s a bit too early to say how this student movement might transcend previous failures , considering that the future of the movement is ahead of us .
While the widespread use of occupation as tactic is the biggest difference with previous struggles , at least within the US , the student movement is still rife with decaying forms of activism pushing their own agendas and framing the movement narrowly as a “ student ” movement .
The biggest problem at this point is to engender effective modes of collective decision - making .
The contemporary student movement is unique in that it is responding to a particular crisis of capital that affects the student populace directly .
This provides a chance for students to fight for themselves instead of for others .
DL : Social movements are like economic bubbles : they rise and
fall , predictably to some , unpredictably to others .
Movements today resemble too much the rhythm of the market , the physiognomy of the state , the language of the church , and the tactics of a cult .
We hope , with our small gesture , to have contributed to subverting the standard activist model of outreach to the “ masses , ” building a “ movement , ” and finishing with some symbolic actions that are “ heard ” by power .
We did the complete opposite by starting with a strong , concrete social action with groups of friends who are fighting for nobody but themselves .
This action itself is a form of communication to others , a form that needs no propaganda .
No prior waiting , no slow building , no abstract audience – we build , and speak through the activities themselves , which need no social movement to make them intelligible .
Do those outside the university sector hear it ?
Those inside the university will be outside soon enough , and those outside return inside during times of crisis .
The point is not merely to have communication between inside and outside , but to repeatedly confuse this boundary .
When a thousand students , non-students , workers , and non-workers from all over New York City stood outside the NYU occupation and fought the police as a small number of people inside held down the floor , the inside / outside barrier began to crack .
Those outside the university do hear the action and come with their force , yet the action itself has not expanded across the social terrain .
But does that mean it wo n’t ?
Our victory can only be assured when the university no longer holds a monopoly on knowledge and no longer reproduces the capital - labour relation .
What could possibly make that happen ?
The suspension of wage - labour in general , an event that opens up the material possibility of reconstituting our lives without the mediation of exchange - value .
We will fail , but in doing so we point to the limits that revolutionary struggle must overcome .
These limits cannot be seen in theory until they are breached in practice .
How does the movement break out of the confines of the campus and connect with other struggles ?
ACP : First , by realizing that the participants are already outside of the confines of the campus .
We are workers and renters and people with credit cards and massive debt and people shaped by the dead rationality of the present .
The moment of break out – if it comes – will probably occur through an inter-campus generalization of the struggle in which people realize these other moments of common antagonism and stop being “ students ” in order that they can stop being “ workers ” or “ renters ” or “ debtors . ”
Then will begin the rent strikes , the debt strikes , the barricades and auto- reductions .
Or not .
There is a question of timing here .
One wants to let the student movement reach its limits , run its course , and produce as much antagonism as possible before shifting to other sectors , in order to increase the force brought to bear by this transfer of power .
Housing is one place where this common struggle emerges , since everyone involved in the student movement is forced to pay rent .
We can also focus on the banks that profit from both student loans and other kinds of debt .
These discussions about how to break out of the confines of the university are currently underway , but objective conditions will probably play as much a part as any decision or choice that we make .
The linkages , if they appear , will probably occur because a moment of conflict breaks out alongside this one , a moment of conflict that , because it bears on our lives , we can plug into and connect to the university conflicts .
AN : The current discourse of individuals having no future has been our point of departure , emphasizing the complete emptiness to individuals of a seemingly alien economy that is nothing other than the “ unconscious ” activity of individuals themselves .
This crisis has been generated not by “ the economy , ” but by our very own self - activity .
Of course there are a multiplicity of factors that combine and individuate bodies , but the total critique of the society of capital has to come from all fronts .
Within the student movement there have been traces of this connecting of different struggles .
The recent series of racial attacks across the Univeristy of California system makes possible critiques of race , gender , and sexuality that could have an impact beyond the material confines of the university .
On this particular issue , what is necessary now is an analysis of race , gender , and sexuality that is able to overcome the limits of identity politics .
DL : Ours was never merely a campus struggle .
The campus is the meeting point for the sharing of our hostilities that we take advantage of simply because we can : the buildings are large , the populations are sympathetic , and the consequences are trivial .
However , the more one fights , the greater the punishments become , and unless the party expands , it will inevitably collapse .
Through the social self - defense of occupied spaces , we bind ourselves to others , forging new material solidarities .
We make friends , we make enemies , we make partisan that which before was banal .
These friends and enemies might be born through the campus , but they are not necessarily tied to it .
Struggles are never by their nature merely insular , but rather contain within them the reflection of a totality of general contradictions in class society .
We blend into struggles over housing , work , and against budget cuts all over the city .
We act as accelerators .
For instance , when we heard that striking workers in a local factory were thinking about occupying , we went to the picket line to offer what we could : our bodies , technical skills , willingness to get arrested , media contacts , tools , and passion .
They needed no convincing .
Unfortunately , the boss locked them out before the scheduled day of action , and our potential sharing of force was preempted .
In this failed process , we learned our strength and our weakness as well .
This situation was external to the university as a particular place , yet linked , as all struggles are , by the totalizing orbit of capital that runs across the entire terrain of everyday human activity .
What is the relationship between occupation and intensifying social conflict ?
AN : Occupations are inherently antagonistic since they are active seizures : direct expropriations of another ’s property .
The level of intensifying social conflict can vary in its duration , but overall this is immanent within the very concept of occupation itself .
During an occupation , the feeling of enmity toward those who attempt to dismantle it ( usually the administration and police , but sometimes activists as well ) tends to increase .
Within the Kerr Hall occupation , for example , the question of the police ’s entrance onto the scene always lurked in the background since we had taken over an administrative building .
This generated immediate connections and bonds formed against this possibility .
However , when the police came the discourse of non-violence was unleashed , preventing the implicit escalation of the occupation from fully actualizing itself into a direct confrontation .
The problem of developing this opposition in - itself into a for - itself form of direct conflict remains .
This past fall , the movement made a show of force through a series of occupations interconnected both spatially and temporally .
Occupations spread throughout California and globally , resulting in a chain of dispersed conflicts .
This gesture of repetition is where our strength lies .
Occupations and other forms of disruption should be constant , shaping new openings , and instilling new rhythms of attack .
DL : In itself , an occupation is nothing but an abstraction , a form decontextualized from its particular conditions of emergence .
In this way , the project is neutralized , barred from being a necessary intensification of social conflict .
Rather , the intensification of social conflict , which is the permanent state of class society , finds potential expression in occupation .
Between December 2008 and May 2009 in New York City , a whole series of actions expressed this intensification .
Besides the occupations of the New School and NYU , there were marches , acts of vandalism , solidarity actions , street parties , rooftop riots , and anti-police demos .
New risks were taken and new friendships were made outside the boundaries of political organization or university identity .
The complicity , coordination , and discipline formed through the occupations and actions of that season were the ground upon which future actions were taken in the winter of 2009 and the spring of 2010 .
However , the irreversible intensification of social conflict will only come when the occupation of space as a form becomes a self - reproducing dynamic whose content knows no bound , when said space becomes a vessel for negation , a place of refuge , and a staging ground for fresh attacks .
Occupied spaces can become centres of activity , sites for reproducing the energy , knowledge , and capacity for people to further their action .
Despite our own struggles and the impressive force of our Californian comrades , no action has come close to truly intensifying social conflict .
This potential , nevertheless , still haunts the present .
ACP : Forgive our geometry here , but we have too long understood the world as an equilateral triangle inherited from the New Left wholesale : a “ few at the top , the rest of us at the bottom . ”
For them , the only direction of a social movement was bottom - up .
What we ’re beginning to understand is that the world is a multi-axis shifting - shape of forces .
The triangle exists in this multi-axis , multi - form cloud .
Through market expansion , states of emergency , democracy , commodity exchange , labour , social movements , the triangle moves , inverts itself , loses and wins ground , expands , destabilizes and stabilizes , and changes shape .
The world is more complex than a triangle , and relations change .
Conflict momentarily changes the relations of the triangle into the unpredictable reality of the cloud .
When we operate as “ student protesters ” we operate within the triangle .
Through conflict and antagonism in the triangle , students can begin to recognize the triangle for what it is : certainly the polarization between the two “ sides ” ( the students versus capital , the state , and the university administration ) , but also the “ social movement ” sector of the triangle and its attempt to assimilate more of the multi-axis world into its linear , equilateral logic .
An occupation is a moment of rupture in this relation .
In those brief moments we are not entirely subsumed by the triangle ’s categories or relations : we create openings .
There is no guarantee as to its effects , no necessary causal relationship between the act of occupation and its further unfolding .
As always , social conflict within the triangle is met with batons , Tasers , jail time , media campaigns – we do not celebrate this but understand that in the past 40 years the realm of “ the political ” has been a site where social movements have been subsumed by adopting the logic ( and thus the desires ) of the triangle .
The agents of the previous mass exodus are now , depending on their place within the triangle , either serving multiple life sentences , sitting on the boards of NGOs , or they are our professors .
We have an opportunity to avoid this process of capture when students take over buildings , highways , and destroy property relations in the cities and in the administrative offices .
These acts speak to us as much as to those agitating in other sectors , and based on the number of solidarity messages and actions transmitted from around the world , it is a useful language .
On our end , we intend to keep the conversation going .
What does it mean to organize without any demands ?
AN : While demands will inevitably be part and parcel of any struggle , the first occupation at UCSC and its slogan of “ no demands ” should be seen within the context of an ever - widening fragmentation of material interests .
Generalized demands , while immediately universal , are vague and oftentimes ridiculous : “ stop the cuts , ” “ stop the war , ” etc .
On the other hand , particular demands correspond to a select portion of the populace .
They are also potentially endless , tied together by the conjunctive ‘ and ’ ( “ we want this AND this AND this … ” ) .
In demanding nothing , we sought to cut the Gordian knot of overwrought demand - making procedures .
“ No demands ” gives us a strategic perspective that can be adapted to the many shifts within the movement .
DL : Bread and butter demands will exist as long as everyday struggles exist – that is , as long as the class struggle exists .
“ No demands ” arises out of the normal pulse of capitalism when the room to negotiate and stall misery narrows to almost nothing .
The great failures of demands and movements is what characterizes this historical period : the spectrum ranges from American labour unions fighting over whose wages to cut in order not to be fired , to German workers self - managing their way into strike - bike.com , to Indian workers bashing their bosses ’ brains and then going home to sleep and look for work the next day .
What is there to demand when your office can be relocated to a country you have n’t seen , your home can be taken away by a conglomerate of faceless investors , and the government can’t even pay the bills it owes to god knows who ?
Still , it is meaningless to actually prescribe “ demand nothing ” outside of a revolutionary crisis ; we can only hope to accelerate struggles that are already around us on the ground , of which demands are a part , and then push the obvious , if and when that time arises .
This in turn requires very little soapboxing .
ACP : The relationship between a struggle and its demands is complicated .
We recognize that struggles do not typically begin from a stance of having no demands but rather reach such a development at a crucial point when enough force within the movement has been constituted .
Our position of no demands can be seen as a challenge to the broader movement and to ourselves : when do we stop asking for what they can give to us and instead initiate acts of appropriation ?
We are tired of a radicalism that speaks only to our victimization and not to our strengths .
Historically , we gained social services because the federal government wanted to sustain capital expansion .
We know their empirical failures , we know that the state cannot dole out resources equitably or make reparations for our histories of genocide , displacement , and forced labour .
We were born into a social arena where victimized narratives are accepted and tolerated .
We want a radicalism that carries with it the knowledge of very real oppression and pain , but strategically wields the strength of a social force , and leads with joy .
In this way , there is literally nothing to demand .
Interestingly , the discussion of demands has not addressed what might be our primary potential : winning that which allows us to continue to fight .
Not every victory in struggle need be a recuperative one .
Instead , such victories might put the forces of order on the defensive , strengthen us , and allow us to make sense of why we fight at all .
What is the role of organizers in relation to the police in the context of the current crisis ?
DL : The crisis of capital in which we live has crossed the university gates to sit in our classrooms ; it has wandered amongst our workplaces and laid us off ; it has traversed our homes and raised our rents .
Crisis is a lived experience and in these situations there usually emerge two coeval forms of social enforcement : the policeman and the activist .
The former contains , threatens , and arrests anyone who seeks to challenge the normalized state of emergency that crisis conditions impose ; the latter urges everyone around to act to challenge the situation , but does so in a way that only manages the crisis .
The means by which the activist urges one to resist are the means of reintegration .
That is : petition , rally , press conference , and symbolic speech .
None of these are wrong in themselves .
Still , they become tools of neutralizing escalation when such a sequence of struggle follows the same exact process of the last 30 years , a process known to all and thus easily accommodated before it even begins .
When the time comes for action , leftists are no better than cops .
Recent history is rife with examples .
At the New School , it was the student activists who were the strongest obstacles to the occupation : wanting to delay , make consensus , appeal to the long - term movement .
At NYU , the activists were both the cause and limit of their struggle .
In Los Angeles , the activists succeeded in blocking the students from storming the Regents meeting .
In Berkeley , the activists blocked the entrance to an empty building .
In Santa Cruz , the activists evaporated into the struggle itself .
The abolition of the social roles of the activist , the professional organizer , and the enforcer of property relations is inextricably tied to the abolition of capitalist social relations , but cannot wait for the latter .
The destruction of specialists in struggle is one task within the struggle itself , a task that ca n’t be achieved by retreating to the public at large .
On the contrary , when there are no more specialists , neither will there be a ‘ public . ’
ACP : In California , the most characteristic tactic of repression shared by both the administration and the official student movement is the rhetoric around “ outside agitators . ”
After the Durant Hall occupation and street conflict in Berkeley in late February , “ outside agitators ” were blamed by activists , the administration , the media , and the police for most of the violence .
We affirm this accusation and turn it on its head because a true student struggle , a socially - effective strike , would also have to include all those excluded from the university .
As more and more people are turned away from the public campuses of California , it would be asinine to claim that anything else would expand the limits of the movement .
Non-students have just as much of an interest in blocking the reproduction of class society as anyone else , if not more .
AN : The police have always been the police .
Let ’s not be too surprised .
How do we counter these forces ?
While there is already an underlying anti-police sentiment rooted in many communities , it is isolated .
What is needed is to assert our presence over theirs , preemptively blocking the deployment of police presence .
Unfortunately , with the culture of non-violence that has become so pervasive throughout activist culture , many activists serve as an appendage to the police force .
What prevents many individuals from attempting any illegal action is not just the police themselves , but also the possibility of a snitch , someone who decides to become an organ for repression .
This breeds a security culture that is sometimes stifling and stops any movement forward due to suspicion of others .
On other hand , activist - organizers also serve as functionaries of politicians and university administrators .
Within particular situations , these activist - organizers will attempt to regulate the situation and delimit its possible trajectories .
In other words , most of the time they will strive for containment .
Moralizing and paternalism aimed at instilling guilt are the primary weapons of the activist - organizers during these situations .
What are the broader implications of occupation ?
DL : There are no broad implications of occupation , because it ’s not simply a tactic .
It is not purely either symbolic or concrete , not just a means or an end .
It is a medium of action in which means and ends themselves are formed and tested .
All occupations are particular to their conditions , their occupiers , and their police force .
Occupying is a way of extending , expanding , articulating , and expressing a struggle , a struggle which itself already expresses a certain contradiction of capital .
Occupation as a form is empty ; it is the content of the human activity that makes it happen that is to be evaluated , understood , and overcome .
People can occupy something “ in solidarity , ” but solidarity is then not external support for another ’s “ cause , ” but rather the internal development of a power based on the sharing of a similar enemy across space .
For example , our numerous marches in solidarity with the California occupations were as much for us as for them .
ACP : It ’s not a means to an end but the basic principle of communism – seizure of the means of production .
Still , occupying a university hall does not really qualify as such a seizure , and it ’s sort of a problem that , under the conditions of the global market and its asymmetries , the means of production are located in Bangladesh , Iowa , and Mexico .
It ’s also hard to meet your own needs when you ’re surrounded by cops .
In other words , we do n’t think this is the revolution .
But the elaboration of material connections between university
occupations and other types of appropriation and disruption is one way in which the revolution might manifest itself .
We hope to have put the immediate possibility of a living communism – one that does not depend upon the consolidation of hegemony or a conquest of state power – on the table .
On March 4 , 2010 , 150 people marched onto the I - 880 freeway overpass in downtown Oakland .
The result was a mass arrest , even though this was n’t the intention of the participants .
An uncanny resemblance to the anti-war movement and its representational actions has led some to critique the abandonment of the tactic of occupation .
More than a few critics seem to hold a nearly mystical view of the transformational aspects of an occupied space .
These critics miss a crucial point , though – that which is shared must be coordinated alongside that which is suppressed : value production and commodity exchange .
Maybe next time small groups of proletarians will briefly seize the highways long enough to set alight a row of tires , in the style of the Argentinian piqueteros , rather than marching en-masse into a trap .
Maximum damage / minimal risk , as some French hipsters once wrote .
The highway action points in the direction of this elaboration , even if its execution was less than perfect this time around .
AN : What ’s more important in an occupation : the building itself , or the experiments and relations that happen inside it ?
So far , occupations have proved to be a space for experimenting with new modes of interacting .
While foreclosed homes , abandoned warehouses , and the like are fertile soil for experimenting in forming new communities against capital , these can also lead to simply co-existing with capital , as is the case with the various squatting movements throughout Europe .
What is necessary in the long term is the immediate and direct expropriation of spaces already in operation , spaces that are ( re ) producing and circulating capital .
This is , after all , what an occupation is : an immediate and direct offensive against capital .
The problem is the scale of such an attack .
It can not be relegated to small - scale seizures of buildings , or lead to centralization in a particular territory .
Is it possible to coordinate a widespread offensive of initiatives predicated on occupation ?
Did you know that all the numbers on a roulette wheel add up to 666 ?
Photo by John Wardell
While I , myself , am not superstitious nor religious , many who are might recall that 666 is the occult " number of the beast , " associated in the Bible with the Antichrist .
While the origin of this number is not certain , it may be as simple as the number containing the sequence of one symbol of each type ( excluding M = 1000 ) in Roman numerals :
The beast number has several interesting properties which numerologists may find particularly interesting .
In particular , it is equal to the sum of the squares of the first 7 primes :
And there 's your random fact for the day .
John Melloy points us to Lon Juricic , who crunches the numbers , and discovers that the 998 point whoosh was actually closer to 1250 points .
How ?
The Dow actually fell closer to 1,250 points — if you calculate the average using low prices for stocks that traded away from the NYSE .
Off exchange trades that were allowed to stand :
“ This is not using the trades that were busted because they were 60 percent off the market , according to Lon Juricic , who ran the shocking numbers for his informative research site StreetInsider.com .
These are trades that stand for the stocks , but just did n’t go into the index calculation .
The low for Procter & Gamble [ PG ] during the quick collapse was $ 39.37 , which occurred on another exchange and still stands to this day because it was within the parameters of legitimate trades as dictated by regulators and the exchanges .
But the low price for P&G that went into the Dow calculation during the crash was $ 56 .
Juricic calculated his new Dow low of 9625.97 for that day just like the Dow Jones Indexes service does , but using these off - exchange lows .
He added the 30 components up using the $ 15 low for General Electric [ GE ] , the $ 67.98 low for 3 M [ MMM ] and so on .
Then he divided by the Dow divisor for Thursday .
The divisor is an essential part of calculating index levels which accounts for stock splits in the member stocks through the years . ”
Pretty wild stuff — and that is likely how the index should be calculated — based on actual trades ( Assuming they all occurred at the similar times ) . . .

Did Dow Actually Drop 1250 in ‘ Flash Crash ?
John Melloy , Executive Producer , Fast Money
CNBC , May 12 2010

Wes and Tony barely survived Stumptown Comics Fest , largely because of the fires and the fistfights .
Big thanks to everyone who came by to say hello or throw hot coffee in our faces .
Both were equally refreshing .
WASHINGTON — North and South Korea accelerated their diplomatic confrontation on Tuesday over the recent sinking of a South Korean warship , with the South saying it would redesignate the North its “ archenemy ” and North Korea severing almost all of its remaining ties to its far wealthier neighbor .
American officials were cautious in their public statements , eager to avoid giving the North reason for further escalation .
Military officials said no additional American combat forces , warships or aircraft had moved into the region — a standard practice in many past crises , including one in 2003 .
Officials watching activity on the ground through satellite photographs said there was no “ unusual ” activity at North Korea ’s main nuclear test site .
Both South Korea and the United States have blamed North Korea for the sinking of the ship , which they say was hit by a torpedo .
The biggest concern within the Obama administration is that the diplomatic skirmishing between the North and South that has followed could spill , by design or accident , into an armed confrontation .
The confrontation already appears to be the closest the two countries have come to open hostilities since 1994 , when the North threatened to turn Seoul into a “ sea of fire ” if its nuclear violations were referred to the United Nations for sanctions .
South Korea and the United States have said they will bring the issue of the sinking , which killed 46 sailors , to the Security Council for unspecified action .
If you happen to possess any cartoon images on your hard drive – or on your bookshelf – that just might depict children involved in or present at a sexual act , then you should probably have deleted them already .
Today – April 6 2010 – is the day on which various sections of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 come into effect , including those ( sections 62 to 68 ) that specifically criminalise possession of " a prohibited image of a child " .
The purpose of this offence is to " close a loophole " and to target certain non-photographic images of children , possession of which is not covered by existing legislation .
Henceforth , you will be committing an offence if you possess non-real , non-photographic images that are pornographic , " grossly offensive , disgusting or otherwise of an obscene character " and focus on a child ’s genitals or anal region , or portray a range of sexual acts " with or in the presence of a child " .
Hitherto , the state of play in the UK - courtesy of the Protection of Children Act 1978 ( pdf ) - was that possession , creation or distribution of an indecent image of a child was a criminal offence .
Legislation and precedent extended the law to cover " pseudo - photographs of children " : that is , images that were created by means of the manipulation of real , non-indecent images of children and adults , to create an end result that a jury deemed indecent .
Finally , the Sexual Offences
Act 2003 raised the age limit for such imagery to 18 – thereby creating the novel legal concept that an act that might legally be viewed in real life became criminal as soon as it was committed to film ( or pixels ) .
The rationale behind the original law was that every indecent image of a child was also an image documenting the abuse of a child .
The extension of such a law to " pseudo - photographs " strained at that principle , although in cases where a real identifiable individual was featured , the logic – of protecting that individual from the traumatic effects of discovering or being aware of the existence of such imagery – remained intact .
Debate on the new law made clear that two additional principles were being called into being .
The first – for which evidence is contradictory – is that there is a natural progression in the expression of paedophilia , with individuals moving from fantasy to acting out of the fantasy .
In such cases , images are considered to encourage such a progression .
The second motivation is more controversial and appears to stem from a knee - jerk " if paedophiles enjoy it , it must be bad " .
Thus , in the original consultation , one police force declared its upset at being unable to do anything in respect of an individual who possessed nothing other than indecent cartoon imagery , and being required by law to return the material it had confiscated .
Otherwise , the thinking behind this legislation appears typified by Labour MP George Howarth who , during the committee stage of the Bill , famously observed , of a drawing scrawled on a piece of paper : " If somebody is in the process of arousing themselves sexually by that process , it must be part of something .
In a lot of cases , it will be part of something that will lead on to something else . "
Critics have objected to this legislation on two grounds .
The first , that if there is now a criminal penalty in respect of possessing cartoon imagery , this may have the unintended consequence of lessening barriers to the possession of real imagery .
There is also some concern that whether a cartoon falls into this category or not will depend on whether a jury decides the age of a cartoon image was over or under 18 .
Also , within the small print of the law , is the issue of when a sexual act may be deemed to take place " in the presence of a child " .
Same frame ?
Same room ?
Same cartoon , but different page ?
The Ministry of Justice has declined to answer - although a court ’s interpretation of that wording may at some future time determine whether an individual goes to prison , or walks free . ®
Le Top - braille , un appareil de poche permettant la lecture instantanée en braille ou en vocal de n'importe quel texte imprimé , a remporté à l'unanimité le Concours Lépine 2010 .
A partir de tout document écrit , un livre , une revue ou une notice de médicaments , le boîtier à lecture optique retranscrit un texte en braille pour les aveugles et mal voyants , grâce à des picots qui surgissent au fur et à mesure de la lecture .
Il est également doté d'une fonction audio pour transformer le texte en son .
L'innovation de Raoul Parienti a été choisie à l'unanimité par les 47 membres du jury .
M. Parienti , ancien professeur de mathématiques et ingénieur de formation , s'est dit " ravi et même émerveillé par la prestigieuse récompense " .
" Nous allons pouvoir dire aux aveugles et mal voyants qu'ils ont un produit qui peut leur simplifier la vie " , a déclaré le lauréat qui espère voir le prix de vente ( 1680 euros ) de son invention baisser considérablement pour le rendre accessible au plus grand nombre .
" Nous n'avons vendu que 150 appareils [ via sa société Vision SAS ] , c'est très peu au regard des 100 000 mal voyants et aux 250 000 très mal voyants en France " , a - t - il encore souligné .
M. Parienti , qui enseigne actu6ellement l'art de l'innovation et de la créativité à l'université de Nice Sofia - Antipolis , a estimé que ce concours allait permettre de communiquer plus largement sur son innovation .

The deployment of Linux on the desktop and in the server room is well served by the general - purpose distribution .
In the embedded world things are very different : although Linux is used widely , the concept of the general - purpose distribution is much less in evidence .
Many vendors rely on forked board support packages or home - grown builds to create their systems , effectively creating their own customized distribution in the process .
While embedded platforms represent a challenge to the traditional Linux distribution , there is no shortage of community projects to support the development of embedded Linux systems .
What makes embedded systems different ?
The primary challenge presented by embedded systems is their diversity .
Embedded device hardware tends to vary both in terms of design and capability .
Even between generations of the same product , it is not unusual for a major system component such as the CPU to change completely .
In addition , most embedded devices contain a fair amount of custom , closed - source software which is not packaged by a distribution .
The combined effect of this hardware and software diversity is that most embedded devices are unique in one way or another , meaning it is difficult to design an embedded distribution which is simultaneously general enough to be useful and targeted enough to be efficient across a range of embedded platforms .
To make matters worse , embedded Linux development often takes place behind closed doors .
In some cases this is due to a lack of hardware to support wider community involvement , since development platforms for many embedded devices will only exist within the labs of the companies manufacturing them .
In other cases , manufacturers of embedded Linux devices rely on keeping their designs as secret as possible in order to keep ahead of the competition .
This secrecy tends to stifle the community engagement that helps fuel the development of many desktop and server distributions .
In addition to the closed nature of many embedded projects , embedded Linux distributions face a challenge of a lack of perceived utility within developer communities .
Given the heavily customized nature of much of the software within a given device , developers tend to view any external software as a starting point rather than a completed product .
Rather than a distribution being a central provider , it is simply another component in a larger project .
Meeting the challenge
Despite the challenges of the embedded Linux ecosystem , embedded Linux tools and distributions can offer real value to developers working within that space .
Various approaches are being developed by a number of embedded Linux projects , generating a suite of tools which may be brought to bear on a particular project according to its needs .
Dispensing with tools : the DIY approach
If complete control over configuration is important to an embedded developer , then the most efficacious approach is to build the whole system manually .
This would typically involve hand - crafting a cross-compilation toolchain targeting the embedded device , then downloading and building the individual packages required to make up the software stack .
Although a somewhat arduous process , the DIY approach to embedded Linux offers several key benefits , including the ability to fine - tune packages to requirements , an enforced understanding of the precise contents of the embedded root file system , and the ability to pick and choose system components in order to meet project goals .
The basics of putting together a DIY embedded Linux system are illustrated in Karim Yaghmour 's book Building Embedded Linux Systems .
In addition , the Cross Linux From Scratch guide covers the creation a completely DIY cross-compiled Linux installation in greater detail .
Meta -distributions and configurable build architectures
The DIY approach to an embedded distribution offers the greatest control and flexibility , but it does require a large investment of time and no small amount of expertise to get a basic system up and running .
To help mitigate this , a number of configurable build tools exist which simplify the process .
This approach combines the flexibility of selecting , configuring , and building sources by hand with the convenience of a framework which hides much of that detail until a developer needs it .
At the time of this writing , several different build architectures are in active development .
Buildroot is perhaps the simplest of the build framework projects .
Buildroot provides a menu - driven configuration similar to that used by the Linux kernel , and an automated build based around makefiles .
It can be used to build anything from a cross-compilation toolchain right up to a complete root filesystem for the device .
It also provides a simple mechanism for developers to patch software packages as they are built .
Since its initial release in 2005 , Buildroot has achieved considerable popularity in a range of applications , which can include anything from chip manufacturer board support packages to embedded firmware for rugged displays .
OpenEmbedded is a more complex system which utilizes a custom build tool , Bitbake , to provide information on how to build individual packages .
Bitbake is derived from Gentoo 's portage system , and many of the concepts utilized in Bitbake will be familiar to Gentoo users .
OpenEmbedded provides Bitbake build recipes for many packages , from cross-compilation tools to the Qt framework and X .
It is used as the build tool for a number of Linux distributions , including Ångström and Openmoko , and is also used by Gumstix to create firmware for their devices .
In contrast , Scratchbox takes a different approach from both OpenEmbedded and Buildroot .
Rather than providing build instructions for the cross-compilation of packages , Scratchbox provides a chrooted environment in which the default build tools produce cross-compiled code .
In this environment , packages may be built as though they were being built natively , thereby avoiding much of the hassle of configuring packages for cross-compilation .
In addition to providing a compilation environment , Scratchbox also integrates Qemu to provide an emulated platform for running cross-compiled code .
This could be a useful feature early in the development of a new embedded device when the actual hardware is not yet available .
Scratchbox has been used by the Maemo project , which is used in Nokia 's Internet Tablet products — and the N900 phone .
Finally , Firmware Linux marries the simplicity of Buildroot to the native compilation approach of Scratchbox .
Starting life in 2001 as a means of automating a Linux From Scratch build , Firmware Linux has developed into a general set of scripts for the creation of a native development environment for the target hardware .
Similar to Scratchbox , Firmware Linux supports the use of Qemu as an emulation environment for running target binaries and compiling code .
Miniature desktop distributions
Automated build environments allow developers to build complete embedded systems from source .
At the same time , a number of projects are developing distributions which approach embedded software from the opposite direction , by slimming down general - purpose distributions to fit the embedded space .
Emdebian aims to make Debian suitable for embedded devices .
So far , this effort has taken two complementary paths .
Firstly , Emdebian Crush provides a heavily modified set of packages based around a Busybox root filesystem to provide the smallest possible installation of Debian .
At the time of this writing , Crush supports ARM platforms only .
Parallel to working on Crush , the Emdebian team has been developing Emdebian Grip , a low - fat install which tracks the development of the forthcoming stable release of Debian .
Emdebian Grip has been used in Toby Churchill 's SL40 Lightwriter , and some of Digi's ARM - based embedded modules , as well as various silicon provider board support packages .
Similar to Emdebian , Gentoo Embedded ( aka Embedded Gentoo ) works to make the Gentoo distribution more suitable for embedded devices .
This brings Gentoo 's portage package management tool to bear on the embedded space , and also provides a handbook which guides users through the process of putting together a Gentoo Embedded system ; a process which will be generally familiar to users of the Gentoo handbook for desktop and server systems .
Readers may be familiar with Gentoo Embedded through its use in Google 's Chromium OS project , where it has been employed as a cross-compilation tool to build AMD64 binaries on an x86 host .
Commercial offerings
Alongside freely available open source embedded Linux tools and distributions , there are a number of commercial embedded Linux distributions available .
Just as with desktop Linux , a commercial agreement with a vendor may offer various incentives to reassure pointy - haired bosses : guaranteed integration support , a quicker time - to - market , enhanced development tools , etc. MontaVista Linux is one of the most prominent offerings in this space , however a number of other commercial embedded distributions exist including Wind River Linux and BlueCat Linux .
Complete software stacks
Recent initiatives have seen the development of complete , application - specific software stacks for embedded platforms .
Examples include Google 's Android and Nokia 's Maemo project , which are geared toward mobile phones and internet tablets ; or one of the many network router firmware projects ( e.g. FreeWRT , Tomato , or OpenWrt ) .
These projects can offer a complete solution for certain developments , although it is more likely that they are employed as a foundation to build upon .
For example , Android is in use in the Archos 5 internet tablet and Barnes and Noble 's " nook " e-book reader , and Maemo has been merged with Intel 's Moblin to form MeeGo .
Many paths to enlightenment
Although the nature of embedded devices makes a general - purpose Linux distribution difficult to develop there are nonetheless a range of projects which support embedded Linux development at every level .
The Cross Linux From Scratch project provides a simple guide to hand - crafting a system , the various build frameworks and slimline versions of desktop distributions provide a sliding scale of automation for the creation of a distribution , and the complete stacks provided by the likes of Android and MeeGo provide an integrated foundation for further development .
Of the range of embedded Linux tools , the projects generating the most press are the likes of Android and MeeGo .
This is partially due to the large corporate sponsors behind these projects , but it may also be because they are starting to change the face of embedded Linux by commoditizing the software stack for subsets of embedded devices .
In so doing , Android and MeeGo may suggest a possible future development path for embedded Linux as a whole : for many applications , an off - the - shelf stack could deliver an enticingly short time - to - market along with the added incentive of high community involvement in the wider project .
Whether or not this model can support enough diversity to make it appropriate across the embedded ecosystem is not clear , but the potential benefits to manufacturers and end users may make it an attractive way to deliver Linux in a range of other embedded markets .

new release of efene .
efene is a programming language that runs on the erlang virtual machine .
the idea is to provide an alternative syntax to erlang that is most suitable for people coming from languages like Java , C , C++ , C# , Javascript and alternatively python and ruby using ifene ( indented efene ) .
the language is almost 100 % compatible with erlang ( and will be ) , the compiler allows to translate an efene source file into a readable erlang one or compile it directly to bytecode .
It also adds some syntactic sugar in some places to make some tasks easier .
changes
complete rewrite of the compiler , less code and more clear , less transformations to get the AST
removed the dependency on the go compiler , now the frontend logic is split between fn.erl and a small shell script .
That means : only erlang required to build and use efene .
added a new language called ifene ( indented efene ) , it has the same syntax than efene but the blocks are indented with spaces instead of curly brackets .
The compiler will compile depending on the extension ( .ifn for ifene .fn for efene ) and transform ifene to efene internally before compiling .
Tabs are not allowed for indentation in ifene , this is to avoid mixing spaces and tabs .
support for newlines before and after curly brackets and after commas .
for example :
before this was the only way
if A {
BodyA
} else if B {
BodyB
} else {
BodyElse
}
now this two forms are also valid
if A {
BodyA
}
else if B {
BodyB
}
else {
BodyElse
}
# or
if A
{
BodyA
}
else if B
{
BodyB
}
else
{
BodyElse
}
now commas are required in lists , tuples and function arguments
the try block is now try / catch / after to make it equal to erlang
the receive block is now receive / else receive / after
operator precedence made the same as erlang
tests included to check that efene generates the same ast as erlang , tests cover almost all the language
now records can be declared in efene
bit syntax made the same as erlang
for a complete reference see the Language Reference
Participate
a mailing list is available at librelist just send a mail to efene@librelist.com to subscribe .
as first mail you may send a hello world program in efene and present yourself by saying your name , where you are , how did you heard about efene and anything else you would like to say .

After the dead horses
We ’ve had a fair bit of fun here lately , pointing out the silliness of those who are supposed to be the intellectual leaders of the right , in its libertarian , neoconservative and Republican tribalist versions .
But , as quite a few commenters have pointed out ( one using the same , maybe Oz- specific , phrase that occurred to me ) the exercise does seem to savor a bit of flogging dead horses .
It seems to me necessary to go beyond this , which was one reason for my post on hope the other day .
To make progress , we need to reassess where we stand and then think about where to go next .
This is bound to be something of a confused and confusing process .
Over the fold , I ’ve made some ( quite a few ) observations , making for a very long post , which is mainly meant to open things up for discussion .
First , considered in intellectual terms , there is very little remaining on the political right ( particularly in the US , but this point applies to most of the English - speaking countries , and to a large extent elsewhere ) that is worth engaging with in terms other than the derision employed here .
It ’s not that , as rightwing pundits go , people like Douthat , Goldberg , Krauthammer and McArdle are soft targets .
Compared to , say , Powerline or the cast of Fox News , they are paragons of reasoned and reasonable discourse .
The same goes for the thinktanks and quasi-academic institutions that are supposed to provide some kind of rigorous basis for thinking about policy .
AEI , Heritage , Heartland and the rest offer little more than partisan hackery .
Increasingly , the same is true of Republican - aligned academics .
There is simply no room for independent thought .
Overall , as I said on my blog a while back , the scene is one of complete ideological incoherence .
Market liberalism has run out of steam , libertarianism has failed to produce a coherent response to the Iraq war or the Bush assault on civil liberties ( to be fair , Obama has also failed here ) , and the various other elements that have emerged or re-emerged as forces on the right – Christianism , aggressive nationalism , anti-feminism and so on – amount to little more than a tribalist set of hatreds of various others .
The unifying feature of the right in the 21st century is not so much ideology as an embrace of ignorance , represented most obviously by the leading figures on the right in the US , Rush Limbaugh and Sarah Palin .
Rather than reflecting an even partially coherent world view and political program , rightwing politics now consists of the restatement of talking points in favor of a set of policy positions that represent affirmations of tribal identity , rather than elements of a coherent program .
The best way to understand this can be summed in the term ‘ agnotology ’ ( h/t commenter Fran Barlow ) , coined by Robert Proctor to describe study of the manufacture of ignorance .
Proctor was referring primarily to the efforts of the tobacco lobby to cast doubt on research demonstrating the link between smoking and cancer .
But the veterans of that campaign have moved on to a whole range of new issues , from climate change to health policy , and their techniques have been so widely imitated that the entire political right now looks like Big Tobacco writ even bigger .
Second , though , even if intellectual engagement is impossible , we ca n’t ignore the fact that the right remains politically powerful , and is currently resurgent in both the US and ( in a rather different form ) in Europe .
Furthermore , the established conventions of political discussion in the US take it for granted that there is in fact a debate going on in which the contributions of the two sides ( as defined by the two major political parties ) are more or less equally worthy of attention .
It is necessary to criticise this convention and hammer home the point that the right has become totally disconnected from reality and rational argument .
The same point needs to be made to the ( shrinking , but still significant ) group of intellectuals of a conservative or libertarian disposition .
Regardless of the abstract merits of ideas there is no way to remain associated with the political right and maintain any kind of intellectual integrity .
The list of issues on which no dissent from the party - line talking points is permissible is so long ( a string of inconsistent justifications for the Iraq war , voodoo economics particularly on anything related to budget deficits , anti-science views on just about everything ) that even maintaining a discreet silence amounts to intellectual dishonesty .
The right is becoming aware of these things , as the debate launched by Julian Sanchez recently showed .
But it ’s certainly important to hammer the point home .
Third , important though it is to kill off intellectual zombies , that can only be the beginning of a response to the failure of the right .
It ’s not as if we have a left - progressive program and movement ready and waiting to fill the vacuum .
The long struggle of left and centre - left parties to maintain their relevance in the face of the resurgent market liberalism of the late 20th century has eroded any belief in the possibility of a fundamental transformation of capitalism , to the point where such ideas no longer receive even lip - service , let alone serious and sustained attention .
Instead , these parties have found themselves lumbered with the task of managing the mixture of social democratic and market institutions that emerged from the conflicts of the 20th century , tweaking them sometimes with market - oriented reforms and sometimes with marginal new interventions .
Practitioners of this kind of managerialist quasi - social democracy have found themselves unable to handle the challenge posed by the irrationalist right , whether in the form of Tea Parties and militias in the US , or slick advocates of xenophobia like Pim Fortuyn in Europe .
Their whole approach to politics assumes that the other side shares a broadly consistent view of reality .
But in John Cole ’s acid metaphor , dealing with the agnotological right is like going on a dinner date where you suggest Italian and your date prefers a meal of tire rims and anthrax .
While competent management commands widespread approval it does not mobilise much enthusiasm .
Again , this is one of the reasons I think we need to offer hope , in the form of goals that can excite enthusiastic commitment to a progressive alternative .
Fourth , while I do n’t see much , if any , benefit in engaging with actually existing conservatism , that does n’t mean that we should ignore conservative , and libertarian , ideas .
You do n’t have to be an unqualified admirer of writers like Burke , Popper or Hayek to concede that they made valid criticisms of the progressive ideas of their day , and to seek a better way forward .
Some examples of the kind of thing I have in mind
* Popper ’s critique of historicism .
After thirty years in which teleological claims of inevitable triumph have been the stock in trade of Fukuyama and his epigones , the left should surely have been cured of such ideas , but their centrality is evident in the very use of terms like “ progressive ” .
It ’s important to recognise that beneficial change is not an automatic outcome of “ progress ”
* Burke and his successors on the need for beneficial reform to be “ organic ” , in the sense that it reflects the actual historical evolution of particular societies , rather than being based on universal truths that are applicable in all times and places
* Hayek on the impossibility of comprehensive planning .
No planner can possess all relevant information or account for all possible contingencies .
We need institutions that respond to local information and that are robust enough to cope with unconsidered possibilities .
In some circumstances , but certainly not all , markets fit the bill .
Fifth , equally , we need to reconsider Marxian and other left socialist critiques of social democracy .
The central burden of most such critiques is that the welfare - state and similar interventions offer no possibility of transforming society or substantially mitigating the inequality of wealth and power inherent in capitalism .
The last time this kind of debate had any relevance beyond setting out the correct viewpoint from which to deplore the advances of the right was back around the 1970s .
At that time , there was a serious belief in the possibility of a revolutionary alternative in relation to which social democratic reforms were at best a distraction , at worst a deliberate obstacle .
This belief ( I assume ) has now completely dissipated .
So , the standard Marxian critique of the 1970s now amounts to defeatism : social democracy can’t change capitalism and neither can anything else .
But radical movements can make space for lots of of different ideas , particularly in relation to organisation and mobilisation , and local ‘ bottom - up ’ policy initiatives .
At least some of the time currently spent on combating the right ought to be devoted to more engagement with these ideas .
Some similar points can be made in relation to the green movement , though I think there has been much more progress in aligning greens and social democrats , both intellectually and as political movements .
Finally , as I ’ve said before , the left has to stand for something more than keeping the existing order afloat with incremental improvements .
We need to offer the hope of a better world as an alternative to the angry tribalism that threatens to engulf us .
That ’s more than enough from me , and I ’m keen for better ideas and analyses than what I ’ve offered .
So , comments please .
B. McCONNELL & BOEHNER " BANKING " on ( literally ) that TEABAGGERS R 2 IGNORANT & LAZY 2 READ :
McConnell & Boehner spread lies through the media banking on ( no pun intended ) & expecting Teabaggers 2B2 lazy & ignorant to read the actual Bill .
Are they correct , are the Teabaggers 2 ignorant & laze 2 read the Bill ?
Will Teabaggers believe the lies of McConnell & Boehner ?
4/12/2010 Easter Break Ends - McConnell & Boehner begin their LIES :
4/12 : Senate Floor - McConnell said the flaws in the Bill were , " flaws that would allow taxpayer dollars to bailout Wall Street banks . "
** McConnell is banking on ( literally ) and expecting teabaggers 2B2 ignorant & lazy to read the Bill - which , if read , does NOT have taxpayers bailing out any bank or any financial institution on Wall Street .
4/13 : Senate Floor - McConnell said , " This bill not only allows for taxpayer - funded bailouts of Wall Street banks ; it institutionalizes them . "
** McConnell again is banking on ( literally ) & expecting Teabaggers 2B2 lazy & ignorant to read the Bill .
4/14 : From The Hill , " In release to reporters by Boehner 's office , the Ohio Republican 's staff claims the bill " sets up a fund for permanent bailouts that guarantees taxpayers are going to have to keep subsidizing irresponsible behavior on Wall Street , and lets the federal government pick winners and losers in the private sector . "
** Boehner is banking on ( literally ) & expecting Teabaggers 2B2 lazy & ignorant to read the Bill .
4/16 : McConnell letter to Harry Reid wrote , " As currently constructed , this bill allows for endless taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street . "
** McConnell is banking on ( literally ) & expecting Teabaggers 2B2 lazy & ignorant to read the Bill .
C. HIDDEN MESSAGE to CNN the MEDIA did NOT pick up on :
McConnell claimed to CNN he wants the government to deny banks the right to set aside their own money for themselves .
The media missed & did NOT pick up on McConnell 's , very important message there .
Read that one more time : McConnell wants the GOVERNMENT to DENY BANKS THE RIGHT TO SET ASIDE THEIR OWN MONEY TO USE FOR THEMSELVES ....
2/18 : On CNN :
CROWLEY : " But that bailout is funded by the banks themselves , is it not ?
It is not a taxpayer bailout ? "
McCONNELL : " I mean , regardless of how the money is produced , it is a bailout fund that sort of guarantees in perpetuity that we will be intervening once again to bail out these big firms . "
There ya have it - McConnell wants the GOVERNMENT to DICTATE to banks that they may NOT use their own money in ways they want to use their money - hmmm ..... and the Teabaggers sit in silence ....
TO : Teabaggers - McConnell wants the GOVERNMENT to DENY BANKS HOW THEY CAN SPEND THEIR OWN MONEY ... and YOU ALL SAY NOTHING !!!!
Where is YOUR outrage , where are your protest signs condemning the GOP wanting the government to deny banks freedoms to spend THEIR money how they want ?
Also , where is the media when you need them ?
Why does NO ONE in the media ask McConnell :
a) Mitch , why do YOU want government to tell banks how they can and cannot use THEIR MONEY ?
and
b ) McConnell SINCE : you want the government to deny banks the right to set aside their own money for themselves - THEN : why not write an Amendment and put it in the Bill as opposed to using ... yet another .... filibuster ?
( psst ... so far the GOP have filibustered 139 times since they became the minority - more than ANY Congress in history . )
For the record , before any posts that I do n't know the definition of teabagger :
Oxford American Dictionary Definition -
" Teabagger " - " A person , who protests President Obama ’s tax policies and stimulus package , "
Columbus Syndrome :
This form of denial afflicts both men and women , though is most pronounced in men between the ages of 16 - 25 .
A defense mechanism , Columbus Syndrome manifests when you completely ignore the fact that your girlfriend / boyfriend has already been " discovered " by numerous others before you .
The most common symptom is becoming agitated to learn the number of your sexual partner ’s previous sexual partners , as though it had been implied they were virginal .
A Henry VIII : Ol ’
Henry is of course famous for having many many wives , whom he routinely disposed of in a dubious manner : " One died , one survived , two divorced , two beheaded . "
Ladies , steer clear - a Henry VIII is a guy who only has miserable break - ups .
A sure red flag is if a guy is n’t on friendly speaking terms with any of his ex's .
The Churchill Illusion : Some of the more badass tales recounting Winston Churchill ’s legendary badassitude were his leisurely cigar - smoking strolls through London during German bombing warnings in WWII .
Awesome ?
Yes .
But what people often overlook with these stories is the fact that Churchill was a functioning alcoholic , his constant shitfacing adding to his bravado .
The Churchill Illusion is when someone whom you hooked up with while they were drunk ( and fun ) turns out to be significantly less excellent when you meet them again , sober .
A Teddy : President Teddy Roosevelt popularized the maxim “ speak softly and carry a big stick . ”
A mantra describing Roosevelt ’s corollary to the Monroe Doctrine , the expression refers to the idea of negotiating peacefully while simultaneously threatening with military might .
Ladies , a Teddy is a guy with a big dick who knows that you know he has a big dick , and thus feels he can afford to put forth little wooing , relying on the threat of his “ big stick . ”
The Russian Front :
Why anyone would want to invade Russia is beyond me , but the frozen colossus has proven to be an irresistible and ultimately disastrous temptation for generations of megalomaniacs , from Napoleon to Hitler .
Guys , a Russian Front is a group of girls at the club / bar who keep shooting down wave after wave of hopeful suitors .
Wisdom dictates that you and your idiot friends should just sit tight and sip your beers .
Russia can only be toppled from within .
A Rasputin : Speaking of Russia and hopeless causes – Rasputin , while known for his creepy womanizing ways , is probably best remembered for being extremely hard to kill ; according to legend : poisoned , shot , stabbed , and drowned .
A Rasputin is a relationship that just wo n’t seem to die .
Be it full on romantic or merely booty calls , you know it needs to end and have tried to cut the cord numerous times … but it simply wo n’t stay dead .
One of you sends a drunken text , next thing you know , you ’re having sex .
Want to know what life will look like on other planets ?
Look no farther than these five creatures , who are already prepared for life on Saturn 's moon Titan - or in the hard vacuum of deep space .

Unlike humans , with our pesky need for things like oxygen and sugar , some creatures are more flexible in the habitats where they feel comfortable .
Here are five lifeforms who are prepared to live on other planets right now .
Worms who live on methane ice
The bizarre creature you see above is a worm who lives on a slab of methane ice pushing up from the seafloor near the coast of Mexico .
According to Penn State , whose researchers helped discover this new form of life :
The discovery of dense colonies of these one - to - two - inch - long , flat , pinkish worms burrowing into a mushroom - shaped mound of methane seeping up from the sea floor raises speculation that the worms may be a new species with a pervasive and as yet unknown influence on these energy - rich gas deposits . . .
" It 's very cool that while we 're busy speculating about life on other planets we continue to discover new forms of life in the most unlikely habitats on Earth , " commented Erin McMullin , a Penn State graduate student and a member of the research expedition that discovered the methane - ice worms .
Methane ice , a gas hydrate , forms naturally at the high pressure and low temperature of the deep sea , but is usually buried deep in marine sediment .
The Gulf of Mexico is one of the few places where hydrate can be found exposed on the ocean bottom .
Occasionally this seeping , solid methane bursts through in mounds , often six to eight feet across .

Here 's an amazing , weird video of life around a methane seep off the coast of New Zealand .
Here the creatures are n't living on methane ice , just methane gas mixed with water .
What does this tell us about life on other planets ?
On Saturn 's moon Titan , there are seas of methane gently lapping at the gorgeous beaches , lit by Saturn 's glowing bands .
If the proposed mission to sail Titan 's seas ever gets underway , it 's possible we may find creatures very similar to the ice worms living there .

Sea creatures who can live in hard vacuum
Tardigrades , also known as water bears , look like cute little sea caterpillars with eight legs .
But these half - millimeter - long , transparent little guys are among the hardiest creatures on Earth .
Native to icy regions , the tardigrade has one superpower :
It can go into a suspended animation state called tun , during which it completely dries out and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations .
It can even withstand the vacuum of space , as researchers discovered when some tardigrades were sent on a space mission in 2008 .

What does that tell us about life on other planets ?
Now that the tardigrade genome is being sequenced and analyzed , we may learn how these creatures finesse suspended animation .
And perhaps we can modify our own genomes to do the same thing for long space journeys .
Plus the fact that they can exist in vacuum means that other organisms might have a tun - like state , drifting through space in search of new worlds to thrive on .

Giant sulfur - eaters of the deep
They live at the edges of molten - hot volcanic vents deep beneath the ocean , and they feed on sulfides delivered to them by local bacteria .
These giant tube worms , which can reach 7 feet in length , live a mile below the ocean surface under extreme pressure .
Their tips are bright red because they 're filled with blood - these worms are seriously packed with blood vessels .
And they prefer live at the edge of " black smokers , " volcanic vents where temperatures can be extremely hot .
What does this tell us about life on other planets ?
The interesting thing about giant tube worms is n't that they can withstand extreme heat , but that they can gain nourishment in an environment with chemistry radically different from our atmosphere .
They 're basically eating sulfides , which are abundant on planets like Venus , where it occasionally snows iron sulfide .
Could tube worms thrive on Venus , with its heat and high pressures and sulfide weather ?

The iron-eating microbes of blood falls
In Antarctica , a pool of seawater trapped beneath the ice is packed with microbes that have evolved to live without light or oxygen .
Advertisement
According to Nature :
The liquid , which comes from a pool of seawater that has been trapped inside the glacier for at least 1.5 million years , is alive with around 30 different types of bacteria with some unique chemical moves .
The microbes have cycled through a million generations since being cut off , and live by slowly nibbling away at organic material trapped with them - likely to be " a mishmash of old ' skeletons ' " , according to Mikucki .
To get energy from organic matter , living things break molecules ' high - energy bonds .
This releases high - energy electrons , which are passed down a chain of molecules , releasing manageable chunks of energy at each step .
In humans and many other large organisms , oxygen is the final acceptor in this electron transport chain .
But in the subglacial pool studied by Mikucki and her team , as well as in other extreme environments , there is no free oxygen to use for this purpose .
Many microbes use sulphate as their final electron acceptor , producing hydrogen sulphide in the process .
But Mikucki and her co-workers found no evidence that this was happening in the mysterious Antarctic pool .
When the team looked at sulphate in their samples , however , they found evidence that the microbes had put the sulphate through chemical reactions .
The researchers believe that the microbes are using sulphate as a catalyst in a complex chain of reactions in which the final electron acceptor is iron .
" We think they are using it to get at the iron oxides , " says Mikucki .
Using iron as a final electron acceptor is not unprecedented .
But using sulphate to do it is .
In fact , many biogeochemists thought it unlikely that any organism could use iron in this way in the presence of a lot of sulphate , because iron and sulphate would just react together to make pyrite .
And yet these Antarctic microbes are using iron as the final step in their electron transport chain not only in the presence of a lot of sulphate , but with its assistance .
" This is how an ecosystem has sustained itself despite being covered by lots of ice in cold and darkness , " says Mikucki .
" Life finds a way . "

What does this tell us about life on other planets ?
Like the tube worms , these microbes are able to gain energy and thrive on chemical compounds totally alien to typical Earth creatures .
A creature that eats iron oxides , instead of photosynthesizing light or chomping on organic compounds like we do ?
It could possibly thrive in the salty , iron - rich seas beneath the thick layer of ice that covers Jupiter 's moon Europa .

The bacteria who survive lethal radiation doses
D. radiodurans is a bacteria that can endure a thousand times more radiation than a person can , largely because of its amazing DNA repair system .
People die of radiation sickness because tiny radioactive particles literally rip our DNA apart , which means ( among other things ) that our cells can no longer reproduce and basic body regulation systems are halted .
But this bacteria is brilliant at reassembling shattered DNA .
Science Ray explains :
" The organism can put its genome back together with absolute fidelity , " says Claire M. Fraser , of The Institute for Genome Research ( TIGR ) in Rockville , Maryland .
This characteristic is what makes D. radiodurans so great , because even when radiation shatters DNA , it can be repaired by the bacterium proteins .
Additionally , the microbe has between four and ten copies of its DNA , rather than the usual single copy .
The additional genomes may allow the bacterium to recover at least one complete copy of its genome after exposure to radiation .

What does this tell us about life on other planets ?
One of the main problems with building a human outpost on the Moon or Mars is that we would be exposed to dramatically more radiation than we are on Earth ( a lot of radiation from space bounces off our atmosphere and magnetosphere ) .
What these microbes prove is that there 's a way to harden DNA against radiation damage .
So creatures on a planet with thinner atmosphere and weak magnetospheres could survive - or maybe , if we reengineered our DNA to be more like D. radiodurans , we could survive too .

There 's bad and good news from the ozone front .
The bad news first : NASA scientists say that the amount of ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation reaching the Earth 's surface has increased dramatically over the past 30 years .
The reason for the increase is a continuing decrease in the protective stratospheric ozone layer , a colorless gas located about 10 to 20 miles above the Earth .
The ozone absorbs much of the ultraviolet energy from the sun that could cause skin cancer and harm living things , including plants , if it reaches the ground or oceans .
The good news :
The amount of the UV increase seems to have stabilized since the mid-1990s .
This finding backs up other research that shows UV levels are stabilizing after countries began signing an international treaty in 1987 that limited the emissions of ozone - depleting gases such as chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) .
In 1987 , the Montreal Protocol treaty and amendments since then have greatly reduced the amounts of ozone - destroying substances ( not only CFCs ) being released into the air .
" Overall , we 're still not where we'd like to be with ozone , but we 're on the right track , " said NASA scientist Jay Herman .
" We do still see an increase in UV on a 30 - year timescale , but it 's moderate , it could have been worse , and it appears to have leveled off . "
Geographically , most of the UV increase has occurred in the mid-and - high latitudes , with little or no increase observed in tropical regions .
The results were published last month in the Journal of Geophysical Research .

The SEC 's sudden attack on Goldman Sachs does n't change the fact that the people whose job it is to keep an eye on Wall Street have been AWOL for too long .
That 's why we need Eliot Spitzer back ASAP !
Editor 's note :
This is a new weekly column by Gary Weiss , an award - winning Wall Street muckraker who has written for BusinessWeek and Portfolio magazines and authored two books , " Born to Steal " and " Wall Street Versus America . "
Look for Gary Weiss every Monday on TheStreet .
Until Friday , it seemed like the
Securities and Exchange Commission
, the FBI , and / or the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York , Preet Bharara , have all been AWOL .
Then suddenly the
SEC
charges
Goldman Sachs
( GS ) - Get Report
with conspiring with a short - seller to design a particularly loathsome bit of toxic - waste derivative , allegedly skinning investors alive in early 2008 .
But that does n't change the fact that the people whose job it is to catch such things have appeared asleep at the wheel for far too long .
Before the Goldman charges , the media had been oozing with disgusting revelations about Lehman Brothers systematically hiding assets .
Now , let 's pause for a moment to consider where these revelations have originated .
It 's a short list : the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy trustee and media articles following up on the trustee 's staggering findings .
The SEC seems to be playing catch - up .
Back in 2008 , when former Lehman CEO
Dick Fuld
appeared on Capitol Hill not to beg for forgiveness , as would have been appropriate , but to blame short sellers and Goldman , it was reasonable to expect that his scalp would have been dangling from a prosecutor 's belt by now .
Instead , he 's faded away like one of Douglas MacArthur 's old soldiers -- while we have to read in the papers about how Lehman 's asset - hiding repo scheme had been going on since 2001 , and had been " materially misleading . "
Now , ask yourself this question : if Eliot Spitzer were somewhere in the vicinity -- and by that , I do n't mean guest - hosting at
MSNBC
-- do you really think that we'd be seeing our watchdogs in such a prolonged siesta ?
Would it have taken Spitzer two years to pounce on Goldman -- and would Fuld have been let off the hook completely ?
Hell no !
When he was attorney general , Spitzer used to hound Wall Streeters on far less provocation , such as when he went after Dick Grasso for cashing $ 140 million pay checks .
Today that seems about as serious as leaving a Porsche running unattended outside wherever Grasso 's mansion is located nowadays .
As the get - Grasso campaign demonstrated , Spitzer definitely pushed the envelope at times .
He could be as vindictive as Bobby Kennedy when he was bearing down on Jimmy Hoffa .
In other words , he 's precisely the kind of mad dog you want to face off against creeps like Fuld and the hyper - compensated ex-SEC officials and lapsed prosecutors now providing legal defense for Wall Street bankers .
And Spitzer is a smart cookie who was going after lending industry abuses as far back as 2003 .
Instead of watching Spitzer doing what Spitzer does best , we have him on the sidelines amid an orgy of publicity about Spitzer 's orgies .
Hey , I 'm not blaming the media for focusing on that -- it 's good copy , and Spitzer has only himself to blame for his career suicide .
But in the course of airing Spitzer 's dirty laundry again ( a disgusting image , I admit ) , we 're forgetting the kind of good this guy could do for society .
Back in the day , Spitzer slashed and burned across Wall Street , turning the screws on financial executives like Torquemada and generally making a pest of himself .
It 's easy to forget that he targeted
AIG
( AIG ) - Get Report
long before it was fashionable , engaging in a jihad against former CEO Hank Greenberg .
He ripped into
Marsh & McLennan
( MMC ) - Get Report
for bid rigging , and Wall Street analysts still break out into a cold sweat when they recall the tawdry emails he unearthed from
Merrill Lynch
analysts .
Let 's not forget that it was his browbeating , arm - twisting and hair - pulling that led to the $ 1.4 billion settlement between regulators and ten Wall Street firms :
Bear , Stearns
,
Credit Suisse First Boston
( CS ) - Get Report
,
Goldman Sachs
,
Lehman Brothers
,
JPMorgan Chase
( JPM ) - Get Report
,
Merrill Lynch
,
Morgan Stanley
( MS ) - Get Report
,
Citigroup
( C ) - Get Report
,
UBS Warburg
( UBS ) - Get Report
and
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
( USB ) - Get Report
.
That could have been a sample of things to come , if Spitzer had n't been so horny and so arrogant .
Lately , Spitzer has been fighting to reclaim his reputation with a typically non-self - effacing
comeback campaign
. I say good for him .
Go Eliot !
I have no idea what he has in mind , but to me it 's pretty obvious where this guy belongs .
He has got to be someplace , anyplace , where he can scare the daylights out of Wall Street .
Special prosecutor , perhaps .
Or he could take over for Preet Bharara .
Sorry .
Bharara is terrific at prosecuting drug gangs in the Bronx , but he has been too cautious , too slow in pursuing major Wall Street firms .
Watching him prosecuting perpetrators of the Bernie Madoff ponzi scheme , the biggest financial fraud in history , is like watching an ant crawl across the lawn .
So far he has been a non-factor in the Lehman and Goldman cases , and has confined himself to busting peripheral characters , such as mortgage scam artists and insider traders .
He has yet to climb up the food chain to major firms , as I 'm sure Spitzer would do if given half a chance .
Now , I 'll admit that a case can be made that Spitzer might have crossed the line , legally speaking , in his hooker addiction .
However , I do n't see that as disqualifying him from the urgent need to deploy the man , like Telly Savales in The Dirty Dozen , in the fight against Wall Street crime .
Yeah , using Spitzer would be fighting dirty I know , but the times demand it .
As far back as Wyatt Earp , one can find law enforcement officers who were not princes , and sometimes would even patronize brothels .
Some of the leading Wall Street cops have not been choirboys .
Rudy Giuliani had his flaws , to say the least .
Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. , the aggressive first SEC chairman , was certainly no saint .
More recently we 've seen a kind of miniature Dirty Dozen emerge in the form of two convicted scamsters -- Sam Antar of the Crazy Eddie stock scam and Barry Minkow , jailed for the ZZZ Best fraud -- racking up impressive records as stock market watchdogs .
You can certainly learn considerably more by reading
Sam Antar's
analysis of the accounting at one of his favorite targets ,
Overstock.com
( OSTK ) - Get Report
, than you can from the sycophantic media coverage .
By the way , Spitzer was a saint compared with Wyatt Earp , and I hear they have n't robbed a stagecoach outside Tombstone in quite a while .
So let 's stop being so prissy about Eliot Spitzer .
Let 's harness all that testosterone to benefit society .

Queensland Opposition Senator Sue Boyce ( pictured ) has written to Communications Minister Stephen Conroy and Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen Smith asking for more information on the US government ’s inquiry about the Government ’s internet filtering project .
Boyce wrote the two page letter to the ministers yesterday ( and sent a copy to the press ) asking for clarification of US State Department spokesman Noel Clay ’s statement that the US Government had “ raised concerns on the matter ” and a statement by Conroy ’s office that the US State Department had “ asked for , and received , background information ” .
The letters to Conroy and Smith are almost identical in content .
In her letter , Boyce wrote : “ I am sure that Mr Clay would have chosen his words carefully and I find it difficult to reconcile a statement that the US Government had “ raised concerns ” with your assertion that the US Government had only asked for background information . ”
“ I would be grateful if you could explain how the two statements can be reconciled .
Were concerns raised by the US Government or did it simply request background information ? ”
The inquiry comes three weeks after Clay ’s comment that the US had raised concerns , as reported on News Ltd blog The Punch .
When Conroy was approached on the subject that same day , he said : “ I have n’t had any direct contact with with the US State Department ” and “ They are maybe speaking with the Department of Foreign Affairs …
It could be that it just has n’t been passed through . ”
Three days after , Conroy ’s office issued the statement that the US state department had asked for background information .
Boyce highlighted US Ambassador Jeff Bleich ’s appearance on the ABC ’s Q&A program last week when he said the US were searching for “ the right balance between law enforcement and respecting that general principle … so we have been working with Australia on this issue , we ’ve had healthy discussions on it . ”
Boyce said that it ’s hard to make sense of Bleich ’s statement of “ healthy discussion ” when Conroy said that the US had only asked for background information .
“ Certainly I hope that your reply will not persist with the fiction that the US Government has simply asked for “ background information ” and shows the same honesty and frankness on this important issue so ably demonstrated by the US Ambassador , ” the Liberal Senator added .
She went on to to berate Conroy and Smith about what she said was their inability to be transparent about Australia and the US Government ’s discussions on the filter , calling their claimed refusal to be open “ deplorable ” .
The letter raised Bleich ’s statement that the filter was inessential and that US had been able to capture child pornographers and other deviants without the use of a filter .
“ I would appreciate your advice about how that has been managed in the USA and why Australia cannot employ a similar strategy , ” said Boyce .

By necessity , the Japanese have an intuition for space - saving design that shines in their products and architecture .
But this concept might be one of the cleverest we ’ve ever seen .
Created by Shin Yamashita , a student at the
Kyoto Institute of Technology , Land Peel is a foam floor covering which also has panels that flip up and fold , to become any sort of furniture you might need :
From a table , to a backrest , to a drink tray , to a footrest , to a pillow :
In addition , there ’s a plug for a custom - fitted lamp , which also serves as a table leg , when extended :
Maybe this would only catch on in Japan , where Tatami mats and floor - sitting are a cultural norm .
But consider :
The carpet in front of the TV might as well be a piece of furniture , given the way most people actually live .
Add a few different skins for different interiors ( think : Flor modular carpet tiles ) , and this could find a huge market .
I recently got a new receptionist in my practice .
She is by all accounts a very attactive woman .
She has long blonde hair , large baby blue eyes and very long legs .
Now this is not out of the ordinary in and of itself , but for the fact that this receptionist has been paying .... well how can I put it .... " special " attention to me .
In fact , you could say that she has been overtly flirting .
I typically ignore this as when I am in the clinic , as my focus is purely on my patients .
But clearly the other girls in the clinic have not .
It is obvious as a result that someone has called my wife , Ms B , and alerted her to the new receptionist 's behaviour .
During our night out for our anniversary recently , Ms B asked me during dinner : I had yet to catch on to her concern , and so simply made a joke that blondes are more beautiful .
Well , was n't this a mistake !
Ms B then started giving me the third degree .
The irony is that I do not particularly like blonde women .
Dark hair is my thing .
In any case , all her concerns were baseless , but how do you comfort a jealous women ?
Anyway , I tried my best , and after I made it clear that this was all in her mind , she started to calm down , but then she began insiting that I sack the receptionist .
I said " " , not unless she performs poorly in her work .
That night when we got home , Ms B went out of her way to make herself available to me .
She even modelled the sexy lingerie I bought her , and she let me take pictures of her in lingerie .
It ended up being a nice evening , but I have no doubt that we will revisit the issue of the receptionist again soon .

Are they containing the spill , or containing the news ?
Meanwhile , the GOP — for the second time — moved to make sure that we taxpayers pay for the oil spill , rather than BP .
I ’ve written a bit lately about what I see as a systematic trend toward “ epistemic closure ” in the modern conservative movement .
As commenters have been quick to point out , of course , groupthink and confirmation bias are cognitive failings that we ’re all susceptible to as human beings , and scarcely the exclusive province of the right .
I try to acknowledge as much , and I ’m often tempted to pluck some instances from the left just to show how very fair - minded and above the fray I am .
( For instance , I find myself increasingly sympathetic to complaints about the coverage of the Tea Parties : Obviously there are both subtle and not - so - subtle bigots in the pack , but I doubt they ’re representative , and it ’s a huge leap to the dismissive suggestion that the phenomenon is nothing but a manifestation of racial anxiety . )
Yet I ca n’t pretend that , on net , I really see an equivalence at present :
As of 2010 , the right really does seem to be substantially further down the rabbit hole .
Perhaps some of that perception can be put down to the fact that I mostly write about the issues where I ’m prone to agree with progressives — so I ’m more conscious of it when Fox spins fantasies about the Patriot Act than when MSNBC spins on economics or health care — but I do n’t think that ’s the whole of it , since I feel like I see the same tendencies even on issues where I ’m closer to the conservative position .
So suppose it ’s true that there ’s a real asymmetry here — the obvious question , if we ’re going to sideline the cheap partisan explanation that conservatism intrinsically appeals to the stupid or closed minded , is why this should be true now .
I have a couple ideas , and ( perhaps another bit of personal bias ) they mostly focus on the effects of technological change .
The big obvious change is the democratization of media , where the idea that there ’s a liberal bias in the journalistic profession has long been part of the conservative narrative .
The effect of this is , I think , usually exaggerated , and the forms bias takes more complicated than the popular caricature .
But it ’s clearly empirically true that reporters are disproportionately liberals and Democrats , and I expect it ’s even more the case at the networks and major national dailies .
Cable and the Internet have , of course , opened things up dramatically .
But as Tucker Carlson won boos for pointing out at CPAC last year , the fact is also that publications like The New York Times fundamentally practice solid journalism .
Inevitably , reporters ’ and editors ’ own views are at least subconsciously going to shape how stories are presented and which are seen as newsworthy in the first place however hard they might strive for objectivity .
It ’s still more likely when those views are shared by the large majority of the professional community .
Still , there ’s a lot of institutional and cultural capital built up in those hoary outlets , which at least produces a set of norms and practices that create pressure toward more fair and accurate reporting — and some of that bleeds over into even the explicitly ideological ones .
The output may have varying degrees of liberal slant , but The New York Times is not fundamentally trying to be liberal ; they ’re trying to get it right .
Their conservative counterparts — your Fox News and your Washington Times — always seem to be trying , first and foremost , to be the conservative alternative .
And that has implications for how each of them connects to the whole ecosystem of media : Getting an accurate portrait is institutionally secondary to promoting the accounts and interpretations that support the worldview and undermine the liberal media narrative .
Perhaps ironically , the trouble is that the novel conservative institutions that have emerged as an effect of technological innovation lack that Burkean reservoir of evolved , time - tested local traditions .
There ’s another explanation that ’s related to the rise of what I ’ve called the politics of ressentiment , maybe best illustrated with the help of an example in the news lately .
Constance McMillen , as you may have read , is a teenage lesbian in Fulton , Mississippi who ( with the help of the ACLU ) sued for the right to bring her girlfriend to her high school prom , and to attend wearing a tux .
At first , the school planned to simply cancel the prom rather than afford Constance the basic equality a court agreed they should .
But ultimately , there was an official “ prom ” attended by Constance and a handful of others , including a couple of the class ’ learning disabled kids , and a real ( but unofficial ) prom sponsored by parents , to which she was n’t invited .
Here ’s what ’s interesting for present purposes .
A bunch of her classmates started a Facebook group called “ Constance quit yer cryin ” to ridicule her .
The attitude of the students and parents who spoke up there was characterized less by overt homophobia than by a resentment of the effort , characterized as attention - grubbing and selfish , to upset local traditions and “ force ” the school to cancel the dance by demanding equal treatment .
But then gay - friendly sites — including traffic behemoth Perez Hilton — began linking the group , bringing a tsunami of comments from people all over the world , in numbers vastly dwarfing the original membership .
Almost all condemned the actions of the school and parents , and supported Constance .
Not a few doled out their own hateful stereotypes , heaping scorn not just on the school , but on southerners or Christians on the whole , as inbred rednecks .
Photos were posted , and much speculation ensued about which rack at Walmart various prom dresses had come off .
Contemplate how vertigo - inducing this must be .
You ’ve got a local community where a certain set of cultural norms is so dominant that it ’s just seen as obvious and natural that a lesbian would n’t have an equal right to participate in prom — to the point where the overt hostility is n’t really directed at Constance ’s sexuality so much as her bewildering insistence on messing with the way everyone knows things are supposed to be .
They ’re not attuned to the injustice because it seems like almost a fact of nature .
Except they ’re now flooded with undeniable evidence that a hell of a lot of people do n’t see things that way , and even hold their community in contempt for seeing things that way .
There have been thousands of “ outside ” posts in a handful of days , with more every minute .
( Think of the small - town high school quarterback getting to college and realizing , to his astonishment , that everyone thinks the “ art fags ” he used to slag on are the cool ones .
Except without even leaving the small town . )
Fulton is an extreme case , but I think there are probably a lot of conservative communities that feel a lower - grade version of this all the time .
So here ’s a hypothesis : Epistemic closure is ( in part ) an attempt to compensate for the collapse of geographic closure .
A function no longer effectively served by geographic segregation — because the digital equivalents of your local hangout are open to invasion by the hordes from New York and London — is being passed to media segregation , bolstered by the sudden demand that what was once tacit and given be explicitly defended .
On both explanations — and I think they ’re complementary rather than competing — the shift toward epistemic closure is linked to changes in communications technology .
Then the obvious question is whether it ’s a short - term symptom of adjustment to that technology , or the start of a new equilibrium .
An obesity expert from the UK believes Australia has overtaken America as having one of the unhealthiest diets in the world .
Dr Tim Lobstein is the director of policy and programmes for the International Association for the Study of Obesity .
He is in Western Australia with Jane Landon from the National Heart Forum to host a number of public lectures on obesity for the Public Health Advocacy Institute .
They recently held a workshop in Geraldton , in WA 's Mid West , to discuss growing concerns regarding obesity and the damaging effects on children .
Dr Lobstein says Australia 's diet has changed dramatically over the last 20 years .
" We 've found that your diets here in Australia are more fatty and oily than American diets , and we thought America was one of the worst in the world , " he said .
" You 've overtaken America .
Your diets are now 40 per cent calories from fats and oils and that 's a pretty shocking statistic - you should be down nearer 20 .
" Your sugars are high , alcohol is about double what 's the recommended level of intake and your fruit and veg are a bit under par . "
He says the rate of obesity in WA is appalling .
" By the time you are middle - aged , the statistics in Western Australia are 82 per cent of men and 68 per cent of women are overweight or obese .
That 's pretty shocking .
That means you 've got a four out of five chance of being overweight , ' he said .
Prevention the cure ?
Both Dr Lobstein and Ms Landon are particularly concerned about the diets of Australia 's children .
He estimates about 90,000 kids in WA are overweight or obese .
" It means each family practice in this state has probably about 2,000 overweight adults and 200 overweight kids to deal with , and they do n't really know what to do because losing weight is a real battle , " he said .
" The struggle we 've got here is how we 're going to implement policies to prevent the weight gain in the first place so at least the next generation will be healthier than this one . "
The challenge , according to Dr Lobstein , is whether Australia can beat the trend .
" Can we have healthy fast foods ?
Can we have a cut in soft drinks ?
Can we have a cut in snacks ?
Can we improve the fruit and veg in this country ?
" Australia can do it .
It 's got the will , it knows the policies that need to be implemented it just needs to get along and do it . "
WASHINGTON - Rep. Michele Bachmann solidified her place in the national spotlight in November when she gathered thousands of Tea Party activists in front of the U.S. Capitol for a " House Call on Washington , " to stop the Democrats ' health care bill .
Months later , official expense reports show that the boisterous , 10,000 - person rally to rein in big government and stop runaway spending cost U.S. taxpayers nearly $ 14,000 .
Bachmann and three other lawmakers split the cost for a private company to arrange staging and a sound system , using their official congressional member allowances .
Joining her were Reps. Tom Price of Georgia , Todd Akin of Missouri and Steve King of Iowa .
Spending tax dollars on partisan events is practiced on both sides of the aisle .
Democrats spent more than $ 9,000 in public money the week before the " House Call " rally to unveil the health care bill at an event outside the Capitol building attended by several hundred .
An ethics group has raised questions about Bachmann 's use of her congressional website to promote the Tea Party rally .
But several Washington ethics attorneys and experts say that paying for the event 's $ 13,600 bill with official funds likely fell within congressional rules , so long as it was not campaign - related .
" Unless it 's billed as a campaign event , or campaign donations are solicited , or there 's a concerted program of endorsements for candidates based on party affiliation , I do n't think that they ran into any issues , " said Stan Brand , a former general counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives .
Learning that taxpayer funds were used did strike a note of discomfort with Twin Cities Tea Party co-founder Deanna Boss , who arranged for more than 100 Minnesotans to attend the rally .
Boss said she would have preferred that private donors had financed the event , given her and other activists ' criticism of excessive government spending .
" I mean , we 're broke , " she said , referring to the national debt .
" Every penny counts here . "

Comedy Central Allows Mockery of Christianity on South Park but Bleeps the Name ' Prophet Muhammad ' from a Recent Episode
Contact : Rev. Patrick J. Mahoney , 540-538-4741 , 202-547-1735
WASHINGTON , April 23 / Christian Newswire / -- Network " censors " South Park after radical Islamic group makes threats about the portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad .
http://livefeed.hollywoodreporter.com/2010/04/south-park-censorship-.html
It is bigotry and discrimination at its worst to protect one faith tradition , Islam , and allow others to be mocked and ridiculed .
South Park has a long history of mocking Christianity and its values which Comedy Central has repeatedly aired .
By bowing to the pressure of radical Islamic extremists , Comedy Central shows their utter contempt for free speech , their cowardice and their distain for religious tolerance and equality .
Sadly , this double standard by Comedy Central toward Christianity , reflects the prevailing attitude in pop culture toward the Christian faith and their values .
Rev. Patrick J. Mahoney , Director of the Christian Defense Coalition , states ,
" It is bigotry and discrimination at its worst to protect one faith tradition , Islam , and allow Christianity and others to be mocked and ridiculed .
" South Park has a long history of mocking Christianity and its values which Comedy Central has repeatedly aired .
Yet , they bowed to pressure from Islamic extremists and bleeped the name the ' Prophet Muhammad ' out of one of their recent episodes .
This is an absolute disgrace .
" Let 's be clear .
By caving in to pressure from extremists , Comedy Central has shown they are cowards , have no respect for free speech or protecting artistic freedom in the shows they air .
" This network is not progressive , edgy or forward thinking .
Rather , they are religious bigots who sacrifice free speech when facing a bully .
Comedy Central shame on you .
" Sadly , this reflects a growing trend in pop culture where it is ' open season ' and a double standard regarding Christianity and its values .
This may be reflected in the National Endowment for the Arts funding a picture of Jesus in a vat of urine or HBO airing an episode of Larry David urinating on a picture of Jesus .
" In America , all faith traditions should be treated with equality . "

Add Palin to the mix and you have a whole new machine in American politics - one with the capacity , as much as Obama 's , to upend the established order .
Beltway types roll their eyes .
But she 's not Obama , they say .
She does n't know anything , polarizes too many people , has lied constantly and still may have dozens of skeletons in her unvetted closets .
To which the answer must be : where the fuck have you been this past year ?
It does n't matter whether she 's uneducated , unprincipled , unaware and unscrupulous .
The more she 's proven incapable of the presidency , the more her supporters believe she is destined for it .
It 's a brilliant little gig she 's devised .
She may be ignorant , but she is not stupid .
She has the smarts of all accomplished pathological liars and phonies .
And this time , she will not even bother to go on any television outlets other than Fox News .
She will be the first presidential nominee never to have had a press conference .
She will give statements by Facebook .
She will speak directly to the cocoon that is , at least , twenty percent of Americans .
The press , already a rank failure in exposing her fraudulence , will be so starstruck by the chance to make money that we will never have a Couric - style interview again .
it will be Oprah all the time .
Because Palin lives in an imaginary world , the entire media world will be required to echo it or be shut out .
More to the point , creating a false narrative around a total phony and peddling her as a savior has no financial downside for the FNC / TalkRadio party .
So this phenomenon will grow and grow .
I mean : can you imagine Romney or Pawlenty inspiring this sort of fervor ?
Check this out in the New York piece :
Nowadays , for both poles of the political spectrum but especially for the right , politics is a businessthe entertainment business .
The freak show , as Mark Halperin termed it , has been turned into a fully merchandised product .
It was Fox ’s Roger Ailes who had the insight that the American right was an underserved market , one with a powerful kind of brand loyalty .
Fox News has turned a disaffected segment of the populace into a market , with the fervor and idiosyncratic truth standards of a cult .
Wingnut - ism has been monetized , is one admittedly partisan way of looking at it .
Palin stokes the disaffection of her constituents and then , with the help of Fox , offers to heal them , for a price .
Andsurprisethey ’re more affluent than most Americans .
Fifty - six percent make over $ 50,000 a year , according to a Times / CBS poll .
Running for president is no doubt part of her business model .
But forget elections ( as many Palin supporters already seem to have done ) ; she ’s already the president of an alternative Americaand also its CEO .
And with that power and that potential funding , how can someone who said she wanted to be president as long ago as 1996 resist ?
Josh can dream all he wants .
She is the biggest political power after Obama in this country .
And , unless the full truth emerges with such force it cracks even the FNC / RNC sealed universe , she will run against him in 2012 .

Huddled around a camp fire in the dunes , a group of young Emirati men drink vodka from plastic cups .
Later , in the VIP area of a club , they swig magnums of champagne , eyeing the Western girls in miniskirts dancing by their table .
This week , these scenes will be on big screens all over Dubai .
They ’re from City of Life , the nation ’s first big - budget feature film , written and directed by Emirati Ali Mostafa .
‘ Ten years ago , no way would I have been able to show that , ’ Mostafa tells Time Out .
‘ I ’m surprised I ’m able to show it now . ’
Others are similarly surprised , and disappointed .
The film was recently leaked on the internet and Mostafa has experienced some adverse reactions .
‘ I met some local girls in a mall who said , “ How can you show this ? ”
I ’m like , “ Is n’t what you [ usually ] see in the cinema 20,000 times worse than what you see in City of Life ? ”
And they ’re like , “ Yeah , but we expected more from an Emirati . ” ’
While some locals may take offence at these scenes , the fact that they ’ve not been cut before the film hits multiplexes shows a marked change regarding the UAE ’s censorship of celluloid .
Of course , there remain ‘ non-negotiables ’ .
A public cinema must not offend the nation ’s social and religious values , meaning any sexual or nude scenes are immediately cast to the cutting room floor ( for example , when Time
Out sat in on a censor ’s viewing of the film Moon , the only thing to be cut – perhaps ironically , considering the title – was a shot of Sam Rockwell ’s rear end as his character took a shower ) .
Also up for the chop is anything that could be offensive to religion ( not just Islam ) and anything that criticises the rulers of the UAE and surrounding Arab nations .
But when you consider that a film such as Syriana , about Islamist terrorism , made it to UAE cinemas , you can appreciate that censors are becoming more liberal .
Mohammed Mutawa , a senior staff member in the censorship department at the National Media Council ( NMC ) , sums up the difficulty of his job when he tells us that ‘ 90 per cent of material – films , music , video games – is from outside our culture ’ .
Inevitably , elements of this imported material will conflict with the UAE ’s social values .
Still , the department rarely bans films , with sometimes humorous results .
Morgan Freeman is entirely missing from the UAE version of Bruce Almighty because censors cut all depictions of God.
Contrary to popular belief , Sex and the City was not banned here .
But because all scenes of a sexual nature were cut , cinemas decided not to screen it – probably because there were only about 30 minutes of the film left to screen ( who knows whether the same will happen with the Abu Dhabi - based sequel ) .
Mutawa concedes : ‘ People see things differently .
Some see only beauty in certain scenes , whereas others [ will be offended ] .
I might enjoy a film , but we have to do what the law says .
There are rules . ’
City of Life director Mostafa says he thinks ‘ the psychology of seeing it on the big screen ’ has drawn objections to the more risqué parts of his film .
True , there seem to be different rules for public and private viewing here .
Juma Alleem , director of the NMC ’s censorship department , confirms it is not illegal to possess an uncensored film on DVD in the UAE because ‘ it is a personal effect .
There is no official intervention because it is for personal use . ’
He also tells us that DVDs for sale in the UAE are n’t as censored as in the cinema because he lacks the technology to cut them .
Therefore , if there are only ‘ one or two ’ sexual scenes , a DVD is released .
If there are ‘ too many obscene scenes ’ , it is banned .
That ’s why Watchmen , for example , was near incomprehensible in the cinema , but it ’s possible to buy the DVD and see the film in its entirety – sex scenes and Dr Manhattan ’s perennially naked presence included .
This too signals a liberal approach , especially when you consider that neighbour Saudi Arabia does not condone viewing films at all .
Cameron Mitchell , general manager of CineStar cinemas , wholeheartedly agrees .
‘ We ’re very fortunate that the UAE is as liberal as it is , ’ he tells us over coffee at the chain ’s new multiplex in Mirdif City Centre .
He confirms that other GCC countries are n’t nearly so relaxed .
Mitchell also offers an insight into why more controversial films , though not banned , may not make it here .
‘ Cinema is a very expensive business , ’ he says .
‘ A lot do n’t make any money .
You have to make sure you screen the right thing . ’
So most cinemas are unwilling to take risks .
As John Chahine , general manager of regional distributor Italia Film , tells us : ‘ Believe it or not , we released Brokeback Mountain [ laughs ] .
It did n’t do well .
But it was only in two multiplexes . ’
However , Chahine thinks this may change .
He has worked here for eight years , and says the difference between what he could screen when he started and what he screens now is remarkable .
‘ For a movie like Syriana or The Da Vinci Code to pass is like a 90 per cent change , ’ he says .
And as the movie business here grows bigger , with new cinemas and new exhibitors coming into the market , companies will seek to gain a competitive edge by giving more films a chance to shine .
Chahine explains that Shutter Island had a bad first week here .
Usually such a film would have been taken off right away , but , believing in its potential , some exhibitors chose to continue screening it .
It has now been running for five weeks .
Ultimately , perhaps boundaries will be pushed most persistently by local filmmakers .
The UAE ’s first female filmmaker , Nayla al Khaja , said in an interview in February : ‘ If they expect [ us ] to make films that are only positive , without any reference to reality , that will be the death of filmmaking . ’
She has resisted this , with her critically - lauded short film , Arabana , tackling the taboo of paedophilia .
Similarly , Mostafa defends his depiction of decadent Emiratis by declaring : ‘ I did what I thought was real . ’
He concedes the film could have delved even further , but reasons : ‘ I did n’t need to make a film that was so unnecessarily controversial that no [ Emirati ] could ever make a film again .
I ’m just scratching the surface . ’
Yet even the ability to scratch it is rapid progress , in line with the myriad other leaps and bounds made by Dubai .
It may not suit some , as Mostafa has found , but if change is going to happen , all the better it comes from UAE citizens .
Let ’s see what people make of City of Life .
It may prove more important than we realise .
City of Life is in UAE cinemas now .

It 's been a long time ( August 2009 to be precise ) since I summarized Twitter 's usage and growth .
So , here are some updated statistics on the micro- blogging service :
Now I know what it must have been like to see Bobby Orr in his prime completely dominating a game .
Now a younger generation knows what it was like to see Wayne Gretzky shred an opponent .
If you did n't watch this game - either shame on you for not tuning in , or shame on Versus and NHL Network for not figuring out a way to get this game out to the whole country .
Yes , the story here should be the Sharks and their spectacular come - from - behind - overcoming - their - choker - label win , but the mainstream media has the narrative covered .
The true story of this game for anyone that cares to dig deeper than the narrative was the Thunder From Njurunda , half man , half God , half possible centaur - Henrik Zetterberg .
Even though it was a losing effort , what Zetterberg did last night was one of the most magnificent playoff performances that I can recall .
Zetterberg was everywhere early and on every line late .
Zetterberg led all forwards with over twenty - two minutes of even strength time , two - and - half minutes more than any other forward .
He was the only forward for either team to who was on the ice with and against every other player in the game .
If last night 's game was The Matrix , Zetterberg had the unfair advantage of seeing the code when no one else could .
For the first time this series the Wings had the home change and Mike Babcock took advantage of it to match Zetterberg against Joe Thornton and his linemates .
Zetterberg came out ahead .
Way ahead .
Scoring Chances
For those of you who are new to the concept of tracking scoring chances , a scoring chance is defined as a clear play directed toward the opposing net from a dangerous scoring area - loosely defined as the top of the circle in and inside the faceoff dots , though sometimes slightly more generous than that depending on the amount of immediately - preceding puck movement or screens in front of the net .
Blocked shots are generally not included but missed shots are .
A player is awarded a scoring chance anytime he is on the ice and someone from either team has a chance to score .
He is awarded a " chance for " if someone on his team has a chance to score and a " chance against " if the opposing team has a chance to score .
Vic Ferrari makes this all possible with his tools to evaluate Corsi , head - to - head ice time and scoring chances .

The Wings really beat on the Sharks early in this game but the Sharks had a couple of power plays in the second and play balanced out after that .
Wings fans are again complaining about the penalties , and it 's easy to see why .
The Sharks have been on the power play for 30:30 in this series , and the Wings only 15:26 .
At even strength , the Wings have a slight edge in scoring chances for the series at 49/43 and a total Corsi advantage of 32 ( though they have trailed late and we know that the shots edge swings to the losing team in that situation ) .
Yet on the power play , the Wings have been outchanced 24/ 6 .
The officiating has n't been great , but the fix is n't in against the Wings this year as Red Wings ' fans claim , certainly no more than the league was fixing the playoffs for the Wings in prior years as all twenty - nine other fanbases claimed .

They also owned overtime - the Wings had a 20 / 12 even strength chances advantage through three .

Sweet Moses .
Zetterberg was 15 / 2 on even strength chances ( if a penalty shot is considered an ES chance , which the NHL thinks it is by the game sheet ) .
Fifteen chances for and two against !
At even strength !
The Wings posted a team Corsi of 20 in this game , Zetterberg himself posted a 25 .
This may be the best underlying stats game I 've ever seen from a single player .
The coolest thing about the electric motorcycle grand prix is anyone with a bit of skill and determination can make a run for the checkered flag .
It does n’t require a wad of money or bleeding - edge machinery , so even two guys working in their garage in Ohio have a shot at victory .
But they need a little help to get there .
John Wild and Sean Ewing are scrambling to finish their homebuilt electric motorcycle and get it shipped to California in time for the opening race of the TTXGP electric motorcycle grand prix season .
The two guys , who call themselves Square Wave Racing , got together three months ago and they ’ve built the SWR1 in record time .
Wild is a vintage motorcycle racer and a fabricator who ’s built a few choppers .
Ewing is an electrical engineer , entrepreneur and student at Ohio State University .
They started with 1996 Honda CBR F3 , which was a hot bike back in the day .
It ’s a bit long in the tooth now , but Wild says it was perfect for their application because it ’s relatively nimble and it ’s got a steel frame .
That makes welding a snap .
“ We ’ve only been working on this for a few weeks , so we had to start with a rolling chassis , ” he said .
“ We did n’t have time to start from the wheels up . ”
The guys swapped the engine for a three - phase AC motor and an 8 - kilowatt - hour lithium - iron phosphate battery .
That ’s huge for a motorcycle , but Ewing says they want to be sure they ’ve got the juice to complete the 25 - mile race .
They ’re shooting for a range of 80 miles — around town , not on the track — and a top speed somewhere north of 100 mph .
Breaking the century mark will be no small feat .
The winner of last year ’s TTXGP on the Isle of Man averaged 87.43 mph .
“ With all the accelerating and braking , accelerating and braking , it will take a lot of energy , ” Ewing says .
“ We ’re confident the battery will last .
The bikes that ran at the Isle of Man last year had about 3.5 kilowatt - hours .
Perhaps we might have a bit of overkill . ”
The guys are keeping mum on the bike ’s performance and specs .
Wild said making the SWR1 handle like a conventional motorcycle was a top priority , so there ’s no regenerative braking .
Motorcycles do most of their braking at the front wheel and Wild felt regen on the back wheel would throw off the braking feel and balance .
Wild says swapping the gasoline drivetrain for an electric one did n’t bring too big a weight penalty .
They have n’t put the SWR1 on a scale , but Ewing guesses the bike weighs about 450 pounds .
The ’96 CBR weighed 405 without gas or fluids .
Wild took the bike for its inaugural ride last weekend , then went for another spin Monday .
“ It ’s not much heavier than the gas motor , ” he said of the electric drivetrain .
“ But it ’s a little bit further forward .
I ’m working on a triple clamp to extend the fork and redistribute the weight a little better .
It does n’t feel any different under acceleration , but it feels a little top heavy under braking . ”
All told , the guys have about $ 10,000 invested in the bike .
They ’re about to ship it to California for the inaugural race at Infineon Raceway May 15 and 16 .
They ’re a little short of cash , so they ’re seeking donations to raise $ 5,000 to finance the trip .
The other races on the North American calendar are within driving distance of Ohio , but the guys could n’t get the time off for a road trip to California .
They ’ve gotta fly everything to the race .
They ’re pretty confident of their chances in the race once they get to Infineon , but they are n’t making any predictions .
“ We ’re definitely looking to finish the race , ” Ewing said .
“ That ’s the first priority .
But we ’re confident in our bike and we ’ll do the best we can . ”

The SWR1 was built in a matter of weeks using a 1996 Honda CBR 600 F3 as the base .
Although the bike is a bit long in the tooth , tech - wise , its steel frame made it a good candidate because it ’s easy to weld .
The electric drivetrain was n’t much heavier than the gasoline drivetrain , but it did move the weight forward a bit .
The team is keeping mum on the bikes specs for now , so we ca n’t tell you much about the electric drivetrain .
A sloppily written law passed by Congress 15 years ago has cost the country several billion dollars in lost oil royalties in the Gulf of Mexico and threatens to cost the country billions more .
Representative Edward Markey has been trying , without success , to fix the law .
He argues that the profit - rich oil companies are absconding with money that rightly belongs to American taxpayers .
The Massachusetts Democrat is submitting a new bill to right this wrong .
It smartly seeks to leverage President Obama ’s promise to open up selected coastal waters to offshore exploration by insisting that these oil companies start paying royalties on all of their existing leases before receiving any new leases .
To encourage deepwater exploration in the Gulf of Mexico , a 1995 law offered generous incentives in the form of relief from royalties , then roughly 12 percent of the per-barrel price .
The law was seen as a useful way to increase domestic production and reduce the country ’s dependence on foreign oil .
Prices were low at the time , so the law contained a threshold of $ 28 per barrel ( in 1994 dollars ) beyond which royalties would resume .
But this applied only to already signed leases .
There was no clear language in the bill specifying price thresholds for new leases signed from 1996 to 2000 .
Some legislators involved in drafting the bill said later that they simply assumed that the $ 28 threshold would apply to both old and new leases .
Video report provided by RAWA the day of the Granai Massacre , of which WikiLeaks reportedly will release classified footage .
The U.S government has always reported 26 civilians were killed though , investigations by rights groups have said more than 90 children alone were killed in the airstrike .
The government has also claimed that the Taliban was responsible for a bulk of the casualties , though civilians claim the Taliban had left well before the U.S. warplanes rained bombs on their village through the middle of the night .
( 2:08 ) :
Classified video footage of U.S. warplanes “ repeatedly ” dropping 500 - and 2,000 - lb. bombs , massacring up to 147 Afghan civilians of the Bala Baluk district of Farah province last May , is expected to be released on the internet by WikiLeaks , Ben Farmer reported at the London Telegraph last night .
Last week , WikiLeaks , a website that posts materials provided by whistleblowers , released a classified U.S. military video depicting the 2007 indiscriminate slaying of over a dozen non-hostile people in the Iraqi suburb of New Baghdad — including two members of Reuters news staff — and wanton destruction of an apartment complex with families inside .
Julian Assange , editor , “ says he was followed on a flight from Reykjavik to Copenhagen by two American agents ” as he “ claims surveillance has intensified as he and his colleagues prepare to put out their Afghan film ” , Matthew Campbell reports at the London Times today .
General David Petraeus — combatant commander of U.S. operations in the Middle East and Central Asian theaters — told National Public Radio , weeks after the attack , that he had seen the video and it “ very clearly shows bombs hitting individuals who are the Taliban who are reacting to the movements of the Afghan and coalition forces on the ground ” and though , “ there were civilians killed in this incident along ” , the “ targets of these different strikes were the Taliban ” .
He added that he believed the video would be shown “ as part of the press briefing ” the U.S. probe .
The video was to be released with a Pentagon investigation report , but Pentagon officials were doubtful , “ out of fear that its findings would further enrage the Afghan public , Pentagon officials told McClatchy , ” Nancy Youssef reported , June 15 , adding later [ emphasis added ] :
Two U.S. military officials told McClatchy that the video shows that no one checked to see whether any women or children were in the building before it was bombed … .
The seven - hour incident on May 4 began when Afghan police were ambushed while they were patrolling a road .
Some officers were killed , prompting the police to call in the Afghan army .
The army then came under attack , too , and the provincial governor called in U.S. forces .
The U.S. forces eventually called in air support , military officials said , and after the airstrike began , the Taliban moved into two remote villages separated by poppy fields that were a source of heavy enemy fire , and the fight continued into the night . …
The May 4 , 2009 late - night attack on the hamlet of Granai ( also translated “ Garani “ ) in the province of Farah was sharply protested with “ Death to America ! ” chants and become known as the “ Granai Massacre “ , as Reuters reported , “ Villagers brought truckloads of bodies to the capital . ”
Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan called the attack , “ one out of many war crime cases ” committed by the Obama Administration in Afghanistan and compiled graphic photos , consistent with the initial claims of Afghan civilians and officials ( 2:42 ) :
A “ tribal elder with extensive local knowledge of the surrounding area ” said the Taliban were never within a kilometer of the Granai village , Guy Smallman reported at the Financial Times , last June .
“ The U.S. disputes this account and claims that the Taliban entered the village , turning it into a legitimate target ” , adding [ emphasis added ] :
There is a partially destroyed farmhouse and two large craters .
[ Taliban ] fighters briefly regrouped here in the evening before melting back into the maze of ditches and trees in the surrounding countryside .
Yet bombs landed there 90 minutes later , the elder says .
Again , the Americans disagree and say the bombings took place in the heat of battle with the Taliban , with no delay .
The elder ’s account appears to be corroborated by other residents of Granai who spoke in Farah to the Institute of War and Peace Reporting … .
Two parts of the village saw the greatest loss of life .
One , the main village mosque , is in ruins .
Its dome is still intact , with the speakers used to announce the call to prayer hanging limply from the roof .
But the area immediately around it is a mass of rubble and craters .
Every building in the vicinity has been demolished .
It was dusk when the attack came .
A large crowd of people were in the garden after evening prayers .
On the other side of the village is what looks like a piece of open waste ground .
But closer inspection reveals the foundations of a house .
Items of clothing and broken crockery are strewn among the debris .
This was where people gathered after the attack on the mosque … .
“ The people were afraid .
About 10 to 15 families gathered in the same place to be safe together .
This was in the evening and it was dark , ” says the elder .
He recalls a small “ helicopter ” with no pilot that made a “ zzzz ” sound .
He appears to be describing one of the pilotless drones used by Nato troops to relay video film of the battlefield .
“ My cousins , my sister , my nephews and also my nieces were all killed in this place , ” he says .
“ About 13 or 14 people related to my sister were killed here .
I found my nephew ’s body recently over there .
A farmer found another body over there . ”
On the hill , beyond the village , are traditional Muslim graves ranged as far as the eye can see .
The fresh ones number more than 70 .
The elder points to those of his sister and her children .
Then at the far end of the cemetery he stands before one enormous grave stretching more than 50 metres across .
“ This is the grave that almost 55 people are buried in because their bodies are in pieces , ” he says … .
“ These are poor people .
They hate the government , they hate the Americans and they hate to live in this place .
We think that this country is like a prison for us . ”
“ The Pentagon initially claimed that the entire incident was made up and that the Taliban had pre-killed all the civilians and stored the bodies in buildings before tricking the U.S. into bombing those buildings , ” Jason Ditz at AntiWar News writes .
“ They later conceded to have killed 26 people , but insisted that ‘ no one will ever ’ know the exact numbers .
They also claimed that the planes had no idea any civilians were in the area ” before dropping 500 - to 2,000 - lb. bombs .
Last June , Philip Alston , U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions , demanded ‘ real accountability ’ for the U.S. - led coalition ’s mounting death toll of Afghan civilians — notably the May 2009 attack on Farah .
Afghan officials were reporting 147 civlian deaths — including 95 children — as a result of the U.S. airstrikes .
Jeremy Scahill reported the U.S. government was doing all it could to shift blame for the massacre of civilians on a Taliban ‘ staging ’ , May 7 , 2009 [ emphasis added ] :
By day ’s end , the Pentagon was seeking to blame the Taliban for “ staging ” the massacre to blame it on the U.S.
Last night , NBC News ’s Pentagon correspondent Jim Miklaszewski said military sources told him Taliban fighters used grenades to kill three families to “ stage ” a massacre and then blame it on the US .
The senior U.S. military and NATO commander in Afghanistan , Gen. David McKiernan , spoke in general terms :
“ We have some other information that leads us to distinctly different conclusions about the cause of the civilian casualties , ” he said .
McKiernan left the specific details of the spin to unnamed officials .
According to The Washington Post , “ A U.S. defense official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said that ‘ the Taliban went to a concerted effort to make it look like the U.S. airstrikes caused this .
The official did not offer evidence to support the claim , and could not say what had caused the deaths . ”
Meanwhile , according to the Associated Press , a senior Defense official who did not want to be identified “ said late Wednesday that Marine special operations forces believe the Afghan civilians were killed by grenades hurled by Taliban militants , who then loaded some of the bodies into a vehicle and drove them around the village , claiming the dead were victims of an American airstrike .
A second U.S. official said a senior Taliban commander is believed to have ordered the grenade attack . ”
As the AP reported , “ it would be the first time the Taliban has used grenades in this way . ”
While the Pentagon spins its story , the International Committee of the Red Cross has stated bluntly that U.S. airstrikes hit civilian houses and revealed that an ICRC counterpart in the Red Crescent was among the dead .
The New York Times ( NYT ) reported that “ 20 to 30 civilians may have been killed ” , according to the U.S. military as of May 21 .
By June 3 , the NYT reported that the U.S. military concedes to making “ significant errors ” in its airstrikes .
The following day , the Los Angeles Times reported that the U.S. military concedes the air strike as “ overkill ” , but still thinks only “ 26 civilians were mistakenly killed ”
A report released in mid-June by the U.S. government “ found 26 confirmed civilian casualties but concedes that it is impossible to determine a final number because some were buried before investigators arrived , ” Ms. Youssef reported at McClatchy .
“ However , it also cites an investigation by the Afghan Human Rights Commission shortly after the May 4 incident , which found 86 casualties . ”
The U.S. military said it would not pursue any internal disciplinary actions for the Granai Massacre , so it ’s pretty clear that the massacre the Pentagon does n’t want us to see was ‘ mission accomplished ’ , right ?

Video : Arizona ’s Immigration Crackdown
Video : What ’s Going On in Arizona ?
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed today what is now the most punitive and sweeping anti-immigrant state law in the nation .
This law ’s full effects will not be measurable for months to come , but it is already clear that it will be challenged in court because it denies rights guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution .
And until the legal issues are settled , the new law will have a detrimental effect on Arizona ’s economy , as well as city and state budgets .
The law essentially legalizes racial profiling
The law puts communities of color in the crosshairs by requiring state and local government workers to determine if a person is illegally in the United States based on a “ reasonable suspicion . ”
Legal experts maintain that the law will result in racial profiling , as it does not prohibit police officers from relying on race or ethnicity in deciding who to investigate .
Of course all Arizonans do n’t all look alike .
Like America , Arizona is a diverse state with multiple generations of U.S. citizens .
Three out of every 10 Arizonans are Hispanic , 1 out of 10 is American Indian , and 13 percent are foreign born .
The law undercuts the Constitution and imbues local police with federal authority
Arizona is attempting to grant local police arrest authority for administrative violations of federal immigration law , even though the state police does not even have that authority under federal law .
The measure does not require the local police to have a search warrant or even suspect that some illegal action has occurred .
The law criminalizes the solicitation of work even though courts have previously ruled that the solicitation of work is protected speech under the First Amendment .
The law will harm the state and local economies
The National Employment Law Project pointed out that smaller - scale anti-immigrant ordinances have cost individual localities millions of dollars .
The Texas - based Perryman Group calculated that if all unauthorized immigrants were removed from Arizona , the state would lose $ 26.4 billion in economic activity , $ 11.7 billion in gross state product , and approximately 140,324 jobs .
The Immigration Policy Center noted that , “ with Arizona facing a budget deficit of more than $ 3 billion , ” the new law will “ further imperil the state ’s economic future . ”
Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon and other local leaders anticipate a drop in new business ventures in the state because of the harsh new law .
Phoenix Vice Mayor Michael Nowakowski observed : “ We ’re the laughing stock of the country because of these crazy laws . ”
The law will be expensive and take cops away from community policing
The Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police firmly opposes the law for fiscal and public safety reasons , noting that fear of government officials will diminish the public ’s willingness to cooperate with police in criminal investigations and will “ negatively affect the ability of law enforcement agencies across the state to fulfill their many responsibilities in a timely manner . ”
Local taxpayers will bear the heavy costs of lengthy court litigation .
The costs to arrest , detain , process , and transport undocumented immigrants out of Arizona will drain local government treasuries .
There were an estimated 460,000 undocumented immigrants in Arizona as of January 2009 , making up 4 percent of the state ’s population .
If the federal government were to handle the entire undocumented population , the cost would be approximately $ 23,148 per person , based on a recent study by the Center for American Progress .
Arizona and other local and state governments are taking action on immigration because Congress has failed to enact comprehensive immigration reform that restores border security , provides a flexible visa program to meet business and family needs , and deals with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States .
This is a federal issue and must be handled by Congress immediately before other states start to follow Arizona ’s lead .

Paying to Pee : Have the Airlines Gone Too Far ?
Ryanair 's plan to charge for its bathrooms has been called inhumane .
April 13 , 2010  --
Irish discount airline Ryanair 's plans to charge to use the toilet might be a great cost - savings move , but it has been met by skepticism and outrage from critics who call it inhumane .
" It 's one of the most absurd ideas I 've ever heard , " said Steven D. Soifer , an associate professor at the University of Maryland 's School of Social Work .
The extra fee for the bathroom , plus the Ryanair 's desire to remove two of the three restrooms to add more seats , causes problems -- especially for people with medical conditions , Soifer said .
His studies include Paruresis , also known as shy bladder syndrome , where people are not able to urinate when in the presence of others .
Soifer said , for instance , that a passenger might really struggle inside the sole airplane bathroom if they knew there was a long line of people waiting in the aisle .
The airline plans to charge either 1 euro or 1 British pound ( about $ 1.30 to $ 1.55 ) to use the toilet for flights scheduled for one hour or less .
By eliminating two of the three bathrooms on the plane , Ryanair plans to add six extra seats .
Stay Up to Date on the Latest Travel Trends from ABC News on Twitter
That could cause major problems for somebody with incontinence who is constantly running up and down the aisle to use the bathroom , Soifer said .
" Who is going to be passing out euros or giving change ?
To me it 's insanity , " Soifer said .
" Using the bathroom is a basic bodily necessity . "
The airline has different hopes .
" By charging for the toilets we are hoping to change passenger behavior so that they use the bathroom before or after the flight , " Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara told London 's Daily Mail .
Soifer half - joked that if Ryanair does actually go through with this plan he will hop on a flight , be the first to use the toilet and then stay in the bathroom the remainder of the flight in protest .
And he 's not alone in seeing potential medical issues with the new pay toilet plan .
Professor Jon Rhodes , president of the British Society of Gastroenterology , told London 's Daily Express that " people with bowel disease need to go to the toilet urgently and often , with very little warning . "
But do n't expect the pay - potties anytime soon .
George Hobica , president of airfarewatchdog.com , said passengers will be so upset about this that they will simply hold the door open for the next person in line .
Ryanair wo n't gain any revenue out of that one pay toilet .
" The one person who pays the pound to pee will call down the aisle , `OK , who 's next !? ' while holding the door open , " Hobica predicts .
Hobica said Ryanair is doing this mostly for publicity – " their CEO loves to get his picture on TV , " he said -- and also to allow the airline to add a few extra seats .
" It will only take a few flights where the one remaining lav malfunctions , leaving passengers with no other options than peeing in their seats , before Ryanair changes its mind on this , " Hobica said .
" I really do n't see it flying in the long term .
I 'm all for airlines making a profit , but this is going to backfire if it indeed gets off the ground . "
Rick Seaney , CEO of airfare - search site FareCompare.com and an ABCNews.com columnist , said that one could make the argument that it is a logical extension for Europeans who in many cases pay for public restrooms at train stations .
" But train stations do n't travel at 30,000 feet in a cramped metal tube with filtered air , " Seaney said .
" Let 's face it , lavatories on planes are not frills ; we are talking basic human needs here and for Ryanair to talk about removing some lavatories while making passengers pay for the remaining toilet , at least for Americans , does n't even pass the giggle test . "
Ray Neidl , an independent airline analyst , generally supports airlines adding on extra fees .
The latest example of a new fee came last week when Spirit Airlines announced it was starting to charge a fee for carry - on bags , a fee higher than that to check luggage .
But for Neidl , Ryanair 's bathroom fee is " probably stepping over the line . "
" I 've been always been an advocate for charging for different services on flights , but that one is going a little too far , that and withholding water , " Neidl said .
" Everything else is on the table . "
Passengers can always revolt , although he said if any airline could get away with this , it would be Ryanair .
Ryanair is notorious for its fees .
While most airlines now have checked - bag fees and charges for changing your flights , Ryanair was a pioneer in those fees and adding additional ones , such as charging all customers extra to check in for their flight .
And that 's not even in the airport , that 's online .
Travelers put up with these fees because the no-thrills airline typically offers ridiculously low airfares on short hops between European cities .
" With Ryanair , you can never tell .
I do n't think it is going to work anywhere else but with Ryanair , it could work , " he said .
" Bottom line : I still predict it does n't happen . "

Popular wisdom holds that good smells are in the nose of the sniffer .
You like the scent of roses ; I like fresh coffee .
But a scientific study using a robotic " eNose " proves that pleasant smells are universal - and predictable .

Good smells are biologically hardwired
Using a device called an eNose , a group of Israeli neurobiologists were able to rank smells by pleasantness .
They tested dozens of smells on people in Israel and Ethiopia ( two very different cultural groups ) in order to determine whether these good smells were universal or culturally specific .
What they found was that many smells are universally rated as good or bad .

Write the authors of the new study :
We tuned an eNose to human odor pleasantness estimates .
We then used the eNose to predict the pleasantness of novel odorants , and tested these predictions in naïve subjects who had not participated in the tuning procedure .
We found that our apparatus generated odorant pleasantness ratings with above 80 % similarity to average human ratings , and with above 90 % accuracy at discriminating between categorically pleasant or unpleasant odorants .
Similar results were obtained in two cultures , native Israeli and native Ethiopian , without retuning of the apparatus .
These findings suggest that unlike in vision and audition , in olfaction there is a systematic predictable link between stimulus structure and stimulus pleasantness .
This goes in contrast to the popular notion that odorant pleasantness is completely subjective , and may provide a new method for odor screening and environmental monitoring , as well as a critical building block for digital transmission of smell .

They add :
We could predict whether a person who we never tested before would like the odorant , and this prediction was consistent across Israeli and Ethiopian cultural backgrounds .
We argue that this difference was not a reflection of better hardware ( in fact , an eNose is less precise than a modern camera or sound recorder ) , or better algorithms , but rather a reflection of a fundamental biological property of the sense of smell .

This has implications for perfumers and other entrepreneurs who want to sell things that smell good across the globe .
But for the rest of us ?
It provides a definitive list of the best and worst smells .
The best and worst smells
According to the humans tested , what were the best smells ?
From the range of essential oils that were tested , these were the winners .

1. lime ( fruit )
2. grapefruit ( fruit )
3. bergamot ( similar to an orange in scent )
4. orange ( fruit )
5. peppermint
Here are the runners - up :
6. freesia ( flower )
7. amyl acetate ( a molecule that smells like apples and bananas )
8. cassia ( similar to cinnamon )
9. mimosa ( flowering tree )
10 . fir ( tree )

And the worst ?
The researchers say the smells consistently ranked the worst included " either carboxylic acids or amines [ and ] cyclohexanol . "
These would probably produce sharp , vinegary smells .
Among the lowest - ranked of the so - called " pleasant " smells were musk and patchouli .

The Federal Government is expelling an Israeli diplomat after it found Israel faked Australian passports that were used in a hit on a top Hamas leader in Dubai .
Foreign Minister Stephen Smith today condemned the fraud as " not the act of a friend " and a clear affront to Australia that cannot be tolerated .
" This is not what we expect from a nation with whom we have had such a close , friendly and supportive relationship , " he said .
In February several forged Australian passports were used in the assassination of Hamas leader Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
Mr Smith confirmed investigations by Australian Federal Police , ASIO and ASIS showed Israel fabricated the passports of four Australians who also had Israeli citizenship .
" The high quality of these counterfeited passports points to involvement of a state intelligence service , " he said .
" These investigations and advice have left the Australian Government in no doubt that Israel was responsible for the abuse and counterfeiting of these passports . "
The Department of Foreign Affairs summoned the Charge D'affairs to request that it remove one of its diplomats within the week .
" The Government takes this step much more in sorrow than anger or retaliation , " Mr Smith said .
" It is a decision taken in our national security interest .
" The department conveyed the Government 's deep disappointment over Israel 's involvement in this affair . "
The diplomat who has been expelled has not been named and it is not known whether they will return or be replaced at a later stage .
Mr Smith said Australia would now work on rebuilding its relationship and reminded Israel friendship was a " two - way street " .
He also said Israel should realise it is on notice that if it again fabricates Australian passports similar or stronger action would be taken .
When asked if Israel had acknowledged its part in the affair or had apologised , Mr Smith replied : " In terms of the substance of these matters Israel has not been drawn in those conversations or drawn on those matters . "
Regrettable decision
A spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry , Yigal Palmor , says it is a regrettable decision .
" It does not reflect the importance and the quality of our relationships , " he said .
Deputy Opposition Leader Julie Bishop says the Government has over - reacted .
" There is no actual proof that the Israeli government was involved - there is an assumption , " she said .
Nicole McCabe , Joshua Bruce , Adam Korman and Joshua Krycer have been named as the Australians whose passports were forged .
All four live in Israel .
Mr Smith says replacement passports have been issued and consular assistance is still being provided to the four Australians .
An Australian Federal Police ( AFP ) team travelled to Israel to investigate the matter as well as the director - general of ASIO earlier this month .
Dubai authorities had said they were almost 100 per cent certain the Israeli spy agency , Mossad , was responsible for the hit .
Dubai claimed the assassins also used Irish , French and German passports to travel through the state .
Israel has maintained there is no proof it was behind the assassination .
Earlier this year , Britain expelled an Israeli diplomat after an investigation by its Serious Organised Crime Agency found that 12 forged British passports used in the assassination were copied from real documents .
It said the copies were made after the passports were handed over for inspection " to individuals linked to Israel " .

The agency in charge of overseeing the United States ’ oil reserves was plagued with gross mismanagement that in at least one case allowed the companies being inspected to fill in their own audit reports , an Inspector General ’s report will reportedly reveal this week .
Regulators overseeing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico reportedly allowed oil company officials to fill in their own inspection reports .
According to the internal probe being released this week , oil officials sketched out their answers in pencil and turned them over to federal oversight officials , who then traced their answers in pen .
ADVERTISEMENT
And as if that was n’t enough , a Louisiana inspector from the Minerals Management Service purportedly admitted to investigators that he ’d used crystal methamphetamine , and may have been high on the illegal stimulant during a drilling inspection .
The Inspector General ’s report was previewed Tuesday in the New York Times .
The report is sure to set off a bombshell in Washington , where Congress is probing how a massive and still - growing oil leak was allowed to happen in the Gulf of Mexico .
None of the reports findings directly address the lead - up to the spill from the sinking of Transocean ’s Deepwater Horizon rig in April , but they certainly draw a picture of a watchdog asleep — or high — at the wheel .
The report also found that during the tenure of President George W. Bush , from 2005 to 2007 , “ inspectors accepted meals , tickets to sporting events and gifts from at least one oil company while they were overseeing the industry , ” the Times said .
The paper added that “ the investigation had been presented to the United States Attorney ’s Office for the Western District of Louisiana , which declined prosecution . ”
The official probe is said to have relied on confidential sources who tattle - taled on the troubled agency .
ADVERTISEMENT
They “ provided additional information pertaining to M.M.S. employees at the Lake Charles District Office , including acceptance of a trip to the 2005 Peach Bowl game that was paid for by an oil and gas company ; illicit drug use ; misuse of government computers ; and inspection report falsification . ”
The latest inquiry into the Minerals Management Service is not the first hard - hitting report to reveal mismanagement by the agency .
MMS is charged with overseeing the nation ’s oil resources and with collecting royalties from oil production firms .
Critics of the agency have said that this dual role often puts the watchdog at a conflict of interest with its purpose of protecting taxpayers .
A 2008 probe found similarly troubling behavior by MMS workers .
Citing what he called a “ culture of substance abuse and promiscuity ” by workers , the Interior ’s Department ’s inspector general found that employees had sex with and took drugs with energy company representatives .
Workers also reportedly enjoyed gifts , ski trips and golf outings paid for by oil giants .
ADVERTISEMENT
In recent weeks , the Obama administration has proposed to split up the MMS into separate watchdog and royalties collection units .
Noted the AP earlier this month : “ One agency would be charged with inspecting oil rigs , investigating oil companies and enforcing safety regulations , while the other would oversee leases for drilling and collection of billions of dollars in royalties .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Currently , the Minerals Management Service , an arm of the Interior Department , is responsible for collecting more than $ 10 billion a year from oil and gas drilling and with enforcing laws and regulations that apply to drilling operations . ”
John King allows Dick Armey to pretend like the Republicans have not already co-opted the Tea Party movement and says they are " grassroots " because they do n't have anyone in charge .
Of course as Karoli pointed out the other day , we already know that 's not true .
And of course let 's not forget Rachel Maddow 's reporting on the topic .

THE regional elections in Italy on March 28th and 29th will , as Silvio Berlusconi has himself said , be of national importance — a big test of the prime minister 's popularity after a troubled 2009 .
On March 20th he called his supporters to a big rally in Rome , but the turnout was disappointing .
The results of the elections may be tight .
So you might expect that the flagship channel of Italy 's public - service broadcaster , RAI , would be offering blanket pre-election coverage on March 26th .
Instead , its only programme will begin at 11.10 pm and last for just five minutes .
Prime time will be given over to two quiz shows and a talent contest .
RAI 's other two channels , along with the three private ones run by the prime minister 's Mediaset group , will also be bereft of election comment and analysis .
You 'd never guess there 's an election on
Nothing better illustrates Mr Berlusconi 's grip on Italy 's media .
In a country with low newspaper readership and internet penetration , the main source of political information is terrestrial television .
With three of the four main private channels controlled by the prime minister and two of its three state - run channels toeing a government line , news bulletins are bland at best .
The editor of RAI 1's news , Augusto Minzolini , openly broadcasts pro-government editorials .
When an English lawyer , David Mills , who was convicted of taking a bribe from Mr Berlusconi , escaped imprisonment because of the statute of limitations , RAI 1's news said wrongly that he had been acquitted .
This makes political talk shows more important .
Although equal airtime legislation was introduced in 2000 to avoid bias , Italy 's media watchdog , Agcom , decided last month that the best way of all to guarantee balance was to ban talk shows during the campaign .
This decision might be dismissed as misplaced punctiliousness were it not for evidence that Agcom has been subject to pressure from Mr Berlusconi .
Police looking into loan - sharking came across a conversation between the prime minister and an Agcom board member , in which Mr Berlusconi had allegedly demanded that it shut down “ Annozero ” , a hostile talk show .
The board member reportedly offered help from officials in preparing a formal complaint .
At the request of the fourth private terrestrial channel and of Rupert Murdoch 's Sky satellite network , a court has overturned Agcom 's decision .
But neither Mediaset nor RAI has reinstated the talk shows .
The daily Corriere della Sera is trying to fill the void by hiring a noted TV journalist to present a programme on its website .
The team from “ Annozero ” is mounting a web - only show in Bologna .
But the web is a poor substitute .
The blackout silenced Mr Berlusconi as well .
Until March 23rd , that is , when he intervened by phone in a popular RAI breakfast TV programme and aired his views — without contradiction .
Out from the shadows , the purplish - black insect - like crawlers advanced toward us .
The clicking of sharp claws punctuated each step .
I watched them emerge in complete disbelief .
They were huge , nearly two meters in length .
It was a creeping madness , a nightmare brought to light , slowly crawling across the ceiling .
The ceiling !
My mind seized and I froze .
From behind the team , I watched them swivel their aim from one crawler to another .
Dada turned quickly to glance at me .
Sweat on his brow .
Fear in his eyes .
He turned to Parker .
“ What is this ? ” he whispered , taking a few steps backward .
The rest of the team followed in step .
“ Do n’t know , ” Parker responded brusquely .
You make a wrong turn for us again , Ghia ? ” Parker asked .
Ghia took a side glance in my direction .
She curled her lip .
“ Wrong cargo , is more like it , ” she responded , her Spanish accent giving much more weight to the sneer .
“ He ’s the bait .
Let them have him . ”
“ Hey , hey … ” Dada started .
“ Shut up and keep it together , both of you , ” Parker interrupted .
The sound of clicking claws increased .
More were coming from behind the first wave .
Parker spat .
“ The Director sent a lot of bugs for you , Maxim .
What is going on ? ”
I was fearful but instantly angry .
“ You people brought me down here , ” I responded .
“ And now we ’ll get you out , ” Parker replied hotly .
We backed away with increasing speed , as the crawlers advanced from the darkness .
They had large compound eyes that shone blue - gray in the light .
Chattering mouths opened wide and snapped closed , showing a tangle of mandibles and fangs .
Three pairs of spindly legs and two twitching antennae preceded each long , segmented body .
“ They ’ll eat us alive , ” said Ghia , with a slight tremble to her voice .
“ He ’s going to get us killed . ”
“ I do n’t need this bullshit , Ghia .
Not today , ” Parker replied , harshly .
He snapped his fingers and pointed everyone back down the passageway .
“ All of you keep moving back .
Let them follow us .
I want them all out in the light .
Pili , you ’re in front . ”
“ You got it , boss , ” replied the big man , as he moved his big frame front and center .
The bugs kept coming .
All eyes watch their movement .
One bug at the front of the pack dropped from the ceiling and began to scurry across the floor toward Pili .
The bug stopped only a few meters away from Pili ’s massive form .
It raised its head .
It looked at us and began shrieking .
Pili jumped and fumbled his rifle .
“ Shit !
Let ‘em have it ! ”
Parker shouted and all four of the insurgents let loose with their weapons .
Pili and Dada shot first , piercing the insect - like body with a volley of flechette rounds .
The close - knit passageway was filled with the airy pop pop sound of gas - propelled flechettes .
The crawlers screeched and began writhing on the floor as the flechette venom attacked their nervous system .
The crawlers behind the first wave advanced more quickly , chattering excitedly , jumping and hissing .
We hurried backward , tripping over refuse and cursing .
The rifles aimed and fired rapidly .
Parker stumbled and fell .
A crawler jumped for him .
Parker screamed .
“ Vete al carajo ! ” Ghia shouted , stepping between Parker and the bug and firing her high - power EMD pulse rifle into the body of the insect at close range .
There was a loud crackle .
The fried creature convulsed on the floor , all six legs trembling .
“ What are these things ? ” I shouted to Dada over the screeching and chattering and gunfire .
“ We do n’t know , damn it ! ” he shouted back .
“ Keep moving ! ”
Ghia fired at another crawler on the ceiling .
The discharge from the EMD caught part of the electrical system and burst open part of the ceiling .
The lights flickered .
A storm of dust and sparks rained down on our heads .
I looked up .
More bugs came crawling out of the darkness after us .
The flickering light only added to the horror .
I fell over a pile of waste construction materials .
My foot kicked loose a length of heavy pipe that clattered across the floor .
I scrambled for the pipe .
It was long and sturdy , with a pinched end that came to a point .
I raised it to my shoulder , and took a defensive position .
Dada saw me coming up from behind with the pipe in my hands .
“ Maxim , back off .
Keep running ! ” he shouted .
“ Move your ass , damn it , ” Parker added .
“ Move , move , move ! ”
We retreated from the creeping horrors .
They jumped after us .
Ghia fried another bug with the EMD , punching a scorched hole in its shellback and sending it skittering across the floor .
Smoke rose from the body and filled the air with a burning chemical stink that reminded me of hot bile .
The crawlers advanced relentlessly in quick waves .
They crawled over the refuse , the writhing bodies , and the smoking carcasses strewn across the floor .
One crawler jumped toward Ghia , opened its mouth and spat out a stringy brown liquid .
Ghia dove to the side to avoid the stream but the spittle caught her across the legs and stuck to her , sending her tumbling to the floor .
“ Mierda ! ” Ghia shouted , shaking herself off and scrambling to get to her feet .
“ Damn it , Ghia , what are you doing ! ” Parker shouted , pulling her up and dragging her back by the collar .
“ Come on ! ”
“ Get your hands off of me , pendejo ! ” Ghia spat back .
“ Then move your shit , Ghia ! ”
Parker released her with a toss and Ghia made a stumbling return to a running retreat .
“ You gotta run , people ! ” shouted Parker .
As we ran , the flechettes continued to fly .
The EMD blasts filled the air with the smell of scorched bugs , electricity , and choking dust .
I kept low to avoid fragments of concrete and metal that burst forth from the walls and ceiling .
One of the bugs shot past the line , with five or six flechettes stuck through its shell .
Pili stood his ground with the creature , reaching out with one of his huge hands and swiping it down from above .
The crawler landed on the big man , hissing and thrashing .
He fell back , with a loud groan , struggling with the huge creature .
It bit into his arm with its mandibles and tore at his legs with hind claws .
“ Get off , me ! ” Pili grunted , as he swung around and threw the thrashing creature to the floor between the two of us .
The bug jumped to its feet , raised its head , hissed , and made a leap for me .
The pipe I was carrying came down with a vicious swing , connecting with the head with a loud ping and breaking it free of the thorax .
A spray of noxious yellow fluid burst into the air and sprayed Parker .
“ Damn it , Maxim ! ” Parker bellowed , wiping the vile yellow fluid from his face .
He reached out and gave me a shove .
“ Move your ass , spaceman !
I ’m not gonna tell you again ! ”
Dada grabbed my arm and pulled me free of Parker ’s reach , screaming .
“ Get back through the passageway , Maxim .
Get to cover .
Go! Now ! ”
I looked at Ghia , running along at a wounded pace , covered in sticky spittle .
Parker was shooting with almost reckless abandon .
Pili was battering bugs off the ceiling .
Dada saw my hesitation , gave me a series of forceful shoves , shouting at me to run .
That was enough .
I turned and ran back down the passageway , as they continued to shoot and shout behind me .
I held the heavy bar tightly in both hands , ready for anything that was waiting around the corners .
My legs quickly found their full stride and my heart pounded .
Faster and faster I ran , until I was sliding around the corners and leaping over debris .
Back through the maze of passageways and cut - throughs , I went .
I made my way quickly , remembering how we had come before .
Soon I was far ahead of the action and could hear no more of the battle behind me .
In my head , I counted back the turns .
Soon , the doorway I saw on the initial trip down loomed ahead .
It was a short run of steps , maybe fifteen or twenty .
I took them in leaps .
I stopped at the door , panting .
I had no idea how deep I was .
I put my ear against the surface and listened .
No sound came from beyond .
It was too thick .
I grasped the latch and pushed .
No movement .
I pushed harder .
Nothing .
I dropped the bar to the stairs with a loud clang , leaned back and hit the door hard with my shoulder .
I burst through the doorway into the freezing open air and tumbled out into the snow and ice .
Bellingshausen .
I was in the city streets .
Snow and howling wind blew fierce and stung my eyes .
I gasped and the chilly air filled my lungs .
With a snap , I turned back and watched as the exit door slammed shut in the wind .
There was no latch on the outside .

Video of confrontation after U - Md. basketball game shows police beating
The Prince George 's County prosecutors have dropped charges against two University of Maryland students they claimed struck mounted Park Police officers and their horses after a basketball game in March .
A video shot by another student , meanwhile , shows police beating one of those students without apparent provocation .
On Monday , a county prosecutor dropped charges against John J. McKenna , 19 .
Charges against Benjamin C. Donat , also 19 , were dropped on Friday .
The videotape was released to some media outlets by the law firm representing the students Monday .
The incident occurred near the University ’s College Park campus on March 3 after Maryland ’s men ’s basketball team defeated Duke .
After the game , students took to the streets to celebrate .
Twenty eight people were arrested or cited , sparking an intense debate between police and students over how and when it is appropriate to break up a group of revelers .
Your Browser DoesNot Support IFrames .
Segments of the incident with McKenna were captured on video by another student .
The video , which lasts approximately one minute , consists of one continuous shot .
It is not known what happened immediately before or after the video started .
The video does not show Donat interacting with police , even though police said in court documents that the two acted together .
The video shows about two dozen students milling about on Knox Road near Route 1 .
About a half - dozen of them are pointing their cellphone cameras at riot police who are gathered between the students and Route 1 .
The video shows McKenna on the sidewalk as he skips and throws his arms in the air .
He stops about five feet from an officer on horseback , the video shows .
In the video , McKenna ’s arms appear to be in front of him , but he does not appear to touch the officer or the horse .
His hands , the video shows , are empty .
Two county police riot officers move toward McKenna , who backs up , the video shows .
The officers rush in and strike McKenna with their batons , the video shows ; McKenna is slammed against a wall and he crumples to the ground .
As McKenna is falling , a third county police riot officer strikes his legs and torso with his baton .
The video shows the officers striking an unresisting McKenna about the head , torso , and legs .
Because they are wearing riot gear , the officers who hit McKenna are not immediately identifiable .
In the video , county police officers and officers on horseback from the Maryland - National Capital Park Police are seen nearby .
They do not appear to intervene .
The officers form a line and move toward the students who had been milling about , the video shows , and the students move back .
Maj .
Andy Ellis , a county police spokesman , said police could not comment until they had viewed the video .
Maryland - National Capital Park Police did not immediately return phone calls .
Charging documents sworn out by county police Officer Sean McAleavey alleged that McKenna and Donat were running and screaming in the middle of Route 1 , prompting an unruly crowd to form .
As two officers on horseback from the Maryland - National Capital Park Police attempted to regain order , McKenna and Donat “ struck those officers and their horses causing minor injuries , ” McAleavey wrote .
McKenna and Donat “ were both kicked by the horses and sustained minor injuries , ” the charging document alleged .
Donat , however , is not in the video and does not appear to be nearby .
A private investigator hired by the teenagers ’ lawyer said Donat was injured by police about a block away from where McKenna was beaten .
The lawyer said the two do not know each other .
Christopher A. Griffiths , the lawyer , said that a prosecutor told him on Friday that charges were dropped against Donat because officers could not identify him .
The charges against McKenna were dropped Monday without comment , Griffiths said .

I ’m sure many of you read the NYT article about the 26 - year - old college grad with almost $ 100,000 in student loans .
The article was fascinating and horrifying , but it did n’t mention a key factor–since the girl in the article graduated in 2005 , the real wages of college grads without an advanced degree have fallen substantially .
Take a look at this chart .
I ’ve plotted median usual weekly earnings of fulltime workers , adjusted for inflation , and indexed to 2001Q1 =1 .
The dark blue line shows the weekly wages of workers with an advanced degree , while the lighter line shows weekly wages of workers with a bachelor ’s degree only .
The real wages for college grads with a bachelor ’s have been in a downswing since 2004 .
That offers at least a partial explanation of her problems … she got caught by a weakening labor market for bachelor ’s degrees .
To put it another way –college grads who are clothed with the protection of an advanced degree have on average managed to hold their own during the financial crisis , and even gain ground .
Since mid-2007 , their usual weekly wages are up by 3.7 % in real terms , putting them at their highest level for the past ten years .
‘ Naked ’ college grads –that is , those without advanced degrees–have not fared nearly so well during the recession .
Their real weekly earnings are down 0.7 % since mid-2007 , and they are well below their 2004 level .
Is this simply supply and demand , a function of which industries were hit , or is there something else going on ?
The Wisconsin State Journal reports that a Juneau County [ WI ]
District Attorney Scott Southworth has sent a letter to local school districts that they could face arrest and jail if they teach the state ’s newly created sex ed curriculum that requires students to learn about birth control and avoiding sexually transmitted diseases on the grounds that they will be contributing to the delinquency of minors :
A Wisconsin prosecutor is warning that teachers who teach the state ’s new sex education curriculum could be arrested and charged with contributing to the delinquency of children .
Juneau County District Attorney Scott Southworth told the Wisconsin State Journal that the state ’s sex education law , which was signed by Gov. Jim Doyle in February , is a “ sick and shameful piece of legislation ” that encourages illegal sex among minors .
And he sent a letter to five school districts urging them to temporarily drop all sex education classes until the Legislature can repeal the law .
“ Forcing our schools to instruct children on how to utilize contraceptives encourages our children to engage in sexual behavior , whether as a victim or an offender , ” Southworth wrote in the March 24 letter .
“ It is akin to teaching children about alcohol use , then instructing them on how to make mixed alcoholic drinks . ”
The new law requires schools that teach sex education to include curriculum about birth control and sexually transmitted diseases as part of comprehensive classes .
But Southworth said it essentially forces school districts to “ instruct children on sex - for - pleasure . ”
And in his letter , he warned the law promotes the sexual assault of children , exposes teachers to possible criminal liability , undermines parental authority , requires districts to condone controversial sexual behavior , gives the contraceptive industry access to school children and may expose districts to civil litigation .
“ This , in turn , will lead to more child sexual assaults , ” he said in the letter .
…
Southworth , a Republican , said teachers will be pushed into “ encouragement and advocacy ” that “ could lead to criminal charges . ”
And he said districts may be forced to teach about homosexuality as well as transgender and transsexual people .
He also said the law will allow “ health care providers ” such as Planned Parenthood to effectively “ market sexually - oriented products to our children . ”
Apparently Stephen Hawking read my book , but not very carefully , because he thinks aliens will come here ala " Independence Day " * and eat up all our resources and move on .
I disagree with him .
I think in fact it ’s more likely that an aggressive alien race would create self - replicating robot probes that will disperse through the galaxy and destroy all life that way .
But more likely still does n’t equate to likely .
I ’ve been thinking about this on and off for a few days , in fact , and I suspect a likely answer to Fermi ’s Paradox — " Where are they ? " — is simply that intelligent life that is capable of interstellar flight does n’t last long enough to colonize other stars .
That would neatly explain why , if stars with planets are common ( which we know is almost certainly true ) , and the conditions for life to arise are relatively common ( again , that seems very likely ) , the galaxy is n’t overrun with life .
It should be by now ; it ’s had billions of years to have space - faring races evolve and colonize the whole shebang .
So in reality , Hawking ’s idea and the one I go over in my book are probably wrong .
But I ’m an optimist , and I can hope that the reason the galaxy is n’t softly humming with life ( that ’s Carl Sagan ’s poetic phrase ) is that we ’re the first , or at least the first in a while .
That would mean we still get our chance .
It ’s a big responsibility , really .
And to be clear , that ’s not snark , even if this post started out a bit snarky .
I ’m serious .
We may be utterly , entirely alone in a galaxy filled with planets that outnumber people on our own planet 50 to 1 .
That idea gives me the creeps more than the idea of hostile aliens bent on sterilizing each of those planets .
But at least it gives us a good chance to spread and see the place a bit .
I ’d like to think that in a hundred generations , this arm of the Milky Way will boast a thousand human planets .
It ’s a nice thought .

The Balanced - Over-Batteries , or B.O.B car is an ingenious contraption developed by Robert Lange , a retired auto mechanic from California .
The B.O.B car was designed following the example of skateboard trucks which use the tilting movement of the board to adjust the angle of the wheels , therefore providing the ability to steer .
The vehicle gets its name from the fact the batteries are slung underneath the single passenger cockpit .
During cornering the batteries act as a counterbalance to the leaning of the vehicle 's passenger compartment - up to 45 degrees in tight turns !
This clever balancing act means that no power steering is needed and the steering wheel can be turned easily from side - to - side with the palm of the hand .
Where possible recycled parts were used in the construction of the B.O.B car .
The front and rear differentials were lifted from 1975 - 76 Pintos , the brakes are courtesy of a Yamaha motorcycle , and the steering mechanism is adapted from a helicopter tail - rotor gearbox .
Each pinto rear - end has 2 computer sync motors with chain drive .
The vehicle has two speeds which can be switched between by changing the voltage from 36 - 72 volts .
Development of the Balanced - Over-Batteries bar took around three years , despite the complicated and unique nature of the vehicle .
Thanks to the use of recycled or reclaimed parts the total cost came in at around $ 500 .
Amazing .

It ’s time for some guitar finger stretching .
Practicing finger stretching exercises for guitar will not only help you develop a better reach , but they will also help you build some strength and independence in your fingers .
Before starting this guitar lesson , I ’m going to give you a warning .
Be careful with these finger stretching exercises !
If over done you will injure yourself .
They should be practiced for very short periods of time .
You should feel a stretch in your hand , but you should not feel pain .
If you feel pain , stop immediately .
With that said , these are 3 very helpful finger stretching exercises for guitar .
I call them “ The Worm ” , “ The Spider ” and “ The Slinky ” .
Once you play them , you will probably get an idea of where the names come from .
Guitar Finger Stretching Exercise # 1 – The Worm
( Video Guitar Lesson 1 of 3 )
Note , the numbers underneath the guitar tablature above indicate the left hand fingers you should use .
With this exercise you are starting high on the neck of the guitar and working your way down .
At first you will probably not get very far .
But over time you will be able to work your way down the neck .
You are going to place all 4 fingers down first .
You are playing chords here , just picking the notes one at a time .
Each different chord shifts only one finger down a fret from the previous chord .
There are 4 different chords in the cycle and then the process will start over again .
You can continue this process all the way down the neck .
Take it slow .
Guitar Finger Stretching Exercise # 2 – The Spider
( Video Guitar Lesson 2 of 3 )
You can do the next exercise on any set of 2 adjacent strings .
Since you are working your way up the neck of the guitar with this one , it actually gets easier .
You could reverse the direction and come back down as well .
So to start with , you are going to play this finger stretching exercise for guitar on the 4th and 3rd strings .
This is the same guitar finger stretching exercise only skipping one string in the middle .
This is more of a stretch .
Here you are skipping 2 strings in the middle .
The more strings you skip , the more the stretch .
Guitar Finger Stretching Exercise # 3 – The Slinky
( Video Guitar Lesson 3 of 3 )
As well as a good guitar finger stretching exercise , this is also a good picking exercise .
Be sure and use strict down and up picking .
This can also be done as a sweep picking exercise .
Again , practice these finger stretching exercises for guitar in small doses .
And soon your fingers will be a limber as a Olympic gymnast 🙂

Install Zoho Webservice in Ubuntu
Zoho Webservice has been in the Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx official repositories for quite some time , but it did n't actually work until yesterday .
You can install it by simply pasting this into a terminal :
sudo apt - get install webservice - office - zoho
If you 're not using Ubuntu 10.04 , you can download Zoho Webservice from HERE - it should work in older Ubuntu versions since it does n't have any dependencies , however please note that I 've only tested it in Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx .
Zoho Webservice package will get a lot more features in Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat .

Idaho Contractor lends hand to homeowners in need Wants to help people in Idaho ’s northern counties Sat. , March 6 , 2010
The Spokesman - Review
NBR Home Services will take nominations for small home projects for residents in Kootenai , Boundary or Bonner counties .
To nominate someone , go to www.nbrhomeservices.com and follow the link .
For more information call ( 208 ) 818-1323 .
Evelyn DeLaughter had n’t laid eyes on the treasures stored above her garage since she moved into her Priest River , Idaho , home in 2006 .
The steep wooden steps leading up to the second - level of the garage were rotten and too dangerous for the 71 - year - old to use .
DeLaughter , a widow who uses a ski pole as a walking stick , could n’t afford the roughly $ 500 it would cost for materials and labor to build new steps , so she put the items — Christmas decorations , sewing materials , and memorabilia — out of her mind .
Until Saturday , when North Idaho contractor Scott Whitman showed up to build her a new set of steps for free .
Whitman , owner of NBR Home Services in Priest River , is donating his time once a month to help North Idaho homeowners finish projects they otherwise would n’t be able to complete because of financial or other constraints .
“ They are angels , ” said DeLaughter .
DeLaughter watched from a lawn chair in her yard off Beardmore Avenue Saturday as Whitman and several volunteers cut lumber and hammered away .
“ For someone to come and do something like this for someone you do n’t even know , it ’s amazing , ” DeLaughter said .
Whitman said he had been watching people come together to aid the victims of the earthquake in Haiti when he came up with the idea to help local residents with unfinished projects .
“ Obviously , I ca n’t go to Haiti , ” Whitman said .
“ So I thought , why not help out the people who need help here at home ? ”
The Kootenai , Boundary and Bonner County region is a depressed area , made worse recently by the downturn in the economy , Whitman said .
For laborers and loggers , it ’s been especially difficult , he said .
“ I know their pain , ” he said .
With the help of friend Jamie Eberle , who owns Northern Sky Marketing , the pair solicited nominations for people in need in a Priest River newspaper .
DeLaughter ’s is their first project .
“ Some of the responses have been really moving , ” Eberle said .
Mostly , it ’s homeowners who already have materials for jobs like replacing flooring or remodeling bathrooms , but do n’t have the money to pay someone to do the job .
Many of the nominees are elderly , and most projects are small .
“ I ’m only going to tackle what I can finish in a day , ” Whitman said .
The plan is to do a project for homeowners in one of the three North Idaho counties once a month .
On Saturday , Whitman received donations for DeLaughter ’s project , including cash from Eberle ’s marketing business , and materials from Stimson Lumber , Home Depot and Sandpoint Building Supply .
Kelly ’s Vay Mart & Hoodoo Creek Cafe provided pizzas for lunch .
“ This is not exactly a wealthy community , ” said Jerry Gordon , and longtime friend of Whitman ’s who volunteered to help .
“ There are a lot of people who need a project taken care of that the just ca n’t afford to do themselves . ”
DeLaughter said after the death of her husband , Jim , in 2004 , she could no longer afford the couple ’s four - bedroom home in Iowa .
Her son found the mobile home for her in Priest River , and she headed west with a grandson .
Her grandson died in a motorcycle accident near Silverwood in 2008 , she said .
Last week another grandson , Michael Jones , 23 , was visiting from Iowa when DeLaughter got the news about her nomination for Whitman ’s services .
“ Just the other day she asked me how much it would cost for them stairs , ” Jones said .
“ The she told me never mind , somebody ’s coming to do it . ”
When she is finally able to get up to her storage area and take the lock off , it “ will be like finding treasures , ” DeLaughter said .
“ There ’s lost of memories up there , ” she said .
“ Sometimes it ’s hard to go through things like that .
There might be some tears . ”

Friends do n't let friends drive drunk be gay .
At least , not if the American College of Pediatricians has anything to do with it .
The splinter group , which broke away from the much larger American Academy of Pediatrics in 2002 after disagreements over homosexual parenting , is urging schools to respond to homosexual tendencies and gender confusion with skepticism and / or reorientation therapy .
In the words of ACP President Thomas Benton :
" If I was aware that my teenage son was thinking about getting drunk and operating a car , I 'd do everything in my power to prevent him from doing that .
. . . [ Schools ] should provide an environment that is safe for all children , but they should n't promote an agenda .
They should n't say , ' Let 's have a coming - out party . ' "
Warns the ACP in a letter to school superintendents last month , just because a kid has homosexual tendencies at 12 does n't mean he or she will turn out gay by 25 ; prematurely labeling teens could steer them " into harmful homosexual behaviors they otherwise would not pursue . "
The ACP makes homosexuality out to be a consequence of peer pressure , but coming out is a huge deal — not something many teens take lightly .
While it 's true that teenagers often engage in same - sex experimentation — sexual urges start to surface around age 10 — most experts agree that sexual orientation can't be altered by therapy .
ADVERTISEMENT
It takes time before a teen fully comes to terms with his or her sexual orientation .
So what should parents do in the meantime ?
Keep an open mind and try not to pass judgment one way or the other .
Says Caitlin Ryan , director of the Family Acceptance Project , " we tell parents and families that they need to provide a supportive environment for their children before they know who they 'll become . "
I 'd say that 's pretty great advice when it comes to — well , pretty much anything .
Except maybe drunk driving .
Abstract Invasive species have tremendous detrimental ecological and economic impacts .
Climate change may exacerbate species invasions across communities if non-native species are better able to respond to climate changes than native species .
Recent evidence indicates that species that respond to climate change by adjusting their phenology ( i.e. , the timing of seasonal activities , such as flowering ) have historically increased in abundance .
The extent to which non-native species success is similarly linked to a favorable climate change response , however , remains untested .
We analyzed a dataset initiated by the conservationist Henry David Thoreau that documents the long - term phenological response of native and non-native plant species over the last 150 years from Concord , Massachusetts ( USA ) .
Our results demonstrate that non-native species , and invasive species in particular , have been far better able to respond to recent climate change by adjusting their flowering time .
This demonstrates that climate change has likely played , and may continue to play , an important role in facilitating non-native species naturalization and invasion at the community level .

Introduction Invasive species have significant negative effects on biodiversity , ecosystem function , agricultural productivity , and human health [ 1 ] .
In the United States alone the estimated annual cost of invasive species exceeds $ 120 billion [ 2 ] .
It has been hypothesized that climate change will exacerbate the impacts of non-native species naturalization and subsequent invasion across communities [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
One important way in which non-native species could respond to climate change is by adjusting their phenology ( i.e. , the timing of seasonal activities , such as flowering time , leaf out time , germination and migration ) [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
Along these lines , the ability of species to appropriately adjust their phenology to climate change has been shown to have a significant impact on species success [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
The extent to which phenological response is also linked to non-native species success , however , has not been examined , despite its potential relevance to conservation and management efforts in the face of continued climate change .
Here , we take advantage of a unique historical dataset from Concord , Massachusetts ( USA ) [ 12 ] to elucidate the role of climate change in shaping the patterns of non-native plant species ' naturalization and invasion ( see Material and Methods ) .
Concord has experienced significant climate change in the last 150 years , during which time the mean annual temperature has increased 2.4 °C [ 12 ] .
The Concord dataset was initiated in 1851 by the American naturalist and conservationist Henry David Thoreau and continued by later observers , including the authors of this paper [ 12 ] .
This dataset permits the calculation of two important phenological response traits : i ) the ability of species to track seasonal temperature variation measured as the correlation between first flowering day and annual spring temperature from 1888 – 1902 ( herein referred to as flowering time tracking ) and ii ) the change in mean first flowering day over two periods : 1851 –2006 and 1900 –2006 ( herein referred to as flowering time shift , see Material and Methods ) .
We distinguished between native and non-native species using the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) PLANTS Database [ 13 ] .
We further distinguished non-native non-invasive and non-native invasive ( i.e. , herein referred to as invasive ) species using the Invasive Plant Atlas of New England [ 14 ] ( for complete definitions of non-native species status see Material and Methods ) .
To account for other factors that could also explain non-native species success , we examined several additional ecologically important traits that have been implicated in non-native species ' naturalization and invasion [ 15 ] , including : habit , plant height at maturity , leaf mass per area , flower diameter , pollination syndrome , and seed weight .
We tested for significant differences in these traits between : i. ) natives and non-natives , ii . ) natives and non-native non-invasives , iii. ) natives and invasives , and iv . ) non-native non-invasives and invasives .
These comparisons were tested using generalized estimating equations ( GEE ) implemented in the R based package APE [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
GEE allow phylogenetic distance matrices to be incorporated into a general linear model framework so as to account for phylogenetic bias and permits the simultaneous analysis of multiple categorical and continuous traits as covariates in the same model [ 17 ] .
Materials and Methods Study Site Concord , Massachusetts , USA ( 42°27′38 ″ N ; 71°20′54 ″ W ) is a township encompassing ∼ 67 km2 .
Although the town has undergone extensive development since the time of Henry David Thoreau ( ∼1850 ) , ∼60 % of Concord remains undeveloped or has been well protected through the efforts of numerous national , state , local , private parks , and land - trusts [ 27 ] .
Species ' Native / Non-Native Status Species ' native and non-native status was obtained from the USDA PLANTS Database [ 13 ] for the 587 species included in our analyses .
Species were scored as ‘ native ’ if they occurred in the continental United States or Canada at the time of Columbus ( ca. 1492 ) and ‘ non-native ’ if they arrived from other regions since that time .
Thirty - one species that were coded ambiguously by the USDA as ‘ native and probably introduced ’ were not included .
When these species were coded as either ‘ non- native ’ or ‘ native ’ the results were not qualitatively different than those presented here .
All non-native species were considered ‘ naturalized ’ because they are thought to be established members of the Concord flora [ 27 ] .
Non-native species were further categorized as ‘ non- native non-invasive ’ and ‘ invasive ’ using the Invasive Plant Atlas of New England ( IPANE ) [ 14 ] .
IPANE defines a non-native species as ‘ invasive ’ if it meets all of the following criteria : 1 ) the species is or has the potential to become naturalized in New England , 2 ) the species is or has the potential to establish in minimally managed habitats , 3 ) the species does or has the potential to disperse rapidly and widely , 4 ) the species does or has the potential to establish large populations in minimally managed habitats , and 5 ) the species is classified as invasive in other areas outside of its native range .
Importantly , our analyses , which include data on change in abundance [ 10 ] , independently corroborate IPANE 's scoring of invasive species status .
Invasive species , as classified by IPANE , have significantly increased in abundance in Concord relative to native and non-native non-invasive species over the past 100 years ( Table S1 ) .
Ecological Trait Data Ecological trait data was collected from multiple sources .
Shift in mean first flowering day ( 1851 –2006 , 1900 –2006 ) , the correlation between flowering time and inter-annual temperature variation from 1888 – 1902 ( i.e. , flowering time tracking ) , and change in abundance were all calculated directly from observations of the Concord community [ 10 ] , [ 12 ] .
Flowering time tracking was calculated as the correlation between first flowering day and mean monthly temperature in January , April , and May .
This aggregate temperature was determined to be the best predictor flowering day in Concord [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
We also obtained several additional ecologically relevant traits that have been implicated in non-native species success , including : leaf mass per area [ 30 ] , plant height at maturity [ 13 ] , seed weight [ 31 ] , habit [ 32 ] , flower diameter [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] , and pollination syndrome [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] .
Habit was coded as a binary trait ( herbaceous vs. woody ) using the Manual of the Vascular Plants of Northeastern United States and Adjacent Canada [ 32 ] .
Pollination syndrome was coded as a binary trait ( i.e. , wind vs. insect pollinated ) using refs [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] .
Binary traits were treated as continuous in our correlation analyses and results should be interpreted as relative proportions .
Leaf mass per area , plant height , seed weight , and flower diameter were log - transformed when necessary to meet the assumptions of normality .
This study focuses on the ability of species to adjust their flowering phenology in response to climate change , an ability that has been shown to have important implications for species success [ 10 ] .
Although poorly understood , a species ' ability to succeed might be linked with flowering time shifting if its fitness was directly dependent on when it flowered .
For example , species that are unable to appropriately adjust their flowering time in response to climate change could suffer from a sudden lack of pollinators [ 22 ] , [ 35 ] .
Alternatively , species ' fitness could be indirectly dependent on flowering time .
For instance , changes in flowering time are generally correlated with the timing of leaf out , a character that is often linked to competitive ability and physiological adaptation [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
A species that starts its growing cycle earlier in warmer years could have a competitive advantage in terms of nutrient acquisition and light availability .
As a result , they may be more likely to complete their life cycle under favorable conditions ( e.g. , before the onset of warm and dry weather during the middle to late summer ) .
Furthermore , a species that is able to leaf out earlier in warmer years could potentially shade out co-occurring species that are not responsive to temperature .
Similarly , a species that puts out its leaves later in cold years might avoid late frosts that could damage its leaves .
Trait Correlations Standard trait correlations may be biased by species relatedness [ 39 ] .
To account for evolutionary history in assessing trait correlations , we used the generalized estimating equations as implemented in APE [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
GEE incorporates a phylogenetic distance matrix into the framework of a general linear model and permits the inclusion of multiple categorical and continuous traits as covariates in the same model [ 17 ] .
This is similar to normal general linear regression in that the β- coefficient describes the direction and magnitude of the difference between groups ( e.g. , the directional difference in shift response between native and non-native species ) .
Our conclusions are drawn here from the results obtained from GEE analysis ( Table S1 ) , but correlation results were similar when using phylogenetic independent contrasts as implemented in the ‘ aotf ’ module in Phylocom [ 40 ] .
Phylogeny Construction
We constructed an initial composite phylogeny of the Concord flora using Phylomatic [ 41 ] and further resolved relationships above the generic level based on the literature .
For complete details of our construction of the phylogeny see Willis et al . [ 10 ] .
Divergence time estimates were calculated using the ‘ bladj ’ function in Phylocom [ 40 ] based on Wikström et al . [ 42 ] .
Sensitivity Analysis Phylogenetic correlations can be biased by branch length estimates and phylogenetic resolution .
We tested the sensitivity of our results to branch length estimates by setting all branch lengths equal to one .
We tested the sensitivity of our results to phylogenetic uncertainty by performing our analyses on a set of 50 phylogenies where all polytomies , above and below the generic level , were randomly resolved using the ‘ multi2di ’ function in APE and ages were re-estimated using the ‘ bladj ’ function in Phylocom .
Regression results were robust to both of these sensitivity analyses ( Table S1 ) .
Multivariate Analyses Including Abundance Data Flowering time shift results remained similar when change in abundance [ 43 ] was included as an independent variable in the models we analyzed ( flowering time shift 1851 – 2006 : Non-native vs Native , β = − 3.61 , SE = 1.02 , t = − 3.54 , p = 0.0007 ; Invasive vs Native , β = 8.28 , SE = 2.67 , t = 3.10 , p = 0.0029 ; Non-native non-invasive vs Native , β = − 4.51 , SE = 1.01 , t = − 4.48 , p<.0001 ; Invasive vs Non-native non-invasive β = 11.30 , SE = 3.81 , t = 2.96 , p = 0.0090 ; flowering time shift 1900 – 2006 : Non-native vs Native , β = − 0.10 , SE = 0.84 , t = − 0.12 , p = 0.9015 ; Invasive vs Native , β = 9.50 , SE = 2.05 , t = 4.64 , p<.0001 ; Non-native , non-invasive vs Native , β = - 1.26 , SE = 0.87 , t = − 1.46 , p = 0.1498 ; Invasive vs Non-native , non-invasive , β = 7.99 , SE = 3.23 , t = 2.47 , p = 0.0216 ) .

The journal Science has published a letter signed by 255 members of the National Academy of Sciences , including 11 Nobel laureates , that pushes back sharply after months of assaults on evidence pointing to a growing and disruptive human influence on the climate and some of the researchers who ’ve done important work on global warming .
The authors specifically criticize some politicians for what the letter calls “ McCarthy - like threats of criminal prosecution against our colleagues on the basis of innuendo and guilt by association . ”
It does n’t name names , but a clear target is Senator James M. Inhofe , the Oklahoma Republican .
Another candidate could be Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II , who has subpoenaed the University of Virginia to obtain information on the work there in 1999 by the climate scientist Michael Mann ( now at Pennsylvania State University ) .
I ’ll shortly be posting a sharp critique of that action by Paul “ Chip ” Knappenberger , who has in the past been a critic of some of Mann ’s work .
Here is the letter ’s take - home point :
Society has two choices : we can ignore the science and hide our heads in the sand and hope we are lucky , or we can act in the public interest to reduce the threat of global climate change quickly and substantively .
The good news is that smart and effective actions are possible .
But delay must not be an option .
The letter has a defensive tone that has n’t served scientists particularly well in the past , but is understandable given the pressures that have been mounting on this field of inquiry .
Just a couple of decades ago , climatology was a quiet arena connected to broader human affairs mainly through maps of planting times for crops .
Now climate research has become entwined with energy policy and the brutal politics of fossil fuels , in which states ’ stances largely are shaped by the presence or absence of coal or industries reliant on coal or oil for profits .
The influence of fossil fuel money on climate science has sometimes reached right into the White House .
At the international level , the climate debate has largely boiled down to economic battles between competitors and between the world ’s rich and poor nations .
The journal also has published an editorial on the scientists ’ letter and the broader issue of polarization around climate research ( subscription required ) .
Written by Brooks Hanson , the deputy editor for physical science , the editorial attempts to cool things down , but also pushes back at the scientific community a bit .
Here ’s an excerpt ( the acronym I.P.C.C. is for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ) :
Two reasons that many people went along with the Obama administration ’s health care reform proposal was that it was purported to extend coverage to the uninsured and would eliminate the ability of insurers to deny coverage ( including rescind existing policies ) for pre-existing conditions .
The latter claim was false ( more on that shortly ) and some gaps have already come to light .
Consider this story from the New York Times , “ Coverage Now for Sick Children ?
Check Fine Print . ”
Here was the sales talk :
Mr. Obama , speaking at a health care rally in northern Virginia on March 19 , said , “ Starting this year , insurance companies will be banned forever from denying coverage to children with pre-existing conditions . ”
Here ’s the reality :
William G. Schiffbauer , a lawyer whose clients include employers and insurance companies , said : “ The fine print differs from the larger political message .
If a company sells insurance , it will have to cover pre-existing conditions for children covered by the policy .
But it does not have to sell to somebody with a pre-existing condition .
And the insurer could increase premiums to cover the additional cost . ” …
But , insurers say , until 2014 , the law does not require them to write insurance at all for the child or the family .
In the language of insurance , the law does not include a “ guaranteed issue ” requirement before then …
Starting in January 2014 , health plans will be required to accept everyone who applies for coverage .
Yves here .
So that means everything is hunky dory starting in 2014 , right ?
Do n’t assume that .
The way pre-existing conditions often come into play now is that a patient has an expensive ailment , and the insurer looks for a way to deny coverage .
So they go through the patient ’s medical history and find something , anything they failed to tell the insurer about , and use that as an excuse to deny coverage .
And it does n’t matter that the condition you failed to report was inconsequential , or that you failed to report it because your doctor diagnosed it late ( for instance , you got Lyme disease before you got a policy , but no one diagnosed it until it was advanced Lyme disease , after you were covered ) .
Why can insurers use these weak excuses to cancel coverage ?
Because they have been able to argue successfully , that these omissions are “ fraud and intentional mispresentation ” .
Guess what ?
The draft bill preserved the “ fraud and misrepresentation ” out , and I have seen nothing to indicate that this language was revised .
The executive director of a 150,000 member nursing organization , which opposed the bill , noted :
Insurers may continue to rescind policies for “ fraud or intentional misrepresentation ” – the main pretext insurance companies now use to cancel coverage .
So when will voters find out the full extent of the bait and switch ?
In 2014 , when Obama hopes to have been voted in for his second term .
Update 3/30/10 : Per reader Nimrod , it looks as if the hue and cry over the poor drafting of the language regarding child coverage has led to a climbdown by the industry .
No openly crossing Obama during his momentary resurgence .
But I am not holding my breath that other ambiguities in the bill will be so readily resolved in the public ’s favor .

The banned weedkiller has desiccated many plants
Police are hunting a saboteur who has killed off floral displays in a North Yorkshire village taking part in this year 's Britain in Bloom competition .
A banned weed killer has been used in a spate of attacks which is believed to be a deliberate attempt to scupper the community 's chances in the contest .
It is estimated it will cost £ 20,000 to dig up the floral displays , remove the chemical and refill the beds .
Les Hutchinson , chairman of Cayton In Bloom , said the village was devastated .
He said : " Why on earth would you devastate the whole village ?
" We raise money to do the work and we just work in the village and do the best we can for the whole environment .
In 30 years of horticulture I 've never come across this sort of deliberate contamination Roger Burnett , Scarborough council
" We enter competitions but what we really want to do is improve our local environment for the community and visitors . "
Over the years the village 's flowers beds and baskets have won numerous awards .
But in the last month , a number of floral displays have been killed off and analysis tests have shown the banned weed killer sodium chlorate has been used .
Mr Hutchinson said he believed the person responsible was someone local who had a grudge rather than young vandals .
" The person who has done this has got knowledge of the products they 've used .
They are very dangerous weed killers , " he said .
Roger Burnett , parks and countryside manager for Scarborough council , said : " In 30 years of horticulture I 've never come across this sort of deliberate contamination in any village or town . "
Mr Burnett said the weed killer had caused scorching and desiccation of the leaves .
He added : " It 's on every bed , on every tub , on every border .
" The trouble is sodium chlorate is such a hazardous chemical that once it's on the ground it tends to stay in the soil for a number of years so we 're wondering what to do and seeking expert advice on how to deal with the problem . "

D- Pad Hero 2 , the sequel to last year 's homebrew music game for the NES , is now out and free to download !
If you missed the original D - Pad Hero , the game is styled after Guitar Hero , with players tapping buttons as notes drop to the bottom of the screen , except it 's played with a traditional control pad instead of an instrument controller .
This follow - up promises 50 percent more tracks , three difficulty levels , new 3D - style visuals , song challenges , power - ups ( e.g. POW blocks ) , multiple endings , and co-op / versus two - player modes .
The new music includes Queen 's " I Want To Break Free " , Megadeth 's " Countdown to Extinction " , Led Zeppelin 's " The Ocean " , Elvis Presley 's " Burning Love " , and many others .
You can play the D - Pad Hero 2's ROM in the emulator of your choice ( or on an NES if you have the right equipment ) , but the game 's developers highly suggest using an actual controller instead of your keyboard to play the game .
You can check out another song playthrough after the break :

President Barack Obama has said the biggest threat to US security is the possibility of a terrorist organisation obtaining a nuclear weapon .
Speaking on the eve of a nuclear security summit in Washington , he said leaders from 40 states should focus on how to secure nuclear material .
He said groups like al - Qaeda would not hesitate to use nuclear devices .
Neither North Korea nor Iran , two states with disputed nuclear ambitions , have been invited to the summit .
The two countries are viewed by the US as violators of the non-proliferation agreement .
Syria was also left off the invitation list because the US believes Damascus has nuclear ambitions , the Associated Press news agency notes .
But the leaders of nuclear states like India , China and Pakistan are among those coming to Washington for the biggest gathering of world leaders in the US capital in decades , says the BBC's Mark Mardell .
While the issue of what to do about Iran 's nuclear ambitions is not on the agenda , it will be at the centre of many discussions , our North America editor adds .
' South African example ' Leaders or other representatives of 47 states are attending the summit .
This is an unprecedented gathering - Mr Obama will hope for an unprecedented outcome
Jonathan Marcus
BBC diplomatic correspondent
Obama 's ambitious summit Could terrorists get the bomb ?
" The single biggest threat to US security , both short - term , medium - term and long - term , would be the possibility of a terrorist organisation obtaining a nuclear weapon , " Mr Obama said .
" This is something that could change the security landscape in this country and around the world for years to come .
" If there was ever a detonation in New York City , or London , or Johannesburg , the ramifications economically , politically and from a security perspective would be devastating . "
Mr Obama praised South Africa for being the first country to abandon a nuclear weapons programme .
South Africa had , he said , acquired special standing as a " moral leader " for voluntarily dismantling its nuclear programme in the 1990s , He thanked its President , Jacob Zuma , for the leadership his government had shown on non-proliferation .
Israel is being represented at the summit only by a deputy prime minister amid reports that its government is worried that Turkey and Egypt might use the occasion to raise the issue of its nuclear arsenal .
Last Thursday , President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty reducing each country 's deployed nuclear arsenal to 1,550 weapons .
Earlier in the week , Mr Obama approved a new nuclear policy for the United States , saying he planned to cut the nuclear arsenal , refrain from nuclear tests and not use nuclear weapons against countries that did not have them .

Many have commented that , in an ideal world , this may have been the final of the competition .
Barcelona and Inter are generally considered to be the strongest two sides left in the Champions League – and of course , they are also the only two actual champions left .
For the tactical enthusiast , however , a two - legged tie between the two most interesting sides in the competition is a more exciting prospect than a one - off game .
It pits Jose Mourinho – often considered the master tactician – against Pep Guardiola , who in just two seasons has demonstrated that he , too , is a very difficult manager to outwit .
Of course , this is not the first meeting between the sides this season – they were drawn together in the group stage , producing a 0 - 0 at the San Siro , before Barca triumphed 2 - 0 at the Nou Camp , with a Pique goal from a corner and a glorious move finished by Pedro .
The goals from that game :
Mourinho was surprisingly gracious after the defeat at the Nou Camp , saying :
“ Barcelona are a squad of players who play genuinely well … they play a high intensity game ; they press high and very quickly .
And when they have the ball they use it with high - speed passing .
That is a really speciality .
It is easy to say that they are a better team than we are . ”
Whilst a repeat of those two scorelines would not be a major surprise , it is perhaps difficult to read too much into those games – the first was the first game of the tournament and was tight , cagey and generally quite dull – the second was played without the two key players on either side – Lionel Messi and Wesley Sneijder – whilst Zlatan Ibrahimovic was also injured .
It ’s also interesting to note that both teams have changed their primary formation since their meeting in November .
Inter started the season with a 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 shape that saw Sneijder playing ahead of a solid midfield trio ( Dejan Stankovic replaced him for that game ) , whilst Barca were playing with the flexible 4 - 3 - 3 that they won last season ’s Champions League with .
Now , Inter switch between the 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 and a 4 - 3 - 3 , or 4 - 2 - 1 - 3 , that sees Sneijder deeper in midfield , and two forwards ( generally Samuel Eto ’o and Goran Pandev ) on the wings – and have favoured the latter in recent weeks .
Barcelona have had a similar journey – experimenting with a strange 4 - 2 - 4ish formation before recently installing it as their main shape , with it working excellently against Arsenal in the last round .
It would be a surprise if Inter did n’t go with the 4 - 2 - 1 - 3 for this game .
Against Barcelona it is vital to occupy the opposition full - backs – especially Dani Alves at right - back , and Barcelona dominated the game at the Nou Camp partly because Alves and Abidal were able to come forward into midfield and help Barca retain possession .
Eto ’o has generally been used in a wide role in recent weeks , and he could be used on the right - hand side to try and replicate the role Theo Walcott played against Barcelona – staying wide and running at pace .
Pandev has been the first - choice player on the left - hand side but has been out of form recently , and Mourinho could go for a more defensive option on the left side of midfield – Dejan Stankovic can do a job there , or Mourinho may go further and play Javier Zanetti or even Christian Chivu on the left of midfield .
There has been speculation Maicon could play in midfield – he did well there in the cup against Fiorentina – but it seems unlikely given Barca ’s main threat is from the right , not the left .
Sneijder will play in the No 10 role and look to occupy Busquets , whose passing against Arsenal was excellent , with Esteban Cambisso joined by Zanetti ( unless he is deployed elsewhere ) or Barcelona youth product , Thiago Motta .
The key to nullifying Barcelona is surely to stop Xavi playing – Arsenal failed to do so and lost , Real Madrid failed to do so and lost – but Mourinho will not make the same mistake .
Motta may be given the job of tracking him .
Barcelona ’s selection dilemmas start from the front .
Zlatan Ibrahimovic would love to get another run out back at the San Siro , but he has only played eight minutes ( in Barcelona ’s weekend draw at Espanyol ) of football since his two goals at the Emirates , and he may not be 100 % fit .
Barcelona might be better off playing without Ibrahimovic .
Opinions remain divided on the enigmatic Swede , but even his admirers admit that he forces Barcelona to play in a slightly different way – he is less mobile than other forwards in the side , and is plays more of a traditional striking role than Pedro , his most natural replacement .
Inter ’s centre - backs – Lucio and Walter Samuel – are utterly dominant in the air but prone to small , quick , tricky players .
They marked Didier Drogba out of the game both home and away against Chelsea , and recently against Fiorentina faced more problems against the youthful energy of Keirrison than the strength and aerial presence of Gilardino .
Ibrahimovic is far from a one - dimensional player , but Guardiola may decide that a line - up without him might be the best way to get at Inter – really testing the ageing centre - backs by playing no out - and - out striker .
It would make sense for Barcelona to play a team similar to the one against Real Madrid in the second half , where Maxwell was pushed into a left - sided midfield position to track the runs of Sergio Ramos – here , he could do the same against Maicon , with Eric Abidal behind him .
Guardiola could consider bringing in Gabriel Milito to mark his brother Diego , and play Puyol at left - back .
Almost an entire preview without mentioning Messi – how do you stop him ?
Man mark ?
Double mark ?
Mourinho ’s theory will be fascinating .
His experiment with an ultra - defensive 5 - 4 - 1 formation once Inter had taken a 0 - 1 lead over Fiorentina in the cup was also interesting – would he try something similar if Inter go ahead ?
A near - impossible task to try and predict the line - ups , but that ’s what makes the game so fascinating – in Mourinho and Guardiola we have two tactical chameleons who are happy to adapt their shape according to the opposition .
We might be set for a footballing chicken game .

The authors of Effective Perl Programming offer tips for working with files and filehandles .

It 's easy to work with files in Perl .
Its heritage includes some of the most powerful utilities for processing data , so it has the tools it needs to examine the files that contain those data and to easily read the data and write them again .
Perl 's strength goes beyond mere files , though .
You probably think of files as things on your disk with nice icons .
However , Perl can apply its file - handle interface to almost anything .
You can use the filehandle interface to do most of the heavy lifting for you .
You can also store filehandles in scalar variables , and select which one you want to use later .
Item 51 .
Do n't ignore the file test operators .
One of the more frequently heard questions from newly minted Perl programmers is , " How do I find the size of a file ? "
Invariably , another newly minted Perler will give a wordy answer that works , but requires quite a bit of typing :
my ( $ dev , $ino , $ mode , $ nlink , $uid , $ gid , $rdev , $ size , $ atime , $ mtime , $ ctime , $ blksize , $ blocks ) = stat ( $ filename ) ;
Or , perhaps they know how to avoid the extra variables that they do n't want , so they use a slice ( Item 9 ) :
my ( $ size ) = ( stat $ filename ) [ 7 ] ;
When you are working this hard to get something that should be common , stop to think for a moment .
Perl is specifically designed to make the common things easy , so this should be really easy .
And indeed , it is if you use the -s file test operator , which tells you the file size in bytes :
my $ size = -s $ filename ;
Many people overlook Perl 's file test operators .
Maybe they are old C programmers , maybe they 've seen only the programs that other people write , or they just do n't trust them .
This is a shame ; they are succinct and efficient , and tend to be more readable than equivalent constructs written using the stat operator .
Curiously , the file test operators are the first functions listed in perlfunc , because they are under the literal - X .
If you want to read about them , you tell perldoc to give you the function named - X :
% perldoc -f -X
File tests fit into loops and conditions very well .
Here , for example , is a list of the text files in a directory .
The - T file test decides if the contents are text by sampling part of the file and guessing .
Almost all file tests use $ _ by default :
my @textfiles = grep { - T } glob " $ dir_name / * " ;
The -M and - A file tests return the modification and access times of the file , but in days relative to the start of the program .
That is ,
Perl takes the time the program was started , subtracts the time the file was modified or accessed , and gives you back the result in days .
Positive values are in the past , and negative values indicate times after the start of the program .
That seems really odd , but it makes it easy to measure age in terms a human can understand .
If you want to find the files that have n't been modified in the past seven days , you look for a - M value that is greater than 7 :
my $ old_files = grep { - M > 7 } glob '*';
If you want to find the files modified after your program started , you look for negative values .
In this example , if -M returns something less than zero , map gives an anonymous array that has the name of the file and the modification age in days ; otherwise , it gives the empty list :
my @new_files = map { - M < 0 ? [ $ _ , - M ] : ( ) } glob '*';
Reusing work
If you want to find all of the files owned by the user running the program that are executable , you can combine the file tests in a grep :
my @my_executables = grep { -o and -x } glob '*';
The file test operators actually do the stat call for you , figure out the answer , and give it back to you .
Each time you run a file test , Perl does another stat .
In the last example , Perl did two stat s on $ _ .
If you want to use another file test operator on the same file , you can use the virtual _ filehandle ( the single underscore ) .
It tells the file test operator to not call stat and instead reuse the information from the last file test or stat .
Simply put the _ after the file test you want .
Now you call only one stat for each item in the list :
my @my_executables = grep { -o and - x _ } glob '*';
Stacked file tests
Starting with Perl 5.10 , you can stack file test operators .
That is , you test the same file or filehandle for several properties at the same time .
For instance , if you want to check that a file is both readable and writable by the current user , you list the -r and - w file tests before the file :
use 5.010 ; if ( - r -w $ file ) { print " File is readable and writable
" ; }
There 's nothing especially magic about this , since it 's a syntactic shortcut for doing each operation independently .
Notice that the equivalent long form does the test closest to the file first :
if ( -w $ file and -r $ file ) { print " File is readable and writable
" ; }
Rewriting the example from the previous section , you 'd have :
my @my_executables = grep { - o -x } glob '*';
Things to remember
Rick Spielman , the Vikings vice president of personnel , detailed the way the franchise worked this year 's NFL draft , saying the team started off by looking at taking the best player available while at the same time looking to fill whatever needs it had .
" We followed our draft board like we normally have , and as best players came down , we tried to fill needs as well , " Spielman said .
" I know the first part , to get the corner [ Virginia 's Chris Cook ] by moving back in the second round , and then having enough ammunition to come up and get [ Stanford 's ]
Toby Gerhart , who we thought is a very good running back and is going to be a great running back for us teamed up with Adrian Peterson .
" Then in the [ third ] day , [ Southern California defensive end ] Everson Griffen , for him to be there in the fourth round , when we had a lot higher grades on him , I think most people did , and feeling very comfortable after spending some time with him , that he 's the type of football player we want here . "
Spielman said the difference between this year from last is the team had eight draft choices compared to only five in 2009 .
Because the team had fewer draft picks a year ago , Spielman said the team was more aggressive in signing players from its draft board that did not get selected .
He added : " This year , because we had more picks -- we had two picks in the fifth , we had a pick in the sixth , and two picks in the seventh -- a lot of those guys now , we had an opportunity to get some later guys and draft them later , because we had more picks down there .
We did n't need as many college free agents as we did in the past .
Kind of the theme was in the last couple rounds was to get very good football players . "
Will switch positions
Will switch positions
The Vikings did something different than other years when they drafted a couple of players in the later rounds with the intention of having them play a different position than they did in college .
" Like the quarterback at UAB , Joe Webb was such a phenomenal athlete , he reminds you a little bit -- I 'm not going to put him in that class , yet -- but a little bit like when [ Cleveland All - Pro returner ]
Josh Cribbs came out of [ Kent State ] as a quarterback , " Spielman said .
" You 've got this kid [ Webb ] down at the Senior Bowl , he played some receiver .
You see this kid that 's over 6 - 2 , he 's almost 225 pounds , and he has great leaping ability and his hand - eye coordination was unbelievable when you 're watching him catch the ball .
Now , is he raw ?
Yes .
Does he have to learn how to run routes ?
Yeah , he has to learn how , and learn all the nuances of that position .
" But he has the athletic skills to potentially develop , and I have a lot of faith in our coaching staff and coach [ Brad ]
Childress , because those guys do a great job bringing these young guys along . "
Spielman had good contacts with the Rutgers coaching staff , and he was convinced Ryan D'Imperio , who played linebacker for the Scarlet Knights , could play fullback in the NFL .
" D'Imperio , the kid we took from Rutgers , was actually a very good high school fullback , " Spielman said .
" They moved him to linebacker when he was at Rutgers .
I 'm very close with Greg Schiano , the head coach there .
He and I had worked together when I was with the Bears .
He said he had no doubt about this kid can [ move ] back over to fullback .
So , again , we 'll see where these guys are when they come in , but we 've got some exciting athletes to try to develop . "
In rating the Vikings ' picks , the website nflmocks.com gave the team an A for the fourth - round selection of Griffen , saying the Vikings got a first - round talent in the fourth round and adding , " Griffen gives some insurance if Ray Edwards holds out this year . "
As a team , the Vikings got a C - plus for their draft from the website , the same as the Packers and Bears , with the Lions getting a B .
Like always , time will tell how good this draft will be .
Last year 's draft was so good , the fans are going to be spoiled if this one turns out to be as good .
Jottings Jottings Robert Bruininks would have to be one of the school presidents to vote in favor of the Big Ten expansion .
The University of Minnesota president said that at this point , there has n't been any serious discussion among school presidents about expansion .
BUYER BEWARE !!
Blackpaw Innovations is a FRAUD !!
For anyone considering this product , please reconsider .
Mike Phillips , the owner of Blackpaw Innovations , stole my money .
This is business is a complete scam !!
I ordered and paid for one of these units on March 12th .
Mike told me it would ship in 10 business days .
I never got my tracking information , so I tried calling Mike , and calling Mike , and calling Mike .
Finally , he responded to a message I left on his website and told me that it had been shipped , but he was out of town on vacation and would have to send me the tracking number when he got back .
He never did and my tire carrier never showed up .
I then started a second wave of emails , phone calls , text messages , website comments , etc. to try and find out what the deal was .
Finally , Mike responded and told me that it had shipped .
AGAIN !!
Guess what , still no tracking number !
At that point he pretty much cut off any communication we had .
Weeks went by and I 've tried numerous times to get my money refunded in which Mike lied to me many more times telling me he would send my money back .
He has gone so far as to tell me my paypal refund was " in progress " .
I 'm pretty familiar with paypal and the process pretty much consists of entering the amount you want to send somebody and hitting the button .
Since the latest lies , Mike will not respond AT ALL .
If you know anyone considering one of these units , please direct them to this post .
Anyone who needs further evidence , I 've got saved copies of everything sent back and forth and would be more than happy to share it .
Thank you for reading this and please link it to any and all offroad forums you may be affiliated with .

Oxford used to have a great range of bookshops , not surprisingly for a university town , but they have been steadily closing .
Here are the ones that are left .
The Last Bookshop
This is a mix of secondhand books and new ones - the latter are £ 3 ( up from £ 2 in summer 2014 ) .
Unlike most such discount bookshops , however , the stock - remainders and returns - is disproportionately taken from literary and specialist publishers , resulting in a high concentration of literature , academic works , and so forth .
Notable finds here ( or in older incarnations of the shop ) include novels by Wolfgang Koeppen , W.F. Hermans , and Gert Ledig .
Mostly they have stacks of the same title , but they have occasional " one off " titles - a nice hardcover copy of Elias Khoury 's Yalo , for example , and a hardcover copy of Menezes and Mendeiro 's An Introduction to Auction Theory .
Book Stop
A reincarnation of the old Last Bookshop .
A discount shop , with most books £ 3 to £ 5 .
Blackwells
This is Oxford 's best known bookshop .
Spread over four levels - and three shops , with a separate Art / Poster on the other side of Broad St and a shop in the Westgate shoping centre - Blackwells has a great academic and specialist range .
It 's also spaciously laid out , with armchairs for reading scattered throughout , and has a Cafe Nero attached to it .
( For Sydney - siders , Blackwells has as many books ( 100000 + ) as Abbeys ( 55000 ) and Gleebooks (? ) combined , but in at least twice the space . )
There are plenty of 3 - for - 2 offers , even 2 - for - 1 classics , but also a few shelves of sale books : my finds here include Ancient Sukhothai for £ 1 and Israel 's History and the History of Israel for £ 10 .
Upstairs is a small antiquarian and secondhand section .
Waterstones
The Oxford Waterstones has a good range of books , spread over several floors , and a nice layout , with show tables highlighting themes e.g. literature in translation , first novels .
There 's a Costa 's Coffee attached .
Waterstones is much better than any of the Australian chain bookstores ( such as Dymocks or Angus and Robertsons ) .
Oxfam Bookshops
The specialist Oxfam bookshops on St Giles and Turl St are both excellent .
The people running them know how much books are worth , though , so real bargains are hard to come by .
Charity Shops
Most of the charity shops - and Oxford has many - have a bookshelf or two of books .
On Cowley Rd , the Oxfam shop gets some nice books in .
I picked up one of the Clay Sanskrit Library volumes , the Gitagovinda , for £ 2 here .
And the Age UK shop is decently curated .
The Barnardos and Helen & Douglas House shops seem to collect less interesting books .
The Oxford University Press Bookshop
The OUP bookshop is always something of a disappointment .
There are some excellent books , albeit rather expensive , but it 's all a bit staid .
Given the prices , it 's hard to justify not just going to Amazon for OUP books .
St Philip 's Books
St Philips 's specialises in theology and church history , but also has some general history .
It 's a bit cramped and not that much fun to browse in , so I do n't visit that often .
The web site is easy to use , however .
Antiques on High
The front is dedicated to antiques , but the back rooms have quite a decent stock of books , mostly antiquarian / collectible .
St Andrews
A Christian bookshop .
Others
What have I missed ?
And no , WH Smith does n't count as a bookshop !
Closed
Borders , the Inner Bookshop , Barefoot Books , Paradise Books , the Albion Beatnik , the Book House , ...

Some 15 per cent of voters asked by ICM to name the most important issue in the campaign chose immigration .
It trailed only the economy ( 32 per cent ) and was ahead of the NHS ( 14 per cent ) , education ( 10 per cent ) , tax and public services ( nine per cent ) , and crime ( four per cent ) .

The Israeli military attacked a Gaza - bound aid flotilla , leaving at least nine dead , after receiving reports that the fleet had links to al Qaeda , the Israeli ambassador to Denmark said Monday .
" Before the flotilla entered Israeli waters , rumor had it that the organizers [ of the aid initiative ] had links with the al Qaeda terrorist network , " Arthur Avnon was quoted as saying on the website of public broadcaster DR .
" The people on board were not so innocent ... and I cannot imagine that another country would react any differently , " the ambassador said before being summoned to the Danish foreign ministry to explain the attack .
Meanwhile , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s office said he spoke Monday to top diplomatic and security officials by telephone from Canada and voiced his “ full backing ” for the military .
Before the ships set sail from waters off the east Mediterranean island of Cyprus on Sunday , Israel had urged the flotilla not to try to breach the blockade and offered to transfer the cargo to Gaza from an Israeli port , following a security inspection .
Commandos stormed the six ships carrying hundreds of pro-Palestinian activists on an aid mission to the blockaded Gaza Strip .
At least nine people were killed and dozens wounded after Israeli soldiers encountered an unexpected resistance when they boarded the vessels .
According to Netanyahu , the Israeli soldiers were attacked and defending themselves in the raid .
SLIDESHOW : World Responds to Israeli Gaza Flotilla Attack
Avnon echoed Netanyahu ’s sentiments , lamenting the loss of life but saying , " the [ Israeli ] soldiers were welcomed with violence when they climbed on board .
One of them was injured in the stomach and others were injured with baseball bats . "
An Israeli military spokesman said two guns had been discovered on the ships and Israel 's military chief , General Gaby Ashkenazi , blamed the violence on Turkish nongovernmental organization ( NGO ) IHH , which he characterized as " extremist . "
Israel 's Channel 10 television and Al - Jazeera both reported 19 dead , but the Israeli channel later revised that number down to nine .
The Gaza branch of IHH put the death toll at 15 , saying most of them were Turkish nationals .
The Israeli military said seven soldiers were wounded , one of them seriously .
The operation in international waters off the Gaza coast was a nightmare scenario for Israel that looked certain to further damage its international standing , strain already tense relations with Turkey -- the unofficial sponsor of the mission -- and draw unwanted attention to Gaza 's plight .
White House spokesman Bill Burton , speaking on the eve of a meeting that President Barack Obama had scheduled at the White House with Netanyahu , said the United States " deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries sustained " in the incident .
Netanyahu announced Monday he would cancel his White House visit to deal with the crisis .
Burton also said that administration officials are " currently working to understand the circumstances surrounding this tragedy . "
The United States , among others , has been trying to restart direct peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians , but progress toward this achievement has lagged severely in recent months .
The tough Israeli response also drew condemnations from Turkey , France and the U.N. 's Mideast envoy , while Greece suspended a military exercise with Israel and postponed a visit by Israel 's air force chief .
The U.N. Security Council announced they would meet Monday afternoon to discuss the attack .
Turkey 's prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan described the raid as " state terrorism " Monday , as some10,000 Turks marched from Israel 's Consulate in Istanbul toward the city 's main square , shouting slogans denouncing Israel .
The protesters earlier Monday tried to storm the Consulate building but were blocked by police .
In response , Israel advised its citizens Monday to avoid travel to Turkey and instructed those already there to keep a low profile and avoid crowded downtown areas .
There were conflicting accounts of what happened early Monday .
An Al - Jazeera reporter on one of the Turkish ships said the Israelis fired at the vessel before boarding it .
The Israelis , who had declared they would not let the ships reach Gaza , said they only opened fire after being attacked by activists with sticks , knives and live fire from weapons seized from the Israeli commandos .
Israeli security forces were on alert across the country .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the Israeli " aggression , " declared three days of mourning across the West Bank and called on the U.N. Security Council and Arab League to hold emergency sessions on the incident .
Ismail Haniyeh , leader of the rival Hamas government in Gaza , condemned the " brutal " Israeli attack and called on U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon to intervene .
The activists were heading to Gaza on a mission meant to draw attention to a three - year - old Israeli blockade of the coastal territory .
Israel imposed the blockade after Hamas , which it considers a terrorist group , violently seized the territory .
Critics say the blockade has unfairly hurt Gaza 's 1.5 million people .
" It 's disgusting that they have come on board and attacked civilians .
We are civilians , " said Greta Berlin , a spokeswoman for the Free Gaza movement , which organized the flotilla .
She spoke from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus and said she had lost contact with the flotilla .
Israeli naval commandos stormed the ships in a predawn raid while they were in international waters after ordering them to stop about 80 miles from Gaza 's coast , according to activists .
A Turkish website showed video of pandemonium on board one of the ships , with activists in orange life jackets running around as some tried to help an activist apparently unconscious on the deck .
The site also showed video of an Israeli helicopter flying overhead and Israeli warships nearby .
Turkey 's NTV showed activists beating one Israeli soldier with sticks as he rappelled from a helicopter onto one of the boats .
The Al - Jazeera satellite channel reported by telephone from the Turkish ship leading the flotilla that Israeli navy forces fired at the ship and boarded it , wounding the captain .
" These savages are killing people here , please help , " a Turkish television reporter said .
The broadcast ended with a voice shouting in Hebrew , " Everybody shut up ! "
The Free Gaza Movement is an international group of pro-Palestinian activists that claims the blockade , imposed three years ago after the militant Islamic Hamas group overran Gaza , is unjust and a violation of international law .
Organizers included people affiliated with the International Solidarity Movement , a pro-Palestinian group that often sends international activists into battle zones , and the IHH , a Turkish aid group that Israel accuses of having terrorist links .
The flotilla of three cargo ships and three passenger ships carrying 10,000 tons of aid and 700 activists was carrying items that Israel bars from reaching Gaza , like cement and other building materials .
This is the ninth time that the Free Gaza movement has tried to ship in humanitarian aid to Gaza since August 2008 .
Israel has allowed ships through five times , but has blocked them from entering Gaza waters since a three - week military offensive against Gaza 's Hamas rulers in January 2009 .
The latest flotilla was the largest to date .

BAGHDAD ( AP ) 
A police official says U.S. troops opened fire on a car in western Baghdad , killing an Iraqi journalist and her husband .
The official says the incident took place late Wednesday in the Tobchi neighborhood .
He says U.S. troops open fire on Aseel al - Obeidi and her husband 's car but gave no further details .
He spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media .
Morgue officials confirmed the deaths .
The U.S. military did not confirm the incident but said it was investigating killings Wednesday of two Iraqis that occurred as troops were conducting security operations in western Baghdad .
Al - Obeidi worked for Dijla television , which recently closed because of financial problems .

A principios de la semana pasada me sorprendió encontrar un gran bullicio en la esquina del eje Baja California y la calle Chilpancingo , en la colonia Condesa .
Decenas de mirones observaban el cadáver de un hombre de 35 años que había sido prensado por una camioneta contra un camión de mudanzas .
El conductor había sufrido un ataque epiléptico y le fue imposible frenar provocando la tragedia .
Aquello me hizo pensar en las muchas lagunas que históricamente ha habido en el Distrito Federal para la expedición de licencias , documento que en opinión de los expertos , guarda hoy menos respeto legal que una credencial para que los niños puedan acceder a todos los juegos de la feria .
Curiosamente hoy es inexistente el procedimiento creado a principios del siglo XX por la primera Oficina de Licencias para Automovilistas y que consistía en realizar un examen de reflejos y vista al solicitante , además de exigir un certificado médico avalado por una institución pública , para evitar que algún “ amigo doctor ” facilitara cualquier documento .
Si hoy revisa los trámites para la expedición de cualquier tipo de licencia , A , B , C y D , encontrará con que el único párrafo referente a la aptitud del conductor es : “ Declarar bajo protesta que tiene capacidad física y mental para conducir el vehículo conforme a la licencia solicitada , o que , en su defecto cuenta con los aditamentos necesarios para conducir dicho vehículo ” .
Atrás quedaron los días en que las oficinas realizaban largos exámenes para seleccionar a los conductores , incluso en 1936 se trató de promover una ley con la que se podía levantar cargos y hacer corresponsable de un accidente al médico que alterara un certificado médico u omitiera con premeditación alguna enfermedad que pusiera en riesgo tanto al conductor como a los transeúntes .
No obstante aquello nunca prosperó , porque por alguna razón , las licencias nunca fueron protegidas contra la falsificación y la documentación para tramitarlas siempre se mantuvo en la línea de lo medianamente exigente .
En la década de los 30 , el famoso falsificador Miguel Cantat , otrora pintor de caballete , fue responsable de expedir desde su taller el 30 por ciento de las licencias con las que circulaban los autos en la ciudad de México .
Cuando hace unos años , este columnista reporteaba para un noticiero de televisión , realizó una cobertura con cámara escondida para mostrar la facilidad con la que era posible obtener una licencia con documentos falsos .
Hoy , usted puede acudir a una de las tiendas comerciales de la ciudad que exhiben el logo de un pelícano y obtener el documento con el que supuestamente el Estado garantiza la aptitud del conductor y la seguridad del transeúnte , en menos de 15 minutos o mientras realiza sus compras .
¿ No sería mejor que realizaran un convenio con las empresas y colocaran las licencias dentro de las cajas de cereal ?
De todos modos para realizar cualquier trámite , ningún banco , oficina gubernamental , instancia de salud o persona física en sus cinco sentidos , recibe la licencia , es el documento más inútil de la historia de nuestra nación y a lo mucho sirve para que el policía en turno tenga tiempo de dorar la píldora y pensar en cuánto va a salir la mordida a la víctima .
¡ Muchas gracias a nuestros amables lectores por sus correos de la semana pasada , más de 300 , con respecto al tema del grafiti !
Girls played significantly longer with dolls , the study said
Boys naturally gravitate towards cars and girls towards dolls from the moment they first crawl , a study suggests .
City University researchers put a range of toys a metre from 90 children - aged nine to 36 months - and recorded what was played with and for how long .
They found boys spent more time playing with cars and balls , while girls spent more time playing with the dolls .
Researchers said the study suggested there was an " intrinsic bias " in children towards gender - typical toys .
They presented their findings at the British Psychological Society 's annual conference in Stratford Upon Avon on Friday .
Children of this age are already subject to a great deal of socialisation
Dr Brenda Todd
One of the researchers , Sara Amalie O'Toole Thommessen , said : " It was very obvious that even the youngest children went straight for gender - typed toys and colours .
" Boys went straight for the ball and the black car , and girls went to the teddy bear and the doll . "
The team said its study was the first to have found such consistent and stable differences in toy choices between genders in children younger than 18 months .
A fellow researcher , Dr Brenda Todd , said : " We were surprised to find the differences so early . "
But she added : " Children of this age are already subject to a great deal of socialisation , but these findings are consistent with the idea of an intrinsic bias in children to show interest in particular kinds of toys . "
It is one of the paradoxes of the Internet .
Along with the freest access to knowledge the world has ever seen comes a staggering amount of untruth , from imagined threats on health care to too - easy - to - be - true ways to earn money by forwarding an e-mail message to 10 friends .
“ A cesspool , ” Google ’s chief executive , Eric E. Schmidt , once called it .
David and Barbara Mikkelson are among those trying to clean the cesspool .
The unassuming California couple run Snopes , one of the most popular fact - checking destinations on the Web .
For well over a decade they have acted as arbiters in the Age of Misinformation by answering the central question posed by every chain letter — is this true ?

The popularity of Snopes — it attracts seven million to eight million unique visitors in an average month — puts the couple in a unique position to evaluate digital society ’s attitudes toward accuracy .
But poor borrowers are often too inexperienced and too harried to understand what they are being charged , experts said .
In Mexico City , Maria Vargas has borrowed larger and larger amounts from Compartamos over 20 years to expand her T - shirt factory to 25 sewing machines from 5 .
She is hazy about what interest rate she actually pays , though she considers it high .

“ The interest rate is important , but to be honest , you can get so caught up in work that there is no time to go fill out paperwork in another place , ” she said .
After several loans , now a simple phone call to Compartamos gets her a check the next day , she said .
Occasionally , interest rates spur political intervention .
In Nicaragua , President Daniel Ortega , outraged that interest rates there were hovering around 35 percent in 2008 , announced that he would back a microfinance institution that would charge 8 to 10 percent , using Venezuelan money .
There were scattered episodes of setting aflame microfinance branches before a national “ We ’re not paying ” campaign erupted , which was widely believed to be mounted secretly by the Sandinista government .
After the courts stopped forcing small borrowers to repay , making international financial institutions hesitant to work with Nicaragua , the campaign evaporated .
A Push for More Transparency
The microfinance industry is pushing for greater transparency among its members , but says that most microlenders are honest , with experts putting the number of dubious institutions anywhere from less than 1 percent to more than 10 percent .
Given that competition has a pattern of lowering interest rates worldwide , the industry prefers that approach to government intervention .
Part of the problem , however , is that all kinds of institutions making loans plaster them with the “ microfinance ” label because of its do - good reputation .
Damian von Stauffenberg , who founded an independent rating agency called Microrate , said that local conditions had to be taken into account , but that any firm charging 20 to 30 percent above the market was “ unconscionable ” and that profit rates above 30 percent should be considered high .
Mr. Yunus says interest rates should be 10 to 15 percent above the cost of raising the money , with anything beyond a “ red zone ” of loan sharking .
“ We need to draw a line between genuine and abuse , ” he said .
“ You will never see the situation of poor people if you look at it through the glasses of profit - making . ”
Yet by that measure , 75 percent of microfinance institutions would fall into Mr. Yunus ’s “ red zone , ” according to a March analysis of 1,008 microlenders by Adrian Gonzalez , lead researcher at the Mix .
His study found that much of the money from interest rates was used to cover operating expenses , and argued that tackling costs , as opposed to profits , could prove the most efficient way to lower interest rates .
The Netherlands Antilles semi-submersible heavy load carrier M/V MIGHTY SERVANT 2 ( 21,162 gross ) , Singapore for Cabinda , capsized in lat 00 48S , long 104 20E , Nov 2 .
The 1983 - built ship , owned by Belgium - based offshore heavylifting group Dockwise , had a crew of 20 and was carrying an 8,790 ton offshore production module at the time of the accident , which reportedly occurred in calm seas .
The ship is currently on its side in 35 m of water , with 5 m of its hull still above the surface .
Divers searching the vessel discovered the bodies of 2 Dutch & 2 Filipino crewmen inside the vessel , and the search for a remaining man has entered its final stages inside the wreck .
This was a very impressive , huge & famous vessel .
( Wed. Nov. 3 1999 )
UPDATE : An uncharted rock probably caused the capsize of heavylift vessel M/V Mighty Servant 2 , and the loss of 5 lives , in Nov. 1999 .
The ship 's owner , Belgian company Dockwise , says a new , specially commissioned hydrographic survey of the area near the Indonesian island of Singkep has discovered a " single isolated pinnacle of granite directly on the ship 's course . "
The rock is not on existing charts .

Like the many businesses that support it , public transportation is a cornerstone of any modern , urban economy .
Businesses , labor leaders , community advocates , and employers realize the necessity of mass transit .
With so many groups showing continued support for this vital investment , it 's time we all recognize the job creating benefits public transportation provides to our community and region .
In a very literal sense , transit means business , which is why we cannot give up on expanding economic opportunity through smart investments in public transportation .
A functioning transit system makes sense in terms of the opportunities it creates and the money it saves .
Studies show that a commitment to transit can save residents approximately $ 1,040 in vehicle , parking , and roadway costs , providing a 277 % annual return on transit investments .
According to the American Public Transportation Association , households can save an average of $ 9,293 in transportation costs each year .
This is in addition to savings in the form of congestion reductions , increased traffic safety , and a healthier environment that benefits everyone .
Given the obvious positives , opposition to smart transit investments is perplexing , especially when recent efforts to revitalize the Milwaukee County Transit System ( MCTS ) could have been tied to direct property tax relief for Milwaukee County .
Throughout the recent debate on regional transportation for Southeastern Wisconsin , businesses highlighted the many successes they were having with new job creation , yet raised concerns as to how they could possibly gain access to a necessary workforce if there were no functioning bus system in Milwaukee .
The combination of public savings , benefits to business growth , and additional development that comes from investing in public transportation underscores how truly essential transit it is to our community and economy .
We cannot forget one of the most important aspects of public transit : the people who use and rely on it .
According to customer surveys taken by those who use buses in Milwaukee County , an overwhelming 70 % of riders do not have a car they can count on for travelling to work , the hospital , or a number of other important locations .
According to one estimate , MCTS also uses its paratransit services to provide more than 1 million rides a year to persons with disabilities .
Given the number of jobs , businesses , and individual lives that depend on our transit system , the implications of its further erosion will be disastrous .
We must find a way to stop the coming transit tragedy .
Public transit is a smart way to grow the economy , creating a public investment that has vast benefits , both public and private .
Failure to invest in this important and economically vital infrastructure will result in nothing short than the continued decay and eventual collapse of Milwaukee County as we once knew it .
The current legislative session is over , but the fight for public transportation is not .
Transit means business for everyone , which is why everyone needs to come together for transit as Wisconsin moves forward .
Tamara Grigsby , a Democrat , represents the 18th Assembly District .
A white police officer in Philadelphia was fired this week after confessing that he shot himself in the shoulder last month and blamed the shooting on a black assailant .
According to Sgt. Robert Ralston ’s original story , he stopped two men on the railroad tracks late on the night of April 5 .
When one of them pulled a gun and put it to his head , he knocked it away , but it went off and grazed him in the shoulder .
The attacker , whom Ralston described as having cornrows and a tattoo under his left eye , then ran off .

The police immediately launched a massive manhunt , blanketing the predominantly African - American neighborhood with SWAT teams and K - 9 units .
“ I think it ’s despicable , ” one resident complained .
“ The cops were stopping every man with dreadlocks .
Every black man was harassed . ”
“ To us in Boston , ” noted the Boston Globe ’s James Alan Fox , “ the incident is reminiscent of the Charles Stuart debacle when the police compromised the civil rights of the entire Mission Hill community in searching for the black assailant whom Stuart , a white suburbanite , claimed had shot him and his pregnant wife as they drove home from birthing class at Brigham and WomenÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Hospital .
The aggressive and highly questionable manner in which the cops rousted countless numbers of residents of the area set race relations in the city back years upon years . ”
Although no motivation has been established for the 21 - year veteran ’s deception , Fox suggests that “ Ralston was angry over having been transferred from a white community in South Philadelphia to the black neighborhood in West Philly . ”
“ I ca n’t believe he ’d really do something like that , ” Ralston ’s next door neighbor Brawly Joseph , who is black , told CNN .
“ That ’s really uncalled for .
Ever since I ’ve been living here , he ’s really been like anti-social around this area . ”
According to the Philadelphia Inquirer , Ralston ’s story quickly fell apart because “ the facts of the case did n’t add up .
There was powder residue on his shirt that matched his own service weapon , indicating he was shot at close range .
His reaction to the shooting also drew suspicion , and police said he seemed eager to cast himself in the role of a hero . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s troubling in a lot of ways , ” Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey stated in announcing Ralston ’s confession .
“ It inflames racial tensions in our community , and that ’s certainly something we do n’t need . ”
The Inquirer reports that Ralston “ will face no criminal charges in the case , because he was offered immunity in exchange for his confession . ”
He may also be able to collect his police pension .
His badge number will be retired permanently , however , and he will “ have to pay the cost of the massive manhunt that was sparked by his tale on April 5 . … [ when ] police spent hours combing the West Philadelphia neighborhood for possible suspects , ”

Based on the top search results , you could :
Man , what a rip - off .
How did these answers come up as the most relevant results ?
They give basically no practical advice .
For all you romantics , there is real hope
It comes from a problem in statistics .
For the sake of this discussion , I define true love as the best person who is willing to date you .
Even if that ’s not exactly true , I ’m wiling to live with that definition .
Because if you think your true love is someone that wo n’t date you , well , I ’m not sure any advice can help you .
So for all you reasonable romantics , I offer this hope : if you follow this advice , you ’ll maximize your chance of finding true love .
The advice will give most people about a 37 percent chance of finding true love .
Yes , it ’s not perfect–but I ’d say that ’s pretty good for a really difficult problem .
Modeling the True Love Game
Dating and relationships are complicated social interactions so they need to be simplified before coming up with any meaningful analysis .
In this statistics game , you search for your true love by dating and having relationships with various people .
Your only goal is to find the best person willing to date you–any thing less is a failure .
Here are some ground rules ( basically the same rules as on MTV’s show Next ) :
You only date one person at a time .
A relationship either ends with you “ rejecting ” or “ selecting ” the other person .
If you “ reject ” someone , the person is gone forever .
Sorry , old flames cannot be rekindled .
You plan on dating some fixed number of people ( N ) during your lifetime .
As you date people , you can only tell relative rank and not true rank .
This means you can tell the second person was better than the first person , but you cannot judge whether the second person is your true love .
After all , there are people you have not dated yet .
Now , I know some of these rules are not realistic , but I think the game captures many of the dynamics of the dating world .
So let ’s take this as a starting point .
How does the game play out ?
You can start thinking about the solution by wondering what your strategies are .
Ultimately , you have to weigh two opposing factors .
— If you pick someone too early , you are making a decision without checking out your options .
Sure , you might get lucky , but it ’s a big risk .
— If you wait too long , you leave yourself with only a few candidates to pick from .
Again , this is a risky strategy .
The game boils down to selecting an optimal stopping time between playing the field and holding out too long .
What does the math say ?
The basic advice : Reject a certain number of people , no matter how good they are , and then pick the next person better than all the previous ones .
The idea is to lock yourself in to search and then grab a good catch when it comes along .
The natural question is how many people should you reject ?
It turns out to be proportional to how many people you want to date , so let ’s investigate this issue .
To make this concrete , let ’s look at an example for someone that wants to date three people .
Example with Three Potential Relationships
A naÃ¯ve approach is to select the first relationship .
What are the odds the first person is the best ?
It is equally likely for the first person to be the best , the second best , or the worst .
This means by pure luck you have a 1/3 chance of finding true love if you always pick the first person .
You also have a 1/3 chance if you always pick the last person , or always pick the second .
Can you do better than pure luck ?
Yes , you can .
Consider the following strategy : get to know –but always reject –the first person .
Then , select the next person judged to be better than the first person .
How often does this strategy find the best overall person ?
It turns out it wins 50 percent of the time !
For the specifics , there are 6 possible dating orders , and the strategy wins in three cases .
( The notation 3 1 2 means you dated the worst person first , then the best , and then the second best .
I marked the person that the strategy would pick in bold and indicated a win if the strategy picked the best candidate overall . )
1 2 3 Lose 1 3 2 Lose 2 1 3 Win 2 3 1 Win 3 1 2 Win 3 2 1 Lose
You increase your odds by learning information from the first person .
Notice that in two of the cases that you win you do not actually date all three people .
As you can see , it is important to date people to learn information , but you do not want to get stuck with fewer options .
So do your odds increase if you date more people ?
Like 5 , or 10 , or 100 ?
Does the strategy change ?
The answer is both interesting and surprising .
The Best Strategy for the General Case
From the example , you can infer the best strategy is to reject some number of people ( k ) and then select the next person judged better than the first k people .
When you go through the math , the odds do not change as you date more people .
Although you might think meeting more people helps you , there is also a lot of noise since it is actually harder to determine which one is the best overall .
So here is the conclusion :
The advice : Reject the first 37 percent of the people you want to date and then pick the next person better anyone before .
Surprisingly , you ’ll end up with your true love 37 percent of the time .
The advice is unchanged whether you plan to date 5 , 10 , 50 , 100 , or even 1,000 people .
Here is a table displaying specific numbers :
Number of people you want to date ( N ) Number of people you should reject ( k ) 4 1 5 2 10 3 25 9 50 18 100 37
Now I was simplifying matters just a bit because “ rejecting 37 percent ” is an approximation .
There is some math that goes into the exact answer .
To be precise , the exact answer is to find first value of k such that
The full proof is fascinating , though somewhat technical .
I encourage my avid math readers to check it out .
Do a Google search for “ How to Find a Spouse A Problem in Discrete Mathematics With an Assist From Calculus ” and try to find slides .
I ’ve updated this about 5 times over the years , the link keeps changing .
Here ’s a link , but if it is broken do a search and try to find the slides : slides .
A Lesson Learned ?
Do n’t settle too early .
Suppose that Americans have between five to ten relationships before marriage .
This means most people are going to reject the first two or three people , regardless of the person ’s quality .
Sounds odd , but it ’s just too important to test the market and find that special person .
Besides , this strategy improves a person ’s odds from a pure random chance ( 10 - 20 percent ) to almost 37 percent .
Okay great .
There ’s just one last thing to consider .
Does n’t the Other Person Play the Game Too ?
Game theory would be a lot easier if you could ignore how other people affect the game .
So we ’re not done yet .
The HUGE caveat is the other person is also trying to game you .
Imagine this : you date a few people , then finally find a great match , and then try to get more serious .
Only , that ’s not in the other person ’s plan .
The other person happens to be less experienced than you , and you happen to be that person ’s first serious relationship .
As great as you might be , that person is not ready to settle .
The theory suggests you should not feel hurt if someone rejects you like this .
You are likely an early victim .
To take advantage of the theory , you should consider whether the other person is ready to get serious .
I guess this is why there are certain age clusters when people get married .
But there are things that counter the problem of timing .
In real life , you have other strategies to increase your odds not possible in the game :
You some times can rekindle an old flame .
You cannot date simultaneously , but you can often get to know many people at the same time .
You might be able to figure out a true love without having to date many more people .
It happens .
And if you are getting more serious , seek out reasonable people who only want to have one or two relationships in their lifetime .
You would be in luck , because the math says you ’re first in line to be their true love 😉

The Indian and Pakistani prime ministers are due in Bhutan this week India has arrested a woman working as a diplomat in its Islamabad embassy on charges of spying for Pakistan .
Madhuri Gupta , 53 , is a second secretary in the high commission in the press and information section .
She was arrested on a work trip to Delhi .
Officials say she is suspected of handing over classified documents to Pakistan 's ISI intelligence service .
There was no immediate response from Pakistan .
The neighbours have a history of mistrust and have fought three wars .
The arrest comes ahead of this week 's regional summit in Bhutan , where Indian PM Manmohan Singh and Pakistani counterpart Yousuf Raza Gilani may meet on the sidelines .
Relations have been strained since the Mumbai ( Bombay ) attacks of November 2008 , which India blamed on militants from Pakistan .
The official is co-operating with our investigations and inquiries
Vishnu Prakash ,
Indian foreign affairs spokesman
Singh rules out talks ' Boosting militants '
Q&A : Kashmir dispute " We have reasons to believe an official in the Indian high commission in Pakistan has been passing information to Pakistani intelligence officials , " said Vishnu Prakash , a spokesman for India 's ministry of external affairs .
The Press Trust of India ( PTI ) news agency said Ms Gupta had been arrested four days ago after being summoned to Delhi .
She was produced in court on Monday and will remain in police custody for another five days , PTI said .
Ms Gupta has worked in Islamabad for three years , reports say .
The head of India 's intelligence agency RAW ( Research and Analysis Wing ) in Islamabad is also being investigated , PTI reports .
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says that although it is not clear what secrets were passed on , the revelations have come as a major embarrassment for India .
There have been instances of rogue agents or Indian officials working for foreign governments , but this is believed to be the first such instance involving Pakistan .
Ties between India and Pakistan are strained over the Mumbai attacks
This week in Bhutan , Mr Singh and Mr Gilani are expected to try to ease relations that have been strained since the Mumbai attacks .
India blamed Pakistan - based militant group Lashkar - e - Taiba for the attacks , which left 174 people dead , including nine gunmen .
Delhi put peace talks on hold suggesting that " state elements " in Pakistan were involved too .
Pakistan admitted the attacks were partly planned on its soil , but denied any official involvement .
In February , Pakistan and India held their first formal talks since the 2008 attacks and agreed to " remain in touch " .
And earlier in April , Mr Gilani and Mr Singh held " informal talks " at a reception hosted by US President Barack Obama .

After threatening the cashier , he tries to leave the shop , but is blocked by Martin Richardson , who hits him twice with a chair and holds him to the ground until police arrive .

It 's free , it 's open to the public , and it 's highly recommended :
" The Fiscal Sustainability Teach - In Counter - conference will be the important event in Washington on April 28 , " said Professor Galbraith .
" Unlike the other meeting , this one will feature important work by honest scholars .
It deserves at least equal attention , and very much more respect . "
We 've got the bare bones to go forward , but we 're still in need of help with our funding .
The room is reserved , the speakers all have their plane tickets , and maybe we 'll even even be able to provide them with free coffee .
But if you 'd like to see videos on the web later on , or read transcripts , or look at PowerPoint presentations , or ... and if you 've got a few dollars to spare , you can donate here , or here .
With your help , we might even be able to give them a free lunch to go along with that free coffee .

My first reaction , upon reading about the SEC ’s complaint against Goldman Sachs was to shrug .
Basically , the SEC claims that Goldman failed to disclose a conflict of interest in a deal the firm arranged , that perhaps Goldman even misdirected and misimplied and failed to correct impressions that were untrue but helpful in getting the deal done .
If that ’s the worst the SEC could dig up , I thought , there ’s way too much that ’s legal .
Had you asked me , early Friday afternoon , what would happen , I would have pointed to the “ global settlement ” seven years ago .
Then as now , investment banks were caught fibbing to keep the deal flow going ( then via equity analysts who hyped stocks they privately did not admire ) .
The settlement got a lot of press , the banks were slapped with fines that sounded big but did n’t matter , promises were made about “ chinese walls ” and stuff , nothing much changed .
But Goldman ’s PR people have once again proved themselves to be masters of ineptitude .
Have n’t those guys ever heard , “ it ’s not the crime , but the cover up ” ?
The SEC threw Goldman a huge softball by focusing almost entirely on the fibs of a guy who calls himself “ the fabulous Fab ” and makes bizarre apocalyptic boasts .
Given the apparent facts of this case , phrases like “ bad apple ” and “ regret ” and “ large organization ” and “ improved controls ” would have been apropos .
It ’s almost poignant :
The smart thing for Goldman would be to hang this fab Fab out to dry , but whether out of loyalty or arrogance the firm is standing by its man .
But Goldman ’s attempts to justify what occurred , rather than dispute the facts or apologize , could be the firm ’s death warrant .
The brilliant can be so blind .
The core issues are simple .
Goldman arranged the construction of a security , a “ synthetic CDO ” , which it then marketed to investors .
No problem there , that ’s part of what Goldman does .
Further , the deal was n’t Goldman ’s idea .
The firm was working to serve a client , John Paulson , who had a bearish view of the housing market and was looking for a vehicle by which he could invest in that view .
Again , no problem .
I ’d argue even argue that , had Goldman done its job well , it would have done a public service by finding ways to get bearish views into a market that was structurally difficult to short and prone to overpricing .
Goldman could , quite ethically , have acted as a broker .
Had there been some existing security that Paulson wished to sell short , the firm might have borrowed that security on Paulson ’s behalf and sold it to a willing buyer without making any representations whatsoever about the nature of the security or the identity of its seller .
Apparently , however , the menu of available securities was insufficient to express Paulson ’s view .
Fine .
Goldman could have tailored a security or derivative contract to Paulson ’s specifications and found a counterparty willing to take the other side of the bet in full knowledge of the disagreement .
Goldman need n’t ( and should n’t ) proffer an opinion on the substantive economic issue ( was the subprime RMBS market going to implode or not ? ) .
Investors get to disagree .
But it did need to ensure that all parties to an arrangement that it midwifed understood the nature of the disagreement , the substance of the bet each side was taking .
And it did need to ensure that the parties knew there was a disagreement .
Goldman argues that the nature of the security was such that “ sophisticated investors ” would know that they were taking one of two opposing positions in a disagreement .
On this , Goldman is simply full of it :
Extensive Disclosure Was Provided .
IKB , a large German Bank and sophisticated CDO market participant and ACA Capital Management , the two investors , were provided extensive information about the underlying mortgage securities .
The risk associated with the securities was known to these investors , who were among the most sophisticated mortgage investors in the world .
These investors also understood that a synthetic CDO transaction necessarily included both a long and short side .
[ bold original , italics mine ]
The line I ’ve italicized is the sole inspiration for this rambling jeremiad .
That line is so absurd , brazen , and misleading that I snorted when I encountered it .
Of course it is true , in a formal sense .
Every financial contract — every security or derivative or insurance policy — includes both long and short positions .
Financial contracts are promises to pay .
There is always a payer and a payee , and the payee is “ long ” certain states of the world while the payer is short .
When you buy a share of IBM , you are long IBM and the firm itself has a short position .
Does that mean , when you purchase IBM , you are taking sides in a disagreement with IBM , with IBM betting that it will collapse and never pay a dividend while you bet it will succeed and be forced to pay ?
No , of course not .
There are many , many occasions when the interests of long investors and the interests of short investors are fully aligned .
When IBM issues new shares , all of its stakeholders — preexisting shareholders , managers , employees — hope that IBM will succeed , and may have no disagreement whatsoever on its prospects .
Old stakeholders commit to pay dividends to new shareholders because managers believe the cash they receive up front will enable business activity worth more than the extra cost .
New shareholders buy the shares because they agree with old stakeholders ’ optimism .
The existence of a long side and a short side need imply no disagreement whatsoever .
So why did Goldman put that line in their deeply misguided press release ?
One word : derivatives .
The financially interested community , like any other group of humans , has its unexamined clichés .
One of those is that derivatives are zero sum contests between ‘ long ’ investors and ‘ short ’ investors whose interests are diametrically opposed and who transact only because they disagree .
By making CDOs , synthetic CDOs sound like derivatives , Goldman is trying to imply that investors must have known they were playing against an opponent , taking one side of a zero - sum gamble that they happened to lose .
Of course that ’s bullshit .
Synthetic CDOs are constructed , in part , from derivatives .
( They are built by mixing ultrasafe “ collateral securities ” like Treasury bonds with credit default swap positions , and credit default swaps are derivatives . )
But investments in synthetic CDOs are not derivatives , they are securities .
While the constituent credit default swaps “ necessarily ” include both a long and a short position , the synthetic CDOs include both a long and a short position only in the same way that IBM shares include both a long and a short position .
Speculative short interest in whole CDOs was rare , much less common than for shares of IBM .
Investors might have understood , in theory , that a short - seller could buy protection on a diversified portfolio of credit default swaps that mimicked the CDO “ reference portfolio ” , or could even buy protection on tranches of the CDO itself to express a bearish view on the structure .
But CDO investors would not expect that anyone was actually doing this .
It would seem like a dumb idea , since CDO portfolios were supposed to be chosen and diversified to reduce the risk of loss relative to holding any particular one of its constituents , and senior tranches were protected by overcollateralization and priority .
Most of a CDO ’s structure was AAA debt , generally viewed as a means of earning low - risk yield , not as a vehicle for speculation .
Synthetic CDOs were composed of CDS positions backed by many unrelated counterparties , not one speculative seller .
Goldman ’s claim that “ market makers do not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller ” is laughable and disingenuous .
A CDO , synthetic or otherwise , is a newly formed investment company .
Typically there is no identifiable “ seller ” .
The investment company takes positions with an intermediary , which then hedges its exposure in transactions with a variety of counterparties .
The fact that there was a “ seller ” in this case , and his role in “ sponsoring ” the deal , are precisely what ought to have been disclosed .
Investors would have been surprised by the information , and shocked to learn that this speculative short had helped determine the composition of the structure ’s assets .
That information would not only have been material , it would have been fatal to the deal , because the CDO ’s investors did not view themselves as speculators .
I have little sympathy for CDO investors .
Wait , scratch that .
I have a great deal of sympathy for the beneficial investors in CDOs , for the workers whose pensions wo n’t be there or the students at colleges strapped for resources after their endowments were hit .
But I have no sympathy for their agents and delegates , the well - paid “ professionals ” who placed funds entrusted them in a foolish , overhyped fad .
But what investment managers believed about their hula - hoop is not what Goldman now hints that they believed .
Investors in synthetic CDOs did not view themselves as taking one side of a speculative gamble against a “ short ” holding opposite views .
They had a theory about their investments that involved no disagreement whatsoever , no conflict between longs and shorts .
It went like this :
There is a great deal of demand for safe assets in the world right now , and insufficient supply at reasonable yields .
So , investors are synthesizing safe assets by purchasing riskier debt ( like residential mortgage - backed securities ) and buying credit default swaps to protect themselves .
All that hedging is driving up the price of CDS protection to attractive levels , given the relative safety of the bonds .
We might be interested in capturing those cash flows , but we also want safe debt .
So , we propose to diversify across a large portfolio of overpriced CDS and divide the cash flows from the diversified portfolio into tranches .
If we do this , those with “ first claims ” on the money should be able to earn decent yields with very little risk .
I do n’t want to say anything nice about that story .
The idea that an investor should earn perfectly safe , above - risk - free yields via blind diversification , with little analysis of the real economic basis for their investment , is offensive to me and , events have shown , was false .
But this was the story that justified the entire synthetic CDO business , and it involved no disagreement among investors .
According to the story , the people buying the overpriced CDS protection , the “ shorts ” were not hoping or expressing a view that their bonds would fail .
They were hedging , protecting themselves against the possibility of failure .
There need n’t have been any disagreement about price .
The RMBS investors may have believed that they were overpaying for protection , just as CDO buyers did , just as we all knowingly and happily overpay for insurance on our homes .
Shedding great risk is worth accepting a small negative expected return .
That derivatives are a zero - sum game may be a cliché , but it is false .
Derivatives are zero-sum games in a financial sense , but they can be positive sum games in an economic sense , because hedgers are made better off when they shed risk , even when they overpay speculators in expected value terms to do so .
( If there are “ natural ” hedgers on both sides of the market , no one need overpay and the potential economic benefits of derivatives are even stronger .
But there are few natural protection sellers in the CDS market . )
Goldman claims to have lost money on the CDO it created for Paulson .
Perhaps the bankers thought Paulson was a patsy , that his bearish bets were idiotic and they were doing investors no harm by hiding his futile meddling .
Perhaps , as Felix Salmon suggests , the employees doing the deal had little reason to care about whether the part of the structure Goldman retained performed , as long as they could book a fee .
It is likely that even if Paulson had had nothing to do with the deal , the CDO would still have failed , given how catastrophically idiotic RMBS - backed CDOs were soon revealed to be .
But all of that is irrelevant , assuming the SEC has the facts right .
Investors in Goldman ’s deal reasonably thought that they were buying a portfolio that had been carefully selected by a reputable manager whose sole interest lay in optimizing the performance of the CDO .
They no more thought they were trading “ against ” short investors than investors in IBM or Treasury bonds do .
In violation of these reasonable expectations , Goldman arranged that a party whose interests were diametrically opposed to those of investors would have significant influence over the selection of the portfolio .
Goldman misrepresented that party ’s role to the manager and failed to disclose the conflict of interest to investors .
That ’s inexcusable .
Was it illegal ?
I do n’t know , and I do n’t care .
Given the amount of CYA boilerplate in Goldman ’s presentation of the deal , maybe they immunized themselves .
But the firm ’s behavior was certainly unethical .
If Goldman cannot acknowledge that , I ca n’t see how investors going forward could place any sort of trust in the firm .
Whatever does or does not happen in Washington D.C. , Goldman Sachs needs to reform or die .
Sir Stirling Moss has labelled Michael Schumacher as " past it " , after a disappointing start to the seven - time world champion 's F1 return .
Schumacher has scored just ten points in four races , forty less than his Mercedes team - mate Nico Rosberg .
A number of ex-drivers , including Mika Hakkinen , have urged fans to give Schumacher time but Moss insists the comeback was a mistake .
Asked if he could understand Schumacher 's decision to return , Moss told the Metro : " In a word no .
He 's a highly intelligent bloke , and I really can't see … all he 's going to do is damage his achievements .
People are going to say that he 's past it now , which he probably is . "
In his exclusive column with ESPNF1 , Moss reiterated his belief that Schumacher never faced a competitive team - mate in his glory years and that he does n't appear to have the same " compulsion " to win on his return .
" People say it 's because he 's been away for three years and that sort of stuff , but I 'm going to stick to what I said at the start of the season : Until now , he 's never had a truly competitive team - mate , " Moss said .
" His seven world titles are , in my mind , misleading and I think we are seeing proof of that now he is up against Rosberg .
Rosberg has proved himself as the team 's No.1 and he 's been faster than Schumacher in all circumstances .
" What 's more I 'm not sure he is taking F1 as seriously as he was earlier in his career .
You need a compulsion to be there , you can't just do it for fun , and I do n't think Schumacher has that compulsion anymore .
To win you need to believe that there is no way anybody else can beat you and , frankly , I do n't think he 's in that kind of mindset .
It seems as though this year is just part of his retirement rather than an extension of his career . "
Montreal , May 14 , 2010 - In Canada , in stark contrast with the rest of the world , wealthy men increase their likelihood of being overweight with every extra dollar they make .
The new study was led by Nathalie Dumas , a graduate student at the University of Montreal Department of Sociology , and presented at the annual conference of the Association francophone pour le savoir ( ACFAS ) .
" Women are n't spared by this correlation , but results are ambiguous , " says Dumas .
" However , women from rich households are less likely to be obese than women of middle or lower income . "
Dumas used data from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey ( CCHS ) .
This provided access to information from some 7,000 adults aged 25 to 65 .
Dumas ' research is unique because she took into consideration the sex of individuals as well as their body mass index ( BMI ) to differentiate the overweight from the obese .
" Many epidemiological studies have established that the odds of being overweight or obese decrease as family income increases , " says Dumas .
" But we do n't know why this relationship is inverted for Canadian men .
According to the CCHS , the richer they are , the fatter they are . "
So why are rich men and poor women more likely to be obese in Canada ?
Dumas researched all existing literature and concluded a socioeconomic hypothesis could only explain the link of obesity and income for women .
Yet no hypothesis could explain the phenomenon observed in Canadian men .
" Since the 1980s , the greatest increase in obesity levels has been among rich Canadian and Korean men , " says Dumas .
" We still ca n't explain why . "
According to Dumas , one possible explanation is dining out .
" Canadians love restaurants .
And people who regularly eat out have no control over what they eat .
They also tend to eat more calories and consume larger amounts of alcohol . "
Too many restaurant meals , combined with a decrease in physical activity , is another possibility .
" There are obviously various factors at play : we still have n't empirically proved them , " says Dumas .
The 2004 CCHS found 23.1 percent of Canadians 18 years or older - about 5,5 million adults - are obese .
By 2030 , according to the World Health Organization , 2,3 billion people will be overweight and 700 million of will be obese .

North Korea announced Wednesday that its scientists had created a nuclear fusion reaction - a claim nuclear experts quickly cast doubt on .
" Nobody in the world has been able to sustain a controlled nuclear fusion reaction , the ultimate goal of nuclear technology , " said Dan Pinkston , head of the Seoul office of the International Crisis Group .
" I do n't think the North Koreans are going to start ... putting nuclear power vendors around the world out of business any time soon . "
Nuclear fusion is the same process that fuels stars , but has never been sustained in the laboratory by any nation , much less one of the poorest nations on earth .
If scientists could harness fusion energy , it could become a long - term , inexpensive power source .
The state - run Korean Central News Agency reported the claim that was made in Rodong Shinmun - the North Korean Workers Party newspaper .
The paper called it " artificial solar technology , " adding the breakthrough represented " the development of new energy desired by humankind . "
If North Korea has managed to advance nuclear fusion , it would be shocking development .
In March , an article in Scientific American magazine called " Fusion 's False Dawn " said , " Scientists are now uncovering serious engineering challenges that could forestall the construction of such a plant for years to come . "
The KCNA reported the process had been achieved on April 15 - " The Day of the Sun " - the birthday of Kim Il Sung , the late founder and " eternal president " of North Korea .
" Given that this is coming from the Rodong Shinmun , it is designed to strengthen the regime , " said Dr. Kim Byung - ki , a security expert at Korea University .
" The technological aspects have to be taken with a pinch of salt . "
Do n’t Poo-Poo Stool Transplants !
October 19 , 2008 at 6:27 pm
From yesterday ’s StarTribune :
The patient in his Duluth clinic was not responding to antibiotics , and now the stubborn infection in his intestines threatened to kill him .
Then Aas found a similar case written up in a 1950s Norwegian medical journal .
The cure ?
Replace all the bacteria in the patient ’s gut with a tiny dose of someone else ’s stool .
A stool transplant ?
Was Dr. Aas serious ?
Yes , he most certainly was .
The “ microbiome , ” as it is known , is now the focus of a $ 115 million federal research project to investigate the symbiotic bond between humans and their bacteria .
Well , we ’ve reported before that bugs can be good for us and that it ’s possible to be too clean – but this puts a whole new perspective on things .
From the National Institute of Health :
Within the body of a healthy adult , microbial cells are estimated to outnumber human cells by a factor of ten to one .
These communities , however , remain largely unstudied , leaving almost entirely unknown their influence upon human development , physiology , immunity , and nutrition .
While the term “ microbiome ” may be relatively new in biomedical research , most people are familiar with some of the effects — both good and bad — that microbes can have on our health .
Consider the example of the biggest reservoir of microbes in humans : the digestive tract .
The human gut harbors many beneficial microorganisms , including certain bacteria called probiotics .
There is evidence these probiotics , found in dietary supplements , yogurt and other dairy products as well as various soy products , can stimulate the immune system and improve digestive functions .
In contrast , previous research suggests that variations in the composition of microbial communities may contribute to chronic health conditions , including diabetes , asthma , obesity and digestive disorders .
We need microorganisms to survive .
It appears that the key is not so much to eliminate microogranisms from our bodies , but to keep them in the proper balance .
Again from the Star Tribune story :
Aas ’ patient 10 years ago had a common intestinal infection caused by a bacterium called C. difficile .
It sometimes takes hold when patients get a dose of antibiotics for some other reason .
These can destroy the population of beneficial intestinal bacteria , or flora , that digest food and provide nutrients to the body .
Then the spores of C. difficile , which can lurk in the gut , flower and take over , producing a toxin that causes severe diarrhea and , in time , destroys the colon lining .
Often , a dose of a different antibiotic will suppress the infection .
But sometimes C. difficile just keeps coming back .
C. difficile is one of a growing number of micro-organisms that have become resistant to antibiotics , while at the same time becoming more common and more virulent .
According to the Mayo Clinic : Healthcare associated infections — illnesses you acquire during a stay in a hospital or longterm care facility — are n’t new .
But in recent years , the infections have reached epidemic proportions in hospitals and nursing homes around the world .
One of the most widespread and potentially serious of these illnesses is caused by the bacterium Clostridium difficile , often simply called C. diff or C. difficile .
C. difficile bacteria are everywhere — in soil , air , water , human and animal feces , and on most surfaces .
The bacteria do n’t create problems until they grow in abnormally large numbers in the intestinal tract of people taking antibiotics or other antimicrobial drugs .
Then , C. difficile can cause symptoms ranging from diarrhea to life - threatening inflammations of the colon .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , each year in the United States C. difficile is responsible for tens of thousands of cases of diarrhea and at least 5,000 deaths .
And the problem is getting worse .
The number of C. difficile infections doubled between 1993 and 2003 , with most of the increase coming after 2000 .
C. difficile is n’t confined exclusively to hospitals .
It ’s also a growing problem among otherwise healthy people .
And although the infection can usually be controlled with antibiotics , virulent strains of C. difficile are now appearing that resist treatment with common medications .
Hence the need for a new cure .
Now , Rubin and Aas are researching which bacteria are the critical players in the hidden war inside the gut .
If they can answer that , patients might one day get a pill with the right bacteria instead of a tube in their nose .
In a refreshing bit of candor : Aas says he does n’t know exactly why the stool transplant works .
He presumes that the infusion of donated flora resets the bacterial balance in the gut and somehow keeps the C. difficile in check .
Whatever the mechanism , it works 95 percent of the time .
Neither group of researchers expects that finding the answer would result in a new , blockbuster drug .
There are probably not enough severe cases for that kind of payoff .
They are after different stakes — a better understanding of the relationship between humans and their bacteria .
In an interview in the Washington Post , Aas stated that he views stool as an organ :
It is normally considered waste product , but it is in a way an independent organ , like the kidney , and it contains thousands of different bacteria living in symbiosis .
These bacteria are needed for normal health .
When you use some antibiotics , some of this bacteria population gets destroyed .
If you later get infected with Clostridium difficile colitis , there is this competitive battlefield in the colon , and without the necessary bacteria , Clostridium has the upper hand .
So what we do is take normal stool from a normal person , make an extract of it , put it in a blender with water , take two tablespoons of that cocktail , and introduce it into the patient ’s body .
Fascinating stuff .
We hope their research leads to a better understanding of the ecosystems inside and outside our bodies .
It ’s not just humans who are afflicted with this disease .
Dogs and other animals also suffer from c. difficile .
In June , 2006 the CDC reported that a toxin - variant strain of C. difficile was diagnosed in a healthy , 4 - year - old toy poodle that was visiting patients in Ontario hospitals on a weekly basis .
The canine isolate was indistinguishable from the major strain implicated in outbreaks of highly virulent c. difficile found in humans around the world .
Although this was reportedly the first report of a human strain of c. difficile detected in a dog , many strains of the disease isolated from animals are indistinguishable from those associated with this disease in humans .
Want to know more about c. difficile ?
Check out this great summary on the disease from from our friends over at Worms and Germs .
And in the meantime – wash your hands , avoid taking unnecessary antibiotics – and do n’t keep your house too clean .

Bastard aus GEZ und Kopfpauschale Peter Mühlbauer
Der Heidelberger Professor Paul Kirchhof will ARD und ZDF zu einem leistungslosen Einkommen verhelfen
Paul Kirchhof hat sich einen Namen damit gemacht , in das Grundgesetz etwas ganz anderes hineinzulesen , als eigentlich drin steht .
Den so genannten " Halbteilungsgrundsatz " zum Beispiel , der besagt , dass niemand mehr als die Hälfte seines Einkommens an Steuern abführen dürfe und der von Verfassungsrichtern nach ihm weitgehend revidiert wurde .
Es ist zu hoffen , dass es dem Heidelberger Professor mit seinem neuen Argumentationskunstwerk ähnlich geht .
Der CDU - nahe Akademiker hat nämlich in der letzten Woche ein Gutachten veröffentlicht .
Bezahlt wurde es von den öffentlich - rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten .
Und um sie geht es in dem 85 Seiten umfassenden Papier auch .
Dass es also möglicherweise nicht ganz neutral ausfallen würde , war zu erwarten .
Was aber schließlich herauskam , das heißt für ARD , ZDF und Konsorten unter dem Strich 500 Millionen weniger durch ein Werbeverbot , aber 800 Millionen mehr auf Kosten von Sozialversicherten , Steuerzahlern und Geringverdienern .
Kirchhof gibt in seinem Gutachten nicht nur den bereits seit längerem bekannten Politikerplänen für die Umwandlung der bisherigen geräteabhängigen Rundfunkgebühr in eine Haushaltspauschale sein licet , sondern macht im Zuge der Argumentation , wie sie seiner Ansicht nach so gestaltet werden kann , dass sie weder dem Grundgesetz noch EU - Vorschriften widerspricht , gleich den Vorschlag , dass man die bisherigen Befreiungen für Transferleistungsempfänger abschaffen solle .
Die Betroffenen , so Kirchhof , könnten ja einen Ausgleich von den Sozialkassen bekommen , der über einen Zusatz zum Wohngeld ausgezahlt wird .
Abgesehen davon , dass nicht jeder Transferleistungsempfänger Wohngeld bekommt , sind die Kassen von Renten - und Arbeitslosenversicherung allerdings so chronisch unterfüllt , dass das Problem damit an den Bundeshaushalt delegiert wäre .
Kirchhofs Modell bleibt deshalb trotz seiner Begriffssophisterei , mit der er darlegen will , dass eine einkommensabhängige Gebühr eine Steuer ( und damit verboten ) sei , nichts anderes als eine Steuererhöhung mit Etikettenschwindel .
Hinzu kommt , dass ein direkt oder indirekt aus dem Bundeshaushalt gezahlter Sozialausgleich ( sei er für die Kopfpauschale im Gesundheitswesen oder für die Haushaltspauschale bei der Rundfunkgebühr ) spätestens mit dem Inkrafttreten der " Schuldenbremse " auf den Prüfstand kommt - und dann sehr wahrscheinlich abgeschafft wird .
Doch auch jetzt schon ist der Bundeshaushalt so belastet , dass man sich durchaus fragen kann , warum Kirchhof den Sendern nicht nur die 500 Millionen Euro , die sie bisher mit Werbung erwirtschaften , durch ein leistungsloses Einkommen ersetzen will , sondern auch , warum Sozialversicherte , Steuerzahler und sozial Schwache seinem Modell nach noch einmal 300 Millionen Euro obendrauf legen sollen .
Als ob es den Fall Brender nie gegeben hätte
Es ist allerdings bei weitem nicht die einzige Frage , die in dem Papier offen bleibt : Die Problematik der Staatsferne des öffentlich rechtlichen Rundfunks bügelt Kirchhof beispielsweise nur mit einer sehr verkürzten Wiedergabe der alten Rechtsprechung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts ab : Danach ist Staatsferne dann gegeben , wenn der Gesetzgeber " die Rundfunkgesetzgebung von der Abgabengesetzgebung trennt , den Abgabentatbestand in einer Allgemeinheit von hoher Abstraktion regelt und sachfremde Einflüsse auf die Abgabenentscheidungen durch ein Verfahren zurückweist . "
1
Das liest sich ganz so , als ob es den Fall Brender und die dazugehörigen juristischen wie öffentlichen Debatten , inwieweit diese Staatsferne tatsächlich praktisch und nicht nur theoretisch vorhanden ist , nie gegeben hätte .
Hubertus Gersdorf etwa , Juraprofessor in Rostock , kam anhand dieses Falles zu dem Ergebnis , dass das ZDF dem Bürger eine staatsfreie Berichterstattung schulde , die jedoch nach derzeitiger Zusammensetzung von Fernsehrat und Verwaltungsrat nicht gegeben sei .
Und weil es hieran fehlt , gibt es ihm zufolge auch keine Legitimation , die Bürger zwangsweise zur Finanzierung heranzuziehen .
Eigentlich sehr grundlegende und durchaus einschlägige Gedanken eines Kollegen , auf die Kirchhof in seinem Gutachten eingehen hätte müssen .
Die Frage der Staatsferne , die der Heidelberger so beiläufig beiseite schiebt , wird zudem um so wichtiger , als ARD , ZDF und die anderen öffentlich - rechtlichen Anstalten nach Inkrafttreten des neuen Leistungsschutzrechts die einzigen bundesdeutschen Medien sein werden , auf die sich gefahrlos verlinkt lässt .
In diesem Zusammenhang wäre unter anderem die Frage zu prüfen , ob dieses Leistungsschutzrecht in seiner geplanten Form nicht gegen EU - Rundfunkrecht verstößt .
Auch praktisch alle anderen interessanten Probleme spart der Heidelberger Professor auf den 85 Seiten einfach konsequent aus : Dazu gehört die Frage , warum die öffentlich - rechtlichen Sender ihr Angebot nicht einfach verschlüsseln , und nur von Konsumwilligen kassieren , ebenso wie die Tatsache , dass die Ausweitung der Zahlungspflicht auf Computerbenutzer , die bewusst auf Radio und Fernsehen verzichten , zu einer sinkenden Akzeptanz der Gebühr führte und die Qualität der Degeto- , Pilcher - , Knopp- , Volksmusik - und Soap - geprägten Hauptangebote den Effekt hatte , dass immer mehr Menschen das Modell des öffentlich - rechtlichen Rundfunks überhaupt infrage stellten .
Einsparmöglichkeiten ausgespart
Überwiegend oder ausschließlich Grundversorgung im engeren Sinne bieten nur mehr der Bildungskanal BR alpha und eine Handvoll Radioprogramme wie Bayern 2 , Deutschlandfunk und Deutschlandradio Kultur .
Dabei sind diese echten Grundversorgungssender deutlich billiger , als die Hauptprogramme , die sich spätestens seit den 1990 ern hauptsächlich als Konkurrenz zum Privatfernsehen gebärden .
Und während das ZDF 2008 mit 1,73 Milliarden fast ein Viertel der GEZ - Gesamteinnahmen verschlang , kam ein Sender wie Deutschlandradio Kultur mit 183 Millionen Euro aus .
Rechnet man großzügige 400 Millionen für einen öffentlich - rechtlichen Bildungskanal , dann wäre eine stattliche Grundversorgung mit einem Fernseh - und drei Radiokanälen schon für deutlich weniger als eine Milliarde Euro zu haben .
Ein Bruchteil dessen , was der öffentlich - rechtliche Rundfunk jetzt kostet - wodurch die Gebühr von 17,98 monatlich auf 2,50 Euro sinken könnte .
In solch einem Modell müssten die Hauptsender nicht unbedingt abgewickelt , sondern könnten privatisiert werden .
Doch mit der Privatisierung ist es eine seltsame Sache : Einerseits wurden reihenweise natürliche Monopole oder andere dafür völlig ungeeignete Objekte wie die Rentenversicherung ( teil ) privatisiert , andererseits gibt es zum Fernsehsender ZDF oder zum Programm Das Erste , deren schadlose Privatisierung sich geradezu aufdrängt , nicht einmal eine Debatte darüber .
Ein Schelm , wer denkt , dies könnte eventuell mit einer mangelnden " Staatsferne " der Angebote zu tun haben .
Hinzu kommt , dass heute ( anders als in der Vergangenheit ) statt eines Informationsmangels ein Informationsüberfluss herrscht .
Deshalb wird sich möglicherweise auch das Bundesverfassungsgericht einmal mit der Frage beschäftigen , inwieweit technologische Neuerungen das verändern , was " Grundversorgung " ist .
Und , ob das Vorhalten von Anstalten , die sich ( wie unter anderem der Drehbuchskandal ins Bewusstsein rief ) zu Verteilungsnetzwerken entwickelt haben , tatsächlich geeignet , erforderlich und angemessen zur Sicherung solch einer Grundversorgung ist .
Ein milderes Mittel als das Kassieren von 7,26 Milliarden Euro Zwangsgebühren wäre schon jetzt in Sicht : Die Abschaffung des Fliegenden Gerichtsstandes und die Eindämmung von Missbrauchsmöglichkeiten im Abmahnrecht würden zu einer Stärkung von Presse - und Redefreiheit führen , mit der sich ganz ohne subventionierte Konkurrenz zu Bertelsmann eine bessere Informationsqualität und eine größere Meinungsvielfalt herstellen ließen .
Aber auf Einsparmöglichkeiten geht das Kirchhof - Gutachten genauso wenig ein wie auf die Geeignetheit , Angemessenheit und Erforderlichkeit der vorhandenen Infrastruktur .
Und wahrscheinlich gerade wegen dieses offensichtlichen Mangels bejubelten nicht nur die Funktionäre des öffentlich - rechtlichen Fernsehens , sondern auch die Manager des privaten und Politiker aller Parteien das Papier : ARD - Chef Peter Boudgoust sprach von einer " logisch nachvollziehbaren Grundidee " , die " alle wichtigen verfassungs - und europarechtlichen Aspekte " einbeziehen würde , ZDF - Intendant Markus Schächter fand es " klar und prägnant " , der Verband Privater Rundfunk und Telemedien ( VPRT ) meldete , dass er Kirchhofs Pläne " begrüßen " würde und der schleswig - holsteinische Ministerpräsident Peter Harry Carstensen lobte das Werk als " gute Basis für eine fundierte weitere Behandlung des Themas " .
Der rheinland - pfälzische Ministerpräsident Kurt Beck , mehrere FDP - Landespolitiker und die medienpolitische Sprecherin der Grünen - Bundestagsfraktion , Tabea Rößner , arbeiten bereits seit längerem auf eine " Haushaltsgebühr " hin .
Ihre Begründung dafür ist , wie bei Flat - Tax - und Kopfpauschaleplänen , dass das Modell " einfacher " sei .
Nun steht zu erwarten , dass die Ministerpräsidenten der Länder möglicherweise schon in ihrer nächsten Sitzung am 9 .
Juni Kirchhofs Gutachten in Entwurfsform bringen .

Private lenders have exploded in popularity over the last decade or so with people all over the UK .
If you are in a situation where you need to borrow money , this is an option you should at least look into .
Fewer people than ever are going to banks or even credit unions to obtain loans .
When you take the time to learn about these lenders and what they have to offer , you ’ll be in a better position make the right choice .
It ’s All Very Simple
Getting an online loan from a private lending company is a very simple process that does n’t you require following any complicated steps .
In fact , it is possible to get one of these loans the same day .
You just fill out an application on the lender ’s website and wait for a reply .
If you do get approved , you will have to look over and sign the loan agreement .
Once you have completed all of these steps , you just have to wait to receive your money .
These lenders do n’t make getting the money you need overly difficult like so many banks .
You Can do it All Online
One of the most appealing things about borrowing from private lenders online is the fact that it can all be done from home .
You wo n’t have to go anywhere to pick up an application , which is always nice .
Everything is done electronically , including the transfer of funds into your bank account .
This is a big part of what makes this process so easy and convenient .
Your Credit is n’t as much of a Factor
All legitimate lenders will run a credit check when you are applying for a loan , but that does n’t mean you should worry .
The fact is that bad credit is n’t nearly as much of an obstacle with private lenders as it is with banks .
It is actually pretty easy to get approved if you have bad credit , provided you meet the lender ’s minimum criteria .
If you are having a hard time getting a loan from a bank for this reason , private lenders have a lot to offer .
You Can Get the Money You Need Right Away
When you have some crucial expense that needs to be paid immediately , a private lender is the best option there is .
Payday loans can provide you with the funds you need within 24 hours .
Most people who get approved end up receiving their money just hours after submitting their application .
This can be useful in a variety of situations .
If you have car repairs you need done or some other important expense , you should keep this in mind .
There are Lots of Lenders to Choose from
The proliferation of private lending companies means that you will have lots of options available .
It is important that you take the time to look into these choices you have before making a final decision .
You want to get the best possible deal , which means looking into some of these businesses online .
Just visiting each of these lender ’s websites can provide you with a lot of very useful information .
It ’s also highly recommended that you read reviews for these companies .
Find out what other people have to say about them based on their past dealings .
Flexible Terms
Private lenders are often very flexible with the terms of their loans .
You could get up to a month to pay back the money you borrow , though it ’s not always a good idea .
The point is that these lenders tend to be a lot more flexible than the average bank .
This ultimately means a higher chance of getting what you need with minimal to no downside .
When you are looking for the right lender to borrow from , you ’ll need to find one that is highly flexible .
No Additional Fees
It really is n’t all that difficult to find a private lender that wo n’t charge you any fees on top of your interest rate .
While this is not the case with all of these lenders , there are quite a few that have a “ no fees ” policy .
You should keep this in mind when you are trying to find the right lender to borrow from , as it can save you a lot of money .
Borrowing from a private lender is often times a very smart decision , especially if you need money in a hurry .
Most people should n’t even bother trying to get a loan from banks , as it is just too difficult .
The internet is the best resource you have when it comes to obtaining a loan .
You will get a maximum level of convenience , which will make this process a lot easier .
There is simply no point in waiting longer than you need to or paying more than necessary for your loan .
An ambulance pulling into Lawrence Memorial Hospital from the site of an industrial accident Thursday had to be quarantined for several hours , as officials from Lawrence - Douglas County Fire Medical analyzed the substance that apparently had caused all the trouble .
Their identification : cane molasses .
“ Once it ’s exposed to the air and it ’s properly ventilated , it can be scrubbed down and washed away with soap and water , ” said Jeff Novorr , LMH vice president .
“ Once we realized what it was , that ’s what we did . ”
While the molasses might be unusual in that it was being used to enhance fertilizer products at MagnaGro International — “ I do n’t think it ’s the same type of molasses that you would go to Hy - Vee and buy and put on your pancakes , ” Novorr said — the normally harmless product can be problematic under certain conditions .
When kept in a confined and enclosed space , Novorr said , gases given off by the material can gather and reach unhealthy concentrations .
“ One of which is carbon monoxide , which , ultimately , can be fatal , ” Novorr said .
“ When it ’s used and stored in ventilated areas , you would n’t have the accumulation of gas . ”
Novorr emphasized that he was unfamiliar with specific site conditions at MagnaGro , 600 E. 22nd St. , and that he was not involved in or familiar with any investigation to determine exactly what happened Thursday at the site , where two MagnaGro employees died .

It 's probably been a tough week for Apple engineer Gray Powell , what with him reportedly losing a next - generation iPhone in a bar , only to see photos of the super - secret device later spashed across the internet .
Tech blogs say Powell left the prototype , which was disguised as an iPhone 3GS , behind at Gourmet Haus Staudt , a German beer hall in Redwood City , California .
The iPhone was later sold to tech blog Gizmodo for $ 5,000 .
There 's been rampant speculation that Powell is in trouble with Apple for losing the phone .
But Lufthansa , the German airline , is offering to help the 27 - year - old drown his sorrows .
The airline ’s director of marketing and customer relations has written an open letter to Powell , dated April 21 and posted on the internet .
“ I recently read in the news that you lost a very special phone at a German beer bar in California , " writes Nicola C. Lange .
" We all know how frustrating it can be to lose personal belongings … at Lufthansa we also noted with great interest your passion for German beer and culture . "
Lange goes on to say , " [ Lufthansa ] would like to offer you complimentary Business Class transportation to Munich where you can literally pick up where you left off . ”
The letter was attached to a tweet posted on the airline ’s Twitter page Thursday .
It said , “ If you can help us get in touch with Gray Powell , we ’d like to fly him to Munich . ”
As marketing gimmicks go , this is a pretty good one .
There was no word as of late Thursday on whether Powell had accepted the offer .
But if he does , maybe he should leave his iPhone at home .

Mozilla is rightly concerned that users upgrade promptly after new versions of Firefox are released , and a user survey has revealed why they do n't .
Mozilla is rightly concerned that users upgrade promptly after new versions of Firefox are released , and a user survey has revealed why they do n't .
The Mozilla Blog of Metrics has issued # 4 in a series Why People Don't Upgrade Their Browser .
The new versions of Firefox are invariably more secure than the older ones , and so Mozilla has begun to study user reactions and survey users for their reasoning .
A few weeks ago , Firefox 3 users received a warning that their browser was about to reach the end of it 's support life :
Users who clicked " No thanks " on the warning were directed to a survey and Mozilla got 40,000 responses .
The majority said they were not upgrading to 3.6 because they were happy with version 3 .
A significant number said they did n't have time to upgrade , which is a shame since it takes very little time .
Mozilla will address this in the future by stressing in the upgrade notice that the process is " relatively quick and painless . "
The second question asked for any thoughts the user had about why they were n't upgrading .
More than a third were concerned about compatibility problems with web sites , plugins , etc. , and this is a fair point as it has been with every new major version of Firefox .
Fewer users complained about stability and performance than in previous versions of the survey .
The time issue and complaints of " too many updates " are definitely a problem , but one I think can be best addressed through education ; updates are necessary and not a burdensome task .

According to data released today ( Monday ) by the Swedish statistical office Sweden unexpectedly fell back into recession in the fourth quarter , adding to the impression there has been a growth dip among Europe ’s economies and raising further questions about the durability of the recovery in Europe .
Gross domestic product contracted by a seasonally adjusted 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2009 ( when compared with the previous three months ) , despite analyst expectations for growth of 0.3 per cent .
In addition the third - quarter figure was revised to a 0.1 per cent quarterly decline ( down from an original 0.2 per cent gain ) which means that Sweden is now back in recession .
Year on year GDP was down by 1 % , following a 4.8 % fall in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
That is to say Swedish GDP is now down by just under 6 % from GDP in Q4 2007 .
Exports seem to be a big part of the problem , despite the earlier devaluation in the Krona .
In this sense my earlier optimism was misplaced .
In fact , exports have fallen in every quarter since the start of the long contraction .
Indeed , far from this expansion being export - lead , it is household and government consumption which have been the positive components in growth .
Capital investment is still contracting , as it is almost everywhere in Europe , which is one of the obvious weaknesses in the recovery .
But I say “ what is going on ” in my title , since I am at this very moment going through all the February Purchasing Managers Index ( PMI ) results , and Sweden has come in , for the second month running , as the global leader , with a reading of 61.5 , which in theory suggests a strong expansion in the manufacturing sector .
But it is n’t only the January and February 2010 data which have been strong , if you look at the PMI chart ( below ) in theory Swedish manufacturing has been expanding since June last year .
Yet if we come to look at the manufacturing output data as supplied to Eurostat , there is no sign whatever of any sort of recovery in Swedish manufacturing .
Really I think SILF / Swedbank owe us all some sort of explanation for this state of affairs , since at the very least something must be way out of line in their methodology .
And please note , this survey is NOT produced by Markit economics , whose PMIs are normally far more reliable .
Just Cause 2 was designed by the government to pacify the masses and prevent people from getting anything done .
That ’s just a theory , though .
I might be wrong .
But the ludicrous amount of time one can sink into this game in one sitting is simply astonishing .
It ’s sandbox mayhem at its finest .
The game follows Rico Rodriguez , an operative for the ‘ Agency ’ assigned to the small island nation of Panau .
The plot quickly becomes boring and predictable and you ’ll find yourself avoiding the story missions from the get - go .
The writing has all of the faults of a B - movie script but none of the quirky charm that comes with it .
However , it does n’t break the game seeing as the entire game world is open to you right from the start .
Players will be able to enjoy dozens of hours of gameplay without ever completing a single mission .
Normally , a poorly written plot and repetitive missions would result in a mediocre game .
But seeing as Just Cause 2 does n’t force you to play through the plot , the quality of it is moot .
You ’ll want to play a few missions because there are several that are brain - blastingly awesome , but most of them boil down to attacking a location , eliminating a target , or rescuing someone .
The problem is that it takes enormous discipline to play missions .
On your way to any given location , you ’ll come across buildings to destroy , Colonels to assassinate , and general insanity of which you must partake .
After 10 hours of gameplay , most will have only completed a handful of missions because the amount of stuff to do and the size of Panau is staggering .
Aside from the story missions given to you by the Agency , Rico can assume the role of Scorpio , a gun - for - hire , and complete tasks for any of the three factions on the island .
Working for one particular faction over another does n’t hold any inherent benefit , and in the end it ’s just a way to cause a bit more chaos and earn some more cash .
As for getting around the 400 square miles of game world , your most invaluable tool will be the Grapple .
With a range of several hundred feet , it makes scaling mountains or crossing bodies of water a cinch .
Using it in conjunction with your parachute allows you to travel miles in minutes without ever resorting to a vehicle .
Another important gameplay aspect is the Stunt Jump feature .
Using it , you can ‘ ride ’ the tops of cars , trucks , and planes , moving around and using the vehicle as cover .
This allows you to jump onto an enemy vehicle during a high - speed chase or grapple onto a passing plane to escape your attackers .
In addition to allowing you to grapple onto any surface , you can also ‘ Dual Hook ’ by attaching the grapple to two separate surfaces .
Doing this , you can tie enemies to vehicles and drag them until they ’re dead , pull down statues of the Panauan dictator , or do anything else that might come to mind .
Alongside your grapple is a modest arsenal of weapons , all of which can be upgraded , and over 100 vehicles , which can also be upgraded .
Parts can be found in supply drops scattered around Panau and they ’re awarded for completing faction and story missions .
Always at your beck and call is the Black Market Dealer , who can deliver weapons , a select few vehicles , or airlift you to any previously discovered location on the map .
It ’s quite a useful feature , but you can only buy one weapon or item at a time , making it tedious to replenish all of your ammo before a large firefight .
Enemies absorb unreasonable amounts of damage before finally dying , but the game gives you an unfair advantage should you have access to a mounted gun , all of which have infinite ammunition .
Grabbing one and removing it from its stand will hinder your movement , but it will allow you to take down enemy and structure alike in seconds .
Cannons , machine guns , and rockets on tanks , helicopters , and jets also have unlimited ammo .
The game must be commended for realizing that its strongest point is destruction .
While other games might have imposed limits or required you to do more in order to wreak havoc , Just Cause 2 lets you off the leash after the first 20 minutes and from there on out , the game is what you want it to be .
The world is chock full of Easter Eggs and interesting locations and while several military bases do look identical and players will quickly fall into a groove , none of that seems to matter when you blow up an oil rig or bail out of a 747 just before a mid-air collision .
Just Cause 2 is available for the PC , PS3 , and 360 but the platform of choice is definitely the PC .
Thanks to a free modification known as the Bolo Mod , players can enjoy unbreakable grapples in infinite numbers .
As a result , PC players are able to do things that console owners can’t like tethering two planes permanently together in flight .
Or gamers can web teams of enemies to the rafters and street lights Spider - Man-style .
If Eidos knew what was good for them , they ’d release the mod for the consoles and sell it as DLC .
If you ’re debating which console to play it on , the PS3 version is the best , as it features a capturing mechanic that allows you to save clips to your HDD or upload them directly to YouTube .
There ’s even a way to have the game constantly recording so that when you pull off that one - in - a - million stunt , you can automatically save the past 30 seconds of footage .
The thing about Just Cause 2 is that you will always end up playing longer than you intended .
You always see one more vehicle you want to try .
There ’s always one more crazy stunt to try .
A rental might be wise for those who are n’t particularly font of sandbox shooters , but for everyone else , this is a must buy .
The longevity of the game more than justifies the price tag and it ’s the kind of game that keeps on giving .

RELEASE : 10-080
NASA 's Unpiloted Global Hawk Completes First Science Flight
WASHINGTON -- NASA has successfully completed the first science flight of the Global Hawk unpiloted aircraft system over the Pacific Ocean .
The flight was the first of five scheduled for this month 's Global Hawk Pacific , or GloPac , mission to study atmospheric science over the Pacific and Arctic oceans .
The Global Hawk is a robotic plane that can fly autonomously to altitudes above 60,000 feet -- roughly twice as high as a commercial airliner -- and as far as 11,000 nautical miles , which is half the circumference of Earth .
Operators pre-program a flight path , then the plane flies itself for as long as 30 hours , staying in contact through satellite and line - of - site communications links to a ground control station at NASA 's Dryden Flight Research Center in California 's Mojave Desert .
"
The Global Hawk is a revolutionary aircraft for science because of its enormous range and endurance , " said Paul Newman , co-mission scientist for GloPac and an atmospheric scientist from NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " No other science platform provides the range and time to sample rapidly evolving atmospheric phenomena .
This mission is our first opportunity to demonstrate the unique capabilities of this plane , while gathering atmospheric data in a region that is poorly sampled .
" GloPac researchers plan to directly measure and sample greenhouse gases , ozone - depleting substances , aerosols , and constituents of air quality in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere .
GloPac 's measurements will cover longer time periods and greater geographic distances than any other science aircraft .
During Wednesday 's flight , the plane flew approximately 4,500 nautical miles along a flight path that took it to 150.3 degrees
West longitude , and 54.6 degrees North latitude , just south of Alaska 's Kodiak Island .
The flight lasted just over 14 hours and flew up to 60,900 feet .
The mission is a joint project with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , or NOAA .
The plane carries 11 instruments to sample the chemical composition of the troposphere and stratosphere .
The instruments profile the dynamics and meteorology of both layers and observe the distribution of clouds and aerosol particles .
Project scientists expect to take observations from the equator north to the Arctic Circle and west of Hawaii .
Although the plane is designed to fly on its own , pilots can change its course or altitude based on interesting atmospheric phenomena ahead .
Researchers have the ability via communications links to control their instruments from the ground .
" The Global Hawk is a fantastic platform because it gives us expanded access to the atmosphere beyond what we have with piloted aircraft , " said David Fahey , co-mission scientist and a research physicist at NOAA 's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder , Colo .
" We can go to regions we could n't reach or go to previously explored regions and study them for extended periods that are impossible with conventional planes .
" The timing of GloPac flights should allow scientists to observe the breakup of the polar vortex .
The vortex is a large - scale cyclone in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere that dominates winter weather patterns around the Arctic and is particularly important for understanding ozone depletion in the Northern Hemisphere .
Scientists also expect to gather high - altitude data between 45,000 and 65,000 feet , where many greenhouse gases and ozone - depleting substances are destroyed .
They will measure dust , smoke and pollution that cross the Pacific from Asia and Siberia and affect U.S. air quality .
The Global Hawk will make several flights directly under the path of NASA 's Aura satellite and other " A - train " Earth - observing satellites , " allowing us to calibrate and confirm what we see from space , " Newman added .
GloPac is specifically being conducted in conjunction with NASA 's Aura Validation Experiment .
The GloPac mission includes more than 130 researchers and technicians from NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Dryden Flight Research Center , Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , and Ames Research Center in Moffett Field , Calif .
Also involved are NOAA 's Earth System Research Laboratory ; the University of California , Santa Cruz ; Droplet Measurement Technologies of Boulder , Colo . ; and the University of Denver .
NASA Dryden and the Northrop Grumman Corp. of Rancho Bernardo , Calif. , signed a Space Act Agreement to re-fit and maintain three Global Hawks transferred from the U.S. Air Force for use in high - altitude , long - duration Earth science missions .

A New Jersey family that lost one daughter rock - climbing four years ago lost a second daughter last week to a vacation tragedy .
Morristown art student Lauren Failla , 25 , was attacked and killed by a crocodile on April 29 while snorkeling at a tropical island resort in India , authorities said .
Her older sister , Emily , a 24 - year - old teacher , fell to her death while rock - climbing in Washington state in July 2006 .
Lauren Failla was killed on April 29 .
She was swimming with a friend in the turquoise waters off Radhanagar Beach on Havelock Island in Andaman when the croc suddenly struck , according to Indian media reports .
Failla ’s companion reportedly videotaped the attack as the crocodile clamped the victim in its jaws and pulled her to her doom .
Her body was found on a nearby beach the next day .
The sisters ’ parents , Frank and Kay Failla , are devastated , said relatives .
As you 've probably heard , everyone heading out to see Iron Man 2 this weekend — “ clean and efficient , ” raves Scott Tobias — will also get a first look at J.J. Abrams ’ secret - but - also - not collaboration with Steven Spielberg , Super 8 , courtesy of a special sneak trailer .
Abrams confirmed a few details about the film to Entertainment Weekly today , saying that he ’s directing it this fall under a budget of $ 45 million , plans to complete it for release next summer before immediately moving on to Star Trek 2 ’s summer 2012 release date , and that it will serve as “ an homage to the sci - fi films Abrams loved as a teenager . ”
That ’s evident in the brief synopsis of what you can expect to see in the preview , which Deadline describes thusly :
“ A pickup truck veers onto a train track , heading directly for a locomotive .
The legend appears : ‘ In 1979 , the US Air Force closed a section of Area 51 .
All the materials were to be transported to a secure facility in Ohio . ’
The truck hits the train , and both fly off the tracks in an explosion .
Focus on one train car that was spared , and a heavy pounding is heard from inside . ”

Carbon nanotube sensor detects hydrogen peroxide emanating from a single living cell
( Nanowerk News ) MIT chemical engineers have built a sensor array that , for the first time , can detect single molecules of hydrogen peroxide emanating from a single living cell .
Hydrogen peroxide has long been known to damage cells and their DNA , but scientists have recently uncovered evidence that points to a more beneficial role : it appears to act as a signaling molecule in a critical cell pathway that stimulates growth , among other functions .
When that pathway goes awry , cells can become cancerous , so understanding hydrogen peroxide 's role could lead to new targets for potential cancer drugs , says Michael Strano , leader of the research team .
Strano and his colleagues describe their new sensor array , which is made of carbon nanotubes , in the March 7 online edition of Nature Nanotechnology .
Strano 's team used the array to study the flux of hydrogen peroxide that occurs when a common growth factor called EGF activates its target , a receptor known as EGFR , located on cell surfaces .
For the first time , the team showed that hydrogen peroxide levels more than double when EGFR is activated .
EGF and other growth factors induce cells to grow or divide through a complex cascade of reactions inside the cell .
It 's still unclear exactly how hydrogen peroxide affects this process , but Strano speculates that it may somehow amplify the EGFR signal , reinforcing the message to the cell .
Because hydrogen peroxide is a small molecule that does n't diffuse far ( about 200 nanometers ) , the signal would be limited to the cell where it was produced .
The team also found that in skin cancer cells , believed to have overactive EGFR activity , the hydrogen peroxide flux was 10 times greater than in normal cells .
Because of that dramatic difference , Strano believes this technology could be useful in building diagnostic devices for some types of cancer .
" You could envision a small handheld device , for example , which your doctor could point at some tissue in a minimally invasive manner and tell if this pathway is corrupted , " he says .
Strano points out that this is the first time an array of sensors with single - molecule specificity has ever been demonstrated .
He and his colleagues derived mathematically that such an array can distinguish " near field " molecular generation from that which takes place far from the sensor surface .
" Arrays of this type have the ability to distinguish , for example , if single molecules are coming from an enzyme located on the cell surface , or from deep within the cell , " says Strano .
How they did it :
The sensor consists of a film of carbon nanotubes embedded in collagen .
Cells can grow on the collagen surface , and the collagen also attracts and traps hydrogen peroxide released by the cell .
When the nanotubes come in contact with the trapped hydrogen peroxide , their fluorescence flickers .
By counting the flickers , one can obtain an accurate count of the incident molecules .
Next steps : Researchers in Strano's lab plan to study different forms of the EGF receptor to better characterize the hydrogen peroxide flux and its role in cell signaling .
They have already discovered that molecules of oxygen are consumed to generate the peroxide .
Strano 's team is also working on carbon nanotube sensors for other molecules .
The team has already successfully tested sensors for nitric oxide and ATP ( the molecule that carries energy within a cell ) .
" The list of biomolecules that we can now detect very specifically and selectively is growing rapidly , " says Strano , who also points out that the ability to detect and count single molecules sets carbon nanotubes apart from many other nanosensor platforms .
FOREIGN students and temporary residents will face tough new rules when buying a house and will have to sell on leaving Australia .
The Federal Government 's crackdown , to be announced today , reverses its December 2008 decision to relax foreign ownership rules .
Bowing to public pressure , the Government will also introduce a hotline for concerned locals to " dob in " foreigners they suspect of breaching the rules .
Under the rules , temporary residents and foreign students will be :
SCREENED by the Foreign Investment Review Board to determine if they will be allowed to buy a property .
FORCED to sell property when they leave Australia .
PUNISHED if they do not sell by a government - ordered sale plus confiscation of any capital gain .
REQUIRED to build on vacant land within two years of purchase to stop " land banking " .
Failure to do this would also lead to a government - ordered sale .
There have been growing claims that real estate prices have been forced up by wealthy Asian families , especially from China and Korea , buying up property and outbidding locals at auctions .
The Government is concerned by anecdotal reports that foreigners are " collecting " houses , often in the same street , and leaving them empty when there is a shortage of housing .
Assistant Treasurer Senator Nick Sherry said he wanted to ensure foreigners did not put " pressure on housing availability for Australians " .
Treasury is investigating 50 suspicious residential buys by foreigners in Melbourne .
Senator Sherry said the changes would " ensure that investment is in Australia 's interests and in line with community expectations " .
He said the Government would catch cheats with new powers allowing it to cross-match information from Land Victoria and the Immigration Department .
It will also rely on members of the public to report suspicious property buyers to a new hotline : 1 800 031 227 .
" I want to make sure everyone in the community has a direct line to report their concerns , " Senator Sherry said .
" If you do the wrong thing , you will be found out . "
New penalties , which may be linked to the value of the property , will apply to buyers , sellers and estate agents .
There is no data showing how many properties have been bought by temporary residents .
Since the Government 's 2008 change , the median house price in Melbourne has risen from $ 450,000 to $ 524,500 .
Foreigners living overseas are still prevented from buying existing homes and only allowed to buy or build new ones .

Click on the pictures to read profiles of David Cameron 's Conservative - Lib Dem coalition cabinet : PRIME MINISTER - DAVID CAMERON Conservative David Cameron was virtually unknown outside Westminster when he was elected Tory leader in December 2005 at the age of 39 .
The Old Etonian had dazzled that year 's party conference with his youthful dynamism and charisma , reportedly telling journalists he was the " heir to Blair " .

When Sir Menzies Campbell resigned as leader in 2007 , he entered the race to succeed him , in the end narrowly beating Chris Huhne .
He has campaigned against the government over civil liberties and opposed the Conservatives ' spending cuts plans , attempting to create a distance between the Lib Dems and what he calls the " old parties " .
But he really came to prominence during the televised debates ahead of the general elections , being judged in polls to have been the big winner of the first one .
However , this appeared to do little to help the Lib Dems when they actually lost seats on 6 May .
The party , though , retained enough MPs to become the vital players in the hung parliament .

Junior Defence Minister - Andrew Robathan ( Conservative ) Return LORD CHANCELLOR AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR JUSTICE - KEN CLARKE
Mr Cameron has previously said that Mr Clarke was a " big figure " with " great experience " .
He was the last chancellor to lead the UK out of recession - during the John Major government of the 1990s .
His return to the Tory frontbench last year was seen as somewhat of a gamble for Mr Cameron given that Mr Clarke - who held a host of ministerial jobs in the Thatcher and Major governments - had staunchly pro-European views .
These views were widely seen to be the reason for his failure to win the three party leadership contests he entered - but Mr Cameron decided that Mr Clarke 's experience was worth the risk of reopening party splits .
Mr Clarke was president of the union at Cambridge , became a QC in 1980 and after a succession of junior ministerial jobs he served as health , education and home secretaries before becoming chancellor from 1993 to 1997 .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A long - awaited compromise bill to reduce U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases blamed for global warming will be unveiled by a group of senators on April 26 , sources said on Thursday .
The U.S. Capitol building is seen before the start of President Barack Obama 's primetime address to a joint session of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives on Capitol Hill in Washington February 24 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jim Young
The legislative language to be sketched out in 11 days , according to government and environmental sources , is being drafted by Democratic Senator John Kerry , Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and independent Senator Joseph Lieberman .
Backers of the environmental bill hope the unveiling will pave the way for the full Senate to debate and pass a measure in June or July if the compromise attracts enough support from a group of moderate Republicans and Democrats .
Republican Senator Judd Gregg told Reuters he was “ committed to getting something that addresses our energy needs in a constructive and comprehensive way . ”
He added he did not know yet whether he would support the bill being developed .
President Barack Obama has made climate change one of his top priorities and took steps recently to show Republicans he was serious , including expanding federal aid for building nuclear power facilities and allowing more domestic offshore oil drilling -- initiatives to be included in the Senate compromise .
The White House is also eager to show the rest of the world the United States is ready to take a leadership role on global warming , including to help kick - start stalled international efforts to tackle the problem .
Despite vocal climate change skeptics in the United States , leading scientific groups have been hoping the United States , the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China , would take action .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported on Thursday the world ’s combined land and ocean surface temperatures in March were the hottest on record .
Once the senators formally sketch out their bill , Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid will decide the next steps in a year crowded with competing legislative priorities and congressional elections in November .
The bill could face stiff opposition from lawmakers in states with economies heavily dependent on oil and coal .
Lou Hayden , a policy expert at the American Petroleum Institute , said his group would not support the bill unless it went through an economic analysis by the Energy Information Administration , an independent arm of the Energy Department .
The bill is already slated to be analyzed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Congressional Budget Office , which could take more than a month .
BILL MIGHT END STATE / REGIONAL CARBON TRADE PROGRAMS
Kerry , Lieberman and Graham have been working for months on a global warming compromise significantly different from a measure passed last year by the House of Representatives and a bill approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee .
It also takes many elements from those bills .
Like the House - passed bill and Obama administration policy , it would set a target of 17 percent reductions in smokestack emissions of carbon dioxide by 2020 , from 2005 levels .
Point Carbon , an energy markets consulting service , estimated the anticipated Senate bill would result in U.S. gasoline prices rising an average of 27 cents a gallon from 2013 to 2020 .
The bill is expected to contain a fee on motor fuels .
On Wednesday , a Senate source told Reuters the legislation would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating carbon dioxide emissions .
It would also end state and regional carbon - trading programs , such as the one several Northeastern states participate in , to be replaced by a national carbon reduction policy .
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative , with 10 participating states from Vermont to Maryland , has raised over $ 582 million for state efficiency and climate programs , said Environment Northeast , a Boston research group .
Peter Shattuck , a carbon markets policy analyst there , said shutting the program could create concerns among the states over lost revenues .
A group of nine senators , mostly from Midwestern manufacturing states , urged Kerry , Graham and Lieberman in a letter on Thursday to take into account jobs in their states .
“ Without such a plan , we are concerned that the legislation will ultimately be unsuccessful , ” Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown and others wrote .
ANALYSIS : The North has never paid its way and there are worries that aid has blunted enterprise spirit , writes DAN KEENAN
OWEN PATERSON is not the first Conservative to try to rein in British exchequer spending in Northern Ireland .
The first Thatcher government in 1979 curbed the rise in spending by Britain on Northern Ireland , apart from security , as efforts were made to control spending .
The attempt was in keeping with that administration ’s policy of neoliberal market economics .
Yet , British government spending on Northern Ireland started to rise noticeably again in the early 1990s as the first signs of an emerging peace process were noted .
The British government block grant , or subvention , to the North began a steady rise to the point where it stands today at more than £ 9 billion ( €10.5 billion ) .
British funding mechanisms for the regions and the devolved administrations are complex .
But it is not an oversimplification to suggest that annual British spending in the North sits at between £ 16 billion and £ 17 billion .
This figure includes the sums granted by the exchequer to Stormont for allocation by the devolved administration – the Departmental Expenditure Limits – and the amount given directly by the treasury to cover welfare costs and related items , known as annually managed expenditure .
According to estimates provided by the Stormont Department of Finance and Personnel , the Executive has between £ 9 billion and £ 10 billion to spend on its services .
Moreover Northern Ireland , in general , benefits from a net gain of about £ 6 billion when total spending and taxes raised are taken into consideration .
This means that roughly for every man , woman and child in the North , the British state pays out more than £ 9,700 per year .
The North has never truly “ paid its way ” in relation to the UK as a whole .
Following partition it was thought the British state would do well out of the new constitutional arrangement given that the bulk of industry in Ireland at the time was concentrated in the greater Belfast area .
However , traditional industries such as shipbuilding and textiles soon went into decline leaving Northern Ireland structurally weak .
Attempts to diversify into new industries , such as synthetics , failed when they too went into terminal decline after the 1960s .
British spending in the North later grew in an attempt to offset economic decline and the effects of the Troubles .
Apart from mitigating the effects of violence and the absence of a political accommodation throughout the course of the Troubles , a secondary effect of the subvention has been to mask the true economic state of NI and its levels of dependence on the British exchequer .
The loss of manufacturing jobs , the dramatic shift towards service sector employment and the arrival of branch plants ( which had diminished decision - making powers and few RD facilities or marketing operations ) meant that the innovating skills of the local population withered .
Because of this Northern Ireland effectively lost its capacity to generate internally its own manufacturing growth .
The sheer scale of government intervention in the North ’s economy dented rates of productivity .
The numbers in service industries rose as they fell in manufacturing , and it is often feared that the subsidising of Northern Ireland , added to the “ branch - plant ” character of local manufacturing , has blunted the region ’s entrepreneurial spirit .
Indeed the Northern Ireland Economic Council , in its 1999 publication The Implementation of Northern Ireland ’s Economic Development Strategy in the 1990s : Lessons for the Future , asked openly if the North ’s economy was “ addicted to state aid ” .
For Conservative Donors , Latest RNC Scandal
Is the ‘ Nail in the Coffin ’
Created : April 02 , 2010 06:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
RNC Chairman Michael Steele ( ZUMA )
The “ suggested amount ” portion of the donation form is crossed out .
There is n’t a box to check for no donation , so the would - be donor has simply drawn and filled in a new bubble and scrawled “ NO . ”
“ What the hell happened in NY District 23 ? ” writes the anonymous donor to an unrewarded Republican National Committee .
“ You guys supporting Dede Scozzafava ? ”
[ GOP1 ]
The form is one of many collected by blogger , columnist and TV pundit Michelle Malkin since the RNC chipped in for the doomed congressional campaign of Scozzafava , a moderate Republican who eventually withdrew from a November 2009 special election and helped Rep. Bill Owens ( D - N.Y. ) squeak past Conservative Party candidate Doug Hoffman .
In the wake of Monday ’s Daily Caller story on the RNC ’s lavish spending , including a $ 1,923 check to the Voyeur West Hollywood nightclub — an embarrassment to RNC Chairman Michael Steele for which the offender , Allison Meyers , was fired , and her upcoming events postponed — Malkin put up another batch of defiled RNC donation forms , with graffiti like “ Fire Steele .
Hire Cheney .
( Dick or Liz . )
Then Get Back to Me . ”
The Voyeur story dogged the RNC all week , especially after the committee pointed to outsized Democratic National Committee expenses as a distraction ( giving the DNC an opportunity to take another whack at the juicier RNC tale ) and after Politico noticed that a typo on one solicitation form sent donors to a phone sex line .
But for many conservative activists , it only accelerated and amplified a revolt against the RNC that had been brewing for months .
It ’s given the growing number of conservative PACs and projects a new selling point to potential donors .
And it ’s emboldened the sizable number of loose - lipped Republican activists who are working to create new institutions outside of Steele ’s purview .
“ This nightclub story is absolutely awful , ” said Eric Odom , a Tea Party activist and the chairman of Liberty First PAC , “ but the RNC just came off of a meeting in Hawaii , and that was even worse .
I do n’t think there are conservatives who are going to turn on the RNC just because of this story .
I think it ’s the nail in the coffin . ”
According to Odom — who famously denied Steele a speaking slot at the April 15 , 2009 anti-tax Tea Party in Chicago ( Steele , at the time , denied that he had wanted to speak ) — donors to Liberty First PAC have been submitting RNC - bashing notes along with their checks .
One out of ten donations via Paypal , said Odom , came with a message along the lines of “ 2009 was the last year I ’ll donate to a party . ”
Mark Skoda , the leader of the Memphis TEA Party who launched the Ensuring Liberty PAC at February ’s National Tea Party Convention , told TWI that the troubles that had beset the RNC would be impossible in his group — and potential donors knew it .
“ We ’re not going to be buying first - class tickets , ” said Skoda , who is convening the first meeting of Ensuring Liberty ’s board next week .
“ There ’ll be no big parties .
We ’re operating like a business .
I used to work for FedEx — these things like vast overcharges did n’t happen . ”
Skoda , who said he “ felt bad ” for Steele after hearing the Voyeur news , emphasized that Ensuring Liberty would be “ a complement , ” not a competitor , to the RNC .
It would back Republican candidates , albeit after making sure they fit the PAC ’s exacting standards and did n’t just have an “ R ” next to their names on the ballot .
But other conservatives are less diplomatic .
On Wednesday night , Family Research Council President Tony Perkins sent a blunt message to supporters : “ Do n’t give money to the RNC . ”
On Thursday afternoon , the Leadership Institute — whose president , Morton Blackwell , is an RNC committeeman – posted a Facebook message commenting favorably on the Perkins news .
( Blackwell is out of the country and did not respond to requests for comment . )
The evidence of conservative donors taking their money elsewhere is hard to track .
In the final quarter of 2009 , for example , the most prominent competitors for conservatives ’ donations pulled in modest amounts of money .
Our Country Deserves Better PAC , the group behind the Tea Party Express , had only $ 161,174 in receipts .
The Senate Conservatives Fund , Sen. Jim DeMint ’s ( R - S.C. ) PAC to aid his hand - picked candidates , raised $ 238,189 .
By comparison , the RNC raised $ 22,295,310 .
But activists point to the RNC ’s low cash - on - hand numbers to make their case .
“ The bottom line is that Michael Steele never should have gotten this job in the first place , ” said one exasperated conservative fundraiser .
“ Nothing that ’s happening now should surprise anyone . ”
That criticism has surfaced again and again as conservatives court donors for their projects .
On Thursday , Jonathan Strong — the reporter whose initial Voyeur story started the latest stampede against the RNC – cobbled together the last few years ’ worth of negative stories about Steele ’s managerial and financial problems .
They had n’t been enough to push conservatives away from Steele when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 2006 or the RNC chairmanship in 2009 .
Indeed , in 2005 , conservatives rallied around Steele when the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee hacked into the Senate candidate ’s credit report to get the details on his personal bankruptcies .
Conservatives are no longer giving Steele a pass on those stories .
The less faith small - and big - dollar donors have in the RNC , the more valuable they can be to other PACs , which are not being shy about soliciting their support .
“ When I fly , I fly coach , ” said David Bossie , the chairman of Citizens United and its political PAC , another competitor for small - dollar conservative donors .
“ We ’re not lavish .
If you donate to us , you know your money is going right back into the field to support conservative candidates , seeking out people who would n’t otherwise get support . ”
The Susan B. Anthony List , the American Conservative Union ’s PAC and Our Country Deserves Better can all point donors to their low - overheard campaigns in NY - 23 or the Massachusetts special election for the U.S. Senate , contrasting those with the performance of the RNC .
The party committee is well aware of its predicament .
“ The press shop ’s about as busy now as it was during the days that Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) suspended his presidential campaign , ” groused one conservative strategist who ’s worked with the RNC .
The problem for conservatives is that dividing their efforts , and nurturing mistrust in the RNC , might damage the GOP ’s 2010 strategy even if competing groups are well funded .
“ You ’re seeing a lot of small donors , who in other times would be discovering the party committee , going to these PACs instead , ” said Anthony Corrallo , a fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies campaign finance .
“ Large amounts of potential money that the RNC may have been able to attract are now going elsewhere .
And you ’d rather see money located in the parties — the RNC can do much more coordinated GOTV [ get out the vote ] and advertising . ”
RNC defenders could point the detractors to the left ’s experience with divided effort .
In 2003 , a team of big liberal donors that included George Soros and Peter Lewis founded America Coming Together , spending more than $ 10 million for GOTV .
Because ACT could n’t coordinate with the Democratic Party or John Kerry ’s presidential bid , some of its efforts were wasted .
And in 2007 , the disbanded group paid a $ 750,000 fine to the FEC for fundraising violations .
It remains to be seen whether conservatives can avoid a similar fate .
Odd question to ask , right ?
But judging by the numbers , yes .
Is that all there is to it ?

In reality ?
Probably not , but then , " better " is relative .
It 's here that we 'd caution you to remember the traditional line about apples , oranges , and comparisons .
Both the 2011 Ford Mustang GT and the current BMW M3 offer staggering performance , V - 8 power , and rear - wheel drive .
One is a pedigreed European sport sedan , the other a charmingly raw piece of traditional American muscle .
As to which one we like better , well , that depends on the day , our mood , the road , and how much diner food / schnitzel we had that morning .
Different cars , different purposes , both awesome for entirely different reasons .
Still , are n't those numbers nuts ?

Shapely is an offshoot of the GIS - Python project that provides spatial geometry functions independent of any geo-enabled database .
In particular , it makes python point - in - polygon calculations very easy .
Creating a Polygon
First , you need to create a polygon .
If you already have an ordered list of coordinate points that define a closed ring , you can create a Polygon directly , like so :
from shapely .
geometry import Polygon poly = Polygon ( ( ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 1 ) , ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 1 , 0 ) ) )
But what if you just have a bunch of points in no particular order ?
Then you can create a MultiPoint geometry and get the convex hull polygon .
from shapely .
geometry import MultiPoint # coords is a list of ( x , y ) tuples poly = MultiPoint ( coords ) .convex_hull
Point - in - Polygon
Now that you have a polygon , determining whether a point is inside it is very easy .
There ’s 2 ways to do it .
point.within(polygon ) polygon.contains ( point )
point should be an instance of the Point class , and poly is of course an instance of Polygon .
within and contains are the converse of each other , so whichever method you use is entirely up to you .
Overlapping Polygons
In addition to point - in - polygon , you can also determine whether shapely geometries overlap each other .
poly.within( poly ) and poly.contains ( poly ) can be used to determine if one polygon is completely within another polygon .
For partial overlaps , you can use the intersects method , or call intersection to get the overlapping area as a polygon .
There ’s a lot more you can do with this very useful python geometry package , so take a look at the Shapely Manual as well as some usage examples .
BERLIN ( AFP ) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A German hotel where then US President George W. Bush stayed in 2007 angrily rejected Thursday claims by his wife Laura Bush of possible poisoning , accusing her of a publicity stunt for her memoirs .
“ We see absolutely no evidence to support ( these allegations ) at all , ” said Christian Ploeger , a spokesman for the Fundus Group that owns the Grand Hotel Heiligendamm in northern Germany where the Bushes stayed for a G8 summit .

“ The food was checked by security staff , ” Ploeger told AFP .
“ I suspect that this may be just to try and sell more copies of the book . ”
In her upcoming autobiography “ Spoken from the Heart , ” a copy of which was obtained by the New York Times , Laura Bush writes that she , her husband and staff members may have been poisoned when they fell ill during their stay .
The president was even bedridden for part of the trip , and while the Secret Service investigated the possibility they were poisoned , doctors could only conclude they all contracted a virus , the paper cites Laura Bush as writing .
After noting several high - profile poisonings , she wrote , “ we never learned if any other delegations became ill , or if ours , mysteriously , was the only one . ”

Germany ’s federal police force declined to comment .
The book , due for release in May , also deals with a fatal November 1963 car accident when she was 17 in Texas and at the wheel of a car that hit another , killing the driver , a fellow student , the New York Times said .
Some comments by Ted Chiang , Benjamin Rosenbaum , Nathaniel Hellerstein and others in my recent post on “ True Names and Fnoor ” got me to thinking about the relationships between science fiction and quantum mechanics .
This is a big topic , so I ’m going to break it up into two or possibly more posts .
First , a throwaway remark — a chemist friend of mine once remarked that it would be entertaining if fundamentalist religious types got into attacking quantum mechanics .
They ’re always just hammering way on evolution , I guess because it ’s fairly easy to ( sort of ) understand .
Certainly there are some things in QM that might stoke someone ’s ire .
If the Lord knows all things , how dare scientists assert that the universe is in any respect Uncertain ?
Do keep in mind that QM does have its good side .
One key point , which Ted hinted at , is that the very stability of matter seems to depend upon QM .
I ’m thinking here of the notion of there being minimum amounts of energy ( quanta ) by which a system can change .
Consider an electron orbiting a proton — a hydrogen atom , in other words .
If energy were n’t quantized , the electron would gradually spiral in to the proton , and the atom would collapse .
But , as things stand , an undisturbed hydrogen atom is very unlikely to pulse out the full quantum of energy necessary for a collapse .
In some sense , QM acts as a set of struts to prop up our atoms .

But for an SF writer , there are a number of things about QM that are provocative .
I have six little subpost sections in mind ; I ’ll cover the first three of them today and the last three in a follow - up post .
(1) Under the Quantum Foam : Does space break down at a small enough scale ?
(2) Many Universes ?
Some think that QM supports a multiverse in which our universe is only one of an endless set of variations .
(3) Yes and No .
The QM notion of superposed states says that systems ( like the famous Schrödinger ’s Dead Horse … I mean Cat ) can be in several seemingly exclusive states at the same time .
(4) The Secret Theory .
Can there be hidden variables and a deterministic theory at a deeper level than QM ?
(5) QM Teep .
The QM notion of entanglement says that distant particles ’ states are in some instantaneous way correlated .
(6) Everything ’s Alive .
Quantum computation indicates that any piece of matter can be regarded as a supercomputer , potentially cabable of carrying out intelligent - seeming computations .
1. Under the Quantum Foam .
The notion of quantum graininess spills over from energy and into space and time .
One often hears talk of the so - called Planck length , which is about 0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 001 616 meters , or a hundred - quintillionth the size of a proton .
This particular distance pops out of the mathematics of QM .
There ’s a common feeling that the whole notion of space might not work anymore at the Planck length size scale — you often hear the phrase “ quantum foam ” ( scroll to the end of this page , for instance ) .
What ’s not to like about quantum foam ?
Well , you can of course capitalize on it , and blend it into your story .
I do n’t think I ’ve seen enough stories like that .
The physicist George Gamow made some popular attempts at this kind of thing in his beloved Mr. Tompkins books , here ’s an excerpt of one .
In my own novel , Master of Space and Time , the gimmick that I used for giving my characters a fleeting ability to control the universe was to locally ( in the vicinity of their heads ) expand the Planck length into a one - meter length . ——
But if you ’re interested in having some kind of “ scale ship ” that lets people shrink down endlessly into the microverse , then the foam is a problem .
I wrote a novel about this , too , Spacetime Donuts — in this book , I pretty much punted on the problem with QM and just glossed it over .
My characters shrank all the way down to the smallest possible level and , gloryoski ! , the smallest level was the same as the largest , so they ended up shrinking down to find the same Earth they ’d left from .
Very Golden Age .

A few years ago , I found a heartening passage in Michio Kakau , Parallel Worlds , where Kakau discusses a 1984 theory of “ string duality ” ascribed to Keiji Kikkawa and Masami Yamasaki .
String duality theory also allows for interesting physics below the Planck length .
The Planck length becomes something like an interface between two worlds .
As Kakau puts it :
“ Let ’s say we take a string theory and wrap up one dimension into a circle of radius R .
Then we take another string and wrap up one dimension into a circle of radius 1 / R .
By comparing these two quite different theories , we find that they are exactly the same .
Now let R become extremely small , much smaller than the Planck length .
This means that the physics within the Planck length is identical to the physics outside the Planck length .
At the Planck length , spacetime may become lumpy and foamy , but the physics inside the Planck length and the physics at very large distances can be smooth and are in fact identical . ”
I decided to start using the word “ subdimensional ” for the cosmos that lies “ inside the Planck length . ”
It ’s kind of a Golden Age term of uncertain meaning , but I started using it in the sense of string duality theory ( without saying so ) in my Flurb story with Paul DiFilippo , “ Elves of the Subdimensions . ”
I also used this idea in my Tor.com story , “ Jack and the Aktuals . ”
And I used the subdimensional world in my novels Postsingular and Hylozoic — here there are some nasty beings called subbies living down there .
I put it like this Postsingular .
“ Did you guys see that weird ocean when you came across ? ”
Thuy asked Ond .
“ I think it ’s the Planck frontier , ” said Ond .
“ Physics at the scales smaller than the Planck length is supposed to be identical to physics at the scales larger than the Planck length .
So then the Planck length is a frontier between dual versions of the cosmos .
And if someone shrinks down into the dimensions under the foamy frontier , they ’ll feel like they ’re expanding into a whole alternate cosmos hidden in the subdimensions .
There ’s a world under that ocean . ”
“ A subdimensional world , ” said Chu .
“ We ’re heard the Hibraners taking about it .
They call it Subdee .
And those bird - headed men we saw were subbies .
Subbies from Subdee . ”
2. Many Universes ?
In the essay on infinity , “ Avatars of the Tortoise , ” that appears in his collection Labyrinths , Jorge Luis Borges writes , “ This is a concept which corrupts and upsets all others .
I refer not to Evil , whose limited realm is that of ethics ; I refer to the infinite . ”
To my way of thinking , Borges dictum is equally true of “ the multiverse . ”
I do n’t think I ’ve ever seen¬ an SF novel or story the full quantum - mechanical multiverse with complete success .
What tends to happen in these tales is that the character moves along some sequence A1 of events until * wham * something ’s about to kill him or her and then * hop * the character jumps over to a sequence A2 of events where all is well .
My problem with this is that the narrative then is a kind of cheating .
There ’s no essential connection between A1 and A2 , that is , there is no causal connection between these two .
They ’re two independent histories , and it ’s wishful thinking to pretend that there is some higher - level metacharacter who is able to move from the one to the other .
I discuss this in more detail with reference to Neal Stephenson ’s excellent novel Anathem , in my post , “ Narratives in the Multiverse . ”
Let me back up a bit .
What QM have to do with the multiverse anyway ?
Although there is no QM axiom or principle that explicitly decrees randomness , the conventional belief is that many primitive events ( such as the decay of a radioactive atom ) do in fact happen randomly .
( One reason this is n’t an axiom is because the precise meaning of “ random ” is , in a Goedelian and metamathematical sense , impossible to define . )
IN any case , many of us would like to suppose that our reality is in no sense random , and that things do n’t happen for no reason at all .
A sloppy way to account for the seeming randomness of low - level quantum events seem to be random is to insist that the timeline of our universe is continually branching , and that , for lack of a better reason to go one way or the other , both outcomes result from any up - or - down measurement .
And the universe splits , and a copy of you goes into each universe
I think this is a terrible idea .
As I write in my tome , The Lifebox , the Seashell , and the Soul :
“ Many people find the multiverse model philosophically unsatisfying .
It ’s hard to put one ’s finger on the problem , but I think it has to do with meaning .
One likes to imagine the world has an ultimate explanation of some kind .
Call it what you will : the Secret of Life , God ’s Plan , the Theory of Everything , the Big Aha , whatever .
If we live in a multiverse of many universes , then perhaps the multiverse has a Multiversal Big Aha , but a mere individual universe does n’t get a Big Aha .
An individual universe is simply the result of an incalculable number of coin flips .
To me , this feels inane and defeatist .
Our beautiful universe deserves a better explanation than that .
Although the multiverse model is in fact useful for understanding certain kinds of quantum phenomena , it ’s not attractive as a final answer . ”
Note that QM does not require us to have a multiverse .
We can instead accept that systems enter superposed mixtures of “ both up and down ” states , and that the process of observation precipitates such a system ( randomly ? ) into one particualr pure state .
A few more words on alternate worlds .
What I do think to be feasible for an SF story is to work with some limited number of branes , or alternate universes , and to have characters moving from one brane to the other .
When they move they might possibly encounter alternate copies of themselves , although it ’s often convenient to eliminate the alternate self in some fashion ( that is , either the alternate is dead , or perhaps the alternate has left for yet another brane ) .
I used this technique in my novel Mathematicians in Love — here there is a jellyfish - like “ God ” who creates a new “ draft ” of our universe on every Friday , and my main characters manage to hop to a sequence of maybe three alternate drafts .
A different idea about multiple universes or branching time is implicit in the notion of “ precogs , ” that is , psychically gifted people who can continually select the optimal thing to do next .
I think the very first Phil Dick story I ever read was a fine exemplar of this : “ The Golden Man , ” about a guy who is unkillable because he always knows to zig when you zag .
To do this right we want to avoid assuming all the futures are real — because , once again , if all the futures are real , then it means nothing to claim that someone always picks the right path because he or she is continually picking every path .
This claim is as spurious as a stock broker ad that shows a protracted series of different people making money on stocks … and which tries to pretend that all those people are one and the same person … who could be you , ’cause you ’re Younique !
To some extent we do look into possible futures — that ’s what reasoning and imagining scenarios is all about .
But to give it an SF twist , let ’s suppose that , although our timeline does n’t fully branch , it does very commonly grow out stubs that are some fractions of a second long .
If the one undivided history of our one world does n’t enter a stub , then it withers and snaps off .
Or you might say that the history might even go a little way into a bad branch but then somehow back up like a car out of a dead - end alleyway , and head back on the “ proper ” branch .
The backups are very common , in fact they ’re all but ubiquitous .
Most people do n’t notice this , as when time backs up , events run backwards and memories get erased .
But our Golden Man or Woman does learn to notice .
And you need to put some thought into what happens when A and B stand at a crossroads and differ about which is to be the path taken .

3. Yes and No
QM famously says that , left on their own , systems evolve into so - called superposed states which are a mixture of classically different states .
But when an “ observer ” examines a system it quick - as - a - flash “ collapses ” into being some pure , non-mixed , non-superposed state .
Another pair of words used here are coherent and decoherent , taken in a technical QM sense where “ coherent ” means a mixed or superposed state , and “ decoherent ” is a prissy , flattened - out , one - thing - and - one - thing - only pure state .
The notion of “ coherent , ” “ superposed , ” or “ mixed ” states is one of things that seems superficially very remote from ordinary life .
But , if you ponder it , you may come to see that in some respects our minds are very often in superposed states .
Do I like this meal ?
Well , until you insisted on an answer , I did n’t have a real opinion about it …
Here ’s a quote from a thought - provoking article by Nick Herbert called “ Quantum Tantra ” .
He ’s leading up to a proposal that our mind is , as I ’m hinting , very much like a quantum system that naturally evolves into superposed states .
“ By the high standards of explanation we have come to demand in physics and other sciences , we do not even possess a bad theory of consciousness , let alone a good one .
Speculations concerning the origin of inner experience in humans and other beings have been few , vague and superficial .
They include the notion that mind is an ‘ emergent property ’ of active neuronal nets , or that mind is the ‘ software ’ that manages the brain ’s unconscious ‘ hardware ’ …
Half - baked attempts to explain consciousness , such as mind - as - software or mind - as - emergent - property do not take themselves seriously enough to confront the experimental facts , our most intimate data base , namely how mind itself feels from the inside . ”
Nick proposes that we think of the human mind as a quantum system .
Recall that quantum systems are said to change in two ways : when left alone , they undergo a continuous , deterministic transformation though a series of superposed states , but when observed , they undergo abrupt probabilistic transitions into pure , classical states .
Nick suggests that we can notice these two kinds of processes in our own minds .
( Coherent )
The continuous evolution of quantum superpositions corresponds to the transcendent sensation of being merged with the world , or , putting it less portentously , to the everyday activity of being alert without consciously thinking much of anything .
In this mode you are n’t deliberately watching or evaluating your thoughts .
( Decoherent )
The abrupt transition from mixed state to pure state can be seen as the act of adopting a specific opinion or plan .
Each type of question or measurement of mental state enforces a choice among the question ’s own implicit set of possible answers .
Even beginning to consider a question initiates a delimiting process .
[ This discussion of Nick ’s idea is drawn from The Lifebox , the Seashell , and the Soul .
And I also talked about this in a 2005 blog post . ]

Company working with satellite provider on feature that would let users search both TV content and web videos on set - top boxes
Once again , rumours are making their rounds that Google is going to make some sort of set - top box play .
The latest : the Wall Street Journal reports that the company is working with Dish Network on a new feature that would let users search both TV content and web videos on set - top boxes " using elements of Google 's Android operating system " .
The tie - in direct with Dish Network , a broadcast satellite service provider , makes sense , since both companies already have a close relationship on the TV , where Google TV Ads counts Dish Network as one of its primary partners .
But there are some big caveats and unknowns :
It 's unlikely that the service will come to market soon , since the WSJ makes a point of emphasising that the tests are limited for now to a " very small number " of Google employees .
Also , no set - top boxes that run on Android are currently on the market .
But as far back as November 2007 there were rumours that Google was working to build an app platform for set - top boxes .
Nothing has come of that , although that effort would presumably be related to this one in some way .
If Google did go ahead and launch some sort of " Google TV search " , competitors would include Clicker , the much - hyped ( and funded ) online video search engine which has deals with set - top boxes like Boxee and popbox , so that users can search Clicker from their TVs .
A Google spokesman said the company does not comment on rumour or speculation .

THE Australian Greens want to ban major banks from charging $ 2 fees for non-customers to withdraw cash from their ATMs .
The party will propose amendments to the trade practice laws to stop major banks charging for ATM use .
But it wo n't advocate the fee ban for credit unions , building societies or independent ATM operators , such as corner shops and clubs .
Greens leader Bob Brown said the multi-billion dollar major banks did n't need the extra annual $ 680 million generated from inflated ATM fees .
" Australians spend around $ 1000 on bank fees , 20 per cent more than in the United Kingdom where ATM fees do n't exist , " he said .
The $ 2 fee does n't reflect the real cost of processing an ATM transactions , he said .
" The Reserve Bank of Australia estimated it was about 50 cents in 2000 , which is likely to be even lower now . "

Lord David Triesman had no choice but to resign as chairman of England 's 2018 World Cup bid on Sunday morning .
Once it became clear that his private and indiscreet chat with a former civil service colleague was out in the public domain , senior figures on the bid team and inside the Football Association began distancing themselves from damaging claims of collusion between the Spanish and Russian FAs to bribe referees at this summer 's World Cup .
I will return to this bizarre conspiracy theory in a moment .
Around midday on Sunday , Lord Triesman told colleagues on the 2018 bid board that he would step down .
This came after a frenetic morning of meetings and phone calls between key figures including head of international strategy David Dein , Lord Sebastian Coe , who splits his time between his 2018 role and his day job as chairman of the London Olympic organising committee for the 2012 Games , and Keith Mills , also a member of the 2018 and London 2012 boards .
As soon as the story broke at 2200 BST on Saturday , the 2018 team were engaged in a damage limitation exercise .
Messages were sent to the Spanish and Russian 2018 bid teams disowning Triesman 's remarks and apologising .
Coe is due to telephone the Fifa president Sepp Blatter later on Sunday to make the bid team 's position clear and to explain it has moved swiftly to deal with his comments .
Dein is now the front - runner to take over from Triesman as interim chairman with Coe and Mills likely to step up their involvement in the next few weeks .
By moving so swiftly and decisively , the 2018 team hope they will help avoid any lasting damage from Triesman 's remarks .
Just to recap , Triesman was allegedly caught on tape telling Melissa Jacobs , a former colleague and friend from his days as a government minister , that the Spanish FA was looking to bribe referees in South Africa at next month 's World Cup finals .
To help them , they had , according to Triesman , enlisted the backing of the Russians who would join the referees plot in return for their support in subsequent voting rounds should Spain go out early in the election of the 2018 World Cup hosts in December .
Now , I have covered quite a few of these bids and you hear all sorts of wild conspiracy theories for why certain members of the 24 - strong Fifa executive vote the way they do .
But I have never heard anything quite as far fetched as this .
Above all else , it would require the three Fifa members from Latin America ( two of whom are from Brazil and Argentina ) assumed to support Spain and Portugal 's 2018 bid to collude in a bid to give Spain an advantage at this summer 's World Cup , by swinging behind the Russians once Spain and Portugal are eliminated .
It makes no sense .
Senseless or not , Triesman - usually such an engaging and accomplished administrator - has said it and will have to pay the price .
As a senior member of the Labour Party ( he was a former general secretary and also served as a foreign office minister ) , Triesman must have seen political colleagues reach the critical moment when they know there is no turning back .
On Sunday morning , he would have experienced that feeling himself and as he read through the Mail on Sunday 's story he would have reached the only decent conclusion - that he had to walk the plank .
So where does this leave the 2018 bid ?
In short , they are going to find it incredibly difficult to recover from this .
Fifa 's executive committee members ( one of whom is Spanish and another Russian ) will be absolutely furious at the head of a bid making such claims against rival bids .
It is forbidden in the rules laid down by Fifa for the bid process but even if it was n't wrong , it would be a resigning matter .
Even before these extraordinary claims , England 2018 had suffered a series of embarrassing setbacks .
First we had the comments from Fifa vice - president Jack Warner in October that England 's bid was lightweight .
Then we had the Mulberry handbag gaffe where the wives of all 24 members of the Fifa executive were sent gifts in contravention of the bidding rules .
And that all culminated in the November resignation of Sir David Richards after a reshuffle of the 2018 bid board .
Since December 's World Cup draw in Cape Town however , and thanks mainly to the presence of David Beckham , England 's bid has been back on track .

In fact Triesman told me in an interview last Thursday that if the vote had been on Friday , England would have won it .
Even if that interpretation may have been wishful thinking , the opposite is certainly true now .
Those left to pick up the pieces are describing it as the 2018 bid's ' Panorama ' moment - a reference to the 2004 crisis for the London 2012 Olympic bid when a BBC investigation claimed members of the International Olympic Committee were open to bribes .
But that was a legitmate piece of journalism .
They may not have liked it but ultimately those members of the IOC less used to a free and open press , had to accept that it was beyond the control of Coe and other senior members at London 2012 .
Triesman 's comments are far less easy to explain and this problem will not be solved by just removing him from the 2018 position and leaving him in charge at the FA .
The 2018 bid team may be run by a separate subsidiary company but it is the national FA which submits the bid .
Blatter and Fifa will not be able to understand why he is still head of the FA after making such remarks and any failure to deal with that part of the problem swiftly will probably leave the bid dead in the water .
For the FA it leaves them facing another period of enormous upheaval .
The organisation is already without a permanent chief executive following Ian Watmore 's resignation in March and serious issues over finances and the future of Wembley lie ahead .
Today 2018 is the priority and Triesman 's swift removal may give them a slim chance of salvaging the campaign .
Sorting out the FA will be far more complicated .
UPDATE 1800
Following a lengthy FA board meeting on Sunday afternoon , David Triesman has just issued a statement confirming he has stepped down as both chairman of the FA and of the 2018 World Cup bid team .
David Sheepshanks , the former Ipswich chairman , and Roger Burden , the head of the national game board , have been appointed joint interim chairmen of the FA .
An interim replacement for Triesman at the head of the 2018 board is yet to be named but it is likely Triesman 's predecessor Geoff Thompson , who is a vice - chairman of Fifa and member of the 24 - man executive , will be given the job of trying to patch up the damage done by Sunday 's damaging bribe claims .
For the second time in a week , the FA have moved swiftly and decisively to deal with a major problem .
The first , England manager Fabio Capello's new ratings website , was postponed until after the World Cup amid concerns it would undermine his relationship with the players in South Africa .
By removing Triesman so quickly the FA and England 2018 will hope they can salvage some credibility .
In his resignation statement , Triesman said : " A private conversation with someone whom I thought to be a friend was taped without my knowledge and passed to a national newspaper .
That same friend has also chosen to greatly exaggerate the extent of our friendship . "
I know there is a lot of sympathy among readers of my earlier blog for the fact Triesman has been the victim of a media sting .
In fact , it is understood the members of the FA board accepted Triesman 's resignation with some reluctance and regret at this embarrassing turn of events .
But the fact is he is an experienced and accomplished former politician and he should have been more discreet in his remarks .
Triesman and English football have paid a heavy price for those comments .

For those who are looking to get into the e-cigarette industry or for those who are trying to quit traditional smoking but are having a hard time and want an alternative option , then buying an e-cigarette starter kit is the recommended route to go .
The reason being is because the starter kits that many companies offer usually come at very affordable prices and have multiple batteries or cartridges in them .
When first starting out with e-cigarettes , it is a good idea to try out various different types of cartridges , both disposable and non to figure out what your preference is .
In addition to this , finding out what strength of e-liquid you will need or want and what flavor you enjoy the most ; will enhance your e-cigarette experience .
There are a few questions you will need to ask yourself when starting out to see if you will want a starter kit :
How often do I smoke / will I smoke ?
Will I need more than one battery ?
Where will I be smoking ?
Accessories – do I want them ?
What can I afford ?
Often times people do n’t have all the answers to the above questions , to getting a starter kit can better help them define what they will need for future or prolong use .
When looking to buy a starter kit , it is best to shop around and see what different companies are offering .
Many companies have various types of e-liquid ( or e-juice ) , and have different accessories that come with their starter kits .
A basic starter kit will often come with at last two batteries , a pack of five cartridges ( enough to last you what a traditional pack of cigarettes would ) , a wall charger , a USB charger , and the choice of what flavour you would like .
There are also ranges in kits that you can buy , from basic kits all the way up to pro kits , all varying on how much product you get and what accessories come with it .
A lot of companies do have “ express ” kits that are perfect for those who do not have a large budget to spend and these usually include two cartridges , a standard battery and a charger .
This tends to be the best option for those who want to just try it out , or for those who do not want to spend a lot of money when first making the switch .

None Dare Call It Sedition
Sedition : Crime of creating a revolt , disturbance , or violence against lawful civil authority with the intent to cause its overthrow or destruction
-- Brittanica Concise Dictionary
Well , finally .
It 's high time somebody had the guts to say the S - word -- sedition -- right out loud .
When the indictments against the Hutaree were unsealed last week , the S - word was right there , front and center , in Count One .
The Justice Department accused them of " seditious conspiracy , " charging that the defendants " did knowingly conspire , confederate , and agree with each other and other persons known and unknown ... to levy war against the United States , and to prevent , hinder , and delay by force the execution of any United States law . "
This is very serious stuff .
But the Hutaree are getting nailed for sedition only because they crossed the line with inches to spare .
They 're by no means the only ones .
This stuff is becoming the new norm on the conservative side .
We saw it again last Thursday , when the Guardians of the Free Republics -- a Sovereign Citizen group that believes that the oath of office taken by state governors is invalid under their twisted Bizarroland interpretation of the Constitution -- sent letters to most or all sitting state governors telling them to either a ) take what they consider to be a legitimate oath of office ; b ) stand down ; or c ) or be removed " non-violently " within three days .
The FBI , rightly , regards this as a potentially seditious threat against the governors .
These two events are a wake - up call for progressives .
They 're telling us that it 's time to openly confront the fact that conservatives have spent the past 40 years systematically delegitimizing the very idea of US government .
When they 're in power , they mismanage it and defund it .
When they 're out of power , they refuse to participate in running the country at all .
When they need to win an election , they use violent , polarizing , eliminationist language against their opponents to motivate their base .
This is sedition in slow motion , a gradual corrosive undermining of the government 's authority and capability to run the country .
And it 's been at the core of their politics going all the way back to Goldwater .
This long assault has gone into overdrive since Obama 's inauguration , as the rhetoric has ratcheted up from overheated to perfervid .
We 've reached the point where you can't go a week without hearing some prominent right wing leader calling for outright sedition -- an immediate and defiant populist uprising against some legitimate form of government authority .
Moderates and liberals are responding to this rising threat with feckless calls for " a return to civility , " as all that 's needed to put things right again is a stern talking - to from Miss Manners .
Though that could n't hurt , the sad fact is that we 're well past the point where it 's just a matter of conservatives behaving like tantrum - throwing spoiled brats ( though they are ) .
When a mob is surrounding your house with torches and telling you they intend to burn it down , " civility " really is n't the issue any more .
At that point -- and we 're there -- criminal intent and action become the real issues .
Progressives need to realize that the right began defiantly dancing back and forth over the legal line , daring us to do something about it , quite some time ago .
And it 's high time we called it out -- and , where appropriate , start prosecuting it -- for exactly what it is .
What is Sedition ?
Before we start throwing around inflammatory terms like " sedition , " it 's essential that we understand the strict definition of the word -- and use it carefully and precisely , lest it lose all meaning .
( That 's what happened with the word " fascism , " which has been distorted into meaninglessness by hyperbolic overuse on the left and willful redefinition on the right .
Once a word is abused to death this way , it 's very hard to recapture it and restore its original meaning .
And that 's no small thing , because losing the word makes it functionally impossible to even discuss the political idea the word represents .
Worse : as Orwell told us , when we no longer have the language to describe what we 're dealing with , we also lose our ability to deal effectively with fascism at all .
That 's a real danger with loaded words -- so , please , let 's be extremely careful about how we brandish this one . )
Here 's the defining line we need to hold on to .
People who promote subversive ideas , no matter how dangerous those ideas might seem , are completely protected under the First Amendment .
Even calling for the overthrow of the government is protected ( though not benign , as we 'll see later , because it creates justification , permission , and incitement to seditious acts ) .
That 's why the conservatives have been safe -- so far .
It 's only when those people start actively planning and implementing a government rebellion that it turns into criminal sedition .
In this case : the weird rantings on the Hutaree website -- not seditious .
The group 's allegedly operational plans to assassinate a police officer , ambush the resulting funeral , and thus bring on a national militia uprising -- absolutely seditious , if the charges stick .
This bright - line distinction , which has been part of American sedition law for the past 50 years , parallels closely the line drawn by terrorism analysts in sussing out which groups are benign and which ones are headed for trouble .
As I 've noted before , one of the cardinal signs these experts watch and listen for is a fundamental shift in rhetoric .
In the early stages of dissent , they establish the lines of conflict by obsessively focusing on their enemies and loudly denouncing their essential evilness .
You hear this kind of talk in politics all the time these days .
It 's often ugly , but not inherently dangerous .
But in the latter stage , the talk turns overtly eliminationist , and the group starts expressing its clear desire and intention to eradicate specific enemies .
When they shift to that second stage , it 's a sign that they have mentally committed themselves to violent action , and are more likely to be actively acquiring arms , selecting targets , and getting ready to act in the near future .
When a group enters this planning stage in an attack on government offices or officials , they 've officially crossed the line into sedition .
Sedition on The Right
Openly advocating acts of sedition has become the conservatives ' main political stock in trade over the past year .
( The SPLC offers a strong summary here . )
You hear it everywhere from Rush to Glenn to Michelle Malkin to Michelle Bachman .
Everybody on the right is now roundly convinced that the fairly - elected President of the United States is n't even a citizen .
He 's a Muslim , and thus in treasonous league with terrorists .
The main goal of his administration is to turn the country over to the One World Government .
He 's a socialist .
He 's a fascist .
All of these are direct attacks on Obama 's fundamental legitimacy and authority to lead the country -- and thus a deliberate incitement to overthrow his government .
These narratives are coupled with a rising us - versus - them blaming of progressives for all the problems of the country .
These days , the screeds typically sound like free - market fundamentalists freebasing Hitler : they 're clouded over with the typical eliminationist vitriol that reduces liberals to subhuman vermin that must be violently exterminated from the body politic in order to restore the virtue of the country .
( For those who enjoy that sort of thing , there are even occasional hints of anti-Semitism in the mix . )
This is dangerous stuff .
And in the context of the conservatives ' longstanding effort to delegitimize the government , it 's also an open invitation to sedition .
This seditious intent is expressed even more directly in the increasingly overt firearms displays at right - wing events .
The media were all aghast when a small handful of people showed up packing heat at last summer 's Tea Party disruptions .
Now , we 've advanced the point where not one , but two , 100 % gun-toting marches on Washington , DC are planned for this coming April 19 .
Their organizers are hoping the marches will draw tens of thousands of armed protestors .
Get used to seeing guns in the streets wherever the law allows -- because the conservatives have told their base explicitly that they need to be " exercising their rights " on this front to the fullest extent .
These escalating armed demonstrations are a clear signal that the right wing is done talking -- and , worse , has already decided that democracy is futile , and taking up arms is the only appropriate response .
They 're carrying weapons to scare us weak - kneed girly libs into submission , and to show us they mean business .
Growing up in gun country , I was taught at my daddy 's knee that when someone says they 're going to shoot you , it 's always a good idea to take them at their word and handle yourself accordingly .
Right now , I think that 's good advice for anybody in America who considers themselves a member of the reality - based community .
But it 's not just armed individuals .
They 're also forming more and more armed groups , which are gearing up for a fight .
For the past five years , armed Minutemen have been usurping the job of the US Border Patrol .
And as of this year , according to the SPLC , over 500 armed militias are forming , many of which present themselves as alternative law - enforcement posses that are adjunct to the ones staffed by the county sheriffs .
What these folks are telling us is that they no longer recognize the government 's sole franchise on the use of force ; and they 're actively organizing to seize at least some of that power for themselves .
Most alarming of all : these right - wing warriors have also advanced to actual target acquisition .
This should worry us , because law enforcement and terrorism experts know that when groups like this get to where they 're settling on specific targets , they 're the final stages of gearing up for violent confrontation .
When Bernard Goldberg wrote a book listing the " 100 people who are destroying America " -- and includes elected officials -- he was writing a target list .
( And at least one guy took him up on it , in his own deranged way . )
When the " spiritual warriors " of the Transformations movement proudly announce that they 've mapped every town in America -- literally creating target maps of " demonic activity " that pinpoint government offices , non-Evangelical houses of worship , clinics , theaters , Indian mounds and sites ; or even just households with Muslims , neo - pagans , Goth - baby teenagers , or Obama stickers on their cars -- they 're putting us on notice that they 've identified the specific people and places that need to be " cleansed " in order to purify their communities .
According to researchers Rachel Tabachnik and Bruce Wilson , these " transformation " attempts have already become government - level issues in New Jersey , Arizona , Texas , and Hawaii .
At present , they claim that they 're only mapping their neighborhoods so they can pray over us all ; and their attempts to take over local government are being done by purely democratic means .
But , as has often happened before ( yes , the Nazis started out just this way ) , the day may come when they 'll decide that mere prayer and organizing is not enough .
Like any street gang , they 've taken proprietary responsibility for a piece of turf ; and they believe God is holding them accountable for everything that happens there .
The resulting performance pressure is a perfect setup to justify more aggressive cleansing tactics if they can't convert the town by peaceful means .
And some of these groups have already effectively crossed the line , in spirit if not in prosecutable fact .
When the Christian dominionists train up " Joel 's Army " by sending their sons to the US armed services so they can get the combat experience they 'll need to set up a worldwide theocracy , that 's evidence of an active plan to effect an armed government takeover .
When senior US military officers put their commitment to Jesus ahead of their commitment to uphold the Constitution and regard the military as God 's force in the world , we should be very afraid .
For years now , we 've dismissed all of this as crazy talk , the rantings of a loony fringe that will never get enough traction to become a material threat to our democracy .
But we 're well past the point where it's no longer quaint and funny , or an embarrassing breach of democratic etiquette that polite people should just ignore .
It 's time to confront the sobering fact that the entire right wing -- including the GOP establishment , which encourages , endorses , and echoes these sentiments almost every time its officials appear in public these days -- is now issuing nearly constant invitations to criminal sedition .
They 're creating a climate and using language that emboldens the handful of sociopaths in our midst who are always spoiling for a fight .
They 've given their new corps of flying monkeys permission to brandish their guns in public , empowered their militias , promised them glory , and are now telling them explicitly which targets to hit .
We 'd be idiots not to regard this as an overt threat .
Especially when they keep telling us , very explicitly , that they mean it to be .
We need to start talking about this for what it is , and calling it out whenever it happens .
Leonard Zeskind points out that the feds have never been able to make a sedition charge stick against a right - wing group ( if the Hutaree are convicted , it 'll be a first ) ; but the first step in stopping sedition is making sure everybody knows exactly what it is when they see it .
And that means calling out the S - word every time we see the conservatives defiantly stretching their hands and feet out over that line to score a few cheap political points .
The challenge I once threw down on the conservatives
still stands .
Do they want a civil war ?
Are they out to overthrow the US government ?
If this is just political grandstanding to energize the base , they 're playing with fire , and they need to bring this incendiary campaign to a screeching halt .
Right now .
This Mickey Mouse pussyfooting around , play - acting at sedition is criminally dangerous chickenshit politics that puts the short - term needs of the Republican party ahead of the long - term viability of the American democracy they 've sworn to uphold .
In case the party leaders have n't noticed , their base has taken them as seriously as a heart attack -- and they 're genuinely making ready for armed revolt .
On the other hand , if seditious overthrow is what they intend , let them stand up , follow through , and face the charges .
They 're either Americans , committed to working in good faith within the democratic process to create our common future ; or else they 're seditionists in intention or fact -- and thus enemies of the state , plain and simple .
For the good of the country , we cannot continue to let them have it both ways .
They need to choose whose side they 're on : America's , or their own .

Examination of Atrazine Shows Report Funded By Chemical Maker Flawed
By Vickie Chachere
TAMPA , Fla . ( May 6 , 2010 ) –
In a perfect world , scientific research is supposed to be completely objective and free of conflicts of interest .
But University of South Florida researchers say that politics can overtake facts , with potentially detrimental effects for the integrity of science and the health of ecosystems .
In a paper published in the journal Conservation Letters , biologists Jason Rohr and Krista McCoy document the impacts of conflicts of interest on science , humanity , biodiversity and ecosystem services , educate the readers on how to identify the many guises of conflicts of interest , and offer recommendations to reduce conflicts of interest for enhanced environmental and human health .
Rohr and McCoy define conflicts of interest as circumstances where it can be reasonably perceived that financial or other considerations have compromised or biased professional judgment and objectivity for personal or organizational benefit .
However , it is Rohr and McCoy ’s case study focusing on a 2008 review of the effects of the herbicide atrazine on freshwater fish and amphibians that has the potential to have imminent policy implications .
Atrazine is the subject of a congressional investigation , and its risk to aquatic systems and human health is being re-evaluated by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency .
Last month , a Minnesota congressman introduced federal legislation that would ban atrazine .
Rohr and McCoy examined whether this review , funded by the company that produces atrazine , represented the primary literature accurately .
They report that this review misrepresented more than 50 studies and included 122 inaccurate and 22 misleading statements .
Of these inaccurate and misleading statements , 96.5 percent seem to benefit the makers of atrazine in that they support the safety of the chemical .
Further , this review cast criticisms at 94 percent of the studies where atrazine had adverse effects , but only weakly criticized 2.8 percent of the studies where there were no effects of atrazine .
These errors and biases are documented in a 39 - page , point - by - point analysis in the supplementary materials of Rohr and McCoy ’s paper .
In contrast to the industry - funded review , Rohr and McCoy ’s 2010 paper in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives documented consistent effects of atrazine on the behavior , infections , growth , and immune , endocrine , and reproductive systems of freshwater fish and amphibians .
“ Our concern is that policymakers may base their decisions on misinterpreted , misrepresented , or biased science , ” Rohr cautions .
“ However , we do not suggest any intent by the authors of this industry - funded review . ”
“ Our case study on atrazine was designed as a contemporary example of conflict of interest rather than a direct examination of the controversial chemical , ” Rohr said .
“ The goal of the paper was to educate scientists , natural resource managers , policymakers and judicial officials on the potential impacts of conflicts of interests , and how to identify and reduce them . ”
“ It is important to remember that environmental groups , governments , scientists , and other professionals can also have conflicts of interest that can delay or prevent advances that could benefit the public good . ”
Atrazine was banned in Europe in 2004 , but is still widely used in the United States and 80 other nations , making it one of the most commonly used herbicides in the world .
It is also used in the Southeastern United States , including Florida , where it is often used on lawns , golf courses , and in sugarcane agriculture .
Rohr and McCoy offer several additional recommendations , such as a call for greater education on conflicts of interest ; for governmental agencies and judicial systems to have the authority to mandate disclosure of who funded research , and for an end to allowing companies to pay for safety research for their own products and to instead put that testing in the hands of a neutral regulatory agency .
Well the latest installment in the PixelJunk franchise has been released on the Playstation Network .
Unlike previous titles , this game actually has somewhat of a story that the player does not have to fill in with their own imaginations .
You are a ship captain on a search and rescue mission throughout a mining cavern on a distant planet .
Your space station has lost contact with many of the researchers and workers within the depth of the mines and it is your job to go in and investigate .
In order to accomplish this feat , you are given a small spacecraft that has four primary weapons , all of which will all be used in a variety of fashions .
Your weapons include bullets , missiles , and a grappling hook .
The fourth “ weapon ” spins your ship .
There are also little substations in certain levels that you can park in and receive a special power for a limited amount of time .
They ’re like Mario suits , only applied to a space ship .
Throughout the more advanced stages you will gain the ability to use power - ups to protect your ship , and pick up giant fluid sucking sponges which help you move liquids where you need them .
Playing around with the sponges is one of the highlights of the game , but will also cause many of your deaths .
As you rescue more workers you begin to learn the story of some sort of earthquake that happened , and a variety of monsters that have began to appear throughout the caverns as a result .
The story is a microscopic part of the game , and really is not necessary .
It is fun and goofy to see these cute little cartoon characters spouting off Resident Evil - like dialogue in text form , but really it only provides the slightest continuity throughout the experience .
In no way does it shape or change the way in which I played the game and it was odd to see such a half - hearted effort from Q Games .
Traditionally Q Games has focused on one very particular dynamic of gaming and made an entire 50 + hour experience out of it for even the most hardcore gamers .
PJS : The Depth of Disaster does this as well , by focusing on never before seen realistic fluid dynamics .
There are six different substances , which all interact and these are oil , water , lava , gas , rock , and ice .
For example when water touches lava it turns to rock , lava melts ice , and water on oil forms gas .
In addition each of these substances have different temperatures , which affect your ship .
Although there are a huge variety of projectile shooting enemies throughout the game , your real enemy is the temperature of your ship .
The game employs an Excitebike style heat meter that will make your ship explode or stall if it gets too hot or cold .
Your job is to collect diamonds and researchers in each level , but honestly it really is n’t necessary to save the researchers .
The diamonds are the gateway to the later stages , so they are the most significant pick - ups .
There are three boss battles in the game , …. and yes the first one is a GIANT ENEMY CRAB which you hit its weak spot for massive damage ….
AWESOME .
These boss battles are by far the best part of the game , particularly the second one .
The fact that there are only three really left me asking for more and overall , I was disaapointed .
The game looks great , but I would really suggest playing it on an HD TV .
The small subtleties of the projectiles , fluids , and researchers will make you die and repeat levels without the crispness of HD graphics .
I played the game on both a HD and Standard TV and the difference was astounding .
This is one of the first times I can say that playing a game without HD will actually hurt the gameplay , and increase difficulty substantially .
The game has a nice cartoon look that works really well , and the animations of the fluids and the boss battles look stunning .
This is a great example of using old fashion gameplay and simple graphics that are jacked up with the processing power of the Cell Broadband Engine , and it just works perfectly .
One of the most perplexing issues in this game is the difficulty .
The levels are extremely easy at times , and even some of the later levels feel like tutorials .
The interesting paradigm about this is you will die hundreds of times , which left me kind of spellbound .
I knew the levels were easy , and I usually could figure it out the puzzles pretty quickly , but there is something about the game that made me die over and over again .
Curiosity kills the cat over and over again .
Which leads directly into the biggest positive in this game ; it ’s simply fun to play and experiment around with PJS .
Playing and interacting with all the fluids throughout the game will keep you entertained for hours .
You will become your own worst enemy as you tempt fate , and explore every nook and cranny throughout each level .
The ship is a lot of fun to fly , and controls work really well .
It is a little “ floaty ” at first , but by the end of the third or fourth stage you will have complete mastered their nuances .
This is a game for completists only !
If you want to speed run this game it will be done within two hours , and you will be left disappointed .
I have been debating throughout this entire review whether this game is a worth buying title or not .
It seems this may be the first of many episodes , judging by the subtitle , the shortness in length , and the cliffhanger ending .
With this in mind it further complicates the “ must buy ” question .
Pricing and quality of future episodes could be a major deterrent for this game .
Since I cannot know this , I have to make my decision with speculation only .
Right now I would say this is worth purchasing only because it is a mere $ 10.00 .
This decision was so tight that if it were $ 11.00 I would probably say you could pass on this one until a price drop or future episodes are released .
If you speed run through games , and only care about beating them , this game is not for you .
This is made for people who can play it passively over a few days or weeks on and off , depending on your level of nerdiness .
If you ’re a fan of the series this is a nice edition , but you will find yourself asking for more , and being slightly disappointed .
The international significance of the Greek general strike
10 May 2010
The Greek general strike and continuing mass protests against the European - IMF austerity package negotiated last week with Prime Minister George Papandreou , of the social - democratic PASOK party , are a sign of coming class struggles in Europe and around the world .
There is bitter opposition among Greek workers to Papandreou ’s policy .
Hundreds of thousands of jobs are to be cut , workers will take initial pay cuts of 20 percent or more , and social services and pensions are to be gutted .
Stock markets collapsed last week , as investors worried that Papandreou might not be able to force the cuts through , and that protests against the financial crisis could spread .
These events have revolutionary consequences internationally .
As speculation rises against Portugal , Spain , and other European countries , it is increasingly clear that workers around the world face a common enemy : a parasitic ruling class that has enriched itself through the bailout of the financial system and wants to enforce huge cuts in jobs , pay , and benefits everywhere .
The international significance of the Greek strikes is now widely acknowledged .
Citing the Greek protests , New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman warned : “ Nothing to do with us , right ?
Well , I ’d pay attention to the drama playing out here .
It may be coming to a theater near you . ”
He added that , as in Greece , US workers “ will have to accept deep cuts to their benefits and pensions … ”
As in the US and other European countries , much of Greece ’s state debt comes from the € 28 billion bailout Athens voted for its banks .
Now , while the Greek ruling class aims to extract € 30 billion in yearly cuts from workers , governments throughout Europe and in the US are preparing to cut tens or hundreds of billions from their budgets .
This winter , the banks bid up interest rates on Greek debt , hoping to make large profits from interest payments while giving Papandreou an excuse for the social cuts he aimed to carry out .
This plan has now backfired , however .
As workers protested the cuts and European powers clashed over the terms of a bailout , interest rates climbed so high that the banks for all practical purposes bankrupted Greece .
Even if Greece adhered to the three - year , € 110 - billion European - IMF bailout , it would be shattered — by some estimates , the European - IMF cuts would collapse its economy by 30 percent .
By then , however , it would owe even more than the roughly €300 billion it owes today .
The Greek crisis has snowballed into a European crisis , threatening the global economy .
The banks are increasingly nervous about lending to Portugal , Spain , the UK , and other countries .
Given Greece ’s role as a lender and export market for Bulgaria , Romania , and Serbia — and as an employer of immigrant workers — the crisis also threatens to devastate the already impoverished and unstable Balkans .
As they worry that European governments will go bankrupt and that banks will lose enormous sums of money , bankers are also increasingly refusing to lend to each other .
This threatens a new credit crunch .
European Union monetary affairs commissioner Olli Rehn warned , “ Consequences from Greece ’s insolvency would be similar if not worse ” than the Lehman Brothers collapse of 2008 .
The Greek bailout , paid to Greece ’s creditors among the banks , will be extracted from the workers twice : first , from workers in countries funding the bailout , and then from workers in Greece , who will have to pay back the loans making up the bailout .
In both cases , they will be used as the pretext for massive cuts .
As social conflict mounts and the global capitalist crisis deepens , the ruling class will resort to ever more open forms of dictatorial rule .
While such measures have been justified so far on the basis of the “ war on terror , ” they will increasingly be directed at mass social opposition .
The British Observer Sunday interviewed Brigadier Stylianos Pattakos , the last surviving member of the military junta that ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974 .
Pattakos praised the junta ’s record : “ In our time , there was no debt .
Not one drachma went astray .
The Greeks are not disciplined like the Germans or the British .
They need authority . ”
He added : “ We are neither at the middle nor at the end of political developments … we are at the beginning . ”
Workers opposing bank bailouts in Greece and abroad face a common world crisis and need an international strategy .
An independent political strategy of the working class runs into immediate conflict with the trade unions and the middle class organizations that work to demobilize opposition .
In Greece , the trade unions and its allies , including the Greek Communist Party and Syriza , are determined to maintain their alliance with Papandreou and their role in the political establishment .
They promoted Papandreou ’s candidacy , and routinely discuss the political situation and the terms of bailouts with him .
By promoting a perspective of influencing Papandreou ’s social - democratic PASOK party , these layers — like their counterparts elsewhere — consciously seek to subordinate workers to the state , to nationalist politics , and to the banks ’ austerity program .
The rising risk of state bankruptcy poses stark alternatives : either the ruling class will keep its riches by impoverishing the workers , or the workers will expropriate the ruling class .
The challenge facing workers is to grasp the full political and historical implications of the struggles they now face .
Banks must become public utilities , so their funds pass under the control of the working class and serve social need , not private profit .
This directly raises the question of revolutionary socialism , for it spells the end of private ownership of the commanding heights of the economy , the profit principle , and the nation - state system .
The political task facing workers in Europe is not to pressure bourgeois governments determined to implement social cuts , but to bring them down and replace them instead with the United Socialist States of Europe .

Is Libertarianism a Part of the Right or the Left ? Neither .
We Are Unique
by Walter Block by Walter Block Recently by Walter Block : My Top Ten List of Books That Have InfluencedMe
I recently published this article : Block , Walter .
2010 .
" Libertarianism is unique ; it belongs neither to the right nor the left : a critique of the views of Long , Holcombe , and Baden on the left , Hoppe , Feser and Paul on the right . "
Journal of Libertarian Studies ; Vol. 22 : 127—70 .
It is 44 pages long , replete with footnotes , references and all other such scholarly accoutrements .
The present essay is a layman ’s version of that paper .
Most people are too busy to wade through such a long and thorough examination of this question , or , indeed , most other issues .
But , this topic is important for libertarians , so I thought I would offer the present essay as a more accessible version of that longer paper .
If you have a query , an objection , a criticism about anything I say herein , please first check the longer paper published in the JLS for reservations , elaborations and qualifications , which appear in the footnotes , reference or appendix sections .
The libertarian political economic philosophy is unique .
It belongs neither to the right or left hand part of the political economic spectrum .
This thesis is in sharp contrast to the views of left libertarians Long , Holcombe , and Baden who maintain that libertarianism is really part of the left , or left - feminist movement , and equally so with the perspective of conservative libertarians Hoppe , Feser and Paul , in whose view libertarianism is a constituent element of the right - wing conservative movement .
The present paper defends the position of libertarian centrism , or libertarian purity or plumb - line libertarianism , vis -à - vis its two competitors for the libertarian mantle : left - wing libertarianism and right - wing libertarianism .
Appearing on LewRockwell.com , there is no need even to carefully define terms such as " libertarian , " as would otherwise be the case .
For , amazingly , all parties to this debate are staunch libertarians .
There are no differences between any of us as to the primacy of the non-aggression axiom , coupled with private property rights based on homesteading .
All principals to this debate agree with these basic premises .
Where we differ is in terms of the logical implications of these founding axioms .
In section II we take to task Long , Holcombe , Baden and other New Age , feminist , hippie libertarians .
Section III is devoted to an equally sharp evisceration of the right - wing , conservative , traditionalist position of libertarians such as Hoppe , Feser and Paul .
We conclude in section IV with an attempt to woo back into the libertarian mainstream these outliers , both sets of them .
II .
Contra left - wing libertarianism
A. Roderick Long
a. rape
Here is an indicative view of Long :
" When radical feminists say that male supremacy rests in large part on the fact of rape — as when Susan Brownmiller characterizes rape as u2018a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear ’ — libertarians often dismiss this on the grounds that not all men are literal rapists and not all women are literally raped .
But when their own Ludwig von Mises says that u2018 government interference always means either violent action or the threat of such action , ’ that it rests u2018 in the last resort ’ on u2018 the employment of armed men , of policemen , gendarmes , soldiers , prison guards , and hangmen , ’ and that its u2018essential feature ’ is u2018 the enforcement of its decrees by beating , killing , and imprisoning ’ , libertarians applaud this as a welcome demystification of the state .
Libertarians rightly recognize that legally enacted violence is the means by which all rulers keep all citizens in a state of fear , even though not all government functionaries personally beat , kill , or imprison anybody , and even though not all citizens are beaten , killed , or imprisoned ; the same interpretive charity towards the radical feminist analysis of rape is not too much to ask . "
Although Feser did not write with this specific quote in mind , he might well have :
" … it is of the essence of modern intellectual life that such claims , and many that are even more bizarre — e.g. that marriage is comparable to rape and sexual intercourse an expression of contempt for women ( Andrea Dworkin ) , that Soviet communism would have been worth the murder of 20 million people had it worked out ( Eric Hobsbawm ) , that Greek civilization was stolen from Africa ( Martin Bernal ) — are regarded as at least worthy of discussion .
The rankest claptrap is given the most serious consideration , while common sense and tradition are dismissed without a hearing . "
I am of course too scholarly by disposition to characterize the views of Long and Johnson in this regard as " the rankest claptrap . "
Instead , I content myself by noting that there is a strong disanalogy between males vis -à - vis females on the one hand , and the state with respect to the rest of us , on the other .
To wit , every government without exception is a rights violator but not every man is a rapist or woman beater .
It is entirely justified for all members of the polity to go in fear of the government .
The state is the greatest rights violator known to man .
It is entirely a different matter to think it reasonable that all women are kept by all men in a continuous state of fear .
Brownmiller and Dworkin , themselves , furnish a counter - example : they went about their ordinary lives , shopping , working , teaching , lecturing , writing ; they could hardly done this were they in a perpetual state of fear .
Their " fear , " rather , was merely theoretical , political , or poetic .
Of course ordinary citizens , too , go about their daily concerns , without exhibiting undue fear of government , or , indeed , any fear at all ; they are taught from the earliest age that " the ( statist ) policeman is our friend . "
The difference is that the minions of the state rule over them whether their victims realize it or not .
This simply is not the case regarding all men and all women regarding rape .
This is not such a difference in degree that it ultimately amounts to a difference in kind ; it is a difference in kind at the outset .
For proof , all we need do is reflect upon the fact that there never has been a government that has not violated rights .
Surely , most men have never , ever , raped anyone , or even come close .
b. The wage gap
Long and Johnson are exercised about " the reality and pervasiveness of … discrimination against women … " According to Long :
" Women on the job market make , on average , 75 cents for every dollar men make for the equivalent jobs .
" What explains this wage gap ?
Various possibilities have been suggested .
But some Austrians have argued that there is only one possible explanation : women are less productive than men .
" The argument goes like this :
If employers pay an employee more than the value of that worker ’s marginal revenue product , the company will lose money and so will be penalised ( sic ) by the market .
If employers pay an employee less than the value of his or her marginal revenue product , then other companies can profit by offering more competitive wages and so luring the employee away .
Hence wage rates that are set either above or below the employee ’s marginal revenue product will tend to get whittled away via competition .
( See Mises and Rothbard for this argument . )
The result is that any persistent disparity between men’s and women ’s wages must be due to a corresponding disparity between their marginal productivities .
" As Walter Block puts it : Consider a man and a woman each with a productivity of $ 10 per hour , and suppose , because of discrimination or whatever , that the man is paid $ 10 per hour and the woman is paid $ 8 per hour .
It is as if the woman had a little sign on her forehead saying , u2018 Hire me and earn an extra $ 2 an hour . ’
This makes her a desirable employee even for a sexist boss .
" The fact that the wage gap does not get whittled away by competition in this fashion shows that the gap must be based , so the argument runs , on a real difference in productivity between the sexes .
This does not necessarily point to any inherent difference in capacities , but might instead be due to the disproportionate burden of household work shouldered by women — which would also explain why the wage gap is greater for married women than for single women .
( Walter Block makes this argument also . )
Hence feminist worries about the wage gap are groundless .
" I ’m not sure why this argument , if successful , would show that worrying about the wage gap is a mistake , rather than showing that efforts to redress the gap should pay less attention to influencing employers and more attention to influencing marital norms .
( Perhaps the response would be that since wives freely choose to abide by such norms , outsiders have no basis for condemning the norms .
But since when ca n’t freely chosen arrangements be criticised ( sic ) — on moral grounds , prudential grounds , or both ? )
" But anyway , I ’m not persuaded by the argument , which strikes me as [ ominous pause for effect ] more neoclassical … than Austrian , in that it ignores imperfect information , the passage of time , etc .
I certainly agree with Mises and Rothbard that there is a tendency for workers to be paid in accordance with their marginal revenue product , but the tendency does n’t realise ( sic ) itself instantaneously or without facing countervailing tendencies , and so , as I see it , does not license the inference that workers ’ wages are likely to approximate the value of their marginal revenue product — just as the existence of equilibrating tendencies does n’t mean the economy is going to be at or near equilibrium .
I would apply to this case the observation Mises makes about the final state of rest — that although u2018 the market at every instant is moving toward a final state of rest , ’ nevertheless this state u2018 will never be attained ’ because u2018new disturbing factors will emerge before it will be realized . ’
" First of all , most employers do not know with any great precision their workers ’ marginal revenue product .
Firms are , after all , islands of central planning — on a small enough scale that the gains from central coordination generally outweigh the losses , but still they are epistemically ( sic ) hampered by the absence of internal markets … .
A firm confronts the test of profitability as a unit , not employee by employee , and so there is a fair bit of guesswork involved in paying workers according to their profitability .
Precisely this point is made , in another context , by Block himself : u2018estimating the marginal - revenue product of actual and potential employees …. is difficult to do : there are joint products ; productivity depends upon how the worker u2018 fits in ’ with others ; it is impossible to keep one ’s eye on a given person all day long ; etc . ’
But Block thinks this does n’t much matter , because u2018 those entrepreneurs who can carry out such tasks prosper ; those who cannot , do not . ’
Well , true enough , but an entrepreneur does n’t have to solve those problems perfectly in order to prosper — as anyone who has spent any time in the frequently insane , Dilbert - like world of actual industry can testify …
" Even if women are not generally less productive than men , then , there might still be a widespread presumption on the part of employers that they are , and in light of the difficulty of determining the productivity of specific individuals , this presumption would not be easily falsified , thus making any wage gap based on such a presumption more difficult for market forces to whittle away .
( Similar presumptions could explain the wage gap between married and single women likewise . )
" Hence a wage gap might persist even if employers are focused solely on profitability , have no interest in discrimination , and are doing the level best to pay salary on marginal productivity alone .
But there is no reason to rule out the possibility of deliberate , profit - disregarding discrimination either .
Discrimination can be a consumption good for managers , and this good can be treated as part of the manager ’s salary - and - benefits package ; any costs to the company arising from the manager ’s discriminatory practices can thus be viewed as sheer payroll costs .
Maybe some managers order fancy wood paneling for their offices , and other managers pay women less for reasons of sexism ; if the former sort of behaviour can survive the market test , why not the latter ?
" I should add that I do n’t think my skepticism about the productivity theory of wages is any sort of criticism of the market .
The tendency to which Austrians point is real , and it means that markets are likely to get us closer to wages - according - to - productivity than could any rival system .
( Since neoclassical perfect competition is incoherent and impossible , it does not count as a relevant rival . )
If employers have a hard time estimating their workers ’ productivity ( the knowledge problem ) , or sometimes cannot be trusted to try ( the incentive problem ) , that ’s no reason to suppose that government would do any better .
Employers are certainly in a better ( however imperfect ) position to evaluate their employees ’ productivity than is some distant legislator or bureaucrat , and they likewise have more reason to care about their company ’s profitability ( even if it ’s not all they care about ) than would the government .
So there ’s no reason to think that transferring decision - making authority from employers to the State would bring wages into any better alignment with productivity .
People in government are crooked timber too , and ( given economic democracy ’s superior efficiency in comparison with political democracy ) they ’re even less constrained by any sort of accountability than private firms are .
" Nothing I ’ve said shows that men and women are equally productive ; it ’s only meant to show that , given prevailing cultural norms and power relations , we might well expect to see a gap between men’s and women ’s earnings even if they were equally productive ( which is at least reason for skepticism about claims that they are not equally productive ) .
" I would also add that even if there are persistent problems — non-governmental but nonetheless harmful power relations and the like — that market processes do not eliminate automatically , it does not follow that there is nothing to be done about these problems short of a resort to governmental force .
That ’s one reason I ’m more sympathetic to the labour movement and the feminist movement than many libertarians nowadays tend to be .
In the 19th century , libertarians saw political oppression as one component in an interlocking system of political , economic , and cultural factors ; they made neither the mistake of thinking that political power was the only problem nor the mistake of thinking that political power could be safely and effectively used to combat the other problems … .
" We know — independently of the existence of the wage gap — that there is plenty of sexism in the business world .
( Those who do n’t know this can verify it for themselves by spending time in that world or talking with those who have done so . )
Once we see why the productivity theory of wages , though correct as far as it goes , goes less far than its proponents often suppose , it does not seem implausible to suppose that this sexism plays some role in explaining the wage gap , and such sexism needs to be combated .
( And even if the wage gap were based on a genuine productivity gap deriving from women ’s greater responsibility for household work , the cultural expectations that lead women to assume such responsibility would then be the sexism to combat . )
But that ’s no reason to gripe about u2018 market failure . ’
Such failure is merely our failure .
Instead , we need to fight the power — peacefully , but not quietly . "
There are several problems with the foregoing .
1. Perhaps most important , we must hark back to the biblical story where people are paid different amounts of money for doing precisely the same job ; or what is the same thing , the same compensation for doing very different amounts of work .
Why is this unjust from a libertarian perspective ?
It is not .
These disparities can be interpreted as a differential gift giving .
That is , the employer pays everyone equally for equal productivity , but then makes a freely given donation to some but not to others .
As long as all these acts are voluntary , there is nothing to which the libertarian , qua libertarian , can object .
Based only on this consideration , Long is going to have to decide whether his primary allegiance lies with feminism or libertarianism .
This author does indeed touch on one aspect of this when he discusses the possibility that the wage gap between males and females might be due to in effect employer consumption : paying males more than females just for the sheer joy of doing so .
If so , is this not the employer ’s right ?
And if so , from whence springs any possible libertarian objection to the wage gap ?
2 . Let us move from normative to positive economics , and consider Long ’s objections to the thesis that in the free market , wages tend to be based upon marginal productivities .
Here , we note that this author posits that there is a " tendency " for employers to pay workers at the level of their marginal revenue product ( MRP ) , but , fully in the Austrian tradition , notes the fact that this is not instantaneous .
However , he seems to think that always and ever females are paid less than their MRP , and that the market is in effect " lazy " in bringing the two amounts into equality .
If the market process were instantaneous , which of course it is not and cannot be , then female wages would instantly rise to their proper MRP levels , and there would be no injustice , at least in this one case .
But why would there be a bias in the market , such that entrepreneurship necessarily results in lower female wages in disequilibrium ?
Why not wages higher than MRP when the market is not in its equilibrium or evenly rotating state ?
Long , let alone not furnishing us with an answer to this absolutely crucial implicit claim of his , does not even seem to recognize that there is a need to do so .
3 . Perhaps the fact that lesbians earn more than straight women will convince Long that the market wages tend not to be determined by sexist men who are biased against women , on the basis of this taste .
For , if the male chauvinist pigs were indeed in charge of pay decisions , and were indeed biased in this direction , and not stopped by profit considerations from indulging in these tastes , surely they would reserve their extreme ire for lesbians , who , presumably , violate traditional values far more than do heterosexual females .
4 . Long is on a slippery slope .
If he doubts that marginal productivity theory applies to the male — female wage gap , logic compels him to articulate the same difficulties as far as the usual free market economic analysis of minimum wages is concerned .
That is , he must say something along the following lines : yes , the minimum wage leads to unemployment for low - skill workers ; but this is true only in equilibrium , and we are never in equilibrium .
To bitterly oppose minimum - wage legislation , as do many right - wing libertarians , is to base one ’s analysis on , horrors , dramatic pause for effect , neoclassical economics .
In contrast we sophisticated left - wing Austro - libertarians are more sympathetic to minimum - wage legislation since it takes time , time that the poor simply do not have , for wages of the unskilled to rise to their equilibrium MRP levels .
In the interim , the minimum - wage law can play a positive role .
His support for unions in this regard is more than just a little disquieting , in that they are , and for good reason , among the strongest supporters of minimum - wage legislation in society , apart from the fully economically illiterate .
It may well be that while Long is a staunch libertarian when it comes to personal liberties , he is less so , far less so , when it comes to economic freedom , due to his misunderstanding of economics .
It is also more than passing curious to find an eminent libertarian such as Long supporting an institution that engages in violence against " scabs . "
5 . What is this business of criticizing the freely made decisions of women to stay home and take care of babies ?
It matters not one whit that this is done " on moral grounds ( or ) prudential grounds . "
The libertarian qua libertarian simply has no business in criticizing " women ’s ( choice of ) greater responsibility for household work . "
It is no business of the libertarian , none whatsoever , to " combat " the " sexism " implicit in " the cultural expectations that lead women to assume such responsibility . "
6. Consider Long and Johnson ’s claim that there is a false but " widespread presumption on the part of employers that " female productivity is lower than that of the male .
Presumably , this false presumption is not only widespread , but of long duration .
Otherwise , it could hardly account for a continuing wage gap .
If so , it resembles nothing if not the " cluster of error " of Austrian Business Cycle theory ( ABCT ) .
But , as we know from our study of business cycles , any such conglomeration of error cannot long endure without continued statist interference with markets .
It would be dissipated by the market ’s profits - and - loss weeding out process .
7. State our authors : " … employers … cannot be trusted to try … estimating their workers ’ productivity … ( the incentive problem ) . "
By this they refer to the fact that some employers might forego a non-sexist discriminatory policy out of consumerist motivations .
But if they do , they will be doing so strictly as consumers , albeit it on company property .
That is , they will not be doing so as employers , as these authors maintain .
8 . In my view , it is not at all a " mistake " to " think … that political power ( is ) the only problem , " that is , as far as libertarianism is concerned .
Here , I define political power along Oppenheimer lines to include any and all initiations of violence , or threats thereof , against innocent people .
This would include , of course , government ; but it would also incorporate other uncivilized behavior such as that perpetrated by robber gangs , or , even , individuals who brutalize innocent victims on their own account .
Of course , there are other problems that libertarians are involved in combating : bad breath , the heartbreak of psoriasis , losing chess games , cancer , the list goes on and on .
But , here , libertarians who do so are not acting qua libertarians .
This is a distinction that is crucial for a clear understanding of this philosophy .
9 . What are we to make of this claim : " We know — independently of the existence of the wage gap — that there is plenty of sexism in the business world .
( Those who do n’t know this can verify it for themselves by spending time in that world or talking with those who have done so . ) "
In one sense , this is unobjectionable .
Were it to be filed under the " everyone knows " category , no reasonable person would object to it .
However , if we are going the anecdotal route , let me add in my own two cents worth .
Yes , we have all heard the sexist jokes in the business world , and , also , the numerous comments about different women ’s physical attributes .
But when it comes to pay , my own informal assessment is that it works mainly in the direction not of increasing the pay gap between men and women .
Rather , it is all in the direction of paying attractive women a beauty premium .
And this observation should not be the occasion of any great surprise .
What else could we reasonably expect from healthy male heterosexuals , if they are in a position to indulge their tastes ?
Their true tastes , let it be stated loud and clear , is not against women , but , if they are in opposition to anyone , it is to other males who are seen as competition .
In another sense , this is highly objectionable .
After all , we are discussing an important issue : is there a male — female wage gap once productivity is taken into account , and if so , is this unjust from a libertarian point of view ?
Resort to anecdotes of this sort must be ruled out of court in any serious analysis .
c. New Age
According to Long " It is an open question whether New Age ideas will prove to be favorable or unfavorable to libertarianism .
I consider them favorable , on the whole … .
If the natural political expression of the Catholic ethos was monarchism , and the natural political expression of the Protestant ethos was democracy , then the natural political expression of the New Age ethos is free - market anarchism .
This does not mean that today ’s New Agers are libertarians .
Some are ; but most , I suspect , are moderate statists of the eco -left variety .
Yet likewise the first Protestants had few if any democratic inclinations .
If the historical pattern repeats itself , however , then as the New Age movement continues to grow , its adherents will come to find its anarchic organizational structure more and more natural , and will gravitate toward manifestations of that same structure in the political realm .
Hence , I suggest , we who hope to found a Free Nation should view the emerging religious climate as a reason for optimism . "
I find this more than passing curious .
On the one hand , I join with Long in hoping that New Agers will one day convert en masse to libertarianism .
On the other hand , I would be willing to bet that more ex -Nazis and ex-hard - core communists will one day embrace freedom than will those of the New Age persuasion .
In any case , I seen no evidence of any New Agers at all who are now libertarians .
I should welcome being proven wrong on this matter .
But as matters stand , this group of people seems most associated with libertine sexual practices , the wearing of hippie clothes , the drug culture , and , as for the rest , obscurantism , relativism and other types of irrationality , too many and too impenetrable even for discussion .
Posit , however , that Long is totally correct in his assessment .
One day , perhaps soon , our libertarian ranks will be bolstered by thousands , nay , tens or hundreds of thousands of Austro - libertarian ex — New Agers , all of them clutching volumes of Atlas Shrugged and Human Action , and sounding rational for the first times in their lives .
What of it ?
Why should we ally ourselves with them now ?
Worse , where is the argument for at present considering them allies ?
Even worse than that , what is the case for considering ourselves as part of a movement that now ( shudder , groan ) includes them ?
It can not be denied that the views of these people , when comprehensible , are pretty much aligned with ours when it comes to personal liberties ( pot smoking and all types and varieties of fornication should be legal , particularly the most kinky ones ) and to foreign policy ( although many of them are pacifists , and libertarians certainly need not adhere to that doctrine ) .
But , when it comes to economic freedom , these people foam at the mouth in anger at the very idea .
One might as well posit individual vs. team sports athletes as more compatible with libertarianism .
That is , track runners are more libertarian than basketball players , since the former compete on their own , and the latter are part of a collective enterprise .
This is a similarly improbable claim with no support whatsoever .
No , the latter are not , because of this fact , more libertarian than the former , and hippie New Agers are not libertarians , nor are we associated with them by virtue of them taking on our own philosophy , in very small part .
d. Equality
According to Long :
" In short , the equality that Locke and Jefferson speak of is equality in authority : the prohibition of any u2018subordination or subjection ’ of one person to another .
Since any interference by A with B ’s liberty constitutes a subordination or subjection of B to A , the right to liberty follows straightforwardly from the equality of u2018 power and jurisdiction . ’
" As Locke explains : [ B]eing all equal and independent , no one ought to harm another in his life , health , liberty or possessions .
. . .
And , being furnished with like faculties , sharing all in one community of nature , there cannot be supposed any such subordination among us that may authorize ( sic ) us to destroy one another , as if we were made for one another ’s uses , as the inferior ranks of creatures are for ours .
" This is a notable pre-Kantian statement of the principle that human beings are not to be treated as mere means to the ends of others .
( Observe , too , how Locke and Jefferson both invoke independence as a corollary of , or a gloss on , equality in authority . )
" We can now see how socioeconomic equality and legal equality both fall short of the radicalism of Lockean equality .
For neither of those forms of equality calls into question the authority of those who administer the legal system ; such administrators are merely required to ensure equality , of the relevant sort , among those administered .
Thus socioeconomic equality , despite the bold claims of its adherents , does no more to challenge the existing power structure than does legal equality .
Both forms of equality call upon that power structure to do certain things ; but in so doing , they both assume , and indeed require , an inequality in authority between those who administer the legal framework and everybody else .
" The libertarian version of equality is not circumscribed in this way .
As Locke sees , equality in authority entails denying to the legal system ’s administrators — and thus to the legal system itself — any powers beyond those possessed by private citizens :
" [ T ]he execution of the law of nature is in that state put into every man ’s hands , whereby every one has a right to punish the transgressors of that law to such a degree as may hinder its violation .
. . .
For in that state of perfect equality , where naturally there is no superiority or jurisdiction of one over another , what any may do in prosecution of that law , every one must needs have a right to do .
" Lockean equality involves not merely equality before legislators , judges , and police , but , far more crucially , equality with legislators , judges , and police .
" By this standard Murray Rothbard , in his advocacy of anarcho - capitalism , turns out to have been one of the most consistent and thoroughgoing egalitarian theorists of all time .
As the author of Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature , Rothbard might very well turn over in his grave to hear himself so described ; but , as we shall see , what Ayn Rand used to say of capitalism applies a fortiori to equality : equality , properly understood , is in many ways an unknown ideal — unknown both to its defenders and to its detractors . "
My only agreement with Long on this matter is that Rothbard would indeed turn over in his grave to hear his views characterized as " egalitarian , " of all things , and properly so .
For if there is anything clear about Rothbard ’s views , it is that he was an opponent , not a supporter , of this doctrine .
Long " succeeds " in shoe - horning Rothbard into this position only by stipulative definition : he redefines egalitarianism , or equality , as non-aggression , and then , correctly , insists , that under libertarianism we would all , rich and poor , the well born and the not so , have equal rights not to be aggressed against .
True , but there is no need to smuggle in egalitarianism or equality to make this eminently sensible libertarian point .
Long , however , errs , in his analysis of authority .
The employer has authority over the employee .
As does the orchestra conductor vis -à - vis the musicians .
This kind of authority is not at all problematic , in that it stems from voluntary agreements to submit to the authority of these others ; e.g. , the employer , boss , conductor , foreman , etc .
If Long is using the word " authority " to depict any other relationship than this reportative one , then he is merely articulating , once again , the libertarian non-aggression axiom .
e. Feminism
According to Long and Johnson :
" … the political traditions of libertarianism and feminism are both in the main correct , insightful , and of the first importance in any struggle to build a just , free , and compassionate society .
We do not intend to try to justify the import of either tradition on the other ’s terms , nor prove the correctness or insightfulness of the non-aggression principle , the libertarian critique of state coercion , the reality and pervasiveness of male violence and discrimination against women , or the feminist critique of patriarchy . "
Rothbard would also turn over in his grave at the prospect of " libertarians " supporting feminism .
How else could he have penned these words : " … the arrant nonsense of Women ’s Liberation . "
Yes , some men rape some women , and females earn less than males , on average , but it is truly a long way from such insights to the libertarian embrace of feminism , of all things .
It can not be denied , moreover , that if females suffer in comparison to males in these regards , than they are in a vastly superior position regarding incidence of suicide , depression , incarceration , mental illness and length of life .
f. Public property
Long is also an advocate of public ( in addition to ) private property .
He starts off by attempting to overturn Hardin ’s concept of the tragedy of the commons , according to which too many cooks spoil the broth : if there are too many owners , for example , the entire public even though they are local , there will be overuse of the resource , as each user imposes costs on the others that he does not himself take into account .
With a little help from Rose and Schmidtz , Long attempts to evade this finding on the ground that :
" There are some cases in which , at least within certain parameters , a physical resource ’s value is enhanced by increased use … .
This is particularly true when the resource is tied in some way to a non-physical comedy - of - the - commons resource , like a market or a town festival ; since “ the more , the merrier ” applies to these non-physical resources , it also applies , to some extent , to the physical land on which the market or festival is held , and to the physical roadways leading there .
Since everyone benefits from having more people come to the fair , everyone also benefits from making physical access to the fairgrounds free as well .
" Of course there are limits .
If too many people come , the fair will be too crowded to be enjoyable .
But this simply shows that some goods have both tragedy - of - the - commons and comedy - of - the - commons aspects , and which one predominates will depend on the circumstances .
Public property may be the efficient solution in some cases , and private property in others .
( Or a bundle of property rights may be split up , with some public , some private . ) "
In my view , there are several errors committed here .
First , Long fails to distinguish between use and ownership .
To be sure , value will increase with use , at least initially , and then decline with overcrowding , as Long correctly notes .
However , what does this have to do with the topic under debate , which is not use but rather ownership ?
Imagine a fairgrounds literally owned by tens , nay , hundreds of thousands of people , not in the form of a single firm with many stock holders , but rather in common , where each of these many , many individuals has the right to do whatever he pleases with the property .
This is a recipe for economic disaster , or , as Hardin would have it , tragedy .
Second , it is not possible for " public " fairgrounds to compete with each other in a way that allows for the weeding out of the inefficient owners , in the same way as can occur with private holdings .
Suppose for instance that public fairgrounds
A does well , satisfies customers , etc. , while public fairgrounds B fails in this regard .
How can the former , or anyone else for that matter , naturally take over the latter , as occurs every day under private enterprise .
There will always be a few holdouts : private owners of the public property B who refuse to go along .
Long admits he has no solution to this problem of the " reversion of public property . "
Third , it is by no means clear that the optimal price for admittance to the fairgrounds is always for " free , " as Long asserts .
This seems to be the case for suburban shopping mall parking lots , but not for those located in highly dense areas where parking spaces are at a premium .
It is unclear why Long thinks a very large number of " public " owners would be on a par with profit - and - loss — making private owners in determining optimal prices in this regard .
Fourth , who , precisely , can make any entrepreneurial decisions about public property , of the sort that are made every day , indeed , practically every minute , in real business firms .
For example , suppose there are too few people at the fair ( who determines that ? ) : should the prices be lowered ?
If the price is already zero , as Long seems to think it would be , should this be lowered to a negative price , e.g. , give entrants a gift to entice them to attend ?
Suppose there are too many people at the fair ( who determines that ? ) : should the price be raised ?
Should a fence be built around the fairgrounds ?
Should the lawn be watered ?
How often ?
By whom ?
Should some ( how much ? ) of the grass be paved over for parking ?
For other purposes ?
How many police should be hired to patrol the fairgrounds and deal with pickpockets ?
What should the qualifications be for these guards ?
Should a water fountain , a swimming pool , be installed on the fairgrounds ?
Of what type and at what cost and by whom ?
Long attempts to answer questions of this sort and offers " turnover rules " for property such as roads , where one typically uses any given spot on the highway for a very small time duration , and " first - come - first - served rules " for things like a spot in a public park , such as a picnic table , where one uses the resource for a longer time , but then loses all control after one leaves .
But , as can be seen from the above set of questions , which comprise only the tip of the iceberg , these two rules hardly begin to address the problems of entrepreneurship and management .
Here is another of Long ’s defenses of public property :
" I envision a world of many individual private spaces , linked by a framework of public spaces .
The existence of such a framework may even be a prerequisite for complete control over one ’s own private space .
Suppose a trespasser comes on my land and I want to push him off .
If all the land around me is private as well , where can I push him , without violating the rights of my neighbors ?
But if there is a public walkway nearby , I have somewhere to push him .
Thus , the availability of public space may be a moral precondition for the right to freedom from trespassers . "
One answer to this quandary is to simply shoot the trespasser .
Better yet , perhaps , the property owner can banish him to the private property of the specific neighbor from whence the trespasser emanated , without violating the rights of the neighbor .
This is so since the neighbor ’s property functioned as the launching pad from which the trespasser came on to the property of the victim in the first place .
Of course that neighbor can turn around and do the same thing : banish the trespasser to the property of the neighbor on the other side , from which the trespasser first came onto his property , and so on , until we arrive at the source of the problem .
Nor is it clear how the resort to public property will solve Long ’s problem with the trespasser .
One is invited to think that the trespasser , too , is a member of the public , and if there is but a public park , or public road abutting the property of the victim of the trespass , he can push the trespasser out onto this area .
But why should that be the case ?
Long acknowledges that " In the homesteading case , it is presumably not the human race at large , but only the inhabitants of the village , that acquire a collective property right in the cleared path ; since it would be difficult for humankind as a whole , or even a substantial portion thereof , to mix its labor with a single resource , and so the homesteading argument places an upper limit on the size of property - owning collectives . "
Well , suppose then that the trespasser is not from the local village .
Then , Long ’s public property will not enable him to deal with the problem in any way not open to the full private property rights system .
Long states : " Since collectives , like individuals , can mix their labor with unowned resources to make those resources more useful to their purposes , collectives , too can claim property rights by homestead .
And since collectives , like individuals , can be the beneficiaries of free voluntary transfer , collectives too can claim property rights by bequest . "
There are problems here with regard to the Austrian notion of methodological individualism .
The way Long characterizes the matter , there is such an entity , the collective , which is apart from , and in contradistinction to , the individuals who comprise it .
But this is not so , indeed , logically cannot be so .
Once all the individuals are taken away from the group , one by one if need by , there is simply no " group " that remains .
" Group " or " collective " is merely a shorthand word for iterating the names of the members .
The " collective " cannot homestead resources ; the " collective , " indeed , cannot do anything that is not done by the individuals who comprise it .
Some individuals can indeed homestead property .
And if this property takes the form of path from the village to the nearby lake , as Long posits , then so be it .
These individuals , and no others , are now the legitimate owners of the path .
But the problem for Long is that he has not succeeded in demonstrating " public " property .
All he has shown is an instance of private property owned jointly , or , collectively if you will , by specific individuals .
This is no news .
There is no need to call this a " heretical " position .
We have long had partnerships , corporations , owned by many people .
Long worries about " the position of those who are not property owners ( specifically , those who do not own land ) ….
A system of exclusively private property certainly does not guarantee them a u2018 place to stand . ’
If I am evicted from private plot A , where can I go , except adjoining private plot B , if there is no public highway or parkland connecting the various private spaces ?
If everywhere I can stand is a place where I have no right to stand without permission , then , it seems , I exist only by the sufferance of the u2018 Lords of the Earth ’ ( in Herbert Spencer ’s memorable phrase ) . "
Perhaps I can allay Long ’s fears .
Anyone with a marginal revenue product above subsistence level can be assured of having a " place to stand . "
For subsistence requires no less than this ; how can you survive if you cannot as much as stand anywhere ?
Happily , just about everyone qualifies in this regard .
Given this , there will always be a landlord willing to rent space to all such people , certainly on this earth , where there is sub-marginal land , but very few such people .
But , what about sub-marginal people , and those not on earth ?
For example , what will be the plight of mentally handicapped people on the moon ?
Especially there , surely , earnings will not be sufficient to guarantee such people a place in which to live .
However , even under such dire circumstances
Long ’s scare scenario does not succeed in undermining the case for total and complete private property .
For such people will have more to worry about than merely a place to stand .
There is also , there as on earth , the question of who will feed them , clothe them , look after them ?
Presumably , this will be done by their parents , charitable institutions or other such benefactors .
Well , those who are in this way responsible for their welfare will presumably be able to add to these costs rental of space on which to stand , walk about , and otherwise thrive .
Standing room , in other words , does not " bite " ; it is not a factor , since it will be incorporated into these other concerns .
Long ’s article is a magnificent libertarian analysis of war , justice and the state .
And yet , and yet … .
This article , is marred not by anything substantive , but rather by his left - wing adherence to feminism .
Very annoying is his use of feminine pronouns such as in the following sentence : " But there seems something deeply un-libertarian about attributing to an aggressor the moral power to decrease her victim ’s legitimate sphere of authority over her own person and property ( emphasis added ) . "
Why would Long do this ?
The only plausible answer would appear to be that he highly regards the feminist movement , which is not noted for its adherence to the principles of libertarianism .
In a seeming strange left — right overlap amongst libertarians , Hoppe , who I characterize below as a paradigm case of right - wing libertarianism , would appear to support Long , who I see as a paradigm case of left - wing libertarian , on the notion that not all property should be privately owned ; rather , some of it should be publicly owned .
States Hoppe " … insurers would want to expel known criminals not just from their immediate neighborhood but from civilization altogether , into the wilderness or open frontier of the Amazon jungle , the Sahara , or the polar regions . "
Supporting the contention that Hoppe is in this case a left - wing libertarian is the interpretation that the Amazon jungle , the Sahara , and the polar regions would not be privately owned .
For if they were , their owners would presumably object , and strenuously so , to the dumping of criminals from the " civilized " areas on to their property .
But this interpretation is problematic .
A far more reasonable one is that while these frontier areas are potentially open to privatization , at present they constitute sub- marginal lands which are too uneconomical to settle .
So , those looking for evidence that Hoppe is a leftist on land privatization will have to look elsewhere .
B. Randy Holcombe
Holcombe ’s contribution to left libertarianism to the best of my knowledge consists of three of his claims .
In one of them he maintains that there really is no difference worth making for the libertarian , between a voluntary condominium association on the one hand , and a small town with a coercive government , on the other .
In his second contribution to this literature , Holcombe takes the position that common property also , not only private property , is compatible with libertarianism .
Since I have criticized the first of these publications of his with a full - length rejoinder and have discussed the other in my critique , supra , of Long , let me merely summarize my criticisms of these two points .
In the first case I charge Holcombe with insufficiently distinguishing coercion from voluntary agreement .
Superficially , the swimming pool run by a small town and a condo association may function in a similar manner .
But there is all the world of difference between them for the libertarian , since one is predicated on coercion , the other on voluntary agreement .
Similarly , to the outside observer , rape and voluntary sexual intercourse may be indistinguishable .
The woman might even be to all outward appearances an " enthusiastic " participant , under the threat that if she is not , the rapist will kill the woman ’s child sleeping nearby .
And yet , distinguishable or not , for the libertarian there is a crucial difference between rape and sexual intercourse based on seduction .
In the second case Holcombe argues that government is inevitable .
My critique is that if government is inevitable , why is it that we have never had world government ?
Also , inevitability is not compatible with free will , which , presumably , Holcombe utilizes in the very writing of his article .
He is thus guilty of a performative in using the free will he needs to write his article to attack this very concept .
In the third case Holcombe mentions a trail that is blazed on virgin territory by a hundred individuals .
No one of them puts in enough homesteading effort into this enterprise to legitimately claim single , individual ownership .
To do so would be to violate the rights of the other 99 people .
From this undisputed fact he somehow deduces that the trail then becomes commonly owned by the entire human race , all six billion of us .
He fails to recognize that there is a third alternative : these 100 people , and only these 100 people , are the proper owners of the trail .
C. John Baden
Another otherwise libertarian who does not fully support private property rights is Baden : " I ’m a guy who , with my wife Ramona , ran 500 ewes for years .
Yet we publicly support the return of the wolf to wild areas . "
This , despite that fact that " The reintroduction of wolves necessarily means that more livestock and pets will be prey . "
And again : " In Montana , and in Idaho as well , few issues are more complex and emotional than those concerning wolves .
For three generations people vilified , mythologized , and killed wolves .
More recently , many environmentalists , myself included , have sought to restore this ancient predator to Yellowstone Park and wilderness areas .
Returning the wolf replaces an important part of the ecological tapestry that humanity has unwoven … .
With careful management , humans and wolves can coexist .
Even with 75 wolves in northwestern Montana , only two cow calves were killed last year . "
If Baden , a Montana rancher , were talking about releasing wolves onto his own property , while building strong fences to keep them penned in there , that would be one thing .
His neighbors might feel threatened , but that is another matter .
However , this otherwise free market environmentalist is proposing no such thing .
Instead , he is advocating the introduction of this vicious predator into the wilds , where no fences will keep them from the private property of other landowners .
It would be one thing if Baden were the typical watermelon : green on the outside but red on the inside .
Then , he would be , merely , an ordinary leftist , or coercive socialist .
Those are a dime a dozen .
But this is clearly not the case , here .
Rather , this author has impeccable free enterprise credentials .
This being the case , it is then proper to characterize him as a left libertarian .
No matter how he is characterized , one thing is clear : it is a violation of private property rights to release wolves onto territory where they can have access to the persons and property of others .
Let Baden keep those wolves to himself .
III .
Contra right - wing libertarianism
A. Hans Hoppe
a. Conservatives
According to Hoppe : " … conservatives today must be antistatist libertarians and equally important , … libertarians must be conservatives . "
I have no real objection to the first part of this statement .
Indeed , I warmly support the idea that conservatives convert to anti-statist libertarianism .
However , I cannot see my way clear to agreeing with the latter contention : that libertarians become conservatives .
Indeed , to do so would be anathema to libertarianism .
Surely , Hoppe cannot literally mean that libertarians should give up their philosophy and embrace that of present - day conservatives .
The only way to reconcile the latter part of this statement with the body of his other work is to say that libertarians should align themselves only with those conservatives who have themselves become libertarians , as per the first part of this statement .
But this is just a highly convoluted way of saying that libertarians should be true to their own philosophy , a viewpoint I also enthusiastically support .
b. Immigration
I regard Hoppe ’s view on immigration as a retreat from libertarianism , and an embrace of conservative principles .
I will not discuss this issue here as there is already not a small literature on this matter .
c. Homosexuality
Consider the following statement from Hoppe where he calls for homosexuals and others to be banned from polite society :
" Naturally no one is permitted to advocate ideas contrary to the very purpose of the covenant of preserving and protecting private property , such as democracy and communism .
There can be no tolerance toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order .
They will have to be physically separated and removed from society .
Likewise , in a covenant founded for the purpose of protecting family and kin , there can be no tolerance toward those habitually promoting lifestyles incompatible with this goal .
They — the advocates of alternative , non-family and kin-centered lifestyles such as , for instance , individual hedonism , parasitism , nature - environment worship , homosexuality , or communism — will have to be physically removed from society , too , if one is to maintain a libertarian order . "
Say what you will in support of this statement — it is stark , it is well written , it is radical , it gives a well - deserved intellectual kick to the teeth to some groups who richly deserve it — it is still exceedingly difficult to reconcile it with libertarianism .
For , in the free society , there will always be the likelihood that different groups will tend to amalgamate in certain geographical areas , and even have restrictive covenants that enforce just requirements , and limitations on free speech .
In places like parts of Texas , Alabama , Mississippi , Arkansas , Louisiana , for example , there is little doubt that such sentiments will be the order of the day .
But there will likely be other areas of the country , for example , the People ’s Republics of Santa Monica , Ann Arbor , Cambridge , Mass , Greenwich Village in New York City , heck , the entire Big Apple for that matter , where pretty much the opposite outlook will legally prevail .
That is , in these latter places , positive mention of free enterprise , capitalism , profits , etc. , will be severely punished by law .
Why libertarianism should be equated with the former views and not the latter is a mystery .
Surely , the libertarian philosophy would support the rights of both groups to act in such manners .
As for homosexuality , it is entirely possible that some areas of the country , parts of Gotham and San Francisco for example , will require this practice , and ban , entirely , heterosexuality .
If this is done through contract , private property rights , restrictive covenants , it will be entirely compatible with the libertarian legal code .
Prohibiting the advocacy of ideas that are harmful to society , moreover , comes under the heading of laws against incitement .
I fully agree with Hoppe that the views of democrats , communists , queer studies theorists , etc. , are very harmful for civilization .
They do indeed amount to incitement .
But here is what Rothbard said about the prohibition of incitement :
" Should it be illegal …. to u2018 incite to riot ’ ?
Suppose that Green exhorts a crowd : u2018 Go !
Burn ! Loot ! Kill !’ and the mob proceeds to do just that , with Green having nothing further to do with these criminal activities .
Since every man is free to adopt or not adopt any course of action he wishes , we cannot say that in some way Green determined the members of the mob to their criminal activities ; we cannot make him , because of his exhortation , at all responsible for their crimes .
u2018 Inciting to riot , ’ therefore , is a pure exercise of a man ’s right to speak without being thereby implicated in crime .
On the other hand , it is obvious that if Green happened to be involved in a plan or conspiracy with others to commit various crimes , and that then Green told them to proceed , he would then be just as implicated in the crimes as are the others — more so , if he were the mastermind who headed the criminal gang .
This is a seemingly subtle distinction which in practice is clearcut — there is a world of difference between the head of a criminal gang and a soap - box orator during a riot ; the former is not , properly to be charged simply with u2018incitement . ’ "
This is not to say that certain statements cannot be banned by contract , restrictive covenants , condominium agreements , etc. , in a private property regime .
But " physically remov( ing some people ) from society … if one is to maintain a libertarian order " sounds very far away from such a concept , and is therefore erroneous , at least in my view , from the perspective of correct libertarian theory .
B. Edward Feser
a . Homosexuality , other victimless crimes
In the view of Feser :
" Suppose for purposes of illustration … that the members of a local governmental body believe that fornication , pornography , homosexuality , etc. , are immoral , and that their promotion in public activities inevitably witnessed by the young will be as potentially corrupting to their moral character as would , say , a march by the KKK or Nazi party in a town where racial tensions are already high .
Then it would have grounds , given the self - ownership principle for banning any such public activity — which would include explicit u2018sex ed’ materials in the local schools , a u2018 pornography fair ’ at the local university , u2018 gay pride ’ parades down Main Street , lewd billboard advertisements and displays of pornographic materials on magazine racks , and so forth .
These all quite obviously contribute to an atmosphere tending to undermine a child ’s ability to develop character traits consistent with sexual virtue , given the extreme difficulty young people have in keeping sexual feelings under control — especially when constantly bombarded by messages insisting in effect that they not be kept under control .
Along the same lines , the local government could prohibit the adoption of children by persons whose choice of sexual u2018 lifestyle ’ it had reason to consider immoral , so as to prevent the moral corruption of those children .
It could also prevent the formation of institutions , such as u2018 same - sex marriage , ’ that it has reason to think would have a dramatic negative impact on the general public understanding of and commitment to basic moral norms , for such a result would profoundly , if indirectly , affect the ability of children to form a sound moral sensibility .
Private vices generally recognized to be vices , and kept private , cannot justifiably be outlawed , but the public legitimization of such vices can and must be . "
States Gordon :
" Feser still saw himself as a libertarian , but his libertarianism was , to say the least , idiosyncratic .
There might be a libertarian case , he claimed , for restricting homosexual conduct , drug use , and other activities at odds with conservative morality .
These vices , if allowed , might impede children ’s character development .
As Feser interpreted the self - ownership principle , children were entitled by it to a clean moral environment .
Hence morals legislation usually taken to be quintessentially anti-libertarian was in fact fully libertarian . "
I beg to differ from Gordon ’s assessment of Feser ’s libertarianism in this regard as " idiosyncratic . "
Unfortunately , it is not .
Rather , it is well within the framework of what I have been characterizing as conservative libertarianism .
Feser ’s views on homosexuality , for example , are certainly within striking distance of Hoppe ’s with which we have just dealt .
There are grave problems , at least for the libertarian , with Feser ’s call to drive underground what he is pleased to call " vices . "
First of all , the vices he chooses for illustrative purposes may all be characterized as " left wing " ones .
But what about right - wing ones ?
They , too , can lead the youth astray .
For example , bull fighting , boxing , football and cock fighting on the part of adults can instill cruelty in those too young not to be negatively impacted by them .
Guns , even used sensibly by adults , can harm children too young to be able to use them responsibly .
How about heterosexuality itself ?
Cannot the sight of a man and woman holding hands while walking down the street cause grave psychological harm to young homosexuals unsure of their sexual identity ?
Even adult heterosexuality is off - putting to children .
The Feser of the above quote would not allow two males to walk down the street holding hands ; why should this case be any different ?
Does it depend , solely , upon whose ox is being gored ?
Secondly , let us attempt a reductio ad absurdum .
There are more quasi- homosexual acts around than fit into Feser ’s philosophy .
I have in mind the habit of professional athletes to pat each other on the butt after accomplishing some task or other ; the practice of basketball players to jump up in the air and touch each other ’s stomachs with this same portion of their own anatomies ; the little dance that football players do in the end zone after scoring a touchdown ; football players grabbing each other in the huddle ; and do n’t get me started on the too close proximity , in football , considering which parts of the different players ’ anatomies come into contact with each other , when the center " hikes " the ball to the quarterback .
All disgusting , I say .
Lest the youth be corrupted , these perverse acts must all be driven underground , too .
Third , Feser is inconsistent .
He says this : " Any community , of whatever size , if free to impose any restrictions on its members that it likes , provided that all members of the community consent to the restrictions .
It is fully consistent with libertarianism that , for example , a group of Puritans decide together to settle a territory and institute a religious commonwealth , or that a group of communists set up a socialist republic .
What is ruled out is Puritans or communists imposing such a system on everyone else , on a community not all of whose members consent to it . "
This is eloquently compatible with plumb - line libertarianism .
Let everyone do " their thing " and all that .
But what happened to this laissez faire attitude when Feser was banning homosexuality , pornography , etc. , from society in order to protect children ?
The correct libertarian view on this is that each community should be able to bring up its children as it wishes
In the free society , left - wing condominium associations will be able to subject their youngsters to homosexuality , pornography , etc . but not football , boxing , etc. , and right - wing restrictive covenants not be prohibited by law from following the opposite practice .
In the truly libertarian society , no one will impose his will on others , using children as an excuse forsooth , as does Feser .
b. Private property rights
Feser , too , comes out against private property rights , superficially over the human person , but actually over much more .
This would qualify him as a left - wing libertarian , but for the fact that this particular stance is better characterized as " rightish . "
Why ?
Because he is using this stance as a means of forcing conservative morality on all of us , on mirable ductu , libertarian grounds .
According to Feser :
" … if I own myself , does n’t it follow that I can … do anything I want with myself , since it ’s my own property I ’m using — including engaging in certain sexual and other behaviors frowned upon by conservative moralists ?….
The answer … is a firm No . "
And why not , pray tell ?
Responds Feser :
" The deeper harmony of self - ownership and moral conservatism can only fully be seen … by attending to a distinction between what we might call formal vs. substantive self - ownership .
Suppose Bob is sitting on a park bench , peacefully watching squirrels scamper about , and Fred sneaks up behind him and strangles him to death .
Clearly , Fred has violated Bob ’s rights of self - ownership , invading as he has Bob ’s personal space without his consent and directly inflicting damage on his self - owned windpipe .
But suppose that Fred goes nowhere near Bob , and instead , from a block away , activates a device which sucks away all the air in Bob ’s vicinity , leaving Bob in a vacuum in which he passes out and quickly dies .
Has Fred violated Bob ’s rights of self - ownership in this case ?
" Fred might plead innocent on the ground that the never laid hands on Bob .
Further , he might insist quite sincerely that he had not particular desire to kill Bob , but wanted instead only to take all the air —
Bob ’s death was simply a … side effect .
And Fred might also claim that Bob ’s self - ownership rights have , in any case , not been violated : Fred has not deprived Bob of anything Bob owned by virtue of being a self - owner .
He never took , inflicted damage upon , or even so much as touched Bob ’s neck or windpipe , nor his lungs , arms , legs , or any other part of his body .
It just so happens that those things do n’t keep working when there ’s no air around , but that ’s not Fred ’s fault .
" Surely we can be forgiven for regarding Fred ’s defense as less than compelling , however casuistically ingenious .
It is true that he has not deprived Bob of any formal rights of self - ownership ; he ’s left Bob and his self - owned body parts , abilities , etc. , unmolested , for all the good this does poor Bob .
Clearly , thought , he ’s deprived Bob of any substantive rights of self - ownership .
He has put Bob in a situation that makes him utterly unable to exercise his self - owned powers , abilities and so forth , rendering them as useless as if Bob had not owned them at all . "
But this is not the end of the story .
Not only , for Feser , does this substantive rights doctrine cast doubt on formal self - ownership of the human body , it applies as well to all sorts of other things .
States Feser :
" Even non-invasive use of one ’s property and powers can violate another ’s self - ownership if it effectively nullifies or disables the other ’s ability to bring his self - owned powers to bear on the world , that is , if it renders another ’s ownership purely formal , not substantive .
Choking Bob invasively violates his self - ownership , but removing all the air from his vicinity also violates it , however non-invasively .
Cutting off your hand invasively violates your self - ownership , but your self - ownership is also violated , non-invasively , if instead … I activate a device that causes to disappear everything you ever try to reach for with your hand . "
From these considerations
Feser wants to derive the right , nay , the obligation , and on libertarian grounds , to prohibit by law prostitution , pornography , homosexuality , in that these latter acts deprive children of their substantive rights to grow up happily and healthily : " … respecting self - ownership requires taking a decidedly conservative position concerning … the rights of children . "
Gordon responds to Feser ’s sally : " Fred has killed Charles , in a perfectly straightforward sense .
It is true that he has not touched Charles , but why is this relevant ?
Libertarians maintain , like almost everyone else , that persons have a right not to be killed .
There is n’t a special libertarian view of what killing someone involves : if you kill someone , even without touching him or his property , you have violated his “ formal ” right to self - ownership .
In like fashion , suppose that Fred poisons some unowned water that he has good reason to believe Charles is about to drink .
Fred has , in an ordinary understanding of law , attempted to murder Charles .
Libertarians should not hold otherwise ; and there is no need to modify the self - ownership principle to take account of such cases . "
Gordon ’s is a good answer .
Here is another one : Ordinarily , when Charles is sitting quietly , breathing , we cannot say that he is homesteading the air , since this commodity is not a scarce item , and one can only homestead , or , indeed , own , scarce goods .
However , when Fred ’ s machine sucks away all the air from the proximity of Charles , oxygen all of a sudden becomes scarce for the latter , very scarce indeed .
But , Fred is thus guilty , under the libertarian legal code , of interfering with the peaceful homesteading by Charles of vital air , thus killing him .
This invasion , or oxygen theft , certainly rises to the level of murder .
Imagine were Fred to encounter Charles deep beneath the sea , where both were breathing air from their respective tanks .
Whereupon Fred seizes , e.g. , steals , Charles ’ air supply , leaving him to drown .
There would be no question but that this would be murder , nor , should there be any issue about such a verdict in the very clever parallel case posed by Feser .
It is the same thing as far as causing " to disappear everything you ever try to reach for with your hand " is concerned .
We have a word for this in the English language .
It is called " theft . "
Thus , there is no need to drive a wedge between so - called formal and substantive rights , whether to human persons or to their property , and to promote the latter at the expense of the former .
The two are in this case at least one and the same , if the relevant concepts are properly understood .
But , if so , then this distinction cannot be used , either , to drive a wedge between libertarian theory , which supports the rights of free individuals to engage in prostitution , pornography , homosexuality , etc. , and the presumed substantive rights of children to be free of possibly witnessing these acts .
Feser ’s mistake is to claim , in effect , that libertarian rights can conflict .
They cannot .
If there is a seeming conflict , one or the other ( or possibly both ) must be in error .
According to Rothbard : " The whole point of natural rights is that they are eternal and absolute , and the every man ’s rights are compossible with the rights of every other man .
In every situation of a seeming conflict of rights , the libertarian political philosopher must search to eliminate the supposed conflict , and to identify whose rights are to prevail , to find out who is the victim and who is the aggressor .
C. Ron Paul
According to libertarian congressman Ron Paul , the fact that immigration will lower wages constitutes a reason to oppose it .
He counters an open immigration policy on the ground that " … in many instances illegal immigrants simply increase the supply of labor in a community , which lowers wages . "
This may or may not be the case , but assume it is .
Still , it constitutes no legitimate libertarian reason for opposing open borders .
For , in this philosophy , one can only own one ’s person and property , one cannot own the value thereof .
Just because immigrants are stipulated to decrease wages does not mean that a rights violation occurred , and this would be the only legitimate reason for opposing their entrance into the country .
Vuk criticizes
Paul on similar grounds , stating : " Ron Paul is blatantly supporting about ( sic ) protectionism , the bane of a free economic society .
Plenty of Chinese are offering us lower prices which out compete domestic industry … "
Well , no one can be perfect .
Ron Paul ’s libertarian credentials are otherwise virtually exemplary .
Everyone is entitled to a small number of mistakes .

Conclusion
The view of Rockwell on conservatives is , I think , definitive :
" The problem with American conservatism is that it hates the left more than the state , loves the past more than liberty , feels a greater attachment to nationalism than to the idea of self - determination , believes brute force is the answer to all social problems , and thinks it is better to impose truth rather than risk losing one ’s soul to heresy .
It has never understood the idea of freedom as a self - ordering principle of society .
It has never seen the state as the enemy of what conservatives purport to favor .
It has always looked to presidential power as the saving grace of what is right and true about America .
" I ’m speaking now of the variety of conservatism created by William Buckley , not the Old Right of Albert Jay Nock , John T. Flynn , Garett Garrett , H.L. Mencken , and company , though these people would have all rejected the name conservative as ridiculous .
After Lincoln , Wilson , and FDR , what ’s to conserve of the government ?
The revolutionaries who tossed off a milder British rule would never have put up with it . "
" For my part , I ’m hoping that the whole conservative movement will go down in flames with the decline and fall of the Bush administration .
The red - state fascists have had their day and instead of liberty , they gave us the most raw and stupid form of imperial big government one can imagine .
They have given America a bad name around the world .
They have bamboozled millions .
They have looted and bankrupted the country . "
However , Rockwell is correctly an opponent not only of conservatives , but of liberals too :
" I do n’t mean to pick on the right exclusively .
The left often … believe that the government can’t but unleash
Hell when it is waging war and spending on military machinery .
But when it comes to domestic policy , they believe the same government can cure the sick , comfort the afflicted , teach the unlearned , and bring hope and happiness to all .
" Each side presumes that it potentially enjoys full control over the government it instructs to do this thing as versus that thing .
What happens in real life , of course , is that the public sector — always and everywhere seeking more power — responds to the demands of both by granting each party ’s positive agenda while eschewing its negative one .
Thus is the left given its welfare , and the right given its warfare , and we end up with a state that grows ever more vast and intrusive at home and abroad .
" What neither side understands is that the critique they offer of the programs they do not like applies also to the programs they do like .
The same state that robs you and me , ties business in knots , and wrecks the schools also does the same — and worse — to countries that the US government invades .
From the point of view of the taxed , the destination of the money does n’t matter ; it is all taken by coercion and all of it saps the productive capacity of society .
Similarly , the state that uses military power to impose its imperial will on foreign regimes — destroying property and lives , and making endless enemies — is the one the left proposes to put in charge of our economic lives . "
It is easy to see how libertarianism stems from conservative roots .
There are members of the Old Right mentioned by Rockwell such as Albert Jay Nock , John T. Flynn , Garet Garrett , H.L. Mencken .
There is also Ayn Rand .
But Gabriel Kolko , W.A. Williams , Ronald Radosh , on the left , too , have made major contributions to libertarianism .
I ca n’t read anyone out of the libertarian movement .
That has not been my purpose in this essay , nor is it within my power to do any such thing .
However , in my assessment , both right - wing and left - wing libertarianism are missing the essence of this philosophy .
I end with a plea to both my right - and left - wing libertarian colleagues :
In Oliver Cromwell ’s elegant words , “ I beseech you , in the bowels of Christ , think it possible you may be mistaken … . "
I do not mean mistaken in some jot or tittle of what I have criticized above .
As far as these things go , I am as likely to be mistaken about any of these specifics as are those I criticize .
What I am talking about is what I see as a burgeoning schism within the libertarian movement , between left and right - wing libertarians .
Each is moving toward the position , as I see it , of excluding the other , or removing themselves from the other .
That would be a tragic mistake .
Both are in error in this regard .

The Best of Walter E. Block
The mainstream media has joined the hunt , egged on by the Internet , which is bursting with questions about the baby ’s health , her provenance and even her existence .
“ The shroud of Suri has yet to be lifted , ” intoned The Associated Press .
“ Missing : baby girl of press - addicted parents , ” Newsweek said .
Image Us Weekly ran a story last week on Suri Cruise , with photos of her mother , Katie Holmes , but none of the baby herself .

While others fanned the flames , the approach at People has been minimalist , giving no hint that Mr. Cruise and Ms. Holmes are living at the white - hot center of a sensational tabloid mystery .
Larry Hackett , the managing editor of People , said that while People may be accused of going soft in hopes of getting the pictures , the magazine was the first , in mid-June , to flag that after 49 days , baby Suri had not materialized in public .
A chart showed that this was an unusual delay for a celebrity baby ; the pictures of the Pitt - Jolie baby , Shiloh , appeared seven days after her birth .
“ What gives ? ” People asked aloud of the delay .
It quoted Mr. Cruise as saying that all was well .
Beyond that , Mr. Hackett said , People may appear soft compared with other magazines because it does not present as fact anything that it cannot verify .
He said the magazine had no evidence of anything wrong with the baby or awry in the Cruise - Holmes relationship .
The two are not married , but reports over the weekend suggested that a wedding may be imminent and that the couple may show off the baby at their nuptials , making the pictures public to everyone at once .
Mr. Hackett said he would love to have the baby pictures and that the magazine ’s treatment of Mr. Cruise and Ms. Holmes and other celebrities “ should put us in good stead because we ’re fair and that ’s paid off for us in the past . ”
He said Team Cruise was fully aware that People wanted the pictures , but in terms of making a pitch , he declined to be specific .
“ Nothing any editor says to Tom Cruise and his camp is n’t anything they have n’t heard before , ” he said .
Mr. Dolce of Star said there were several negotiating tactics that magazines used behind the scenes to land a celebrity .
“ You could promise no negative stories on Tom and Katie for X number of months , though Tom and Katie would probably ask for a blackout more than anything else , ” he said .
“ Or you might swing a deal like OK ! had with Jessica Simpson — we ’ll pay you $ 5 million and that will cover the next four stories . ”
