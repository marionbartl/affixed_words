New nanotechnology paints for walls , ceilings , and surfaces could be used to kill hospital superbugs when fluorescent lights are switched on , said scientists today at the Society for General Microbiology 's Autumn meeting being held this week at Trinity College , Dublin .
The new paints contain tiny particles of titanium dioxide , which is the dazzling white compound often used as a brightener in commercial paints .
It will also be familiar to tennis fans as the powder used for the white lines to mark out the courts at Wimbledon .
Scientists have discovered that extremely small , nanoparticle - sized forms of titanium dioxide can kill bacteria and destroy dirt when they absorb ultraviolet light ( UV ) energy from the sun .
They produce active molecules which clean up the painted surfaces .
" It would be best if the titanium was antibacterial at wavelengths of light that you find indoors , such as fluorescent light , so that paints containing the nanoparticles could be used in hospitals and other places where a clean environment is important , " said Lucia Caballero from Manchester Metropolitan University , UK .
The researchers looked at the survival of the food poisoning bacterium Escherichia coli on different formulations of paints containing the titanium nanoparticles under different types and intensities of lights .
" We found that paints containing titanium dioxide are more successful at killing bacteria if the concentration of the nanoparticles is stronger than in normal paint .
Our best results showed that all the E. coli were killed under ordinary fluorescent lights , " said Lucia Caballero .
" However , other common additives in paints , such as calcium carbonate , silica or talc decreased the antibacterial efficiency of the paint .
If calcium carbonate was present the kill rate dropped by up to 80 % , " said Lucia Caballero .
" Our tests on a commercially available paint showed that the ability of the paint to inactivate bacteria was massively reduced compared with a paint formulation which did not contain such additives . "
With rising concern about the spread of hospital superbugs , healthcare trusts are increasingly looking to find better ways to maintain hygienic standards in hospitals .
The same concerns are driving developments in the food industry and in pharmaceutical companies .
These new nanoparticle paints could provide a simple and cost - effective solution .
" Facilities such as bathrooms and child care facilities , public conveniences and domestic bathrooms would all benefit from good hygiene control , " said Lucia Caballero .
" In all these places , surface hygiene could be improved by the action of fluorescent light on catalytic surfaces such as paints containing nanotitanium .
This would slow down contamination and save on the costs of cleaning maintenance . "
In a high profile campaign , West Virginia citizens have asked for a last minute ‘ stay of execution ’ against the imminent destruction of the site of a proposed wind farm on the state ’s Coal River Mountain .
Handing in a petition , signed by more than 8,000 residents , campaigners today called on State Governor Minchin to make good on his commitment to support the development of renewable energy in the state , and order a halt to the destruction of an area with enough wind power potential to supply 150,000 homes .
Richmond , Va. based coal company Massey Energy has announced plans to commence blasting at the site tomorrow ( 10th September ) , in an operation that will reduce the height of the mountain by 500 feet and free up ten square miles for coal mining activities .
Speaking today , Lorelei Scarbro , community organizer with local pressure group Coal River Mountain Watch said , “ Once the demolition begins , it will be very difficult to stop it , and once the mountain is removed , it wo n’t grow back .
The potential for wind energy and good jobs will be gone forever , along with our renewable water and forest resources . ”
The threat to the mountain , the last in the area to escape the legacy of decades of coal mining , has resulted in an extraordinary mobilization of community power in support of renewable energy proposals .
As well as the proposed wind farm , which residents say would provide 50 permanent jobs , there are plans for sustainable forestry and mountain - based tourism activities .
If the blasting gets the go ahead from the state capitol , it ’s likely to send out a negative message to potential investors in green energy in the state , in stark contrast to recent strong support for renewables in states such as Colorado , Pennsylvania and Florida .

Suppose you 're happily using JSNI to call bits of handwritten JavaScript from within your GWT module .
It works well , but JSNI only works at the level of individual methods .
Some integration scenarios require you to more deeply intertwine JavaScript and Java objects — DOM and JSON programming are two good examples — and so what we really want is a way to interact directly with JavaScript objects from our Java source code .
In other words , we want JavaScript objects that look like Java objects when we 're coding .
GWT 1.5 introduces JavaScript overlay types to make it easy to integrate entire families of JavaScript objects into your GWT project .
There are many benefits of this technique , including the ability to use your Java IDE 's code completion and refactoring capabilities even as you 're working with untyped JavaScript objects .
Example : Easy , efficient JSON
Overlay types are easiest to understand with examples .
Suppose we want to access an array of JSON objects representing a set of " customer " entities .
The JavaScript structure might look like this :
var jsonData = [ { " FirstName " : " Jimmy " , " LastName " : " Webber " } , { " FirstName " : " Alan " , " LastName " : " Dayal " } , { " FirstName " : " Keanu " , " LastName " : " Spoon " } , { " FirstName " : " Emily " , " LastName " : " Rudnick " } ] ;
To superimpose a Java type onto the above structure , you start by subclassing JavaScriptObject , a marker type that GWT uses to denote JavaScript objects .
Let 's go ahead and add some getters , too .
// An overlay type class Customer extends JavaScriptObject { //
Overlay types always have protected , zero- arg ctors protected Customer ( ) { } //
Typically , methods on overlay types are JSNI public final native String getFirstName ( ) /*-{ return this .
FirstName ; }-*/ ; public final native String getLastName ( ) /*-{ return this .
LastName ; }-*/; //
Note , though , that methods are n't required to be JSNI public final String getFullName ( ) { return getFirstName ( ) + " " + getLastName( ) ; } }
GWT will now understand that any instance of Customer is actually a true JavaScript object that comes from outside your GWT module .
This has useful implications .
For example , notice the this reference inside getFirstName ( ) and getLastName ( ) .
That this is truly the identity of the JavaScript object , so you interact with it exactly as it exists in JavaScript .
In this example , we can directly access the JSON fields we know exist , this .
FirstName and this .
LastName .
So , how do you actually get a JavaScript object on which to overlay a Java type ?
You ca n't construct it by writing new Customer ( ) because the whole point is to overlay a Java type onto an already existing JavaScript object .
Thus , we have to get such an object from the wild using JSNI :
class MyModuleEntryPoint implements EntryPoint { public void onModuleLoad ( ) { Customer c = getFirstCustomer ( ) ; // Yay !
Now I have a JS object that appears to be a Customer Window.alert ( " Hello , " + c.getFirstName ( ) ) ; } //
Use JSNI to grab the JSON object we care about //
The JSON object gets its Java type implicitly // based on the method 's return type private native Customer getFirstCustomer ( ) /*-{ //
Get a reference to the first customer in the JSON array from earlier return $ wnd.jsonData[ 0 ] ; }-*/; }
Let 's clarify what we 've done here .
We 've taken a plain - old - JSON - object ( POJSONO , anyone ? no ? ) and created a normal - looking Java type that can be used to interact with it within your GWT code .
You get code completion , refactoring , and compile - time checking as you would with any Java code .
Yet , you have the flexibility of interacting with arbitrary JavaScript objects , which makes things like accessing JSON services via RequestBuilder a breeze .
A quick digression for compiler geeks .
Another neat thing about overlay types is that you can augment the Java type without disturbing the underlying JavaScript object .
In the example above , notice that we added the getFullName ( ) method .
It 's purely Java code — it does n't exist on the underlying JavaScript object — and yet the method is written in terms of the underlying JavaScript object .
In other words , the Java view of the JavaScript object can be richer in functionality than the JavaScript view of the same object but without having to modify the underlying JS object , neither the instance nor its prototype .
( This is still part of the digression . )
This cool wackiness of adding new methods to overlay types is possible because the rules for overlay types by design disallow polymorphic calls ; all methods must be final and / or private .
Consequently , every method on an overlay type is statically resolvable by the compiler , so there is never a need for dynamic dispatch at runtime .
That 's why we do n't have to muck about with an object 's function pointers ; the compiler can generate a direct call to the method as if it were a global function , external to the object itself .
It 's easy to see that a direct function call is faster than an indirect one .
Better still , since calls to methods on overlay types can be statically resolved , they are all candidates for automatic inlining , which is a Very Good Thing when you 're fighting for performance in a scripting language .
Below we 'll revisit this to show you just how much this regimen pays off .
Example : Lightweight collections
We glossed over something in the example above .
The method getFirstCustomer ( ) is pretty unrealistic .
You 're certainly going to want to be able to access the entire array of customers .
Thus , we need an overlay type representing the JavaScript array itself .
Fortunately , that 's easy :
// w00t !
Generics work just fine with overlay types class JsArray < E extends JavaScriptObject > extends JavaScriptObject { protected JsArray ( ) { } public final native int length ( ) /*-{ return this .
length ; }-*/; public final native E get ( int i ) /*-{ return this [i ] ; }-*/; }
Now we can write more interesting code :
class MyModuleEntryPoint implements EntryPoint { public void onModuleLoad ( ) { JsArray < Customer > cs = getCustomers ( ) ; for ( int i = 0 , n = cs.length ( ) ; i < n ; ++i ) { Window.alert ( " Hello , " + cs.get(i).getFullName ( ) ) ; } } //
Return the whole JSON array , as is private final native JsArray < Customer > getCustomers ( )
/*-{ return $ wnd.jsonData ; }-*/; }
This is nice clean code , especially considering the flexibility of the plumbing it 's built upon .
As hinted at earlier , the compiler can do pretty fancy stuff to make this quite efficient .
Take a look at the unobfuscated compiled output for the onModuleLoad ( ) method :
function $ onModuleLoad ( ) { var cs , i , n ; cs = $ wnd.jsonData ; for ( i = 0 , n = cs.length ; i < n ; ++i ) { $ wnd.alert ( ' Hello , ' + ( cs[i ] .
FirstName + ' ' + cs[ i ]. LastName ) ) ; } }
This is pretty darn optimized .
Even the overhead of the getFullName ( ) method went away .
In fact , all of the Java method calls went away .
When we say that " GWT gives you affordable abstractions , " this is the kind of thing we 're talking about .
Not only does inlined code run significantly faster , we no longer had to include the function definitions themselves , thus shrinking the script a litte , too .
( To be fair , though , inlining can also easily increase script size , so we 're careful to strike a balance between size and speed . )
It 's pretty fun to look back at the original Java source above and try to reason about the sequence of optimizations the compiler had to perform to end up here .
Of course , we can't resist showing you the corresponding obfuscated code :
function B( ) {var a, b, c;a=$wnd.jsonData;for(b=0,c=a.length;b<c ;++b ) { $ wnd.alert(l + ( a [ b ] .
FirstName+m+a[ b ]. LastName ) )}}
Notice in this version that the only bits that are n't obfuscated are the identifiers that originated in JavaScript , such as FirstName , LastName , jsonData , etc .
That 's why , although GWT strives to make it easy to do lots of JavaScript interop , we try hard to persuade people to write as much of their code as possible as pure Java source instead of mixing with JavaScript .
Hopefully now when you hear us say that , you 'll understand that we are n't bashing JavaScript — it 's just that we can't optimize it as much , which makes us sad .
Putting it all together
Overlay types are a key new feature in GWT 1.5 .
At its simplest , the technique makes direct interop with JavaScript libraries much easier .
Hopefully after this post you could imagine how to almost directly port any JavaScript library into GWT as a set of Java types , thus allowing the use of a Java IDE for productive development and debugging without impacting size or speed due to any sort of GWT overhead .
At the same time , overlay types serve as a powerful abstraction tool for delivering more elegant low - level APIs such as the the new GWT DOM package .

When will geodjango be merged into trunk ?
Q : When dealing with points ( say , degrees ) from , do they need to be converted to be useful on the back - end data , assuming - that - data is in degrees ?
Is it enough to have the same datum and origin ?
( Reading the intro above is likely to answer the question . )
My ( JDunck ) reading indicates yes .
Given the same coordinate system ( i.e. datum , origin , and axes ) , degrees are useful without conversion .
When dealing with points ( say , degrees ) from , do they need to be converted to be useful on the back - end data , assuming - that - data is in degrees ?
Is it enough to have the same datum and origin ?
( Reading the intro above is likely to answer the question . )
Q : Can this implementation work with ​ MySQL spatial - extensions .
If not , it 's planned ?
No , unfortunately support is not planned .
Support for MySQL was added as of r6527 .
The changes required for the Oracle backend made it relatively easy to implement one for MySQL .
However , MySQL is limited to bounding - box queries only , and many advanced features ( e.g. , coordinate transformation , geometry_columns and spatial_ref_sys tables ) are missing because of MySQL 's implementation .
Furthermore , MySQL 's spatial indexes are limited to MyISAM tables , which are not transactional .
Can this implementation work with MySQL spatial - extensions .
If not , it 's planned ?
Q : Is this going to be a WMS Server / WMS Client / Both ?
OWSLib is just a WMS Client from what I have seen ( from ruckc ) WMS Server first , client capability a possibility in certain situations ( i.e. you want to cache data from another WMS server ) .
Yes , OWSLib is a client , but it contains code for validating the correct parameters to send to a WMS server , thus it can be adapted into a Django view that validates whether the proper WMS parameters were given .
Mapnik has an ogcserver module that can parse the correct parameters for WMS 1.1.1 and 1.3.0 , however since it is licensed under the LGPL it cannot be easily incorporated into this branch ( unlike OWSLib ) .
Is this going to be a WMS Server / WMS Client / Both ?
OWSLib is just a WMS Client from what I have seen ( from ruckc ) Q : Per ​ this discussion in django - developers , " I can do spatial queries if they are directly between two models with polygon fields but I can't seem to get at the spatial queries through foreign keys . "
Geographic queries require GeoManager , even if the model does not have a geographic field itself ( in the case of a foreign key to a geo - field ) .
The reply in the discussion gives detail into why .
Per this discussion in , " I can do spatial queries if they are directly between two models with polygon fields but I can't seem to get at the spatial queries through foreign keys . "
Q : Why are the OGRGeometry methods transform and transform_to separate ?
They are no longer separate , as transform now accepts CoordTransform and SpatialReference objects , as well as string WKT and integer SRID values ( transform checks the input type and dispatches to the correct routine ) .
The former reason for the separation was that each mapped to the separate OGR routines ​
OGR_G_Transform and ​ OGR_G_TransformTo .
For better performance use CoordTransform objects when you will be performing the same transformation repeatedly .
Why are the OGRGeometry methods and separate ?
Example
Geographic Models
Here is an example of how the model API currently works ( assume this example is in geoapp / models. py ) :
from django.contrib.gis.db import models class District ( models .
Model ) : name = models .
CharField ( max_length = 45 ) num = models .
IntegerField ( ) poly = models .
PolygonField ( ) objects = models .
GeoManager ( ) class School ( models .
Model ) : name = models .
CharField ( max_length = 55 ) point = models .
PointField ( ) objects = models .
GeoManager ()
Notes : The GeoMixin syntax is no longer needed as of r6467 .
By default , a GiST index will be created for the School PointField s fields .
This behavior can be turned off by using models .
PointField( spatial_index=False ) .
Using syncdb
Both manage .py commands sqlall and syncdb work on geographic models :
$ python manage .py sqlall geoapp
BEGIN ; CREATE TABLE " geoapp_school " ( " id " serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY , " name " varchar ( 35 ) NOT NULL ) ; CREATE TABLE " geoapp_district " ( " id " serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY , " name " varchar ( 35 ) NOT NULL , " num " integer NOT NULL ) ; SELECT AddGeometryColumn ( ' geoapp_school ' , ' point ' , 4326 , ' POINT ' , 2 ) ; ALTER TABLE " geoapp_school " ALTER " point " SET NOT NULL ; CREATE INDEX " geoapp_school_point_id " ON " geoapp_school " USING GIST ( " point " GIST_GEOMETRY_OPS ) ; SELECT AddGeometryColumn ( ' geoapp_district ' , ' poly ' , 4326 , ' POLYGON ' , 2 ) ; ALTER TABLE " geoapp_district " ALTER " poly " SET NOT NULL ; CREATE INDEX " geoapp_district_poly_id " ON " geoapp_district " USING GIST ( " poly " GIST_GEOMETRY_OPS ) ; COMMIT ;
$ python manage .py syncdb
Note :
The geometry columns are created outside of the CREATE TABLE statements by the AddGeometryColumn .
This is done according to the OpenGIS specfication .
See Open GIS Consortium , Inc. , ​ OpenGIS Simple Feature Specification For SQL , Document 99-049 ( May 5 , 1999 ) , at Ch. 2.3.8 ( Geometry Values and Spatial Reference Systems , pg. 39 ) .
Spatial Queries
After a geographic model has been created , the PostGIS additions to the API may be used .
Geographic queries are done normally by using filter ( ) and exclude ( ) on geometry - enabled models using geographic lookup types ( see the Database API for lookup types ) .
In the following example , the bbcontains lookup type is used which is the same as the PostGIS && operator .
It looks to see if the bounding box of the polygon contains the specific point .
The next example uses the PostGIS Contains ( ) function , which calls GEOS library to test if the polygon actually contains the specific point , not just the bounding box .
>>> from geoapp.models import District , School >>> qs1 = District .
objects .
filter ( poly__bbcontains = ' POINT ( -95.362293 29.756539 ) ' ) >>> qs2 = District .
objects .
filter ( poly__contains = ' POINT ( -95.362293 29.756539 ) ' )
Both spatial queries and normal queries using filter ( ) may be used in the same query .
For example , the following query set will only show school districts that have ' Houston ' in their name and contain the given point within their polygon boundary :
>>> qs = District .
objects . filter ( name__contains = ' Houston ' ) . filter ( poly__contains = ' POINT ( -95.362293 29.756539 ) ' )
In PostGIS versions 1.2.2 and above , Refractions introduced a feature called " inline index magic " that automatically combines the indexed bounding box queries with their more computationally expensive counterparts .
Prior to this revision the following filter could be used to get the same performance benefits :
>>> qs = District .
objects .
filter ( poly__bbcontains = ' POINT ( -95.362293 29.756539 ) ' ) . filter ( poly__contains = ' POINT ( -95.362293 29.756539 ) ' )
Lazy - Geometries
Geographic fields on models are proxies to GEOS Geometry objects , allowing for many interesting possibilities :
As international pricing for the iPhone has been trickling out , customers in some countries are particularly unhappy about their rate plans for the upcoming iPhone launch .
Sweden 's TeliaSonera rate plans , which started at 299 kr / month ( ~$ 50 ) for 100 MB of data and a 199 kr / month ( ~$ 34 ) unlimited data add - on , were met with numerous complaints from their customers .
In response , TeliaSonera is now offering the 199 kr / month ( $ 34 / month ) unlimited add - on plan to any of their existing voice plans .
Potential Canadian iPhone customers have been particularly displeased with Rogers ' iPhone rate plans announced 9 days ago .

The Firefox web browser has been ported to the Qt widget toolkit through a collaborative development effort by Nokia and Mozilla .
This port will facilitate much stronger visual integration between Firefox and KDE - based Linux environments and will also simplify the process of bringing Firefox to mobile platforms that support Qt .
When Mozilla was developing Firefox 3 , the browser 's underlying Gecko rendering engine adopted the Cairo drawing library across all platforms .
In order to port Firefox to Qt , the developers had to create a new QPainter backend for Cairo .
Mozilla 's Vladimir Vuki?evi ?
contributed to that effort and wrote about some of the first steps several months ago .
" I hope that in the future the Qt port will be a toplevel supported Gecko port , alongside gtk2 , Win32 , and OSX , but there 's still a bunch of work needed to make that happen , " he wrote .
The project has moved forward at a rapid pace and is now a lot more mature .
A binary build that is fully compatible with Qt 4.4 was made available at the Maemo web site last week .
The source code is available from a branch in Mozilla 's byzantine version control repository .
Mozilla is actively working to merge the branch back into the main code base , but says that it wo n't be displacing GTK + support — both toolkits will be supported going forward .
I tested the binary build in openSUSE 11 with KDE 4 .
I ran into some rendering bugs in the user interface , but did n't encounter any problems with HTML rendering .
It 's not ready for mainstream use yet , but it looks like it 's getting close .
Although the Qt toolkit already includes Apple 's powerful WebKit HTML rendering engine , Nokia still sees a lot of value in supporting Firefox .
During the recent Akademy conference , Nokia developer Oleg Romaxa told KDE's
Dot news site that Firefox offers a better browsing experience and that Nokia might have some competitive concerns about Apple 's control over WebKit .
" Nokia will use the best browser for the job , " he said .
" Currently , we cannot make a full - featured and integrated browser with WebKit in mobile .
But with Mozilla , we do not need to do anything , we can take existing models and API 's which are available .
Also , NPAPI support is already in the Gecko web rendering engine .
They are also concerned that WebKit is , to some extent , controlled by Apple , who are in competition to Nokia with their iPhone . "
Nokia recently acquired Trolltech , the software company behind the Qt toolkit .
The company plans to leverage the portability of Qt to provide third - party software developers with a way to create applications that can run on a broad spectrum of hardware devices , ranging from desktop computers to phones .
Porting Firefox to Qt will ensure that the open source web browser is available across the entire ecosystem of Qt - compatible mobile platforms .
Qt is already supported on several flavors of mobile Linux and gained support for Windows Mobile in its latest release .
Nokia is also bringing Qt to Maemo , its Linux - based software platform that 's used on Internet Tablet devices .
Mozilla aggressively reduced Firefox 's memory footprint during the Firefox 3 development cycle .
This improvement significantly reduced the browser 's bloat and made it viable in resource - constrained environments .
Mozilla has also launched the Fennec project , which is exploring user interface concepts for a mobile Firefox browser and is also undertaking some experimentation with cloud computing so that users can have a seamless Firefox experience across desktop and mobile devices .
Firefox is looking like a very strong contender in the mobile space , so it 's not surprising that Nokia wants to ensure that it is supported on its future mobile devices .
Better integration between KDE and Firefox is also a feature that Linux users have wanted for a long time , so it is a very welcome side effect of this project .
Some work still remains before Firefox is rock - solid on Qt , but the progress so far is impressive .

I WANT to share a recent experience at work that illustrates the way capitalism pushes workers into struggle , and how we can win if we stick together .
A lot of people on the left are frustrated with the relatively low level of working - class struggle that exists today , and many people I talk politics with think that " everyone is apathetic " or " nobody is doing anything . "
Socialist Worker is a great antidote to this , because you report on grassroots struggle that the mainstream media ignores .
In addition , there is always frustration and anger building beneath the surface , and so it can appear that nothing is happening until that last straw sparks a response from workers .
I work at an HIV clinic that serves a low - income community with very high rates of injection drug use .
We 're overworked and underpaid , the work can be very stressful and emotionally taxing , and because we have no union , we often get extra work piled on that is n't in our job descriptions .
Over the past year , we 've had to start paying for parking , our health care costs increased more than our raises , and we 've had to pick up more work to make up for staffing shortages .
So frustration has been building , but nothing has happened in terms of organized fightback .
Once per year , we have a one - day Friday staff retreat that is meant to help us reduce stress and come together with other HIV prevention and treatment staff to give each other support .
This year , the boss told us that if it rained ( it was in the forecast and the retreat is at a park under a tent ) , we 'd have to end the retreat and go back to work .
It was the last straw , and we reacted .
We got together on the spot and said that this was ridiculous -- with all we put up with , they should at least give us this day to relax .
One of my co-workers , who is not at all political , said that " they can't punish us all if none of us go back to work . "
We all agreed , and everyone together stood up for ourselves and told the bosses we did n't think it was fair to make us go back to work if it rained .
At the end of the day , one of the bosses told us they had " made a mistake " and that we could go home if it rained .
After work , I initiated a conversation about how , because we stuck together , we were able to get what we wanted , and there was enthusiastic agreement .
One of my co-workers started singing " Get up , stand up , stand up for your rights . "
It 's such an amazing feeling that I 'm getting tears in my eyes just thinking about it .
It may seem small , but this is the first time in the almost three years that I 've worked there that anything has gone our way .
And it 's significant that it took us all standing together in solidarity and making a demand .
We 're usually isolated and afraid to speak up because we need our jobs and we have no union to protect us .
In the future , if and when a union drive happens , we can point to this as an example of how , with solidarity , we can win .
I 'm sure stuff like this is happening all over the country , and will continue as the economic crisis worsens .
It 's up to socialists to help our coworkers draw lessons from things like this and help channel this frustration into a reinvigorated , fighting labor movement .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The federal government 's rescue of American International Group gave the insurance titan something even more important than access to $ 85 billion ... it gave AIG time .
Time is what the beleaguered insurer needs to unwind its sprawling operations - it has $ 1.1 trillion in assets and 74 million clients - in an orderly manner .
Had the company been forced into bankruptcy , it would have to unload its subsidiaries quickly and at a deep discount .
" It gives time for AIG to sell assets without having to put out the fire sale sign , " said Stewart Johnson , portfolio manager with Philo Smith & Co. a Stamford , Conn . - based investment bank specializing in insurance .
As in the case of any distressed company , sellers can't demand top dollar for their assets when they are in trouble .
Just look at Lehman Brothers , which declared bankruptcy on Monday after the federal government refused to bail it out .
The investment bank is now forced to sell its holdings at a deep discount .
It pawned its North American operations to Barclays Tuesday for a paltry $ 1.7 billion .
But in AIG 's case , the situation is even more serious .
The company is much larger and complex than Lehman Brothers and its assets hitting the market all at once would likely cause worldwide chaos and send values plummeting .
Experts question whether there are even enough qualified buyers out there to digest the company and its subsidiaries .
Attack began last week
AIG came under attack last week as investors grew increasingly concerned about the company 's capital levels .
Over the weekend , it turned to the Federal Reserve for a loan , but officials had their hands full with Lehman Brothers ' unraveling .
Reluctant to help AIG , officials pushed investment banks to provide the funding , even as AIG 's stock price fell 69 % in two days .
After it became clear that the private sector would not come to AIG's aid , the Federal Reserve Tuesday night stepped in and gave the insurer access to as much as $ 85 billion .
The offer is good for two years , but comes at a steep interest rate of nearly 11.4 % .
In return , the government took a 79.9 % stake in the insurer and expects AIG to sell off assets to repay the loan .
" [ A ] disorderly failure of AIG could add to already significant levels of financial market fragility and lead to substantially higher borrowing costs , reduced household wealth and materially weaker economic performance , " the Fed said in a statement .
" This loan will facilitate a process under which AIG will sell certain of its businesses in an orderly manner , with the least possible disruption to the overall economy . "
AIG 's troubles lie in its exposure to complex credit - default swaps - an insurance - like product that protects buyers from bond defaults .
But while the parent company is suffering , many of its subsidiaries are not only profitable , they are desirable , experts said .
The company has more than enough collateral to back the loan , senior Fed staffers said Tuesday night .
Experts interviewed agree that AIG 's units are worth more than $ 85 billion .
The first businesses the company is likely to unload are its financial services unit , said Donald Light , senior analyst at Celent , a Boston - based financial research and consulting firm .
However , since it is at the root of AIG 's problems and lost $ 14.8 billion in the first half of 2008 , AIG might not get much for it .
Its non-insurance subsidiaries , such as its aircraft leasing business that reported income of $ 555 million for the first six months of the year , will likely fetch more .
Already , the unit 's chief is looking to buy the company from AIG , the Wall Street Journal reported .
Its fleet of 1,000 - plus aircraft alone is valued at $ 55 billion .
Core insurance products might be kept
What happens to the company 's core insurance and retirement services subsidiaries is the big question .
They are undoubtedly among AIG 's most attractive units , but they are also the heart of the business .
Its general insurance business - which includes property and casualty - brought in $ 2.2 billion in profits this year .
Its life insurance unit is likely the last thing the company wants to sell since it is the bedrock of AIG 's business , experts said .
Though the subsidiary has been hit this year by fallout from the credit crisis , forcing it to take a $ 9.6 billion charge in the first six months of the year , it is generally stable .
" They will try to keep all or nearly all of the insurance business in place , " Light said .
The Fed likely took an equity stake in the company , rather than just giving AIG a loan , because it felt the company has a lot of value and might make money for taxpayers , said Anthony Sanders , professor of financial institutions at New York University .
The government made a similar investment in Continental Illinois bank , which failed in 1984 , and turned it around at a profit .
" The payoff on equity is unlimited on the upside , " Sanders said .
" With debt , you just get interest . "
DENVER  Former president Jimmy Carter called Republican presidential candidate John McCain a " distinguished naval officer , " but he said the Arizona senator has been " milking every possible drop of advantage " from his time served as a prisoner of war in Vietnam .
Carter spoke Thursday with USA TODAY and Gannett News Service reporters before Barack Obama 's acceptance speech to cap off the Democratic National Convention .
Carter spoke of Obama 's challenges facing the lingering effects of racism in the United States and the ability of the Clintons to bring their supporters over to Obama .
He decried Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman 's decision to " abandon " the Democrats by speaking at the Republican convention next week .
CARTER INTERVIEW : Watch full archived video
Carter , however , focused heavily on McCain .
He said he was bewildered by McCain 's performance at the Saddleback Presidential Forum hosted by pastor and author Rick Warren in Lake Forest , Calif. , earlier this month .
Carter said that whether he was asked about religion , domestic or foreign affairs , every answer came back to McCain 's 5 ½ years as a POW .
" John McCain was able to weave in his experience in a Vietnam prison camp , no matter what the question was , " Carter said .
" It 's much better than talking about how he 's changed his total character between being a senator , a kind of a maverick … and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right - wing Republicans have presented . "
Carter said Lieberman , Al Gore 's running mate in 2000 and now an independent , had cast his lot with the GOP by deciding to speak at the party 's convention .
Lieberman switched his party registration after losing the 2006 Democratic senatorial primary to Ned Lamont , who made opposition to the Iraq war central to his campaign .
Lieberman kept his seat and has helped Democrats maintain a 51 - 49 voting edge .
" I would hope that the Democrats could have enough senators elected in November so that we would not any longer need to include Joe Lieberman among the senators , " Carter said .
Carter called Hillary Rodham Clinton 's speech at the convention Tuesday " superb " but questioned her for pointing out her accomplishments in some areas and merely saying that Obama shared those concerns .
Carter said former president Bill Clinton 's speech Wednesday was " perfect . "
Carter said the two speeches took pressure off Obama by uniting the party and ensuring that Clinton supporters would support Obama .
Carter cited a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll last week that found 47 % of Clinton supporters said they were solidly behind Obama and 30 % said they would vote for McCain , someone else or no one at all .
" I think that this week has eliminated that disparity , " he said .
Carter also spoke of the segregation he saw growing up and said racism is " always a subtle factor " in American politics .
He called this November 's election possibly the most " momentous , important " U.S. election in the past 100 years , and he was confident that Obama could overcome the racial divide .
But he said race could ultimately be the deciding factor .
When flying back from Ethiopia last Friday , we crossed paths with two airplanes , in a span of a minute .
I have never seen planes cross that close .
We must have flown over the other planes by just a few hundred meters .
One was that close , I could almost see the pilots in the cockpit of the other plane .
It made me think about the amount of planes in the air at any given minute .
Well , I looked it up :
As I am writing this ( Sunday afternoon in EU , morning in the US ) , Flightaware was tracking 3,146 airborne aircraft , and registered 34,130 arrivals in the last 24 hours .
And that is in the US only .
How would that look like on worldmap ?
Well , Christo's

Baboucarr Njie was preparing for his prayer session Friday night , Sept. 26 , when he heard children in the Islamic Society of Greater Dayton coughing .
Soon , Njie himself was overcome with fits of coughing and , like the rest of those in the building , headed for the doors .
" I would stay outside for a minute , then go back in , there were a lot of kids , " Njie said .
" My throat is still itchy , I need to get some milk . "
Njie was one of several affected when a suspected chemical irritant was sprayed into the mosque at 26 Josie St. , bringing Dayton police , fire and hazardous material personnel to the building at 9:48 p.m .

Right - wingers more startled by sudden noises and spiders than liberals , study finds
If you want to know where someone stands politically , forget asking them their views on Thatcherism or the European Union .
Just burst a balloon behind their back .
It may sound bizarre , but researchers claim that conservatives are more startled by sudden noises than liberals .
The American team 's findings - published in the respected journal Science - suggest that our political views are closely linked to our biology .
Anyone whose brain is hard - wired to be anxious about ' external threats ' , such as loud noises or unpleasant images , is more likely to support hawkish policies such as high military spending and the Iraq War , they said .
A bit jumpy ?
Scientists reckon they know exactly how Conservative leader David Cameron would react to seeing a spider on someone 's face
In contrast , those who are less jumpy will tend to support more liberal immigration laws , pacifism and gun control .
To test their theory , the researchers recruited 46 adults with strong political beliefs .
Each was shown three threatening images - a large spider on the face of a frightened person , a dazed individual with a bloody face and an open wound with maggots on it - interspersed with 33 less disturbing pictures .
Sensors measured how much the volunteers sweated .
It was discovered that those with conservative views reacted more strongly to the disturbing pictures than those with liberal opinions .
The researchers also measured how hard participants blinked when suddenly played a loud noise .
Again , conservatives tended to be more easily startled .
The University of Nebraska - Lincoln team were unsure whether people who are naturally more sensitive to threats are drawn to Right - wing politics , or whether conservatives become more jumpy .
Social scientists previously thought that political tendencies were shaped by experience , with most people getting more Right - wing with age .
But a growing body of research apparently shows that our views are inherited .

As a naturally rebellious spirit , Independence Day has a special place in my heart .
In elementary school , I was the kid in the back of the classroom who would always get into arguments with the teacher .
They all said that I should be a lawyer when I grow up , presuming I could muster the patience required for law school .
In middle school , I went punk , always had a crazy haircut , and wore a lot of shirts with skulls and other dark themes .
One of them had a skeleton with a k - bar and a Marine Corps 8 - point cover on his grape .
It read : U.S.M.C. – UNCLE SAM’S MISGUIDED CHILDREN .
When I joined the Marines and started learning about our history , ( they taught us about Smedley Butler , but not that he wrote a book called War Is A Racket ) the one quote that stuck with me was from the legendary Marine , Chesty Puller .
In boot camp , some platoons get to say , “ Goodnight Chesty , wherever you are ! ”  every night in unison while laying in the position of attention in their racks .
The quote is , “ You ’re not a real Marine until you get busted down once or twice . ” 
I did n’t think I would be able to live up to that standard , but fortunately , I was wrong .
Senior Marines would regale me with tales of their craziness , and brag about doing things like driving drunk , getting pulled over , and having the cop let them get away with it .
Then explain it like this , “ But America needs crazy mother - f ’ers like us around .
That ’s what it takes .
Americans sleep soundly at night because they know guys like us can be on any beach in less than 24 hours . ” 
Taking a more strategic look at the Corps ’s strategic value and chances of survival , former Marine Corps Commandant Lieutenant General Krulak noted , “ The United States does not need a Marine Corps , the United States wants a Marine Corps . ” 
It should come as no surprise , that Marines are over - represented in the ranks of Iraq Veterans Against the War .
When I joined the Marines , or rather the Delayed Entry Program ( DEP ) and took my oath of enlistment , I took it very seriously .
“ Support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic . ” 
I stopped to think about why the document was more important than the institution , and it naturally made sense to me .
These are the rules by which we are able to ensure the rights of the people , this is what I want to have my life on the line for .
Of course , the Constitution is simply our best attempt ( and I would argue among the best , if not the best created by any society in human history ) to enshrine a set of greater values in a practical form of governance .
“ We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . ” 
This philosophy and these ideals were not anything particularly revolutionary in and of themselves , but when faced with the rejection of these ideals in the tyranny of King George III , the founding fathers were in a unique position to take a stand for those ideals .
It required a certain courage of them , but they sure as hell delivered !
“ And for the support of this Declaration , with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence , we mutually pledge to each other our Lives , our Fortunes and our sacred Honor . ” 
The utopian ideal that comes from those principles is one that is void of the violation of those rights by any human against any other , or what some would call a state of anarchy .
But out of the realities of the circumstance and the culture at the time , a practical form of governance was necessary , and naturally came the Constitution .
Although beautiful and powerful , this document that created and defined what Benjamin Franklin referred to as , “ A republic , if you can keep it , ”  was far from perfect .
Not only did our founders intend for us to keep it , but strive continuously to improve it , and it prescribed the exact means of amendment .
Along with the cultural evolution that makes change possible , we have been making great progress with our Constitutional Republic .
We have seen the abolition of slavery , a civil rights movement , and a women ’s movement , among many other great strides .
As a species , we have gone from the law of the jungle , to feudalism , to kingdoms , to empire , to capitalism with slavery , to capitalism with corporatism , but all in all , things are getting better .
Humanity marches on .
You can fight it , or fight for it .
It was n’t too long ago that the best we could expect out of life was fondly referred to as , “ solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and short . ” 
My oh my , how we have progressed as a species since then .
But even in America , it has been a process of two steps forward , one step back .
And as a nation , we are progressing down many paths simultaneously .
The founding of the federal reserve as not only unconstitutional , but creating unnatural , immoral concentrations of wealth , could be seen as a step backward begun in 1913 that is still with us today .
Within that time frame , there have been many steps forward , and many smaller steps backward .
Clearly , in this framework , the Bush Administration has had more than it ’s fair share of steps backwards .
That is why this Independence Day is so desperately needed right now .
We have forgotten the ideals put forth in Declaration .
As the founders knew , a servile , unquestioning , obedient people , will always produce tyrants .
The mortal flaw of tyranny is that it is dependent upon the obedience of its subjects .
On this Independence Day we must renew our commitment to the ideals of the Declaration .
It should be very clear to all patriotic Americans , that when in the course of human events , an oppression so revolts those subject to it , it becomes necessary to dissolve the political bands that are the means of that tyranny .
We must , as a nation , once again , embrace defiance , rebellion , and resistance !
Happy Independence Day . . . if you can live up to it .
More than 500,000 official " spying " requests for private communications data such as telephone records were made last year , a report says .
Police , security services and other public bodies made requests for billing details and other information .
Interception of Communications Commissioner Sir Paul Kennedy said 1,707 of these had been from councils .
A separate report criticises local authorities for using powers to target minor offences such as fly - tipping .
Itemised bills
Figures show public bodies made 519,260 requests to " communications providers " such as phone and internet firms for information in 2007 .
Under available powers , they can see details such as itemised phone bills and website records .
But they are not allowed to monitor conversations .
The total number of requests for last year - amounting to more than 1,400 a day - compared with an average of fewer than 350,000 a year in the previous two years .
In his report , Sir Paul said he believed " local authorities could make much more use of communications data as a powerful tool to investigate crime " .
' Proportionality '
But a separate report , by Chief Surveillance Commissioner Sir Christopher Rose , criticises the techniques employed by local authorities to deal with minor offences such as fly - tipping or avoiding council tax .
He said some councils had a " tendency to expose lack of understanding of the legislation " and displayed a " serious misunderstanding of the concept of proportionality " .
Some authorising officers were inexperienced and suffered " poor oversight " , he added .
He called on town halls to invest in properly trained intelligence officers who could operate covertly .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said : " The commissioners ' reports offer valuable oversight and provide reassurance that these powers are being used appropriately .
" These powers can make a real difference in delivering safer communities and protecting the public - whether enabling us to gain that vital intelligence that will prevent a terrorist attack , working to tackle antisocial behaviour or ensuring that rogue traders do not defraud the public . "
Robot designers are currently duking it out for the British army in hopes of nabbing the hearts ( and pocketbooks ) of the UK 's fighting force .
In a makeshift " wartime European village , " scientists and researchers are putting their helper - droids to the test as Army officials look on and investigate how the automatons might serve alongside troops .
Some of the robots being looked at include a " Moon buggy " which remotely patrols for enemies via thermal imaging and then sends the data back to a command center , a helicopter that can be maneuvered in tight urban spaces , and a RC car with what appears to be a pile of digicams mounted on top of it .
The winners of the competition will be announced Monday , but you can hit the read link and see a video -- replete with annoying British television presenter -- of some contestants .

As the Rogers / Fido iPhone debacle continues there ’s some new bad news for mobile users in this country : Bell Canada and Telus Mobility have both announced their intention to charge customers for incoming text messages as of next month .
For anyone not schooled in the etiquette of mobile carriers , this is how it has worked in the rest of the world for the last , oh , decade or so : Subscribers pay for outgoing calls and texts only ; to be asked to pay for the receipt of such things would be tantamount to a slap in the face .
And who is the only politician in this country with the power to stop this ?
God help us all , it ’s none other than Hollywood shill Jim Prentice , our Honourable Minister of Doing It Wrong …
Now to be fair Prentice has called upon representatives from both companies to meet with him about this issue , but presumably it ’s to find out whether they want him to swallow or not .
NDP leader Jack Layton is taking up the cause with an online petition , but it seems to me that if you sit across the floor from the guy in The House of Commons you should maybe be able to to better than that .
Still , it ’s better than nothing .
I really hope Ottawa can get with the program on this stuff , if not for Canadians then at least for the international visitors who will hopefully still be visiting for The Winter Olympics in 2010 …
Dear Giles ,
Sub-editing is a noble profession .
It is also a thankless one - particularly when your writers call you a " useless cunt " .
There was a sharp intake of breath when your e-mail hit the inbox of subs throughout the industry this week - that was after we 'd stopped laughing .
Not that we did n't think you had a point .
Yes , tinkering with copy just for the sake of it and without consultation is wrong .
It is disrespectful and arrogant .
And we can see why you'd be furious at the loss even of an indefinite article .
There is nothing more irritating than a sub-editor who thinks they know better than a writer , particularly one who cares deeply about his work .
But did you really have to be so rude ?
Laura Barton stated in Friday 's Guardian that there 's " something of a long - standing tension between writers and sub-editors " .
Do you wonder why ?
Contrary to your belief , we do n't " believe we know best when we know fuck all " .
If you could only see the state of some of the raw copy we have to knock into shape .
It 's badly structured , poorly spelt , appallingly punctuated , lazily researched .
We 're not saying your writing falls into that category - on the contrary , your journalism is highly accomplished .
Never having worked on your copy , we can only take your word for it that it is beyond improvement in its pre-published state .
Strange as it may seem , many writers do not possess your grasp of language ; indeed it is sometimes difficult to believe that English is their mother tongue , and they do n't give a damn about what they produce because they know that a good , often highly educated sub - editor will correct it , check it and turn it into readable prose .
None of this , however , can excuse your nasty , bullying , " know your place , you insignificant little fuckwit " e-mail .
Yes , it 's funny , in a way that pieces that use " fuck " , " shit " and " cunt " so liberally often can be , but , please - someone made a mistake .
They surely had no intention of sabotaging your deathless prose .
So you do n't like what happened to your piece - have a word with your editor .
The hapless sub will no doubt already have been soundly thrashed and had their dictionary privileges removed .
Some years ago , a colleague of ours had a T - shirt printed up with the legend " xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx is a cunt " on the front , which he wore every week when having to deal with the writer to whom it referred , because he , like you , became so disproportionately abusive when his use of language was questioned .
We'd hate that to happen to you , because you can actually write , and having " Giles Coren is a sanctimonious little twat who needs to get over himself " could be quite costly in T - shirt lettering .
Subs are no more infallible than writers .
So , let 's all try a little mutual respect , shall we ?
All the best ,

WASHINGTON —
It took seven years , but Charles Ulrich did something many people dream about , but few succeed at :
He beat the IRS in a tax dispute .
Not only that , but tax experts say potentially millions of other taxpayers could benefit from his victory .
The accountant from Baxter , Minn. , challenged the method the IRS has used for more than 20 years to tax shares and cash distributed by mutual life insurance firms to their policyholders when they reorganize as public companies .
A federal court recently agreed with his interpretation .
“ There ’s a tremendous amount of money at stake , ” said Robert Willens , a New York City - based tax analyst at Robert Willens LLC .
“ Tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund . ”
Don Alexander , an IRS commissioner in the 1970s and now a tax attorney in Washington , said while it ’s not unusual for individuals to take on the agency , “ most of them lose . ”
Alexander called it “ quite a significant case . ”
The dispute arose when more than 30 mutual life insurance companies became publicly traded corporations in the late 1990s and earlier this decade , in a process known as “ demutualization . ”
Mutual companies are owned by their policyholders , so the companies provided stock and cash to compensate them for the loss of their ownership interests when they went public .
All told , roughly 30 million policyholders received distributions , Ulrich estimates .
MetLife Inc. provided over $ 7 billion of stock to about 11 million policyholders when it went public in 2000 , while Prudential distributed $ 12.5 billion in stock to another 11 million .
The IRS held that the recipients had n’t paid anything for the shares and owed taxes on the full amount when the shares were sold .
Cash distributions also were fully taxable , the IRS said .
That did n’t sound right to Ulrich , 72 , an accountant for 49 years .
He began researching the issue in 2001 , when he received shares from two companies , Prudential and Indianapolis Life .
Ulrich concluded that policyholders had paid for their ownership rights through their premiums so the distributions should have been tax - free .
That could make a significant difference in what a taxpayer owes .
If a company distributed shares worth $ 30 and a recipient subsequently sold them at $ 32 , under the IRS ’ view they would pay taxes on all $ 32 .
Under Ulrich ’s interpretation , they would owe taxes only on the $ 2 per share gain .
In 2003 , Ulrich publicized his views by contacting tax and insurance experts and setting up a Web site .
“ Largely I was regarded as a lunatic , ” he said , who “ would never prevail against the IRS . ”
Still , some people who ’d paid taxes contacted Ulrich and asked him to file refund requests , which he did , for a fee .
Some of those refunds were granted , he said .
Tax experts say the IRS does n’t always closely scrutinize small refunds .
One of his clients , Jean Prevost and her husband , Jim , who live near Minneapolis , received a refund of almost $ 1,500 in federal and state taxes in 2003 .
“ It was n’t a huge amount of money , but it was ours , ” she said .
But the IRS was n’t pleased with Ulrich , accusing him of promoting abusive tax shelters and demanding the names of his clients , which he said he refused to provide .
The agency backed off in 2004 with help from the IRS ’s Taxpayer Advocate office , Ulrich said .
IRS spokesman Bruce Friedland said the agency is prohibited from commenting on its interactions with taxpayers .
One of Ulrich ’s clients , Eugene Fisher , a trustee for a Baltimore , Md. - based trust , sued the IRS in February 2004 after being denied a refund .
Judge Francis Allegra of the Court of Federal Claims in Washington sided with Fisher and called the IRS ’ view “ illogical ” in an Aug. 6 decision .
He ordered the agency to refund $ 5,725 in taxes plus interest to the trust overseen by Fisher .
It ’s not clear how many people could benefit from the ruling .
Many of the 30 million policyholders are probably too late to seek refunds , since claims must be filed within three years of the April 15 tax deadline .
That means the statute of limitations for taxes paid for 2004 ran out April 15 , 2008 .
Many individual taxpayers may not have enough at stake to go to the trouble , said Burgess Raby , a Tempe , Ariz . - based attorney who represented Fisher .
Still , millions of policyholders could benefit from the court ’s ruling , he said .
Raby credits Ulrich with being the driving force behind the issue .
“ The genesis for this was Chuck ’s real feeling that this was an unfair position ” by the IRS , Raby said .
The government could appeal the ruling and likely will fight future refund claims , perhaps hoping for a different outcome in a separate court , tax experts said .
Charles Miller , a spokesman for the Justice Department , said the government has n’t yet decided whether to appeal .
Still , taxpayers should request refunds if they ’re eligible , the tax experts said , because even if the IRS rejects the claim , doing so extends the deadline for a potential refund for two more years .
Ulrich will prepare refund requests for interested taxpayers , for a fee , and has posted additional information at his Web site , www.demutualization.org.
But he said the principle is more important to him .
“ I think it ’s important that taxpayers ’ rights be protected , ” he said .
“ We should have had a Boston Tea Party over this . ”
Half of the children polled said they were not allowed to climb trees
Children are being denied adventurous play because their parents are nervous about exposing them to risk , a new survey suggests .
The UK - wide poll , commissioned by Play England , found half of 7 - 12 year olds have been stopped from climbing trees .
It also showed 21 % of those surveyed had been banned from playing conkers , and 17 % were not allowed to play chase .
The ICM poll interviewed 1,030 children and young people aged 7 - 16 , and 1,031 adults during July 2007 .
Play England , which says it promotes free play opportunities , insists that parents " constantly wrapping children in cotton wool " can harm the children 's development .
The poll found showed 51 % of children aged 7 - 12 were not allowed to climb a tree without adult supervision , with 49 % stopped from climbing trees altogether because it was considered too dangerous .
' Life skills '
According to the research , 70 % of adults had their biggest childhood adventures outdoors among trees , rivers and woods , compared with only 29 % of children today .
It found children 's experiences of adventure are confined to designated areas such as playgrounds ( 56 % ) , their homes ( 48 % ) or theme parks ( 44 % ) .
Adrian Voce , director of Play England , which is part of the charity National Children 's Bureau , said playing was " an essential part of growing up " .
" Adventurous play both challenges and excites children and helps instil critical life skills , " he said .
" Constantly wrapping children in cotton wool can leave them ill equipped to deal with stressful or challenging situations they might encounter later in life .
" Children both need and want to push their boundaries in order to explore their limits and develop their abilities . "
The survey was carried out to mark Playday , the annual celebration of children 's right to play , which is co-ordinated by Play England .
Hundreds of events will be taking place across the UK on Wednesday 6 August to celebrate Playday .
Join us for a facilitated workshop as we explore writing as a powerful tool for healing .

All you have to do is convince the creator of this suit sell it to you .
That ’s no easy feat though since he ’s a die - hard fan of Marvel ‘s character and he only created it as a tribute to the comic hero .
This is definitely the best looking home - made superhero suit I ’ve ever seen , it ’s made out of fiberglass and flexible plastic .
The suit gloves are made out of rubber foam .
The Ironman mask comes with see - through lenses that allow the wearer to see clearly but do n’t reveal his eyes .
The costume is also hand - painted in the classic colors .
The Ironman armor would be perfect for a person 6.2 feet tall , 220 lbs. in weight and with a 35 inch waistline .
I have to hand it to the creator of the suit , even Ironman himself would be impressed .

Author 's Notes :
Alright , I obviously do n't own any of these people … nor mean them any disrespect … just for fun .
I do n't ACTUALLY think Alton Brown and Rachael Ray are having an affair … that would be weird .
But yes , I originally had this up on … as I felt it was rather fan fiction - y … but I guess not .
You know … considering I was a FAN writing FICTION about people .
They deleted it .
SO , I figured I might as well try it out on here .
Even though they 're not original characters … where else am I supposed to put this if wo n't accept it .
I plan on writing more of these , out of my boredom .
Unless a lot of people end up hating it .
Then oh well .
Food Network Fan-Fiction : Installment # 1 --- Good Meals
By Casey …
Please do n't sue me , Food Network
Rachael Ray had been slaving all day in her kitchen !
Actually it was in under 30 minutes .
Some say she has super powers .
I just say she hauls ass .
We all KNOW it would take the normal person at least 45 minutes to finish those things …
" I do NOT have a fat ass ! "
Rachael screamed , throwing a non -stick skillet across the room .
" Damn that Giada from Everyday Italian !
We all know that bitch is a robot !
And her food is plastic that melts easily in the microwave !
Gah ! "
She sank to her knees and sobbed robustly .
Rachael and Giada had been sworn enemies for years .
But lately the skinny , far - too - charismatic - to - be - human evil - doer had teamed up with Michael Chiarello to thwart Rachael and her many television shows .
Many had suspected that Bobby Flay and Tyler Florence were next , but no .
We all know how cruel women and … men ? are .
Especially the hungry ones ( Giada ) , and those so desperate to come out of the food pantry to the entirety of Food Network - land like Michael .
Previously that day , while passing one another at the studio , Giada had made several , hurtful comments to Rachael , saying that her ass was like a sack of wet laundry and that she caught her chugging extra virgin olive oil spiked with vodka in the ladies restroom .
Rachael continued sobbing , meanwhile eating sticks of butter for comfort .
She had no friends in Food Network - land .
Everyone always pried at her as to why SHE did n't have dinner guests on the show , while everyone else did .
" Michael Chiarello !
I 'll kick that flamer 's ass , WHICH MINE IS NOT FAT !!
No one can make a party that good , that fast !
No one can beat me !
I make 30 - Minute Meals , dammit ! "
She said these hurtful things because it had been he who had made fun of her loneliness , noting that he ALWAYS had dinner guests ( and so did Giada ) .
She crawled over , grabbed the same skillet , and threw it in the opposite direction she had earlier , meanwhile cramming another stick of butter into her mouth .
" I would n't even mind if someone used me … just for my delicious , low - carb recipes ! "
She choked out the words , gasping for air .
Just then , the light came on in her studio and she hurriedly wiped away the excess of butter forming around her lips .
" No !
I 'd never do a thing like that !
I came here to announce my love for you , Rachael ! " shouted the man who had suddenly burst onto the area where 30 - Minutes Meals was shot .
" Alton Brown ? ! "
" Yes !
It is I , Alton Brown !!
I was at the Laundromat !
While watching a woman walk away with a rather large sack of wet laundry , when I suddenly realized that I , Alton Brown (! ) , was madly in love with you ! "
" Oh , Alton !
I thought you 'd never tell me such things !
I watch your show everyday !
I even have it set to record !
Even though half the time I set it wrong and end up recording Seinfeld … but that does n't matter !
Because I st-- I mean … because I love you !
And do n't stalk you !
Now Giada …
I heard she 's a stalker … her nickname 's Celery for God 's sake ! "
She stopped .
" Alton … I have a question to ask you … "
They drew closer .
" Yes , my darling ? "
" Do you … "
She stumbled .
" Do you think … that I have a fat ass ? "
" No , no , no !
You 're gorgeous !
Unlike that Everyday Italian bitch … ugh … "
They drew CLOSER !
( Ah! Tension ! Run ! )
" I love you , Rachael !
But not as much as Miss Piggy !
She 's my hero you know … no one could ever replace her …
But you come in at a close second ! " shouted Alton .
" No one turns me on like you … especially in that one episode … where you dressed up as a cowboy … " said Rachael who does not have a fat ass .
" Not even … the episode … where I made DOUGHNUTS ?! "
He grabbed her , throwing her against the counter .
" Oh , God , Alton !
MAKE THE DOUGHNUTS !!! "
" With the glaze ? "
" Oh , God !!!
The CHOCOLATE GLAZE !! "
All of a sudden Emeril burst into the room , " Looks like they 're takin ' it up a notch ! "
" Takin ' it up a notch ? " asked Rachael , tearing herself away from Alton .
" That 's not nearly as catchy as ' BAM ! '
You disappoint me , Emeril … Julia Child is ashamed of you !!!
She visits me in visions ! "
Even though Rachael had to wake up early in the morning and start on her new show , Tasty Travels , she decided it would n't hurt to spend the night with Alton and do some tasty traveling of her own …
Tune in next time …
Ahem , 25 years old and have watched every Knight Rider episode at least three times and the " movies " and the failed pilot of the relaunch .
My first bike was named KITT .
My first reaction when I saw this article was OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG ....
I already have a navigation system , but it is now my " backup " navigation system .
When someone sells an after - market turbo boost or super pursuit mode bolt - on for my Jetta , I 'll be buying that too .
Cleveland / Berlin ( Reuters ) - Fünf Wochen vor der Präsidentenwahl in den USA haben sich Amtsinhaber Donald Trump und sein Herausforderer Joe Biden in ihrem ersten TV - Duell einen hitzigen Schlagabtausch geliefert .

MSNBC 's Hardball host Chris Matthews was on hand during the presidential debate last night , and had a lively discussion with New York Magazine 's John Heilemann .
Matthews suggested that who we want to listen to for the next four to eight years is a part of how we look at who we want to elect to office .
Matthews : " Who do you want to listen to for 4 - 8 years ?
It really is part of how we look at these things .
Let 's start with John McCain .
Do you think he was to troll - like , tonight ?
You know , too much of a troll ?
Seriously , do people want to put up with four years of that , of sitting there angrily , grumpily ... like a codger ?
I do n't want to push you too far , but did n't he seem really contemptuous of his opponent ? "
After much laughter , Howard responds , " He did ... "
Matthews : " You want to put up with four years of that ? "
Howard : " He hates Obama ... Maybe when Obama 's not on stage we wo n't have to put up with that . "
" Excuse me , " interrupts Matthews , " that 's what he thinks of the press .
Is every press conference going to be like that ?
Troll - like performance , angry at the world ? "
The following video is the exchange between Chris Matthews and John Howard after the presidential debates on Friday , September 26 , 2008 .

Lately in my spare time I 've been working on adding Git support to Rietveld .
( Rietveld is the code review tool that Guido wrote as an App Engine demo .
It 's similar to Mondrian but open - source and not as tied into Google 's workflows .
Unfortunately , up until recently it was pretty Subversion - specific , making assumptions like expecting URLs to HTTP - accessible svn repositories .
For what it 's worth , a likely better system is Review Board ; I just think code review is great in general . )
My Rietveld refactoring patch is now in , and we continue to discuss the Git- specific followup .
( Thankfully , someone working on Mercurial support already did a lot of the hard initial work . )
I 've also written a more git - oriented subcommand which works like this : you runto put a branch up for review , andflushes the current branch into a single svn commit using the description from the Rietveld review .
WORLD VIEW : Growing social inequality in the US puts the economy back at the centre of the presidential campaign , writes Paul Gillespie
IN THE 1980s Gore Vidal observed of Reagonomics : " The US government prefers that public money go not to the people but to big business .
The result is a unique society in which we have free enterprise for the poor and socialism for the rich . "
His epigram has been repeatedly recalled this week following the nationalisation of American International Group , the world 's biggest insurer , coming shortly after the similar rescue of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac housing companies and of the Bear Stearns bank .
" Socialised capitalism " is Robert Reich 's description .
" Gains privatised and losses socialised " was the more pointed comment by Nouriel Roubini , professor of economics at the Stern School in New York University .
He is known in the economics trade as a " permabear " because of his repeated claims over the last six years that a financial system based on self - regulation , non-deposits , highly leveraged subprime housing debts and globalised derivatives trading was unsustainable and would collapse .
Now that he has been proved correct he has suddenly become known to wider circles of people desperate to get some expert perspective on these events .
How does this crisis compare to previous ones ?
Is it a systemic failure or a conjunctural one arising from the Bush administration 's deregulation policies ( which continued those of the later Clinton administration ) ?
Could it lead to another depression like the 1930s ?
What alternatives are there to the policies followed this week ?
Roubini is unusual among economists in combining comparative , historical and mathematical analysis , giving him a broader appeal to policymakers and the mass public .
In an interview with the New York Times magazine on August 18th , he described himself as more a realist than a pessimist .
He argues that the AIG should have been bankrupted rather than nationalised , and the $ 85 billion of taxpayers ' money loaned to the firm could have been used instead for debtor - in - possession financing .
This would have allowed for a more fair process for allocating losses between shareholders and short - term and long - term creditors of the firm .
Nationalisations like this are prejudiced in favour of those responsible for the trouble in the first place .
He is scathing about the Bush administration 's actions .
In his column for the online RGE Monitor , he wrote : " Fanatic zealots of any religion are always pests that cause havoc and destruction with their inflexible fanaticism ; but they usually do n't run the biggest economy in the world .
But these laissez - faire voodoo - economics zealots in charge of the USA have now caused the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression and the nastiest economic crisis in decades .
" So let them be shamed in public for their hypocrisy and zealotry that has caused so much financial and economic damage . "
As to historical comparisons , he says " calling it socialism ( even socialism for the rich , the well - connected and Wall Street ) is giving a bad name even to a failed experiment like socialism ; this is more akin to the creation of a corporatist state ( like the Italian fascism or the German Third Reich ) where private sector interests are protected ( gains privatised and losses socialised ) , where the government is taken over by corrupt and reckless private interests . "
The notion of class division based on economic interests has of course been out of fashion during these years ; but the stubborn facts of growing social inequality in the US accelerated by financial deregulation bear out the differential impact of this crisis and put the economy back at the centre of the presidential campaign .
The share of aggregate income going to the highest - earning 1 per cent of Americans doubled from 8 per cent in 1980 to 19 per cent in 2004 .
In 2005 that figure increased to 21 per cent .
The bottom 50 per cent earned 12.8 per cent in 2005 , compared to 13 per cent in 2000 .
In recent years more than half of students graduating from Harvard sought and got high - paid employment in the investment banks that are now collapsing .
That era has come to an end .
Most lower and middle incomes stagnated during the Bush years .
To that uncertainty there is added the much greater systemic one now on view .
How it plays into the elections will probably determine the result , allowing an escape to policy debate from the juvenile personality discussion most prominent so far .
This presents a real opportunity for Barack Obama if he can rise to it .
He has been reaching back to the more radical programme put forward in March criticising tax - cutting , trickle - down policies and deregulation , rather than to the more centrist Clintonite ones adopted more recently .
Polls indicate he is now communicating more effectively with the lower - and middle - income workers he needs ; and the pacing of this crisis will match his own during the final stages of the campaign .
McCain 's U - turns are more pronounced , shifting from the deregulation he advocated and supported in 1999 - 2001 to a call for stronger government action now and a bizarre defence of American workers ' productivity .
He will find it more difficult to dissociate himself from the Bush administration , and the Palin effect may be less appealing in the face of these systemic uncertainties .
Whoever wins inherits a debt of $ 10 trillion , which Roubini believes will now increase by at least another trillion - much of it held by China and Japan .
Despite the worldwide effects of the US financial collapse , not all capitalisms have a similar structure to the recent American model .
Globalisation spread its toxic debt around the world , but varying regulatory regimes make a real difference .
Commentators expect the EU to set new standards which would spread to the US and others .
Thus there has been notably less impact on the German than on the British economy .
Franz Muntefering 's much maligned description of Anglo - Saxon style derivatives trading as " locust capitalism " in 2005 now resonates more widely .

Chinese officials initially suggested that any troubles journalists were having with Internet access probably stemmed from the sites themselves , not any steps that China had taken to filter Web content .
But Sun Weide , the chief spokesman for the Beijing Olympic organizing committee , acknowledged Wednesday that journalists would not have uncensored Internet use .
“ It has been our policy to provide the media with convenient and sufficient access to the Internet , ” Mr. Sun said .
“ I believe our policy will not affect reporters ’ coverage of the Olympic Games . ”
Mr. Sun said foreigners using the Internet in China would be subject to the same laws under which censors blocked access to a wide range of Web sites thought to be detrimental to stability .
China has long maintained that its laws governing Internet access do not amount to censorship and are similar to restrictions on pornography or gambling sites in many countries .
The restrictions were the latest in a string of problems that have tarnished the prelude to the Olympics , which open Aug .
8 . China struggled to contain ethnic unrest in Tibetan areas this spring .
The global torch relay that China organized to promote the Games was disrupted by protests .
Air pollution in Beijing has remained severe despite efforts to reduce it .
In recent months , human rights advocates have accused Beijing of stepping up the detention and surveillance of those it fears could disrupt the Games .
On Tuesday , President Bush met with five Chinese dissidents at the White House to drive home his dissatisfaction with the pace of change .
Mr. Bush , who will attend the opening ceremonies in just over a week , also pressed China ’s foreign minister to ease political repression .
The White House also urged China to lift its restrictions on the Internet .
“ We want to see more access for reporters , we want to see more access for everybody in China to be able to have access to the Internet , ” the White House press secretary , Dana Perino , said Wednesday .
On Capitol Hill , Senator Sam Brownback , Republican of Kansas , introduced a resolution on Tuesday urging China to reconsider what he said were its plans to force international hotel chains to track electronic communications by its guests .
At a news conference , he introduced redacted documents that he said were provided by the hotels requiring them to install government software to monitor Internet traffic during the Olympics .
Concerns about media access to the Internet intensified Tuesday , when Western journalists working at the Main Press Center in Beijing said they could not get to Amnesty International ’s Web site to see the group ’s report on China ’s rights record .
Lamborghini 's teased us with another photo of the mystery car it's bringing to the Paris Motor Show , and a close look suggests Sant ' Agata is about to unveil a sedan .
The Italian automaker offered the first clue earlier this week , revealing a single photo and promising " it 's not just a new Lamborghini , it 's a whole new world . "
That 's set off a wave of speculation about what the company 's got up it 's sleeve .
We joined the parlor game yesterday , suggesting Lambo was working on a hot - rodded version of the already impressive Murcielago LP640 .
But looking at the photo Lamborghini released today , we 're leaning toward a gran turismo to take on the Porsche Panamera and Aston Martin Raptide Rapide .
We 'll even go so far as to say it 'll be called the Mondo .
The most obvious clue is the size of the b- panel – when 's the last time you saw a Lamborghini with a door that was n't right next to the wheel well ?
That much unbroken sheet metal behind the wheel suggests the engine will be up front , creating the space for a back seat .
All the numbers have been Photoshopped off the side of that Pirelli P - Zero , but unless Lamborghini 's gone donk , that 's a relatively puny brake rotor .
More evidence we 're looking at a four - seater , because there 's no way that rotor 's big enough for a Murcielago Super Veloce or Superleggera .
And the flashy paint means we 're not looking another Reventon .
Now then - about the name .
The big clue there is the tagline that accompanied the first photo – " It 's not just a new Lamborghini .
It 's a whole new world . "
We 're betting it 's a riddle .
The Italian word for " world " is mondo .
Ferrari built a 2+2 called the Mondial , which is the other Italian translation of " world , " ( techincally , it 's mondiale , but same diff ) so that word is off - limits .
That might explain the tagline of the photo Lamborghini released today : " Not yet seen THE Italian car ? "
Photos by Lamborghini .
The first teaser photo .
Note the carbon fiber diffuser :
And here 's a shot of the front wheel on a Murcielago roadster for comparison .
Note the proximity of the door to the wheel well , and the size of the rotor :
I talked about these a while back .
It ’s Gen Con time , and that means award ceremonies .
The Diana Jones Award ceremony was held on Wednesday , while the ENnies were given out last night .
Neither website has yet been updated , which I suppose is understandable , in a way .
If I was there with 20,000 other gamers having fun , I would n’t bother with stuff like that , either .
However , there are other sources for this data .
Like Wolfgang Baur ’s LiveJournal , where we get the Diana Jones results .
The 2008 Diana Jones Award was a tie , between Wolfgang Baur ’s Open Design and Jason Morningstar ’s roleplaying game Grey Ranks .
Congratulations to the winners !
Hmm .
Arkenstone stocks Grey Ranks .
It must be mine !
Then there ’s the big event , the ENnies .
Results available on the EN World front page ( for the time being , at least ) .
There ’s a lot , so I wo n’t reproduce it all here .
I will , however , point out that Paizo won gold for Best Cover Art , Best Adventure , Best Setting , Best Adversary Product , Best Aid or Accessory , Best Web Enhancement or Free Product , and Best Publisher .
Silver for Best Interior Art .
My other favourite , Green Ronin‘s Pirate ’s Guide to Freeport got gold for Best Cartography and silver for Best Setting .
It ’s more or less as I expected , actually .
I just wished Seven Days to the Grave would have performed better .
It ’s a smashing adventure , and one of the things it rightfully smashes is the hoary old fallacy that plagues are n’t a danger in D&D , with all those clerics running around .
Ah , well .
Congratulations to Paizo , Green Ronin , White Wolf , Pelgrane Press , Kenzer & Co , Fat Dragon Games , Malhavoc Press , Goodman Games , Pinnacle Entertainment Group , Exile Games Studio , Lone Wolf Development , and hey , even Wizards of the Coast .
I loved Confessions of a Part - Time Sorceress .
Also , congratulations to DungeonMastering.com and FlamesRising.com for Best Fan Products !

Detectives investigating allegations of abuse at a former Jersey children 's home have found a further 14 milk teeth , police said today .
The finds take the total number of children 's teeth discovered at Haut de la Garenne to 27 .
More than 30 bone fragments have been found at the home , which is at the centre of an inquiry into historic child abuse on the island .
The teeth were all found in cellars , apart from one that was located in a cistern in the courtyard .
Police said 26 of the teeth were being tested in the UK .
Tests to establish the age of the bone fragments have produced conflicting results .
Some experts have suggested the bones date back as far as 150 years , in which case , police have said , there would be no murder inquiry .
Others have said they date from the 1950s or 1960s .
Last month , it emerged that the fragment that sparked the search at Haut de la Garenne - initially described as being part of a child 's skull - was considered more likely to be a piece of wood or coconut shell than bone .
More than 100 people have claimed they were abused at Haut de la Garenne .
Forensic teams uncovered a network of four secret underground chambers where the teeth and bone fragments were discovered .
Police have identified around 70 suspects , or " people of interest " , they want to question .
Two men have been charged in connection with alleged child abuse at Haut de la Garenne .
Gordon Claude Wateridge , 76 , originally from London , is charged with three offences of indecent assault on girls under 16 between 1969 and 1979 when he was a warder at the home .
Michael Aubin , 45 , who was born in Jersey and lives in Southampton , is accused of sodomy against a boy under 16 and indecently assaulting two other boys under 16 .
The allegations relate to incidents that took place between 1977 and 1980 .
A third man , 68 - year - old Claude Donnelly , of St Brelade , Jersey , has been charged as part of the wider abuse inquiry .
He is accused of raping and sexually assaulting a 12 - year - old girl on the island between 1971 and 1974 .
I ’ve recently had the opportunity to check out TextMate and it has a nice feature that lets you select some lines and automatically add # to the beginning of them in order to comment them out .
I realized that this is of course a missing feature in the Pico Editor so here we go :
def onComment ( sci ) txt = sci.get_text_range(sci.get_selection_start , sci.get_selection_end ) sci.clear comment_rgx = Regexp.new ( '^ ' + Regexp.escape(@single_comment ) ) new_txt = [ ] txt.gsub(/\r/ , '' ) .split(/
/).each do |line| if comment_rgx.match ( line ) new_txt << line.slice(@single_comment.length , line.length - 1 ) else new_txt << @single_comment + line end end sci.insert_text(sci.get_current_pos , new_txt.join ( "
" ) )
end
First we get the selected text , then we remove it by clearing it in the editor .
We create the regular expression to use , really simple one ; /^#/ in our case ( more on @single_comment soon ) .
We remove any \r characters in case we are on windows followed by splitting by new lines .
We loop through the array we get from the split .
Each line is now matched against the regular expression , if we have a match we will keep everything but the comment .
If we do n’t have a match we add the comment to the beginning of the line .

When he faces off against Sarah Palin Thursday night , Joe Biden will have his hands full .
I should know .
I 've debated Governor Palin more than two dozen times .
And she 's a master , not of facts , figures , or insightful policy recommendations , but at the fine art of the nonanswer , the glittering generality .
Against such charms there is little Senator Biden , or anyone , can do .
On paper , of course , the debate appears to be a mismatch .
In 2000 , Palin was the mayor of an Alaskan town of 5,500 people , while Biden was serving his 28th year as a United States senator .
Her major public policy concern was building a local ice rink and sports center .
His major public policy concern was the State Department 's decision to grant an export license to allow sales of heavy - lift helicopters to Turkey , during tense UN - sponsored Cyprus peace talks .
On paper , the difference in experience on both domestic and foreign policy is like the difference between shooting a bullet and throwing a bullet .
Unfortunately for Biden , if recent history is an indicator , experience or a grasp of the issues wo n't matter when it comes to debating Palin .
On April 17 , 2006 , Palin and I participated in a debate at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks on agriculture issues .
The next day , the Fairbanks Daily News Miner published this excerpt :
" Andrew Halcro , a declared independent candidate from Anchorage , came armed with statistics on agricultural productivity .
Sarah Palin , a Republican from Wasilla , said the Matanuska Valley provides a positive example for other communities interested in agriculture to study . "
On April 18 , 2006 , Palin and I sat together in a hotel coffee shop comparing campaign trail notes .
As we talked about the debates , Palin made a comment that highlights the phenomenon that Biden is up against .
" Andrew , I watch you at these debates with no notes , no papers , and yet when asked questions , you spout off facts , figures , and policies , and I 'm amazed .
But then I look out into the audience and I ask myself , ' Does any of this really matter ? ' " Palin said .
While policy wonks such as Biden might cringe , it seemed to me that Palin was simply vocalizing her strength without realizing it .
During the campaign , Palin 's knowledge on public policy issues never matured – because it did n't have to .
Her ability to fill the debate halls with her presence and her gift of the glittering generality made it possible for her to rely on populism instead of policy .
Palin is a master of the nonanswer .
She can turn a 60 - second response to a query about her specific solutions to healthcare challenges into a folksy story about how she 's met people on the campaign trail who face healthcare challenges .
All without uttering a word about her public - policy solutions to healthcare challenges .
In one debate , a moderator asked the candidates to name a bill the legislature had recently passed that we did n't like .
I named one .
Democratic candidate Tony Knowles named one .
But Sarah Palin instead used her allotted time to criticize the incumbent governor , Frank Murkowski .
Asked to name a bill we did like , the same pattern emerged : Palin did n't name a bill .
And when she does answer the actual question asked , she has a canny ability to connect with the audience on a personal level .
For example , asked to name a major issue that had been ignored during the campaign , I discussed the health of local communities , Mr. Knowles talked about affordable healthcare , and Palin talked about ... the need to protect hunting and fishing rights .
So what does that mean for Biden ?
With shorter question - and - answer times and limited interaction between the two , he should simply ignore Palin in a respectful manner on the stage and answer the questions as though he were alone .
Any attempt to flex his public - policy knowledge and show Palin is not ready for prime time will inevitably cast him in the role of the bully .
On the other side of the stage , if Palin is to be successful , she needs to do what she does best : fill the room with her presence and stick to the scripted sound bites .
• Andrew Halcro served two terms as a Republican member of the Alaska State House of Representatives .
He ran for governor as an Independent in 2006 , debating Sarah Palin more than two dozen times .

Bernard Kobes ( Arizona State ) calls my attention to the latest travesty about academic philosophy to stain the pages of the Chronicle of Higher Education , this one by Russell Jacoby whose qualification for the task -- brace yourselves -- is that he is a " Professor in Residence " in the History Department at UCLA .
This item is not quite as perniciously ignorant as work by Carlin Romano , or as lazily ignorant as Alan Wolfe writing about Mill , but it is ignorant and misleading nonetheless , and does now raise a real question about editorial oversight at the Chronicle : why are you folks letting people with no discernible knowledge of the subject write about academic philosophy ?
Now , to be fair , Mr. Jacoby also wants to savage economics and psychology departments .
Here 's how he starts :
How is it that Freud is not taught in psychology departments , Marx is not taught in economics , and Hegel is hardly taught in philosophy ?
Instead these masters of Western thought are taught in fields far from their own .
Nowadays Freud is found in literature departments , Marx in film studies , and Hegel in German .
But have they migrated , or have they been expelled ?
Perhaps the home fields of Freud , Marx , and Hegel have turned arid .
Perhaps those disciplines have come to prize a scientistic ethos that drives away unruly thinkers .
Or maybe they simply progress by sloughing off the past .
This is a quite breathtaking opening , especially because Hegel , Marx , and Freud were , all three , committed to a scientific ethos -- Marx and Freud precisely in the modern sense ( picked out by the pejorative " scientistic " ) of trying to construct theories , respectively , of history and the mind that passed muster by the standards of the natural sciences .
One of many reasons little sound scholarship on Hegel , Marx , or Freud emanates from the departments Mr. Jacoby singles out is that those fields too often lack anything resembling a commitment to Wissenschaft , to rigorous methods and standards of evidence .
There is a further irony here , which is that the phenomenon in question is not a recent one , something one might have expected an historian to know .
Hegel is taught far more often in philosophy departments now than he was in Germany in the 1870s and 1880s , when the combination of the popularity of Schopenhauer 's anti-Hegelian polemics , the rise of German Materialism , and the " back to Kant " turn in German philosophy left Hegel out in the cold .
And surely Mr. Jacoby must realize that in the heyday of behaviorism in psychology in the 1930s , 1940s , and 1950s , Freud was not exactly a welcome presence in academic psychology departments where any reference to conscious beliefs and desires in the explanation of behavior was itself thought suspect .
So part of what is completely untenable about this framing of the issue is that it assumes , falsely , that these disciplines , including philosophy , are " static , " that because a thinker at time T self - identifies with a discipline that necessarily any discipline bearing the same name at time T+100 must be the same .
But as the story of Hegel 's neglect in Germany just a generation or so after his death rather dramatically illustrates , the assumption has no merit .
Of course , I have yet to raise a question about the factual assumption underlying Mr. Jacoby 's critique , namely , about what is actually taught .
Here 's what he tells us :
A completely unscientific survey of three randomly chosen universities confirms the exodus .
A search through the philosophy - course descriptions at the University of Kansas yields a single 19th - century - survey lecture that mentions Hegel .
Marx receives a passing citation in an economics class on income inequality .
Freud scores zero in psychology .
At the University of Arizona , Hegel again pops up in a survey course on 19th - century philosophy ; Marx is shut out of economics ; and , as usual , Freud has disappeared .
And at the University of Wisconsin at Madison , Hegel does not appear in philosophy courses , Marx does not turn up in economics , and Freud is bypassed in psychology .
I assume that most historians have more regard for the use of evidence than is evident in Mr. Jacoby 's completely absurd sampling method , one made even more suspect by facts that are quite easy to confirm on - line but omitted by Mr. Jacoby .
The Department of Philosophy at the University of Kansas , for example , has a full - time , tenure - stream young scholar who wrote his PhD thesis on Hegel , and who teaches and writes regularly ( and intelligently ) about both Hegel and Nietzsche .
( Did it occur to Mr. Jacoby that the on - line course descriptions might be outdated ? )
This is all the more notable given that the Kansas department is relatively small .
The University of Wisconsin at Madison also has a full - time , tenured member of the faculty ( Ivan Soll ) , who has written one book on Hegel , and many articles on Hegel , Schopenhauer and Nietzsche , among others .
So much for Mr. Jacoby 's report of his random sampling .
Here , off the top of my head , is a list of tenure - stream faculty who teach and write about Hegel in just the top 20 philosophy departments in the U.S. ( I assume that will qualify as the " scientistic " mainstream for Mr. Jacoby 's purposes ) : Beatrice Longuenesse at NYU ; Robert Brandom at Pittsburgh ; Allen Wood at Stanford ; Frederick Neuhouser at Columbia ; Karl Ameriks at Notre Dame ; Michelle Kosch at Cornell ; Michael Forster and Robert Pippin at Chicago ; Kathleen Higgins at Texas ; Michael Hardimon at UC San Diego .
That 's not to mention , of course , all the faculty at these departments who regularly teach and write about Marx , Nietzsche , and Freud , among others .
Aquinas , Epicurus , Duns Scotus , Hobbes , Reid , and Spinoza - - among other major historical figures -- are n't nearly as well - represented as Hegel , I 'm afraid .
Where is Mr. Jacoby 's anger about this fact ?
And should one be angry about it ?
Hegel is but one figure in the history of philosophy , regarded by some as of seminal importance , by others ( like Schopenhauer and Nietzsche , for instance ) as worthy mainly of ridicule .
A typical philosophy department , even one with a PhD program , may have only fifteen or so faculty lines , with which it must cover the whole history of philosophy ( ancient Greek and Roman , medieval , early modern , Kant and 19th - century philosophy , 20th - century analytic and Continental philosophy -- and perhaps even the history of non-Western philosophical traditions ) as well as areas of contemporary research in moral , political , and legal philosophy ; philosophy of the sciences and mathematics ; philosophy of language and mind ; metaphysics and epistemology ; and perhaps still others ( logic , philosophy of religion , aesthetics , etc. ) .
Why , oh why , should the historical treatment of one figure , Hegel , take precedence over every other major historical figure or important contemporary topic ?
That 's the actual question that Departments confront .
And given the actual situation , it is rather striking that Hegel fares as well as he does compared to other figures in the history of philosophy .
Mr. Jacoby , however , has a real axe he wants to grind : namely , what he takes to be the anti-historical or a -historical nature of his target disciplines .
( Imagine that : an historian is mad that other fields do n't pay enough attention to his ! )
Here is his hugely ironic critique of psychology on this score :
[ T ]he ruthlessly anti- or nonhistorical orientation that informs contemporary academe encourages shelving past geniuses .
This mind - set evidently affects psychology .
The American Psychological Association 's own task force on " learning goals " for undergraduate majors makes a nod toward teaching the history of psychology , but it relegates the subject to an optional subfield , equivalent to " group dynamics . "
" We are not advocating that separate courses in the history of psychology or group dynamics must be included in the undergraduate curriculum , " the savants counsel , " but leave it to the ingenuity of departments to determine contexts in which students can learn those relevant skills and perspectives . "
The ingenious departments apparently have dumped Freud as antiquated .
A study by the American Psychoanalytic Association of " teaching about psychoanalytic ideas in the undergraduate curricula of 150 highly ranked colleges and universities " concludes that Freudian ideas thrive outside of psychology departments ....
The irony , of course , is that contemporary academic psychology shares the same " scientistic " commitments of Freud : namely , to discover truths about the mind that can pass muster by the evidential standards that have served us well in the natural sciences .
Physics and Chemistry departments do not spend a lot of time on the " history " of their disciplines , and psychology departments , even if they were now dominated by Freudians , would not either .
Perhaps the fact that psychology is a " soft " science ( to put it nicely ) should give them pause about such an approach ; but , ironically , Freud would not have been an ally on this point .
After then attacking economics , Mr. Jacoby turns to philosophy :
Compared with economics , philosophy prizes the study of its past and generally offers courses on Greek , medieval , and modern thinkers .
Frequently , however , those classes close with Kant , in the 18th century , and do not pick up again until the 20th century .
The troubling 19th century , featuring Hegel ( and Kierkegaard and Nietzsche ) , is omitted or glossed over .
General catalogs sometimes list a Hegel course in philosophy , but it is rarely offered .
Very few philosophy departments at major universities teach Hegel or Hegelian thought .
We 've already noted that this is partly false ( many of the leading philosophy departments in the country have Hegel specialists on their faculties ) and partly misleading ( lots of historical figures are taught irregularly , there is always a question of resources ) .
But Mr. Jacoby continues :
Philosophy stands at the opposite pole from psychology in at least one respect .
In most colleges and universities , it is one of the smaller majors , while psychology is one of the largest .
Yet , much like psychology , philosophy has proved unwelcoming for thinkers paddling against the mainstream .
Not only did sharp critics like Richard Rorty , frustrated by its narrowness , quit philosophy for comparative literature , but a whole series of professors have departed for other fields , leaving philosophy itself intellectually parched .
That is the argument of John McCumber , a scholar of Hegel and Heidegger who himself decamped from philosophy to German .
His book Time in the Ditch : American Philosophy and the McCarthy Era ( Northwestern University Press , 2001 ) savages the contemporary American philosophical profession and its flight from history .
He notes , for instance , that 10 years after the 1987 " breakthrough anthology " Feminism as Critique , not one of its contributors , from Seyla Benhabib to Iris Marion Young , still taught in a philosophy department .
The pressures that force — or tempt — big names such as Rorty and Martha Nussbaum to quit philosophy , McCumber observes , exert equal force on those outside the public eye .
He charges , for instance , that senior editors dispense with peer review and run the major philosophy journals like private fiefdoms , and that a few established professors select papers for the discipline 's annual conferences .
The authoritarianism and cronyism drive out mavericks .
Professor Kobes , in his note to me , put it well : " This is a grotesque distortion of the state of our discipline .
It is simply not true that the major philosophy journals dispense with peer review and are run like private fiefdoms .
And I suspect it is at least misleading to suggest that people like Martha Nussbaum ' quit philosophy ' ( sic ) because the discipline is unwelcoming to people paddling against the mainstream . "
Indeed : I am quite sure Martha Nussbaum , when she joined the University of Chicago Law School a dozen years ago , was " quitting philosophy " as little as I am today .
Benhabib did n't " quit " philosophy either : she simply found the grass greener in Political Science Departments , where the top departments were keen to hire her when top philosophy departments were not .
The reason , I 'm afraid , is pretty simple , but one would actually have to know something to know this : Benhabib 's work on Hegel and the Frankfurt School just is not as good , philosophically , as the best work on these thinkers by Allen Wood , Michael Forster , Raymond Geuss , Michael Rosen , Frederick Beiser , Robert Pippin , and others .
And finally -- alas - - if Mr. Jacoby had asked around he would have learned rather quickly that no one ( not even the leading scholars of Hegel and Heidegger ) considers Professor McCumber an authority on , or even a reliable guide to , contemporary philosophy .
( Professor McCumber does teach in the German Department at UCLA which may explain why he looms so large on Mr. Jacoby 's horizon . )
For example , only Journal of Philosophy could be reasonably charged with being run like a " private fiefdom [ ] , " as our earlier discussion of the topic brought out .
In fact , philosophy is notable for the large number of high - profile journals run meticulously and utilizing blind peer review .
Maybe this is driving out " mavericks " ( like Professor McCumber ? ) , or maybe it is driving out mediocrities and poseurs ?
The evidence on offer is , alas , compatible with both possibilities .
It would take a lot more argument , and knowledge , to establish Mr. Jacoby 's preferred reading .
Mr. Jacoby , sadly , is not done smearing a field he obviously has little knowledge of , for he continues :
Philosophy nods toward its past , but its devotion to language analysis and logic - chopping pushes aside as murky its great 19th - century thinkers .
Polishing philosophical eyeglasses proves futile if they are rarely used to see .
Some philosophers , no doubt , " chop logic , " just as some historians apparently " shovel bullshit , " but we would , in either instance , do well to refrain from judging the state of a discipline by its weakest exemplars .
It is true that philosophy that utilizes formal logic is harder for intellectual tourists like Mr. Jacoby to read , but I am afraid this does not establish its value .
" Language analysis " is also , as every reader of this blog knows , contested and in some quarters abandoned as central to philosophical methodology .
But what contemporary philosophers have in common is not " language - analysis and logic - chopping , " but rather what they share with almost every other philosopher in history , namely , an interest in understanding -- in " polishing philosophical eyeglasses " in order " to see " -- the nature of knowledge , reality , truth , mind , meaning , morality , goodness , art , etc .
Hegel is " murkier " than Quine , and also murkier than Hume .
But murkiness has never been an obstacle to philosophical importance , from Leibniz to Hegel to Husserl to Dummett .
There is a lot right and a lot wrong with academic philosophy in the United States these days .
But to even get at the field 's virtues and problems one has to actually know something about the discipline , about what work is actually being done , what methods are used , what topics and thinkers are being genuinely neglected , and which ones flourishing even though they are unlikely to bear fruits .
There are , without a doubt , departments that are parochial and narrow - minded , whose faculties are under - educated and under - informed , sometimes about the field 's history , sometimes about its contemporary contours , sometimes , remarkably , both .
For my money , I would rather see much more history of philosophy ( though not , I confess , much more Hegel ) , and less intuition - pumping ethics and metaphysics , which may well align my sympathies with Mr. Jacoby's .
But the question is why my preferences , or his , ought to be treated as a pertinent benchmark for the direction the field moves ?
If the SPEP folks had not tainted the word " pluralism " a generation ago by using it as the fig leaf for bad philosophy , one might even say that what some departments now need is more " pluralism . "
The truth is , however , that most departments do rather well in covering philosophy , a remarkably capacious discipline , with unclear boundaries , and a rich and variegated history that permits of many different tellings .
As Professor Kobes wrote to me : " The Chronicle is widely read by deans and other university decision makers .
I am not aware of it publishing on a regular basis any better informed commentator on philosophy than Carlin Romano and Russell Jacoby . "
The solution is clear : philosophers need to write clearly and understandably about their work , how it relates to the work philosophers have always done , how it contributes to interdisciplinary projects in linguistics , computer science , biology , psychology , etc. , and then submit those articles to the Chronicle .
I doubt very much that malice against philosophy explains the embarrassing run of ignorant pieces CH has been publishing .
I suspect , instead , it is lack of anything else available to fill the pages .
For obvious reasons , intellectual tourists like Mr. Jacoby and Mr. Romano will regularly volunteer their amateurish musings about philosophy to CH , since they are n't going to appear in any forum in which the editors know something about the subject .
That makes it even more imperative for philosophers to present their work and their discipline to a non-specialist audience .

WHEN more than 80 % of Americans tell pollsters that they think the country is on the wrong track , and when only 28 % of them believe that the president is doing a good job , you do n't need a Karl Rove or a Dick Morris to tell you that the road to the White House involves steering well clear of the incumbent 's policies .
So why is John McCain not doing it ?
The Republican candidate has always been close to George Bush when it comes to defending two fundamental , if unpopular , points of principle — the Iraq war and free trade .
But in recent months
Mr McCain has slid to the right on a series of other issues , including tax cuts , offshore drilling , immigration and even torture .
This manoeuvring seems insincere and short - sighted .
Sincerity is important with Mr McCain .
He has been at his most attractive , especially to independents such as this newspaper , when he stands up for issues that he believes in .
On the Iraq war , his position has been almost Churchillian : victory at all costs , victory in spite of all terror .
Declaring that he would rather lose an election than a war is paradoxically one of the Republican candidate 's most valuable electoral assets .
It makes him sound like a commander - in - chief .
The same goes for Mr McCain 's support for free - trade agreements .
Only a third of the country thinks these are good for America , the lowest figure , alas , in the developed world .
But Mr McCain 's position has been clear , consistent and right .
As with Iraq , it is his opponent , Barack Obama , who is having to track towards the centre , trying to renounce some of the crowd - pleasing claptrap he uttered in the primaries .
That this newspaper admires Mr McCain for taking positions it agrees with may seem hardly surprising .
Yet he still maintains some of his allure when he takes the wrong course , but does so plainly out of principle .
His support for the embargo on Cuba and his opposition to gun control at home may be wrong - headed , but they are genuine .
His League of Democracies and his overheated rhetoric about Iran are misguided , but they are consistent with his political history .
In a world short of conviction politicians , Mr McCain 's Straight Talk Express has its charms .
But not when the straight talker starts saying things it is very hard to imagine that he remotely believes in .
It was a bad omen last year when this freewheeling western conservative in the Reagan mould went off to court the intolerant Christian right .
And recently , the flip - flops have come rapidly .
Once a vigorous opponent of Mr Bush 's tax cuts , he says he wants not only to continue but also to extend them .
Once a champion of greenery , he has called not only for an expensive petrol - tax holiday ( something Mr Obama cleverly resisted ) but also for a resumption of drilling off America 's coast .
Once a supporter of closing down Guantánamo Bay , he recently criticised the Supreme Court for daring to suggest that inmates deserve the right of habeas corpus .
He has edged to the right on two other areas where he used to be hated by his party 's conservatives as a dangerous maverick : on torture ( he wo n't rule out water - boarding ) and immigration reform ( he says fix the border first , which will take an eternity ) .
Do n't be spooked , John
It is true that America still has more conservatives than liberals .
But the Republican Party has known for a long time that Mr McCain is not precisely one of them — and they still chose him anyway .
Conservatives were smart enough to see that his appeal to independents and floating voters , who make up a larger proportion of the electorate than either of the two main parties , is their only hope of retaining the White House .
American elections classically involve a two - step : the candidate runs to the extreme in the primary , then back to the centre for the general .
Mr Obama is doing that .
Mr McCain seems to be doing precisely the opposite .
It is a mistake .
There were two glaring problems with this theory , as Mr. Taubes , a correspondent for Science magazine , explains in his book .
First , it was n’t clear that traditional diets were especially lean .
Nineteenth - century Americans consumed huge amounts of meat ; the percentage of fat in the diet of ancient hunter - gatherers , according to the best estimate today , was as high or higher than the ratio in the modern Western diet .
Second , there was n’t really a new epidemic of heart disease .
Yes , more cases were being reported , but not because people were in worse health .
It was mainly because they were living longer and were more likely to see a doctor who diagnosed the symptoms .
To bolster his theory , Dr. Keys in 1953 compared diets and heart disease rates in the United States , Japan and four other countries .
Sure enough , more fat correlated with more disease ( America topped the list ) .
But critics at the time noted that if Dr. Keys had analyzed all 22 countries for which data were available , he would not have found a correlation .
( And , as Mr. Taubes notes , no one would have puzzled over the so - called French Paradox of foie - gras connoisseurs with healthy hearts . )
The evidence that dietary fat correlates with heart disease “ does not stand up to critical examination , ” the American Heart Association concluded in 1957 .
But three years later the association changed position — not because of new data , Mr. Taubes writes , but because Dr. Keys and an ally were on the committee issuing the new report .
It asserted that “ the best scientific evidence of the time ” warranted a lower - fat diet for people at high risk of heart disease .
The association ’s report was big news and put Dr. Keys , who died in 2004 , on the cover of Time magazine .
The magazine devoted four pages to the topic — and just one paragraph noting that Dr. Keys ’s diet advice was “ still questioned by some researchers . ”
That set the tone for decades of news media coverage .
Journalists and their audiences were looking for clear guidance , not scientific ambiguity .
After the fat - is - bad theory became popular wisdom , the cascade accelerated in the 1970s when a committee led by Senator George McGovern issued a report advising Americans to lower their risk of heart disease by eating less fat .
“ McGovern ’s staff were virtually unaware of the existence of any scientific controversy , ” Mr. Taubes writes , and the committee ’s report was written by a nonscientist “ relying almost exclusively on a single Harvard nutritionist , Mark Hegsted . ”
That report impressed another nonscientist , Carol Tucker Foreman , an assistant agriculture secretary , who hired Dr. Hegsted to draw up a set of national dietary guidelines .
The Department of Agriculture ’s advice against eating too much fat was issued in 1980 and would later be incorporated in its “ food pyramid . ”
Serious question - is Steve Schmidt running the worst campaign ever :
David Axelrod was surrounded by a pack of camera - toting , mike - wielding , pushing - and - shoving media types , one of whom asked whether his man Barack Obama had been “ too nice ” in the just - completed debate with John McCain .
“ I do n’t think he was too nice .
. . .
There were clear differences .
. . .
He made a very strong case , absolutely , ” the onetime newspaperman said in his meandering style .
Twenty feet away , McCain operative Steve Schmidt was robotically hammering home a single number .
“ Senator Obama was right tonight when he said John McCain was right 11 times .
. . .
It was a home run for Senator McCain . . . .
The person who is losing the debate , the person who is on defense , is the person who says his opponent is right 11 times , ” the shaved - head strategist declared .
I do n’t know how much of the fail from the McCain campaign the last few months is is a clash between John McCain ’s erratic urges and lack of impulse control ( remember the aide who responded that the reason they were in Colombia during an election cycle was because McCain wanted to be in Colombia , andwhat McCain wants , McCain gets ) and Schmidt ’s style , but this is terrible .
Let me explain some more - by every account , Schmidt is an on message kind of guy , and just likes to find one thing and drill it until it is dead .
The problem is that when you have a campaign that operates like that , you can not have John McCain running out and shifting the message every few days .
For example , it was taunts of “ celebrity , celebrity , celebrity , ” then McCain goes on the View and SNL and pictures of him boating in the Mediterranean with Anne Hathaway appear and so on .
Then the most important thing ever was “ experience experience experience , ” and McCain picks Palin .
He continuously asserts the economy is strong , then the next day this is the worst crisis ever .
Today is just the latest installment .
Spend weeks talking about bi-partisanship , spend weeks saying how McCain can work across party lines , jab Obama during the debates because he is so liberal he can not work with Republicans , spend the week saying the financial crisis needs a bi-partisan solution , and then your idiot campaign manager and ad team want to pretend that agreeing with the opposing candidate is bad .
And so on .
They drive their point home as if it is the most important thing ever , make sure everyone knows what their point is ( Schmidt is not subtle ) , then the next day they pull the rug out and something else is the new most important thing ever .
The cumulative effect of all of this is to create a staggering level of incoherence , and it is rational to think these guys are insane or full of shit or unstable , or maybe all three .
Add to it the foolish jihad against the media , and you have the current disaster .
An offline phase that extracts " signals " from a massive web crawl and usage data .
An example of such a signal is page rank .
These computations need to be done offline because they analyze massive amounts of data and are time - consuming .
Because these signals are extracted offline , and not in response to user queries , these signals are necessarily query - independent .
You can think of them tags on the documents in the index .
There are about 200 such signals .
An online phase , in response to a user query .
A subset of documents is identified based on the presence of the user 's keywords .
Then , these documents are ranked by a very fast algorithm that combines the 200 signals in - memory using a proprietary formula .
Mediocristan , consisting of phenomena that fit the bell curve model , such as games of chance , height and weight in humans , and so on .
Here future observations can be predicted by extrapolating from variations in statistics based on past observation ( for example , sample means and standard deviations ) .
Extremistan , consisting of phenomena that do n't fit the bell curve model , such as the search queries , the stock market , the length of wars , and so on .
Sometimes such phenomena can sometimes be modeled using power laws or fractal distributions , and sometimes not .
In many cases , the very notion of a standard deviation is meaningless .
A couple of days ago I had coffee with Peter Norvig .
Peter is currently Director of Research at Google .
For several years until recently , he was the Director of Search Quality -- the key man at Google responsible for the quality of their search results .
Peter also is an ACM Fellow and co-author of the best - selling AI textbook Artificial Intelligence : A Modern Approach .
As such , Peter 's insights into search are truly extraordinary .
I have known Peter since 1996 , when he joined a startup called Junglee , which I had started together with some friends from Stanford .
Peter was Chief Scientist at Junglee until 1998 , when Junglee was acquired by Amazon.com .
I 've always been a great admirer of Peter and have kept in touch with him through his short stint at NASA and then at Google .
He 's now taking a short leave of absence from Google to update his AI textbook .
We had a fascinating discussion , and I 'll be writing a couple of posts on topics we covered .
It has long been known that Google 's search algorithm actually works at 2 levels :
The online , query - dependent phase appears to be made - to - order for machine learning algorithms .
Tons of training data ( both from usage and from the armies of " raters " employed by Google ) , and a manageable number of signals ( 200 ) -- these fit the supervised learning paradigm well , bringing into play an array of ML algorithms from simple regression methods to Support Vector Machines .
And indeed , Google has tried methods such as these .
Peter tells me that their best machine - learned model is now as good as , and sometimes better than , the hand - tuned formula on the results quality metrics that Google uses .
The big surprise is that Google still uses the manually - crafted formula for its search results .
They have n't cut over to the machine learned model yet .
Peter suggests two reasons for this .
The first is hubris : the human experts who created the algorithm believe they can do better than a machine - learned model .
The second reason is more interesting .
Google 's search team worries that machine - learned models may be susceptible to catastrophic errors on searches that look very different from the training data .
They believe the manually crafted model is less susceptible to such catastrophic errors on unforeseen query types .
This raises a fundamental philosophical question .
If Google is unwilling to trust machine - learned models for ranking search results , can we ever trust such models for more critical things , such as flying an airplane , driving a car , or algorithmic stock market trading ?
All machine learning models assume that the situations they encounter in use will be similar to their training data .
This , however , exposes them to the well - known problem of induction in logic .
The classic example is the Black Swan , popularized by Nassim Taleb 's eponymous book .
Before the 17th century , the only swans encountered in the Western world were white .
Thus , it was reasonable to conclude that " all swans are white . "
Of course , when Australia was discovered , so were the black swans living there .
Thus , a black swan is a shorthand for something unexpected that is outside the model .
Taleb argues that black swans are more common than commonly assumed in the modern world .
He divides phenomena into two classes : Taleb makes a convincing case that most real - world phenomena we care about actually inhabit Extremistan rather than Mediocristan .
In these cases , you can make quite a fool of yourself by assuming that the future looks like the past .
The current generation of machine learning algorithms can work well in Mediocristan but not in Extremistan .
The very metrics these algorithms use , such as precision , recall , and root - mean square error ( RMSE ) , make sense only in Mediocristan .
It 's easy to fit the observed data and fail catastrophically on unseen data .
My hunch is that humans have evolved to use decision - making methods that are less likely blow up on unforeseen events ( although not always , as the mortgage crisis shows ) .
I 'll leave it as an exercise to the interested graduate student to figure out whether new machine learning algorithms can be devised that work well in Extremistan , or prove that it can not be done .
The class - action lawsuit that a former Apple network engineer filed last Monday has put tech workers ' relationship with the Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) into the spotlight .
Many IT pros are watching the case with interest since it boils down to a pocketbook issue : compensation for overtime .

IT Workers of the World : Are They Uniting
At issue : are networking professionals — network engineers , network administrators and network support staff — covered by the FLSA ?
The plaintiffs contend that Apple misclassified them as exempt from the FLSA so that the company would not have to pay them for overtime .
Apple will have to prove that these workers are in fact exempt by demonstrating that their jobs require independent judgment and discretion , and that they 're not simply carrying out repeatable tasks , says Jahan Sagafi , a partner with Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein , the law firm that represented IBM workers in their class action lawsuit against Big Blue in 2006 .
( The case was settled for $ 65 million in 2007 .
It was the biggest settlement of such a suit to date . )
[ Editor 's Note : A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the case was settled in 2006 . ]
It 's not uncommon for employers to err on the side of classifying employees as exempt , says Sagafi , who worked on the IBM suit .
In fact , the dirty little secret among employers and HR departments is that classifying employees as exempt — even if it means breaking the law — is in their best interest provided , of course , that they do n't get caught , says Sagafi :
" In a sense , they may see it as economically viable for them to skirt the law and wait to see if they get sued because the exposure is not that huge [ if they do n't get sued ] , " Sagafi says .
" If they can settle [ a complaint ] for less than 100 percent of what they owe people [ for overtime ] , they 've gotten away with a good deal . "
White collar workers like IT professionals can make sure they 're not being cheated out of overtime pay if they smarten up about the FLSA .
If you work in IT , here 's what you need to know about the Federal Fair Labor Standards
Act to make sure you get the compensation and treatment that you deserve under the law .
1 . The FLSA is a weak law .
The U.S. Department of Labor does n't have the resources to enforce the FLSA , so it leaves compliance up to employers , says Sagafi .
Classifying employees properly is the employer 's responsibility .
As a result , it does n't always happen , and the only time employers ' actions get tested is when an employee files a complaint with the Labor Department , a state agency , or an attorney .
2. Employers have little incentive to classify salaried employees properly .
Since employers know the law is n't highly enforced , they may be tempted to err on the side of classifying white collar workers as exempt so that they do n't have to follow the FLSA 's requirements , says Sagafi .
" The advantage to a company of classifying somebody as exempt is that the company can make the employee work as much as it wants , and the employee 's only remedy is to ask for more money , quit or sue for back wages , " says the attorney .
3 . There are five different kinds of exemptions .
The five different kinds of exemption from the FLSA are the administrative exemption , the computer professionals exemption , the executive exemption , the professional exemption and the highly compensated exemption .
The professionals who fall into any one of those five exemptions are not covered by the FLSA .
( To be exempt from the FLSA means that you 're not covered by that law .
To be nonexempt means that you are covered by the law and therefore are eligible for overtime pay and for other protections . )
The administrative exemption is the most complicated , says Sagafi .
" It hinges on whether the employee ' exercises independent judgment and discretion with respect to matters of significance ' for the company , " he says , quoting the law .
In other words , if a professional exercises his or her own judgment , creativity , vision , leadership and autonomy in performing his or her job duties in a core area of the business , he or she is likely to be exempt under the administrative exemption .
" If you do n't exercise independent judgment , if you perform rote , repetitive tasks in accordance with guidelines , protocols , checklists or established procedures , you 're not likely to be exempt under the administrative exemption because you 're not exercising discretion .
You 're just following the rules , " adds Sagafi .
The computer professionals exemption mainly applies to computer systems analysts , computer programmers , software engineers and software developers whose primary duties consist of some combination of design , development , documentation , analysis , creation , testing or modification of computer systems and programs , and who earn at least $ 455 per week on a salaried basis .
It does not pertain to help desk workers or to employees involved in the manufacture or repair of computer hardware .
The executive exemption pertains to employees involved in managing the entire company or a department or division of the company , who manage at least two people , have the authority to hire , fire and promote employees , and who earn at least $ 455 per week on a salaried basis .
The professional exemption applies to " learned " professionals ( e.g. doctors and lawyers ) and to creative professionals ( e.g. graphic designers , copy writers . )
Finally , if you earn $ 100,00 a year or more , you 're exempt from the FLSA under the highly compensated exemption .
Sagafi says that Apple will have to prove that network engineers fall into either the administrative exemption or the computer professionals exemption in order to counter the plaintiffs ' claim that they should have received overtime .
4 . Your title is irrelevant legally .
Sagafi notes that the job title of " network engineer , " which is at issue in the Apple case , is irrelevant when it comes to determining whether or not an employee is exempt from the FLSA , since job titles can be overblown .
" Companies like to give fancy titles to employees because it's a costless way for them to make their employees feel valued , and it has a corollary benefit of making employees sound like they fit an exemption if the employer has an eye to getting sued , " says Sagafi .
5 . What matters is how you perform your work .
Sagafi acknowledges that IT professionals are highly skilled and possess specialized knowledge , but he says , that has little bearing on whether or not they fall into an exemption .
" What matters is whether they have autonomy and discretion , " he says .
" We 've found in these cases that there are established protocols and pathways and instructions and guidelines and ways of doing things that they have to follow time and time again . "
Sagafi points to the work IT professionals have to do to update virus protection software or to diagnose problems with routers as examples of rote , repeatable tasks that do n't involve a lot of personal judgment .
" You get an alert from a third party software vendor , and you know what the steps are [ to install those updates ] because you did it last week .
There 's a right way to do it and not a lot of choice in the matter , " he says .
" Or , if there 's an error showing up on the monitoring software with respect to a router , you know you have to check 11 different aspects of the router and when you find the thing that is wrong with the router , you fix it , and there 's only one fix and there 's not much choice in the matter . "
6 . If you 're going to sue , file a class action suit .
It 's hard for individuals and small groups to win these kinds of overtime cases , Sagafi says , because the FLSA is so complicated and because it consequently takes so much time and money for the attorneys to prove the employer 's liability .
A class action suit , he says , gives the plaintiffs the strength in numbers and the lawyers the economies of scale that they need to prove their case .

Most important , at a time when Fox , MSNBC and CNN routinely mix news and entertainment , larding their 24 - hour schedules with bloviation fests and marathon coverage of sexual predators and dead celebrities , it ’s been “ The Daily Show ” that has tenaciously tracked big , “ super depressing ” issues like the cherry - picking of prewar intelligence , the politicization of the Department of Justice and the efforts of the Bush White House to augment its executive power .
For that matter , the Comedy Central program  which is not above using silly sight gags and sophomoric sex jokes to get a laugh  has earned a devoted following that regards the broadcast as both the smartest , funniest show on television and a provocative and substantive source of news .
“ The Daily Show ” resonates not only because it is wickedly funny but also because its keen sense of the absurd is perfectly attuned to an era in which cognitive dissonance has become a national epidemic .
Indeed , Mr. Stewart ’s frequent exclamation “ Are you insane ? ! ” seems a fitting refrain for a post - M * A * S*H , post - “ Catch - 22 ” reality , where the surreal and outrageous have become commonplace  an era kicked off by the wacko 2000 election standoff in Florida , rocked by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and haunted by the fallout of a costly war waged on the premise of weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
MR. STEWART describes his job as “ throwing spitballs ” from the back of the room and points out that “ The Daily Show ” mandate is to entertain , not inform .
Still , he and his writers have energetically tackled the big issues of the day  “ the stuff we find most interesting , ” as he said in an interview at the show ’s Midtown Manhattan offices , the stuff that gives them the most “ agita , ” the sometimes somber stories he refers to as his “ morning cup of sadness . ”
And they ’ve done so in ways that straight news programs cannot : speaking truth to power in blunt , sometimes profane language , while using satire and playful looniness to ensure that their political analysis never becomes solemn or pretentious .
“ Hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill , ” Mr. Stewart , 45 , said .
“ In some respects , the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most  you know , the difference between potential and kinetic energy ?
 they have the most potential energy , so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion , the most interest .
I do n’t mean for the audience .
I mean for us .
Everyone here is working too hard to do stuff we do n’t care about . ”
Offices for “ The Daily Show ” occupy a sprawling loftlike space that combines the energy of a newsroom with the laid - back vibe of an Internet start - up : many staff members wear jeans and flip - flops , and two amiable dogs wander the hallways .
The day begins with a morning meeting where material harvested from 15 TiVos and even more newspapers , magazines and Web sites is reviewed .
That meeting , Mr. Stewart said , “ would be very unpleasant for most people to watch : it ’s really a gathering of curmudgeons expressing frustration and upset , and the rest of the day is spent trying to mask or repress that through whatever creative devices we can find . ”
Utter the name Joyce McKinney to Britons of a certain age , and you are inevitably rewarded with the briefest flash of incomprehension , followed by a gasp as their memories take them tumbling back to the dark days of early autumn , 1977 .
It was a miserable time : there were clashes on the picket line at Grunwick , inflation was sprinting away at 13 % , Elvis had just died and a band called Baccara were at Number One with Yes Sir , I Can Boogie .
And then , as if to lift the spirits of a nation , along came the most unlikely , the most baffling , the most downright weird news story .
A Mormon missionary from Utah called Kirk Anderson , who was going door - to - door in Ewell , Surrey , was kidnapped at gunpoint by McKinney , a former cheerleader and beauty queen from North Carolina .
With the help of a friend , Keith May , McKinney drugged Anderson with chloroform and drove him to a rented 17th century cottage near Okehampton , Devon .
There the unfortunate young man was chained , spreadeagled , to a bed , with several pairs of mink - lined handcuffs , and over the next few days he was repeatedly required to have sex with McKinney , who later explained that she had been keen to bear his child .
Eventually the missionary wriggled free , dashed from the cottage and alerted police , who set up roadblocks around Okehampton , capturing both beauty queen and friend .
The pair were charged with false imprisonment and possession of an imitation .38 revolver , and brought before Epsom magistrates .
McKinney explained at the commital proceedings that she had fallen head over heels for Anderson when they were at college together in Utah , adding : " I loved him so much that I would ski naked down Mount Everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to . "
She had hired a private detective , tracked Anderson down and came to Britain with May .
Tabloid dream
It was a tabloid dream .
Mormon Sex Slave Case , screeched the Daily Mail .
McKinney and the Manacled Mormon , yelled the Mirror .
Even the Guardian got in on the act with the only - slightly more coy : Missionary was " shackled for sex " .
McKinney 's counsel told the magistrates that " methinks the Mormon do protest too much " .
McKinney was remanded in custody at Holloway prison , north London , pending the full trial but released on bail three months later because of her failing mental health .
May was also bailed and at this point they fled to Canada disguised asmime artists .
And that , perhaps , should have been the end of the matter .
But then last Tuesday , courtesy of the Associated Press news agency , came the delightful story of one " Bernann " McKinney , whose pet dog Booger the pit bull terrier had been successfully cloned by a team of South Korean scientists .
Announcing that she planned to give her identical pets the names Booger McKinney , Booger Lee , Booger Ra , Booger Hong and Booger Park , in honour of the team at Seoul National University that carried out the work , a delighted McKinney could be seen beaming from several news websites and newspapers , including the Guardian .
And some of a certain age beamed back , thinking : " Ohmygawd ! "
A simple check of public records in North Carolina yesterday confirmed that Joyce and " Bernann " are , indeed , one and the same person , and that the predatory beauty queen of 1977 has matured into the pit bull - loving 57 - year - old of 2008 .
The years have not been particularly kind to McKinney .
She has put on a little weight ( have n't we all ? ) and has used a wheelchair for more than a decade .
After crossing the border from Canada she travelled to Atlanta , Georgia , where she went into hiding , disguised as a nun , according to some accounts .
Then she returned to the tiny town of Minneapolis on the North Carolina - Tennessee border , where her parents had been schoolteachers , and moved on to her late grandparents ' wooden farmhouse .
There were to be a few more scrapes with the law .
In 1984 she was arrested after Anderson spotted her loitering near his place of work in Salt Lake City .
When the police searched the boot of her car they found a length of rope and a pair of handcuffs , but charges against her were dropped after she once again jumped bail .
In 1993 she broke into a dog pound in Johnson City , Tennessee , to rescue a pit bull terrier that was about to be put down for mauling a couple of joggers .
This raises the possibility that the Booger brothers , so skillfully cloned in Seoul , are exact replicas of a dog that once faced the death penalty because of its attacks on humans .
But , as McKinney explained after the break - in : " I love those pit bulls .
They 're such sympathetic animals - they 're my kind of dog . "
Lawless
Minneapolis is in the heart of the southern Appalachians , the tough and somewhat lawless mountainous region that was the setting for the Burt Reynolds film Deliverance .
Even here , however , some men say they are wary of her , and caution visitors not to stray on to her land , warning that they could be attacked by her pit bulls .
Anderson himself married after returning to Utah , and found work as a travel agent in the small town of Orem .
And by and large , McKinney has also led a blameless life over the past three decades .
She could not be contacted for comment yesterday , but when a British reporter tracked her down and spoke to her nine years ago she said : " Now everybody understands , and they know what it means to have the paparazzi chasing around after you .
I cried all night when Diana died .
I may be just an ol ' farm girl , but I 've hit that wall with her .
Everywhere I go , people will always remember me as a woman who did the unthinkable .
Just try to imagine what that feels like . "
In theory , however , McKinney remains a fugitive from British justice , and after breaking her cover to hail the success of the scientists in Soeul , could face extradition to stand trial back at Epsom .
Is this possible ?
We asked Scotland Yard .
The young woman - clearly too young - who answered the call , listened patiently for a few minutes .
" I 'm sorry , " she said finally .
" I have n't a clue what you 're talking about . "
Extra , extra !

Linux priced out of the market by vendors conspiring with monopoly !
Nice headline , huh ?
If only it were n't true .
What you see below is a current ad from an educational IT suppliers bruchure .
It features the new Acer Aspire One netbook in both Windows XP and Linux incarnations .
What 's odd about it ?
The lower spec machine with the free operating system costs half again as much as the higher spec one running Windows .
How can this happen ?
Well , here in Victoria the state government has done a deal with Microsoft , which as I understand it essentially means all state schools get their copies of Windows paid for by DEECD .
So if a public school buys a higher spec netbook with Windows XP , they get a $ 156 discount from the government .
If they buy a lower spec one netbook with Linux they do not .
I 'm sure Microsoft are extremely happy that it 's so unattractive to invest in Linux .
Why would any sane person pay so much more for a lesser product , instead of buying the cheaper one on which you can install Linux yourself later anyway ?
But if you go that route , Microsoft still collect their license fee from the state government .

Author James
Moore was told by an airline his name matched a name on the government 's terror watch list .
( CNN ) --
Four years ago , author James Moore released his latest book critical of President Bush .
" Bush 's War for Re-election " was released in fall 2004 and raised questions about the president 's service in the National Guard during the Vietnam War .
The issue of Bush 's service became a campaign issue during the 2004 presidential election .
Months later , on his first airline flight since the election , James Moore was told by the airline he was flying that his name matched a name on the government 's terrorist watch list .
Airline passengers whose names match those on the watch list must provide additional information at airline ticket counters before being allowed to obtain a boarding pass .
" Traveling became very complicated , " Moore said .
Since the name " James Moore " was added to the list in January 2005 , Moore says , he must arrive at airports hours before his flight and is prevented from checking in electronically at home or at the airport .
Depending on the level of scrutiny , he says he can actually spend several hours trying to obtain clearance before being allowed to fly .
Watch Moore talk about being on the watch list »
According to the ACLU , the name James Moore is one of a million names and aliases that have a match on the so - called terror watch list .
The FBI manages the Terrorist Screening Database , designed to prevent potential terrorists from boarding flights .
An FBI spokesperson sent a statement to CNN saying that in several government audits , there 's been " no suggestion " that anyone has been placed on the watch list for political reasons .
" Nominations to the watch list are handled and reviewed by non-political , career intelligence and law enforcement officials who make their determinations solely on the basis of the available information and whether there is a reasonable suspicion to believe the individual is involved in terrorism . "
The FBI would not provide any information on a suspected terrorist who uses the name James Moore .
The author James Moore says he has no proof politics placed him on the list , but he is very skeptical that there is any good reason the name James Moore is on anyone 's terrorist watch list .
iReport.com :
Do you think your name is on a watch list ?
" I 'm stuck with everyone else on this list , wondering , am I someone 's political enemy or do I live in a country where the government is just utterly and completely incompetent ? " he says .
" And neither one of those are pleasant thoughts . "
U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas has asked the Department of Homeland Security to investigate allegations individuals are being placed on the terrorist watch list for political reasons .
The Department of Homeland Security is expected to respond to the allegations this month .
In the meantime , Moore says he is choosing to fly much less to avoid the hassle of traveling with an alleged terrorist name .

The Sony Video Store on the PlayStation Network is filled with a good selection of movies , and you can't beat the convenience of renting or even buying movies from your couch and watching them on your big screen with your PlayStation 3 .
Renting movies is a joy on the system , although it would be nice to have longer than 24 hours to watch the content , but what happens when you buy a movie ?
As one Ars reader found out , and Sony confirmed for us , you have to be careful about what happens to your system once it 's filled with video content : you have one download , one redownload , and that 's it .
Noise , a forum - goer , sent out a warning after he deleted some video content to make room on his hard drive and then found he could n't redownload the content .
The PlayStation 3 support page is perfectly clear on this matter .
" Purchased content can be downloaded to a single PLAYSTATION 3 or a single PSP system , " it reads .
" Content cannot be redownloaded once it has been downloaded to either a PLAYSTATION 3 or PSP system . "
You 're allowed to keep the content on one system , and you can move it to up to three PSP systems , but if you have to delete the content for any reason , it 's gone ?
Sort of .
Lincoln Davis , who handles media relations for the PlayStation Network , told Ars that you are in fact allowed one extra download , but you have to contact Sony .
" If a consumer deletes a purchased movie from their PS3 , they will not be able to redownload the movie without assistance from SCEA 's consumer services , " he told Ars .
" Consumer service can issue a redownload as a one - time courtesy , as provided by our guidelines , for the title to allow the consumer to go back and download the movie from their PSN download list . "
That helps Noise , who can now get his content back — once — but it 's important that PS3 owners realize just how ephemeral the bought content is .
This is n't like the issue of Spore DRM where customer service seems to be willing to hand out new codes like they 're candy ;
Sony is very clear that you can only redownload your content once after it has been purchased .
When we 're discussing a system that seems to release new hardware configurations every few months and a company that actively encourages you to swap hard drives yourself , it appears users are going to run into problems if they ever decide they want to switch out their hard drive or even upgrade into a larger system ; the information on the back - up utility makes it clear that video content can't be moved over to new system , although new hard drives should be safe .
Sony claims that the PS3 is operating on a 10 - year timeline : is one extra download , which you need to contact customer service to apply for , good enough for the next decade ?
It 's hard to know if this limit is Sony 's doing , or if content providers have demanded this level of DRM on the movies sold through Sony 's online service .
Nonetheless , this could cause customers to be very cautious with their hardware or space managements ; no one would dare free up the space knowing that after the one redownload their purchase is gone forever .
It 's also unknown what will happen with these files when you purchase a PS4 — if you 'd like to look that far into the future .
Sony 's policy is a sobering reminder that DRM can turn your purchases into rentals at anytime , with Sony and the content providers tightly holding onto the key .
Huge numbers have already fled eastwards in recent weeks
The UN says 20,000 people have fled Pakistan 's tribal area of Bajaur for Afghanistan amid fighting between troops and militants in recent months .
The UN 's refugee agency says almost 4,000 families have crossed north - west into Afghanistan 's Kunar province .
The army began a sustained campaign against militants in Bajaur nearly two months ago .
Some 300,000 others have fled east within Pakistan in recent weeks with many of them living in temporary camps .
The military says it has killed more than 2,000 militants in the fighting .
Cross border attacks
The UN's High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) believes that the majority of the refugees who have fled into Afghanistan will return home after the fighting stops in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( Fata ) .
Announcing its estimates of the numbers of people who have crossed the border into Afghanistan , the UNHCR in Afghanistan said in the last two weeks alone , more than 600 families had left Pakistan for Kunar .
Villagers taking on the Taleban Displaced by ' war on terror ' A spokesman said the organisation would look out for the welfare of the displaced if they were unable to return home before winter sets in .
" It 's very difficult to predict the security situation on the other side of the border but what we hope is that the security gets better and people will be able to go back , " Nadir Farhad told Reuters news agency .
" But if it continues , we will definitely provide them with ... assistance ... so we can get them through the winter months . "
" They have mainly been provided accommodation by relatives and friends but some 200 families are already living without shelter " he said .
The UNHCR says around 70 % of the families are from Pakistan but the rest are Afghans who have been living in Pakistan .
In the past , Afghan refugees have crossed the border the other way , around four million escaping violence and seeking refuge in Pakistan in the 1980s and 1990s , but more than half have since returned to Afghanistan .
Recently the UNHCR asked donors for more than $ 17 m ( 39.4 m ) in aid to help about 250,000 people displaced by fighting and floods in north - western Pakistan .
They said money was needed to provide relief items like tents , blankets and plastic sheets .
Dangerous situation Pakistan 's army is engaged in a fierce campaign against militants in the north - west of the country .
Attempts by the government in Islamabad to negotiate with militants in areas along the border with Afghanistan appear to have failed , correspondents say .
The country has been hit by a spate of recent suicide bombings widely blamed on militants - including a devastating attack this month on the Marriott hotel in Islamabad .
The bombing killed more than 50 people , most of them Pakistanis .
Militants use the tribal areas as a base for operations in Pakistan and across the border in Afghanistan .
The Taleban and al - Qaeda are believed to operate in these border areas after being pushed out of Afghanistan .
Their presence in the border regions have prompted a number of US attacks inside Pakistan .
Those attacks have angered Pakistan 's government , and there have been incidents around the border involving Pakistani troops firing warning shots at US helicopters .

What are these ?
In keeping with Honey Week here at Eat .
Drink .
Better , I started looking at the various ways individuals can help combat Colony Collapse Syndrome .
One major impediment to the endeavor is that scientists are n’t really sure what ’s causing the disappearance of honeybees .
Theories range from viruses to environmental and agricultural causes .
What we do know is that bees are disappearing at an alarming rate and that this will affect us in profound and irrevocable ways .
One - third of the food we consume comes from pollinators .
Bees are responsible for pollinating almonds , apples , soft fruit , and berries among other crops .
Without them , we will lose more than honey ( a tragedy in its own right ! ) , we will lose a large portion of the biodiversity we now enjoy on our plates .
However , there are things we can do at home to help promote honeybees and their way of life .
Plant Sunflowers
Sunflowers are hardy and quick growing and bees are attracted to their bright colors .
By growing them , we can create a reliable food source .
Additionally , initiatives such as The Great Sunflower Project send sunflower seeds to designated growers who then observe honeybee activities around their grown flowers and report back .
Other plants that bees like : dandelions , lavender , blueberry , clover and echinacea .
Stop Spraying Pesticides
We all hate the bugs that make our gardens ugly and our skin itch , but these toxic brews are indiscriminate in the kinds of insects they affect .
While we do n’t know what is causing honeybee disappearance , surely the noxious chemicals that cloud our backyards are n’t helping .
Help Bees Find A Home
If you notice bees swarming , it means a colony is looking for a new hive .
Call a local beekeeper who can come and give the community some new digs .
If you ’d like to ensure a productive garden , you can even keep them for yourself .
There are many guides to amateur beekeeping , but The Backyard Beekeeper is a good bet .
Let Your Garden Go to Seed
When you harvest your produce – be it cherry tomatoes and lavender or an elaborate orchard – leave some fruits and vegetables on the plant to go to seed .
This allows the bees to stockpile food for the long winter , when they stay in their hives .
And of course , the most important thing you can do is help support honeybee research by donating to a charity or calling up your congressional representatives .
Now that we know , it ’s time to solve the problem .

Right after 1.0 got released , some people started to wonder how to easily stay up to date on bugfixes for this major release .
Back then I think it was James Bennett who told me to stay tuned for something on this front .
Today , Jacob Kaplan - Moss announced that Django 1.0 finally has its own maintenance branch in the repository .
This means mostly one thing for you according the release process documentation :
If you want to stay up to date with the latest fixes for the Django 1.0 release without getting some unexpected and perhaps not really welcome changes to the core , all you have to do is : :
$ svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/releases/1.0.X/
django-1.0 $ cd django - 1.0 $ svn up #
The latest bugfix - release just went live $ svn up
This way it should be easy to keep using your previous update process ( if you were running on trunk that is ) while having a solid base for your sites .

John McCain 's campaign earlier today emailed supporters a new minute - long video called " The One , "
which opens like a Hollywood trailer : " In 2008 , the world will be blessed , " giant letters promise .
" They will call him , The One . "
It then cuts to shots of Barack Obama at his most messianic : " We are the ones we have been waiting for " and the by - now standard photos of hundreds of thousands of cheering Germans .
The spot ends with footage of a bearded and robed Charlton Heston in " The Ten Commandments " parting the Red Sea .
In a week that has already seen the McCain campaign comparing Obama to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton , the new spot takes the , dare we say audacious , step of comparing Obama to the original celebrity .
On the campaign plane , McCain spokeswoman Nicolle Wallace defended the clip as just another harmless quip .
" There is an important role for humor in political campaigns , " she told reporters .
" I think all of us would slit our wrists if there was n't . "
She also said the spot had a serious purpose :
To buck up any McCain backers who may have been dispirited watching Obama dominate the news with his overseas trip and rally .
The hope is to " make sure they understand that Barack Obama , who stands in front of tens of thousands , is not anything to be intimidated by , " she said .
" We 're proud we 're showcasing our candidate surrounded by workers . "

Most of the small business owners I know work for themselves , and some others run a two or three person company .
From them , I learn that being small , often by choice , they are able to build an adaptable and adept business .
Many of them even have the revenue that match their bigger competitors that have a large amount of investment .
In term of investment , small business owners I know are all bootstrappers .
They start with almost nothing , and currently have a five , six , even seven digits annual sales .
Why small business has all it takes to be big business
By being small , they can close control their businesses , while keeping themselves ‘ off the radar ’ from possible lawsuits , tax problems , harsh competitions , etc .
Not that small businesses do n’t face those issues ;
It ’s more to the genetic feature of the small businesses themselves – small and nimble .
Small business requires a relatively low investment .
This enables you to own multiple small businesses – consider this a diversification and spreading - the - risk techniques .
But most important reason of all , by being small , you can closely control your business and avoid the bureaucracy of big companies .
How to be a big business by being small
There are actually two routes to have a big business by being small – own a single business or own a multiple small or micro business .
Own a single business
Starting a business and focus on it for a long time can make the business big .
You can stay in your business to control your business closely .
However , you must understand that all businesses have life cycle .
In difficult times , you have to thrive by finding a way to keep your business running under difficult situation , like today ’s recession , for example .
Own a multiple small or micro business
If you are adventurous , you can have multiple businesses to run .
Do n’t worry , although small businesses often requires thousands to tens of thousands of dollars to start , you can always have a bootstrapping business model .
You can have under 500 dollars business startups , and build as you go .
If you are good at delegating , you can actually run multiple business units that are not only bringing you multiple stream of revenue , but also a well - spread risk .
I mentioned about business life cycle – multiple businesses mean different life cycle , thus giving you a sense of safety net when one or two of your businesses went wrong .
Small Business that has big business require big performer
You might feel that I inclined to multiple small business model – I actually am .
Despite my inclination , whatever path you choose in your entrepreneurship journey , just make sure you are a big performer in order to succeed .
A big performer has all it takes to ace the small business competitions – guts , creativity , and resilience .
Starting up or running a small business requires the same personal effort needed to start or run the bigger counterparts .
Do you have all it takes to own a small business that is big business ?

The government has invoked the retroactive immunity provision of the recently - passed FISA Amendments
Act in a motion to end the ongoing lawsuits against telecoms charged with complicity in the National Security Agency 's controversial program of extrajudicial wiretapping .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , which is spearheading the litigation , promises to fight the immunity clause on constitutional grounds — and has given Ars Technica a sneak preview of the argument it plans to make .
The government 's motion to dismiss ( PDF ) , submitted to California district judge Vaughn Walker on Friday in anticipation of a hearing scheduled for December 2 , was accompanied by Attorney General Michael Mukasey 's public certification ( PDF ) that the defendant telecoms were immune from civil liability under the FISA Amendments Act .
Mukasey also filed a more detailed , classified certification in camera , providing the judge with the specific grounds for the assertion of immunity .
Five paths to immunity ...
There are 50 ways to leave your lover , but only five ways for a company to be entitled to immunity under the FISA Amendments Act .
Three are versions of " they provided assistance , but it was lawful under the statutes in effect at the time . "
Another is not to actually have provided any assistance .
The final , and most contentious , is the new form of retroactive amnesty provided by the law :
The attorney general can assert that the company provided assistance calculated to prevent a terrorist attack on the United States in the wake of 9/11 , pursuant to a written directive from a high administration official assuring them that the surveillance had been authorized by the president and determined to be legal .
Mukasey 's certification says only that one or more of these excuses applies to all the defendants in the consolidated wiretap litigation , asserting that the public disclosure of any more specific information about the grounds for immunity " would cause exceptional harm to the National Security of the United States . "
It 's therefore impossible to know which of the defendant telecoms provided assistance , or under what circumstances .
The attorney general also denied EFF 's contention that , in addition to narrowly targeted eavesdropping on suspected Al Qaeda affiliates , there was any broader program of " dragnet collection on the content of plaintiffs ' communications . "
Precisely what this latter contention means is unclear :
As Ars noted last week , there is some legal controversy over when , precisely , the " collection " of a communication takes place .
Therefore Mukasey 's denial could mean that , despite the evidence provided by AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein , there was no blanket interception of communications for keyword analysis .
But it could as easily mean that the attorney general does not believe that whatever form of " inside the box " analysis of those communications NSA conducted counts as " collection " for the purposes of FISA or the Fourth Amendment .
... and four arguments against it
Does that mean the corpulent contralto should start practicing her warm - up scales ?
Perhaps not : EFF attorney Cindy Cohn has a four - part constitutional harmony for Judge Walker to hear before he strikes the set .
In an interview with Ars Technica last week , she outlined the argument she plans to present .
Contra the government 's frequent assertions that the NSA 's " Terrorist Surveillance Program " was targeted only at communications that were either wholly international or " one-side - foreign , " Cohen plans to assert , on the basis of whistleblower Klein 's evidence and more recent press reports , that the NSA also broadly intercepted wholly domestic communications .
Though , as noted above , Mukasey appears to deny this , we do now know that the program first disclosed by the New York Times in 2005 , and scrutinized in congressional hearings , was only one component of a far broader spying effort , elements of which were apparently so controversial that high - ranking Justice Department officials threatened to resign if it was not halted .
The Supreme Court ruled in 1972 that domestic national security surveillance is subject to robust Fourth Amendment limitations , while the rules for foreign intelligence collection may be more lax .
Similarly , the group plans to argue that the scope of the surveillance conducted went beyond the bounds of the FISA Amendments
Act 's grant of amnesty for surveillance " designed to detect or prevent a terrorist attack , or activities in preparation for a terrorist attack , against the United States . "
Like the previous argument , this line of attack relies on a hybrid of constitutional and statutory claims .
Courts generally follow a policy of constitutional " avoidance " — meaning that if there are two ways to read a statute , and one of them would violate the Constitution , they 'll assume it was meant to be interpreted the other way .
Here , EFF wants to argue that a reading of the statute that covered all the NSA surveillance would be unconstitutionally broad , and so it must be more narrowly constructed .
One potential wrinkle here is that Judge Walker might well agree with this Fourth Amendment analysis as it applies to the government 's conduct , but reject the claim that it presents a barrier to civil immunity for the telecoms .
Cohn explained that EFF is also developing a separation of powers argument rooted in the discrete spheres of responsibility the Constitution assigns to Congress and the judiciary under Article I and Article III .
In effect , the group wants to claim that with the FISA Amendments
Act , which makes immunity hinge on presidential authorizations and attorney general certifications , the legislature has illegitimately usurped a judicial power — deciding the outcome of pending litigation — and assigned it to the executive branch .
This argument comes with a corollary due process claim :
To wit , the plaintiffs have a corresponding right to have their case decided by a judge , not by the President or Michael Mukasey .
Finally , Cohn told Ars , she will make an independent argument against the secrecy provisions of the FISA Amendments
Act , grounded in the traditional authority of courts to determine the disposition of their own records .
While there is nothing new about the practice of filing sealed in camera documents when classified activities are at issue , Cohn called the Act " unprecedented " in its grant of executive power to " gag the courts , " noting that if Judge Walker were to dismiss the lawsuit , he would be barred from explaining publicly precisely why he had dismissed it .
The EFF now has until October 16 to file a brief in opposition to the government 's motion to dismiss .
The government and the telecoms will have a chance to reply to that brief by November 5 , and then EFF will get an opportunity to respond to those filings by November 20 .
The final showdown is slated for the morning of December 2 .

Homosexual men still account for most new cases in Australia Rates of HIV infection in Australia have increased by almost 50 % in the past eight years , according to a report .
The latest figures show that Australia now has about 10,000 cases of Aids , while more than 27,000 people are infected with HIV .
Researchers say the rise has been fuelled by Australia 's mining boom .
They say wealthy miners and businessmen taking holidays overseas contract the virus through unprotected sex .
Upward trend ?
Although HIV / Aids figures in Australia are relatively low by international standards , researchers are worried that this is part of a disturbing upward trend .
Don Baxter , from the Australian Federation of Aids Organisations , says that although homosexual men account for most new cases , a growing number of heterosexuals have tested positive for HIV .
" It appears to be chiefly men who are holidaying in South East Asia and Papua New Guinea , and having unprotected sex with women who must have been positive , " he said .
" The risk of a major outbreak in the population is probably not high .
But again , we 'll have to monitor this situation very closely over the coming years . "
Campaigners say that miners who have cashed in on the resources boom in Western Australia and Queensland have been responsible for a marked increase in the number of new HIV infections .
Statistics have shown that even those in stable relationships can give in to temptation when they are away from their families in a foreign country with their workmates .
A heady cocktail of exotic tropical locations , plentiful supplies of alcohol and money has often led to unprotected sex in brothels - and the catastrophic consequences that can follow .
In Queensland , health officials in Cairns have said that a cluster of six middle - aged businessmen who had tested positive for HIV following trips to Papua New Guinea could be the beginning of a serious outbreak in the city .

Decorators modify functions .
Beginning with the basics , learn how to use decorators in a variety of ways .
Execute code when a function is parsed or called .
Conditionally call functions and transform inputs and outputs .
Write customizable decorators that accept arbitrary arguments .
And , if necessary , easily make sure your decorated function has the same signature as the original .
Decorators .
The shear mention of them brings fear to even the seasoned Python programmer .
Okay , maybe not .
But decorators , at least in this author 's opinion , have a weird syntax and inevitably complicated implementations that are especially foreign ( I think ) to many who have gotten used to the simplicity of Python .
1 The Basics Decorators modify functions .
More specifically , a decorator is a function that transforms another function .
When you use a decorator , Python passes the decorated function -- we 'll call this the target function -- to the decorator function , and replaces it with the result .
Without decorators , it would look something like this : # 's 1 def decorator_function ( target ) :
2 # Do something with the target function
3 target .
attribute = 1
4 return target
5
6 def target ( a , b ) :
7 return a + b
8
9 # This is what the decorator actually does
10 target = decorator_function ( target )
This code has the exact same functionality , but uses decorators .
Note that I can name my decorator function whatever I want .
Here , I 've chosen ' decorator_function ' : # 's 1 def decorator_function ( target ) :
2 # Do something with the target function
3 target .
attribute = 1
4 return target
5
6 # Here is the decorator , with the syntax ' @function_name '
7 @decorator_function
8 def target ( a , b ) :
9 return a + b
As you can see , you need to put the decorator function 's name , prefaced with a @ , on the line before the target function definition .
Python internally will transform the target by applying the decorator to it and replacing it with the returned value .
Both of the above examples will have the same results : # 's 1 >>> target ( 1 , 2 )
2 3
3 >>> target .
attribute
4 1
1.1 Does a decorator function have to return a function ?
No .
The decorator function can return absolutely anything , and Python will replace the target function with that return value .
For example , you could do something like this : # 's 1 def decorator_evil ( target ) :
2 return False
3
4 @decorator_evil
5 def target ( a , b ) :
6 return a + b
7
8 >>> target
9 False
10
11 >>> target ( 1 , 2 )
12 TypeError : ' bool ' object is not callable
This is really not something you want to be doing on a regular basis though -- I 'm pretty sure that a basic design principal is to not have functions randomly turning into other sorts of things .
It makes good sense to at least return some sort of callable .
2 Run-Time Transformations " But , " I hear you saying , " I thought decorators did more than that .
I want to do things at run-time , like conditionally calling the function and transforming the arguments and return value . "
Can decorators do these things ?
Yes .
Is that really something ' more ' than we talked about above ?
Not really .
It 's important here not to get bogged down in the details -- you already know all there is to know about decorators .
To do one of these more complex things , we 're really just adding some plain old Python to the mix .
2.1 The Wrapper Function Remember , your decorator function can return an arbitrary function .
We 'll call it the wrapper function , for reasons which will become clear in a second .
The trick here is to define the wrapper function inside the decorator function , giving it access to the decorator function 's variable scope , including the target function .
# 's 1 def decorator ( target ) :
2
3 def wrapper ( ) :
4 print ' Calling function " %s " ' % target .
__name__
5 return target ()
6
7 # Since the wrapper is replacing the target function , assigning an attribute to the target function wo n't do anything .
8 # We need to assign it to the * wrapper function * .
9 wrapper .
attribute = 1
10 return wrapper
11
12 @decorator
13 def target ( ) :
14 print ' I am the target function '
15
16 >>> target ()
17 Calling function " target "
18 I am the target function
19
20 >>> target .
attribute
21 1
As you can see , the wrapper function can do whatever it wants to the target function , including the simple case of returning the target 's return value .
But what happens to any arguments passed to the target function ?
2.2 Getting the Arguments Since the returned wrapper function replaces the target function , the wrapper function will receive the arguments intended for the target function .
Assuming you want your decorator to work for any target function , your wrapper function then should accept arbitrary non-keyword arguments and arbitrary keyword arguments , add , remove , or modify arguments if necessary , and pass the arguments to the target function .
# 's 1 def decorator ( target ) :
2
3 def wrapper ( * args , ** kwargs ) :
4 kwargs .
update ( { ' debug ' : True }) #
Edit the keyword arguments -- here , enable debug mode no matter what
5 print ' Calling function " %s " with arguments %s and keyword arguments %s ' % ( target .
__name__ , args , kwargs )
6 return target ( * args , ** kwargs )
7
8 wrapper .
attribute = 1
9 return wrapper
10
11 @decorator
12 def target ( a , b , debug = False ) :
13 if debug : print ' [ Debug ] I am the target function '
14 return a + b
15
16 >>> target ( 1 , 2 )
17 Calling function " target " with arguments ( 1 , 2 ) and keyword arguments { ' debug ' :
True }
18 [ Debug ]
I am the target function
19 3
20
21 >>> target .
attribute
22 1
Note
You can also apply a decorator to a class method .
If your decorator is always going to be used this way , and you need access to the current instance , your wrapper function can assume the first argument is always self : # 's 1 def wrapper ( self , * args , ** kwargs ) :
2 # Do something with ' self '
3 print self
4 return target ( self , * args , ** kwargs )
2.3 Summing It Up
So , we have a wrapper function that accepts arbitrary arguments defined inside our decorator function .
The wrapper function can call the target function if and when it wants , get the result , do something with it , and return whatever it wants .
Say I want certain function calls to require positive confirmation before they are executed , and then stringify the result of the function before returning it .
Note that the built - in function raw_input prints a message and then waits for a response from stdin .
# 's 1 def decorator ( target ) : # Python passes the target function to the decorator
2
3 def wrapper ( * args , ** kwargs ) :
4
5 choice = raw_input ( ' Are you sure you want to call the function " %s " ? ' % target .
__name__ )
6
7 if choice and choice [ 0 ] . lower ( ) == 'y ' :
8 # If input starts with a 'y ' , call the function with the arguments
9 result = target ( * args , ** kwargs )
10 return str ( result )
11
12 else :
13 print ' Call to %s cancelled ' % target .
__name__
14
15 return wrapper
16
17 @decorator
18 def target ( a , b ) :
19 return a + b
20
21 >>> test .
target ( 1 , 2 )
22 Are you sure you want to call the function " target " ?
n
23 Call to target cancelled
24
25 >>> test .
target ( 1 , 2 )
26 Are you sure you want to call the function " target " ? y

3 Dynamic Decorators
Sometimes you might want to customize behavior by passing arbitrary options to your decorator function .
A cursory look at decorator syntax suggests there 's no way to do that .
You could just abandon the decorator idea altogether , but you certainly do n't have to .
The solution is define your decorator function inside another function -- call it the options function .
Right before the target function definition , where you would normally list the decorator function ( prepended with an @ ) , call this options function ( prepended with an @ ) instead .
The options function then returns your decorator function , which Python will use as the passes the target function to as before .
3.1 Passing Options to the Decorator Your options function can accept any arguments you want it to .
Since the decorator function is defined inside the options function , the decorator function has access to any of the arguments passed to the options function .
# 's 1 def options ( value ) :
2
3 def decorator ( target ) :
4 # Do something with the target function
5 target .
attribute = value
6 return target
7 return decorator
8
9 @options ( ' value ' )
10 def target ( a , b ) :
11 return a + b
12
13 >>> target ( 1 , 2 )
14 3
15
16 >>> target .
attribute
17 ' value '
As you can see , nothing here about the decorator syntax itself has changed .
Our decorator function is just in a dynamic scope instead of a static one .
3.2 Run-Time Tranformations
You can do Run-time Transformations by returning a wrapper function from your decorator function , just like before .
For better or worse , though , there now must be three levels of functions : # 's 1 def options ( debug_level ) :
2
3 def decorator ( target ) :
4
5 def wrapper ( * args , ** kwargs ) :
6 kwargs .
update ( { ' debug_level ' : debug_level }) #
Edit the keyword arguments
7 # here , set debug level to whatever specified in the options
8
9 print ' Calling function " %s " with arguments %s and keyword arguments %s ' % ( target .
__name__ , args , kwargs )
10 return target ( * args , ** kwargs )
11
12 return wrapper
13
14 return decorator
15
16 @options ( 5 )
17 def target ( a , b , debug_level = 0 ) :
18 if debug_level : print '[ Debug Level %s ] I am the target function ' % debug_level
19 return a + b
20
21 >>> target ( 1 , 2 )
22 Calling function " target " with arguments ( 1 , 2 ) and keyword arguments { ' debug_level ' : 5 }
23 [ Debug Level 5 ]
I am the target function
24 3
4 Caveat : Function Signatures
Phew .
Understand everything you can do with decorators now ?
Good :) .
However , there is one drawback that must be mentioned .
The function returned from the decorator function -- usually a wrapper function -- replaces the target function completely .
Any later introspection into what appears to be the target function will actually be into the wrapper function .
Most of the time , this is okay .
Generally you just call a function with some options .
Your program does n't check to see what the function 's __name__ or what arguments it accepts .
So usually this problem wo n't be a problem .
However sometimes you care if the function you are calling supports a certain option , supports arbitrary options , or , perhaps , what its __name__ is .
Or maybe you are interested in one if the function 's attributes .
If you look at a function that has been decorated , you will actually be looking at the wrapper function .
In the example below , note that the getargspec function of the inspect module gets the names and default values of a function 's arguments .
# 's 1 # This function is the same as the function ' target ' , except for the name
2 def standalone_function ( a , b ) :
3 return a + b
4
5 def decorator ( target ) :
6
7 def wrapper ( * args , ** kwargs ) :
8 return target ()
9
10 return wrapper
11
12 @decorator
13 def target ( a , b ) :
14 return a + b
15
16 >>> from inspect import getargspec
17
18 >>> standalone_function .
__name__
19 ' standalone_function '
20
21 >>> getargspec ( standalone_function )
22 ( [ 'a ' , ' b ' ] , None , None , None )
23
24 >>> target .
__name__
25 ' wrapper '
26
27 >>> getargspec ( target )
28 ( [ ] , ' args ' , ' kwargs ' , None )
As you can see , the wrapper function reports that it accepts different arguments than the original target function Its call signature has changed .
4.1 A Solution
This is not an easy problem to solve .
The update_wrapper method of the functools module provides a partial solution , copying the __name__ and other attributes from one function to another .
But it does not solve what might be the largest problem of all : the changed call signature .
The decorator function of the decorator module provides the best solution : it can wrap your wrapper function in a dynamically - evaluated function with the correct arguments , restoring the original call signature .
Similar to the update_wrapper function , it can also update your wrapper function with the __name__ and other attributes from the target function .
Note
For the remainder of this section , when I speak of the decorator function , I mean the one from this module , not one of the decorator functions that we 've been using to transform our target functions .
Another way to create decorators
Unfortunately , though , the decorator function was n't written with this use in mind .
Instead it was written to turn standalone wrapper functions into full - fledged decorators , without having to worry about the function nesting described in Run - Time Transformations , above .
While this technique is often useful , it is much less customizable .
Everything must be done at run-time , each time the function is executed .
You cannot do any work when the target function is defined , including assigning the target or wrapper functions attributes or passing options to the decorator .
Also , in this author 's opinion it is a bit of a black box ; I 'd rather know what my decorators are doing even if it is a little messier .
But we can make it work for us to solve this problem .
Ideally you would just call decorator ( wrapper ) and be done with it .
However , things are never as simple as we 'd like .
As described above , the decorator function wraps the function passed to it -- our wrapper function -- in a dynamic function to fix the signature .
But we still have a few problems : Problem # 1 : The dynamic function calls our wrapper function with ( func , *args , ** kwargs ) Solution # 1 :
Make our wrapper function accept ( func , * args , ** kwargs ) instead of just ( * args , ** kwargs ) .
Problem # 2 : The dynamic function is then wrapped in another function that expects to be used as an actual decorator -- it expects to be called with the target function , and will return the wrapper function .
Solution # 2 : Call decorator 's return value with the target function to get back to the dynamic function , which has the right signature .
This technique is a bit of a hack , and is a bit hard to explain , but it is easy to implement and works well .
This is the same example as before , but now with the decorator function ( and a name change so things do n't get too confusing ) : # 's 1 from decorator import decorator
2
3 def my_decorator ( target ) :
4
5 def wrapper ( target , * args , ** kwargs ) : # the target function has been prepended to the list of arguments
6 return target ( * args , ** kwargs )
7
8 # We are calling the returned value with the target function to get a ' proper ' wrapper function back
9 return decorator ( wrapper ) ( target )
10
11
12 @my_decorator
13 def target ( a , b ) :
14 return a + b
15
16 >>> from inspect import getargspec
17
18 >>> target .
__name__
19 ' target '
20
21 >>> getargspec ( target )
22 ( [ 'a ' , ' b ' ] , None , None , None )
5 Putting it All Together Sometimes , you really need a customizable decorator that does work both at parse - time and run-time , and has the signature of the original target function .
Here 's an example that ties everything together .
Expanding on the example from earlier , say you want certain function calls to require positive confirmation before they are executed , and you want to be able to customize the confirmation string for each target function .
Furthermore , for some reason , you need the decorated function 's signature to match the target function .
Here we go : # 's 1 from decorator import decorator
2
3 # The ' options ' function .
Recieves options and returns a decorator .
4 def confirm ( text ) :
5 '''
6 Pass a string to be sent as a confirmation message .
Returns a decorator .
7 '''
8
9 # The actual decorator .
Recieves the target function .
10 def my_decorator ( target ) :
11 # Anything not in the wrapper function is done when the target function is initially parsed
12
13 # This is okay because the decorator function will copy the attribute to the wrapper function
14 target .
attribute = 1
15
16 # The wrapper function .
Replaces the target function and receives its arguments
17 def wrapper ( target , * args , ** kwargs ) :
18 # You could do something with the args or kwargs here
19
20 choice = raw_input ( text )
21
22 if choice and choice [ 0 ] . lower ( ) == 'y ' :
23 # If input starts with a 'y ' , call the function with the arguments
24 result = target ( * args , ** kwargs )
25 # You could do something with the result here
26 return result
27
28 else :
29 print ' Call to %s cancelled ' % target .
__name__
30
31 # Fix the wrapper 's call signature
32 return decorator ( wrapper ) ( target )
33
34 return my_decorator
35
36 @confirm ( ' Are you sure you want to add these numbers ? ' )
37 def target ( a , b ) :
38 return a + b
39
40 >>>
Are you sure you want to add these numbers ?
yes

Hey , what do you know , it actually works .
Posted By : Stonecipher
Sept. 9 , 2008
One of the few things we ’ve learned about Governor Sarah Palin in the last week and a half is that she is very fond of running around telling people that she told Congress " thanks , but no thanks " in regards to Alaska ’s infamous bridge to nowhere .
While this claim is completely disingenuous at best , it happens to be pretty much the only ammunition the half - term governor has at this point and the media has happily repeated the line over and over and over and over and over .
It ’s getting annoying .
And it is time for America to stand up and say " thanks , but no thanks " to Sarah Palin .
Almost two weeks after Governor Palin was announced as the Republican Vice Presidential nominee we have yet to see her answer a single question from the press .
Not from the networks , not from the cable news shows , not from the Anchorage Daily News and not even from the mighty Wasilla , Mat - Su Valley Fronteirsman of Palin ’s hometown .
The reason for this media blackout given by the McCain Campaign ?
They refuse to let her be questioned by the media until they are confident the media will treat her with " respect and deference . "
Those are words from McCain campaign manager Rick Davis appearing on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace .
Respect and Deference .
You nominate a woman Mr. Davis , who most of the country has never even heard of , to be Vice President of the United States - one heartbeat away from the Presidency - one 72 - year old , John McCain heartbeat away - and you wo n’t let her speak with the media until she is treated with respect and deference ?
What ’s wrong with you ?
Did Barack Obama get any respect and deference during his primary run ?
Was it respectful of FOX News to report a completely fictional story , based on an email , that Obama attended a Muslim Madrasah in Jakarta as a child ?
Did the media show deference when , before voting even began in the primaries , they openly questioned whether or not Obama was " black enough " while simultaneously pointing out that he may in fact be " too black " to win the presidency ?
Was it respectful , Mr. Davis , when you and your campaign released an absolutely despicable ad which falsely claims that Barack Obama wanted to teach sex ed. to kindergartners when , in fact , the bill in question was designed to protect small children from sexual predators ?
Was it deference you were showing Mr. Davis , when you ran an ad comparing Barack Obama to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton ?
And now Mr. Davis , after all of the slams against Barack Obama for his " lack of experience " , you nominate a half - term governor of the 47th largest state in the nation , who was mayor of a town of 5,000 just three years ago , who admittedly has n’t thought too much about Iraq , and you expect the media to lay off and take it easy on her ?
Give me a break Mr. Davis .
Barack Obama did not have the luxury of waiting for the media to show him respect and deference .
If she wants to be Vice President and play on the national stage she needs to be ready for some hardball .
The majority of the American people know nothing about what this woman believes in and you are asking them to elect her to the second highest office in the country .
That , my friend , is not showing any respect or deference what - so - ever for the American people .
As it appears right now , Sarah Palin will not actually be interviewed until this coming Sunday , a full 16 days ( out of 67 until Election Day - or 23 % of her candidacy ) since she was nominated .
Who is going to be interviewing her ?
FOX News ?
No , that would be too obvious .
Rick Davis and the McCain campaign have granted the first Sarah Palin interview to none other than ABC ’s Charlie Gibson .
The same Charlie Gibson who , along with George Stephanopoulos , spent the first 51 minutes of what was supposed to be a debate between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama back on April 16th , grilling Obama on things like his flag pin and his next door neighbor in Hyde Park , Chicago .
So for 23 % of Palin ’s candidacy her views will have been completely kept in the dark and then all we ’ll get is professional softballer , Charlie Gibson .
During the Gibson interview we can expect to hear more about her son heading off to Iraq on Sept. 11 ( which Joe Biden ’s son will also be doing on Oct. 3 with far less fanfare ) , her NRA membership , her cute daughter Piper , her pregnant daughter Bristol , her working class husband Todd and her image as the " hot " VP candidate .
What we should n’t expect to hear from Gibson are questions about her extreme views on abortion , which she is against even in the case of rape or incest .
Or her nutty , completely outdated and counter - productive abstinence - only approach to sex education .
We wo n’t hear about how she bilked the state of Alaska for a per diem every night she chose to sleep in her own home in Wasilla , Alaska rather than in the capitol of Juneau - a move which her predecessor , Democrat Tony Knowles , denounced as a scam while he was in office .
We are n’t likely to hear about her complete denial that the polar bear is an endangered species or that global warming actually exists .
And we certainly are n’t likely to hear more than one token question ( with no follow - up ) about that false claim that she was against the bridge to nowhere .
So when will we actually get to know who Governor Palin really is and what her views are ?
Well , until Rick Davis and the McCain Campaign decide to show some respect and deference to the American voters , those of us unlucky enough to live in the lower 48 , or in Hawaii , will have a tough time figuring out just where the half - term Governor of Alaska stands on most issues .
And until that happens , America needs to say " thanks , but no thanks " to Sarah Palin .

Firebombs that struck the home and car of two UC Santa Cruz scientists this weekend were part of an increasingly aggressive campaign by animal rights activists against animal researchers at University of California campuses , officials said Monday .
Santa Cruz police officials said the blasts , which occurred three minutes apart , caused one of the scientists , his wife and two young children to flee their home through a second - story window .
“ Acts of violence and intimidation such as these are unacceptable , and they continue a troubling pattern seen at UCLA and other UC campuses that should be repugnant to us all , ” UC President Mark G. Yudof said Monday .
“ These acts threaten not only our academic researchers and their families , but the safety and security of neighbors in our communities as well . ”
City officials joined in harshly condemning the bombings and urged members of the public who might have evidence in the case to contact authorities .
They announced a $ 30,000 reward , including $ 2,500 donated by the Humane Society of the United States .

“ The threats and attacks are shocking and abhorrent , ” Santa Cruz Mayor Ryan Coonerty said .
“ We as a community are unambiguous in our condemnation of these actions .
Let me be clear , this is not protest .
This is terrorism . ”
Nationwide , incidents of violence by self - described animal rights activists have been on the rise , according to the Foundation for Biomedical Research , which has tracked such attacks since 1981 , when there was one .
In 2000 there were 10 such episodes against biomedical research facilities alone , and in 2006 that figure had grown to 77 , according to the group ’s website .
In addition , the type of attacks has changed in recent years .
“ Prior to that , the vast majority of actions taken were against institutions -- break into the lab , steal the animals , trash the facility , ” said foundation President Frankie Trull .
“ More recently , however . . . they ’ve become much more personal , attacking the researchers at their homes .
California seems to be the focus of this activity right now , but not the only focus . ”

Santa Cruz Police Chief Howard Skerry said investigators had collected “ an enormous amount of forensic evidence ” from the two bomb sites .
The FBI , the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives and the state Fire Marshal ’s office are participating in the investigation , along with the city and university police departments .
Santa Cruz police said they were investigating the case as an attempted homicide .
The first bomb went off about 5:40 a.m. Saturday , destroying a car outside the home of a UC Santa Cruz researcher .
Authorities have not named the researcher .
Three minutes later and less than a mile away , a second device exploded on the front porch of researcher David Feldheim ’s home while he and his family were asleep .
As the house filled with smoke , the scientist , his wife and their children , ages 2 and 4 , escaped out a window and down an emergency ladder .
Feldheim injured his feet during his escape .
Both devices were incendiary , police said , but it was unclear how they were triggered .
Also unknown is how many people were involved in carrying out the attacks .

UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal said the episodes were an attempt to stop valuable medical research .
“ I think it ’s a form of domestic terrorism intended to intimidate people , ” the chancellor said .
“ These are incidents that could have killed someone .
They are obviously intended to prevent researchers from pursuing the advancement of knowledge .
They are a serious attack on academic freedom . ”
Police said pamphlets with the names and home addresses of some UC Santa Cruz researchers were found at a Santa Cruz coffee shop four days before the bombings .
The attacks were similar to others since 2006 on the homes and vehicles of animal researchers at UCLA , including one bomb that was mistakenly placed at a researcher ’s neighbor ’s house but did not detonate .
In October , attackers flooded the home of a UCLA scientist who conducts studies using monkeys , causing more than $ 20,000 in damage .
In June , animal rights activists claimed responsibility for setting an unoccupied UCLA carpool van on fire while it was parked at UC Irvine .

At UC Santa Cruz in February , a group of six masked protesters attempted to force their way into a researcher ’s home while the family was having a birthday party for a child .
At UC Berkeley , activists have mounted a “ relentless ” campaign of harassing animal researchers at their homes and in public places on dozens of occasions , said university spokeswoman Marie Felde .
In one case , a group of activists showed up at a researcher ’s child ’s soccer game and shouted that the researcher was an “ animal murderer , ” she said .
University officials also have reported cases of harassment at UC Davis , UC San Francisco and UC Santa Barbara .
The 10 - campus university system is sponsoring state legislation designed to restrict protesters ’ ability to harass university researchers .
Trull called the escalation “ very , very worrying , ” particularly the firebombing of the Feldheims ’ home .
Animal rights activists “ preach this , ‘ We respect all living things , ’ and then they do that with children in the house , ” Trull said .
“ The irresponsibility was breathtaking to me . ”

But at least one activist applauded the attack .
Jerry Vlasak , a Los Angeles physician who runs a website that highlights animal rights activism , blamed the scientists for the violence .
Vlasak , of the North American Animal Liberation Press Office website , said his organization had received no communique from any group claiming responsibility for the Santa Cruz fire bombings .
Although he said he had no direct knowledge of the attacks , he also said that “ the use of force ” is “ not unpredictable or untenable . ”
“ The inconvenience and the suffering of any children or any family members pales in comparison to the suffering and oppression that goes on in these animal laboratories , ” Vlasak said in an interview Monday .
Feldheim is “ putting himself and his family in harm ’s way by continuing to abuse animals . ”
At the entrance to the campus Monday afternoon , about 300 faculty , staff and community members gathered at a hastily organized rally to protest the twin bombings .
Among them were Blumenthal and Coonerty .
Feldheim spoke briefly to the crowd and thanked them for their support .

Martin Chemers , a psychology professor who briefly served as acting chancellor at UC Santa Cruz , helped organize the demonstration to show support for animal researchers and the university .
He carried a sign that said “ Medical Science Saved My Life ” and noted that he had suffered a brain tumor at age 18 .
“ For rational people , this violence is not the way you exercise your opinions in a democratic society , ” he said .
“ We support our colleagues in the sciences and the academic freedom that goes along with being a professor . ”

Paddock reported from Santa Cruz and LaGanga from San Francisco .
Born , raised , and still living in Toronto Canada , Alexandra Orlando has seen both triumph and tragedy in her career in rhythmic gymnastics .
Having missed the Athens Olympics by one spot , she was delighted to have the opportunity to complete in the Beijing Olympics .
Alexandra will be 21 ( birthday January 19 , 1987 ) when she competes this year .
She is expected to do well , as she is one of only four athletes to win six gold medals at a single Commonwealth Games .
When she ’s not competing in gymnastics , she is attending the University of Toronto studying commerce and training at the Ritmika RG Club under Mimi Masleva .

It seemed , by many accounts , a far happier day than the last .
Hours after their worst drop since 1987 , stocks reversed course on Tuesday and headed right back up on hopes that lawmakers were nearing an agreement on a bailout for the financial system .
The Dow industrials jumped 485.21 points , erasing more than half its loss from Monday .
Bank stocks rose sharply , investors were lured out of Treasury bonds , and the dollar soared .
But alarms were sounding elsewhere in the byzantine channels of the global financial system , sending a clear message that the health of the world ’s economy remained at risk of worsening .
Even as President Bush and Congressional leaders worked to make a rescue plan palatable to lawmakers , the flow of credit neared a standstill , making it more difficult for businesses to obtain the money they need for routine expenses like utilities and payroll .
Banks were still reluctant to lend , despite billions of dollars of cash offered up by central banks around the world .
Early on Tuesday , banks were charging one another the highest overnight borrowing costs ever recorded , as measured by an important rate known as Libor .
Even the triple - digit stock rally , spurred by investors ’ hopes that Congress will approve a revised version of a bailout plan , represented yet another of the big daily swings that reflect fragility and fear .
The Greenland Ice Sheet is melting faster than previously calculated according to a scientific paper by University of Alaska Fairbanks researcher Sebastian H. Mernild published recently in the journal Hydrological Processes .
The study is based on the results of state - of - the - art modeling using data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as well as satellite images and observations from on the ground in Greenland .
Mernild and his team found that the total amount of Greenland Ice Sheet freshwater input into the North Atlantic Ocean expected from 2071 to 2100 will be more than double what is currently observed .
The current East Greenland Ice
Sheet freshwater flux is 257 km3 per year from both runoff and iceberg calving .
This freshwater flux is estimated to reach 456 km3 by 2100 .
Mernild ’s results further show a change in total East Greenland freshwater flux from today ’s values of 438 km3 per year to 650 km3 per year by 2100 .
This indicates an increase in global sea level rise estimates from 1.1 millimeters per year to 1.6 millimeters per year .
“ The Greenland Ice Sheet mass balance is changing as a response to the altered climatic state , ” said Mernild .
“ This is faster than expected .
This affects freshwater runoff input to the North Atlantic Ocean , and plays an important role in determining the global sea level rise and global ocean thermohaline circulation . ”
Mernild is conducting the research as part of the University of Alaska ’s International Polar Year efforts .
He was appointed a University of Alaska IPY postdoctoral fellow by UA president Mark Hamilton in 2007 .
Much like everyone else , we ’ve been thinking far too much about Spore recently .
Alex Hutchinson , the game ’s lead designer , has been thinking about it for years .
With the game released , we grabbed the opportunity to talk candidly and extensively with him about its design choices .
From high level decisions like the actual in - game effect of customisation to basic technical elements like the lack of autosave to the question of the sudden difficulty spike in Space ( And the lack of difficulty elsewhere ) , he reveals Maxis ’ thinking .
Whether you adore or abhor it , after reading this , you ’ll understand exactly why Spore is the game it is .
RPS : How did you decide upon the effect of customisation .
As in , deciding that each part would have a specific effect rather based upon something in the design of the creature itself ?
Alex Hutchinson :
This was a really interesting , and ongoing debate on the team – early on there was one faction on the team that fervently believed creativity should have no impact on gameplay – that playing and creating were two totally separate activities , and that players should be able to create anything they wanted and then play any way they wanted .
The second faction believed that creation and play were integral to each other , and that each editor should directly and powerfully impact each game .
There are many challenges with this – first , there ’s just the basic argument that in a storytelling game like Spore ( and our core aim was always to enable people to tell their own stories , not to ‘ win ’ per se ) limiting people ’s creativity is an essentially catastrophic decision and the more gameplay you bond to editors , the more you remove the player ’s ability to tell their story of a mushroom headed toilet bowl who terrorized the earth , or the evil looking fang toothed monster who struggled to befriend the universe .
If this was based purely on physical parts , both those stories are impossible , or at least terribly hard to communicate to players .
Also there ’s a challenge with granularity – we originally had a formula for speed which was basically a curve that said that getting more legs made you faster until you had more than four legs , after which is it made you slower , but never made you as slow as someone with one leg , all of which was modified by the level and type of feet that you had and the mass of the entire creature .
What we found however was that even people who thought they wanted that sort of calculation both did n’t understand it and did n’t like it when they were actually playing – the problem switched to ‘ my guy looks like he should run real fast but he does n’t , why ? ’ and we ’d say , well , you put five legs on him and that bulbous tail is actually really heavy , and people were both disappointed by the result and did n’t understand it and they thought their creativity had been crushed .
Also , we originally had very fine grained stats for Creature Phase , down to a few decimal points , but we kept hitting issues where people would be .1 % faster than their prey or .1 % slower than their predators , so the interaction of chasing your lunch would eventually resolve but someone would be chasing the other creature across the planet for hours which obviously is n’t very interesting or fun .
It all comes down to what intellectually sounds brilliant but is practically painful .
We also had stats that I really liked such as ‘ cuteness ’ which looked at size and type of eyes , overall size and proportion of hands and feet etc but to be honest when you ’re making a casual game , it gets complicated super fast and as much as I am a hardcore gamer and would love to have semi-inscrutable stats smothering the game it just does n’t appeal to that many people and I really like making games that actual human beings can play and enjoy .
In the end we decided to cross streams basically , and begin with games that had a direct relationship between the act of creation and the in - game results , but end with games that allowed people to make whatever the wanted and then play separately .
This also matched the aim of making the games themselves more complex as we moved forward , so that people who were perhaps not as familiar with games could begin with simpler games that were easier to digest before progressing to more complicated games that were more difficult to play on a conceptual level if you were n’t familiar with RTS conventions for example .
My personal position on this was that the editors are the heart of Spore , and that we should bond them as much as possible to gameplay , but the boon and the curse of games is that they ’re giant collaborations .
In the end I think it ’s an interesting spin on creator based content – other developers who are interested in it as a theme can look at essentially four or five different implementations of the idea and hopefully move forward from that learning and make other great games .
RPS : Way back in the mists of time , there was a more free - moving water based stage rather than going straight onto line demoed .
I presumed it was lost because the multi-axis movement is more complicated than the land - based two - axis movement , causing a break in the learning curve … is this right , or is there something else I ’m missing ?
Alex :
That demo in ’05 was really a high concept pitch – the demo was n’t an actual playable game yet , it was just a terrific visual presentation of what people hoped the game would eventually become .
After that there was years of hard graft to get it back to that point and keep evolving it .
To be honest we never even really attempted to build that phase , as soon as production started we realized the mountain we had to climb with five different games – remember that means essentially five control schemes , five sets of user interface , five sets of everything … and all of it with a team that was only about 80 people which is well under the average team size these days for a big project .
The 3D movement would definitely have been a pain , and I think also it would have been hard to differentiate it from either the cell or creature phase – it feels like it would have been more filler than useful , although I ’m sure there ’s an interesting design in there somewhere .
RPS : Talking about that makes me wonder about the structure generally – since it amps up its complications slowly , was there ever a case in an earlier part of the game where you decided a mechanic , while interesting , was too complicated for that point in the curve ?
Or alternatively , give too much attention to that part of the game – as in , the sub games are meant to be progressive and if you get grabbed by an earlier stage and never want to move on , it ’s not going to work as a game about evolution ?
Alex : I think the multiple game phases was the biggest nightmare for design – if you think about creature phase , for example , it has to get its content from cell phase , and then deliver it to tribal phase and beyond , which means a bunch of things : the world for creature phase , which is an avatar based pseudo - adventure game has remain playable for tribal phase and civilization phase , both of which are basic strategy games .
An adventure game wants complex geometry , cool spaces to explore , perhaps physical challenges , while a real time strategy game wants lots of flat , empty spaces to move units through .
And that problem expands endlessly into all other facets of the game , from the challenges the tech team had to handle level of detail from essentially ground level all the way to looking at a planet from space , and on and on .
Essentially it meant that letting phases run in directions they wanted to go was more difficult than any other project I ’ve ever worked on – we continually hit issues where a feature that might be fun for creature phase would essentially break tribal phase , or a feature that would be fun in creature phase was ‘ too intelligent ’ for a creature and had to be reserved for tribal phase .
Also , I fervently believed that for our game to give you a sense of progression – that your creations actually moved from small organisms to big creatures and then tribal creatures and then a civilization – and for you to actually see all the content that other people had made , and not just play once and then stop , the first four phases need to be playable on a Sunday afternoon .
Why did we build an infinite content machine if you ’re only going to play once ?
Why did we make flexible editors for character and unit creation if you ’re only going to make one set ?
Why make a story that ’s about scale changes if the scale changes so gradually you ca n’t see it ?
Spore is designed to let you tell your story , then wake up tomorrow and tell another story .
It ’s an unusual game .
We also saw that people often enjoyed their second and later playthroughs more than their first , which I think is fascinating : I think this is partly because the game is so unusual , and it takes a loop to get your head around it so you can start pushing its boundaries , and I also think it ’s about resetting expectations .
The hype machine was so out of control , and the game was n’t clearly an established genre of game , we always knew there would be people who would be disappointed because it was n’t what they expected , but I just hope people will assess it based on what it tries to do and whether it succeeds , not on whether or not it ’s the game they expected .
Those reviews which try to bash into established categories or break each level down individually to save themselves the difficulties of actually thinking about the game as a whole are pretty shallow in my opinion .
RPS : The game tends to take a gentle approach throughout majority of the game – so it ’s somewhat a surprise , upon reaching the Space stage where it ’s possible to fall into a seemingly unrecoverable hole relatively easily .
What was the thinking behind the sudden leap , if you will ?
For me , it seems an odd conflict – in that the game manages to be casual and not casual at the same time .
Alex : I mentioned it earlier , but the idea was always to ramp up challenge and complexity as you played , but yeah that ’s basically a tuning issue we ’ll address soon .
The desire was to have space feel like it ‘ opened up ’ the game and now you had the wonder of an entire universe in front of you , with limitless access to other people ’s content , and also a game that you could play for several hours .
Space is designed to be a big phase you can sit in for as long as you want , and it needed to be more complex than earlier phases , but it was an interesting challenge .
I quite liked the idea that casual players will enjoy the first phases more , then become less interested and perhaps just start again or play in the editors , and hardcore players will become more interested as the game progresses .
We ’ve seen that in reviews and in player feedback too , which I think is a good thing not a bad thing – it ’s a giant game and there ’s plenty to do for both players , but yeah I think it makes it challenging to boil down into a single idea .
The idea that a game might change its tone over time I think is interesting – most games are monotone ( not monotonous , mind you ) and by that I mean it starts as a shooter and ends as a shooter , so if you like the first five minutes you ’ll like the last five – it ’s an interesting idea to me to make a game where you might intrinsically love one half more than the other , so long as each half is robust enough to give people value for their time and money .
RPS : People have commented on various diversions the game took from evolution , one of the interesting ones I thought was characterising herbivores as communicative and building social networks – not that it ’s totally necessary , but watching people play seems that carnivores wipe the map at the creature stage while herbivores flirt up the map .
I kind of presumed this was because while the carnivores interaction with other animals ( i.e. Eating them ) leads to a game with direction , herbivores … well , mostly do n’t interact with other species in such ways , so you have to abstract a little to make a game .
Is that completely off base ?
Alex :
The interesting thing about herbivores , is that you sit down to assess their basic functionality and how you might put it in a game you realize that herbivores are basically lunch on legs .
They actually do n’t do anything that interesting ( this is a generalization , obviously , to all you zoologists out there ) but carnivores are generally smarter , more active , and have more interesting behaviors .
It ’s no surprise that most games out there are about conflict and aggression – I do n’t think that has anything to do with any ridiculous claims that games instill violence in people , I think it comes down to the fact that conflict is an easier mechanic to model and has strong in - built risk / reward structures that make it inherently fun .
But to hit the storytelling aims I ’ve mentioned a few times already , people obviously needed to be able to make creatures that were non-violent .
It ’s core to the Maxis philosophy and core to Spore as a game and its hopes for mass appeal , that there should be ways to resolve the levels without killing everything .
In the Sims this was an easier problem because the Sims does n’t have a win state , but once we realized you needed to finish each level to get to the next in Spore , we needed to model win states , which meant even social behavior needed a win state .
So when you imagine building a game based on non-violent behavior , it not only becomes a little more abstract – we chose music as a general theme – but it also becomes harder to explain in general , as it ’s not as tightly mapped to ‘ real world ’ behaviors as we ’d have liked .
Further down the chain , we were also trying to tie behaviors to parts in the editor , and to make that purchase decision interesting when making creatures , we needed a reason to map certain behaviors and functionality to groups and the mouth type divide seemed the most logical – it was also something we could use in cell to force the player to make a consequential decision .
In other words , by choosing a certain mouth in cell you were already on a path in the creature phase so you should at least give it passing thought .
RPS : Okay – a break from the really fancy ones .
Care to explain why Autosave was so hard to implement ?
Alex : Haha
I should get an engineer to pitch in here , but the logic was since we do n’t support multiple saves , we did n’t want the player to do something save and then have no way to back out .
The challenge with allowing more than one save is that the universe is persistent – so your save in this game is physically in the same universe as your other save , so if you save this game several times , which universe are you in when you load up another saved game on another planet and progress to space ?
That said , it ’s clearly not ideal and we ’re taking another look at it .
Now that the horror of finishing the game and putting it in a box is passed , issues like these will be re-examined and we ’ll continue to support and grow the game you can be sure .
RPS : What do you think the biggest misunderstandings are about Spore ?
Alex :
Oh this is going to be a long one .
Actually , I ’ll just use one example so it hopefully carries more weight .
We designed spore to be three equal thirds : creating things in the creators , sharing things through the Sporepedia and invisibly in general play just by creating and playing , and then playing the games themselves .
That breaks down to lovely marketing simplification : create , share , play which was also very successful in the Sims .
The interesting thing about Spore , I that these thirds are intended to be equal .
So it astounds me when I read commentary on the game that focuses only on the games , or dismisses the sharing aspects of the game .
It belies the fact that many people are only looking at the ‘ game ’ third , which means they ’re ignoring or dismissing two thirds of the experience – I can understand why people might prefer one third , or even ignore another third , but to assume we did n’t deliberately put the weight of effort equally across the game is odd .
We deliberately did things to the ‘ game ’ part of Spore to enable the editors to be more powerful – it ’s no surprise that you can do virtually anything in the editors , as every time we had a potential design decision that would limit that , we chose to put the burden into the gameplay third , which was truly difficult , but it was the core assumption of the game .
We were trying to do something different .
So I think the biggest misunderstanding is just that these thirds were not designed to be equal , or that there ’s inherently more value in the game part than the creation or sharing part – I think that ’s an assumption that will hold our industry back if we do n’t break it , and I hope that Spore is successful enough to prove that .
RPS : Thanks for your time , Alex .
Alex :
Thanks so much for the questions – feels good to chat about it all .
The UN 's committee on human rights has just published a report criticising Britain 's anti-terror laws and the resulting curbs on civil liberties .
For many commentators the issues raised are mostly a matter of academic abstractions and speculative meanderings .
For me , it is anything but .
These laws have destroyed my life .
On May 14 I was arrested under section 41 of the Terrorism Act - on suspicion of the " instigation , preparation and commission of acts of terrorism " : an absurdly nebulous formulation that told me nothing about the sin I had apparently committed .
Once in custody , almost 48 hours passed before it was confirmed that the entire operation ( involving dozens of officers , police cars , vans , and scientific support agents ) was triggered by the presence on my University of Nottingham office computer of an equally absurd document called the " al - Qaida Training Manual " , a declassified open - source document that I had never read and had completely forgotten about since it had been sent to me months before .
Rizwaan Sabir , a politics student friend of mine ( who was also arrested ) , had downloaded the file from the US justice department website while conducting research on terrorism for his upcoming PhD .
An extended version of the same document was also available on Amazon .
I edit a political magazine ; Rizwaan regularly sent me copies of research materials he was using , and this document was one .
Within hours of my incarceration I had lost track of time .
I often awoke thinking I had been asleep for days only to discover it was n't midnight yet .
My confidence in the competence ( and motives ) of the police ebbed away .
I found myself shifting my energies from remaining cheerful to remaining sane .
In the early hours , I was often startled by the metallic toilet seat , crouched in the corner like some sinister beast .
For days on end , I drew cartoons and wrote diary entries in the margins of Mills and Boon novellas .
I spent hours reciting things to myself : names of Saul Bellow characters , physics Nobel prize winners , John Coltrane albums , anything to keep the numbness away .
I 'm constantly coming across efforts being made to give detention without charge the Walt Disney treatment : the crushing weight of solitary confinement is painted as a non-issue ; the soul - sapping nothingness of the claustrophobic , cold cell is portrayed as a mild inconvenience .
Make no mistake : the feeling that one 's fate is in the hands of the very people who are apparently trying to convict you is , without doubt , one of the most devastating horrors a human being can ever be subjected to .
It is ( to misquote Carl von Clausewitz ) the continuation of torture by other means .
" Those who have nothing to hide , have nothing to fear , " goes the tautological reasoning of the paranoia merchants calling for harsher , ever more draconian " security " measures - as we saw throughout the 42 - days debate .
They should read Kafka : nothing is more terrifying than being arrested for something you know you have n't done .
Indeed , it is the innocent who suffers the most because it is the innocent who is tormented the most .
The guilty calculates , triangulates , anticipates .
The innocent does n't know where to start .
The answers and the questions are absolute , unbreachable , towering conundrums .
I underwent 20 hours of vigorous interrogation while entire days were being completely wasted by the police micro-examining every detail of my life : my political activism , my writings , my work in theatre and dance , my love life , my photography , my cartooning , my magazine subscriptions , my bus tickets .
Aspects of my life that would have been seen as commendable in others were suddenly viewed as suspect in my case for no apparent reason other than my religious and ethnic background .
I was guilty of being that strangest of creatures : a Muslim who reads ; who studied engineering yet writes about Bob Dylan ; was a vocal opponent of the Iraq war yet owns all of Christopher Hitchens ' writings ; admires Terry Eagleton yet defends Martin Amis ; interviews Kazuo Ishiguro , listens to Leonard Cohen , goes to Radiohead concerts , all of which became the subject of rather bizarre questioning .
This is not all : outside , lives are shattered , jobs are lost , marriages are destroyed , minds are damaged , friends and families are traumatised - often irrevocably so .
My parents , whom I was n't allowed to call , could barely get any sleep throughout the ordeal .
Many of my Muslim university friends were , and still are , worried about being targeted themselves .
For most of my loved ones , despite my innocence , nothing will ever be the same again .
I 'm now jobless , facing destitution and threatened with deportation from the country I 've called home for nearly half my life .
Immense pressure is exerted on law enforcement agencies by their political mandarins to produce " results " : pressure to produce a higher number of arrests but also the corollary , more dangerous , impulse to justify them at any cost .
Naturally , through a perverted but pervasive circularity in the logic , lack of evidence becomes the very justification for requesting " more time " .
The government claims that checks and balances will ensure extensions to detention periods are based on verifiable and compelling arguments .
I beg to differ : in my case , the judge was simply bullied by streams of technospeak until she had no option but to grant extra time .
Fighting terrorism is a serious matter and needs to be tackled in a serious way - not through empty gimmicks sustained by fear - mongering and alarmist rhetoric .
The real danger is that we are witnessing a slide from the essential purity of habeas corpus into a Britain where the innocent are detained until proven guilty .

· This article was amended on Tuesday September 2 2008 .
A document known as " the al - Qaida training manual " does not appear on the reading list for Nottingham University 's politics department , as we first said in this piece .
This has been corrected .
In an article I once wrote for Citizens for Legitimate Government titled , You do n’t defend America with a lie back in May of 2003 , it is this passage in that article I want all of my readers to zero in on , “ This administration through this lie has funded a war , that does indeed put everyone at risk .
Because down the road , should a greater threat occur , how will we pay for it ?
Many people are already asking how we could first afford to pay for this war of lies .
This lie perpetuated by this administration and through the help of the media has already weakened a once strong country economically .
A strong country means a country that is economically solvent , instead of insolvent .
We have basically allowed a lie to put us in the red . ”
I want everyone to zero in on …A strong country means a country that is economically solvent , instead of insolvent .
While I always thought it would be another terrorist attack and our response to it , never did I realize in my wildest dreams that the attack upon our nation would come from within .
I never foresaw how the CEO ’s on Wall Street could become as dangerous as Al Qaeda was and still is .
While these CEOs did not fly a plane into any building , what they did was to metaphorically fly a similar plane into people ’s hopes and dreams .
You gave them those planes , Senator McCain .
It is up to we the people to realize that this economic terrorist attack began when deregulation hit our shores and at the hands of none other than Senator John McCain .
Because of his actions in the past , he put our country in the red now that we will be forced to bailout Wall Street .
Senator McCain , when the good people of Arizona sent you to the senate , they placed their trust in you and you have not only let them down , but the people of this republic by turning a blind - eye while Wall Street ran amok .
Now you ask for people ’s trust as you run for the highest office in the land ?
Our trust in you is now long gone as we wake up to a dismal day when our hard - earned - money goes to bailout your friends on Wall Street because of their greed and sheer incompetence .
That was our money and you helped take it from us .
As you look to keep pressing on Iraq , I want to ask you with what money do we do this , Senator McCain ?
America is now broke and I just do not see how the country I love dearly can afford to pay for a war you supported from the get - go .
You targeted the wrong country instead of going to where Al Qaeda truly resides and it has cost us dearly as a country in blood and treasure .
We cannot forgive you , Senator McCain .
You have always been part of the problem as you became embroiled in the Keating Five scandal where once before , we bailed out your friends through the Lincoln Savings and Loan .
In fact the Senate Ethics Committee cited of your involvement in it as being one of poor judgment , yet you wish to ask Americans to trust you with our futures now ?
No thanks , Senator McCain .
You have become a liability , a risk and we cannot trust you .
If God forbid you are elected our president :
Who will you appoint to look over the people ’s money ?
Will it be former Senator Phil Gramm who also took our money from us by writing many of the laws that got us to this point ?
Do you think Americans are that stupid , Senator McCain ?
While some may fit that category , some have woken up to the fact you have not put your country first and that is inexcusable .
In these past two weeks it would have been great to see the president , our congress and the media this concentrated on the 47 million who still go without health insurance or those living in abject poverty because of your trickle down economics also known as Reaganomics .
Those who suffer curable illnesses will just have to wait because they cannot even afford the most basic care in this country .
Where is your country first when it comes to their pain and suffering ?
As you can afford the best medical care for your skin melanomas , there are countless who cannot even see a doctor to deal with theirs .
Because of your age , most likely you are beginning to feel the ravages to your body and there are countless seniors who cannot afford the quality medical care to deal with theirs as you deal with yours .
In reading this article titled , What Makes Obama Run ? , I could n’t help but zero in on this passage , “ Here in Chicago , Obama worked as lead organizer for the Developing Communities Project , a campaign funded by south - side Catholic churches to counteract the dislocation and massive unemployment caused by the closing and downsizing of southeast Chicago steel plants . ”
That is exactly the experience we as Americans deserve as many more will lose their jobs and have done so .
While darkness did visit American ’s door - step when this bailout plan was passed by congress , I along with many others want hope and our dreams realized in the future and that will not come from you , Senator McCain .
Today many Americans across this great country of ours are angry and it is you who should be made to suffer the consequences .
America just cannot afford four more years or risk and you have become that risk .
Howard Dean in his failed presidential bid once called upon all of us to take back our country and that is what we as Americans must do now .
The only way we can do that is making sure you are not our next president .
We have had enough of your failed economic policies .
You have become America ’s greatest liability .

" It is the first responsibility of every citizen to question authority . " -- Benjamin Franklin
WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers are scrambling to put their mark on the Bush administration 's $ 700 billion plan to save financial markets -- a fast - moving test of wills that could reshape one of the biggest bailouts in U.S. history .
There 's no sign yet that Congress will delay or derail the proposal .
Democrats are looking to add provisions that include beefed - up congressional oversight , aid for individual homeowners and changes to bankruptcy laws .
Some of the measures are opposed by the administration .
Perhaps the biggest looming fight is over Democratic efforts to require the program 's participants to curb what they pay their executives .
Last week , as deep new fissures opened in global financial markets , the U.S. Treasury unveiled a plan to spend up to $ 700 billion to buy soured mortgages and mortgage - related securities from financial institutions .
In many respects , the financial sector last week all but ceased to function .
Will the U.S. Treasury repudiate its obligations to its creditors , be they citizens or investors around the world ?
Most observers would answer " no " without hesitation .
But Congress , with the complicity of the White House and the Fed , has arguably embarked on a stealth repudiation .
In his famous treatise , " The Wealth of Nations , " Adam Smith noted there had never been a " single instance " of sovereign debts having been repaid once " accumulated to a certain degree . "
We may have reached Smith 's threshold .
The bond markets are certainly not protecting creditors from the risk of what Smith called " pretended payment " through inflation .
Nor did they do so until far into the great inflation of the 1970s .
Not until late 1977 and into 1978 did the bond market fully incorporate the reality of the debased dollar , by demanding higher long - term interest rates .
How can this happen ?
Markets are supposed to be forward - looking and efficiently price in all relevant risks .
Yet monarchs have been repudiating debt explicitly and implicitly throughout recorded history .
Many years ago , the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises offered an explanation .
He suggested that while you can't , in Abraham Lincoln 's words " fool all of the people all of the time , " you can fool all of the people at least some of the time .
And this is easier to do if a central bank has in the past earned credibility in fighting inflation .

When it comes to following space agency rules , Russia stands firm .
The man who was going to be the first South Korean in space has now been grounded for violating Russian security protocol and will be replaced by a female biotechnology engineer , the South Korean science ministry said on Monday .
Ko San , 31 , was dropped from the April 2008 flight to the International Space Station on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft .
He is now the backup for the mission after he removed sensitive material from a Russian space training center .
Ko , a technology researcher is being replaced by Yi So- yeon , 29 , who is finishing her doctorate in bioengineering .
“ The Russians emphasized the importance of abiding by the rules , as even small mistakes can bring about grave consequences in space , ” a South Koren official said at a news conference , adding Ko appeared to have made innocent mistakes .
The Russian authorities said Ko took a book out of the center without permission and sent it to his home in South Korea in September .
Ko later returned the book , explaining he accidently sent it home together with other personal belongings .
In February , Ko again violated regulations by getting a book from the center through a Russian colleague , and it was material he was not supposed to read .
Officials did not give details about the book ’s contents , but South Korean officials portrayed both of his infractions as minor .
“ The Russian space agency has stressed that a minor mistake and disobedience can cause serious consequences , ” a south Korean official told reporters .
Ko will remain at the Russian space center and continue training .
The official did not say if Ko would possibly go to space on a future flight .
Yi , 29 , will work aboard the International Space Station for about 10 days with three other cosmonauts as well as American station commander Peggy Whitson and flight engineer Garrett Reisman .
Yi will conduct scientific experiments , according to a ministry statement .
The mission will make South Korea the world ’s 35th country and Asia ’s sixth to send an astronaut into space .
The two South Koreans were selected from a list of more than 36,000 candidates .

( CNN ) -- Asian markets on Friday rallied after Wall Street surged on news central banks around the world were pumping billions of dollars into money markets and the U.S. government was planning a broad program to stem the credit crunch .
Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) September 18 , 2008 in New York City .
Hong Kong 's Hang
Seng opened up more than 7 percent , Japanese share prices were up about 3.3 percent , and Australian shares were up about 4 percent .
Taipei and Singapore shares also showed gains .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke briefed House and Senate leaders Thursday evening on a program to let banks get rid of mortgage - related assets that have been hard to value and harder to trade .
Democrat Barney Frank of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee said he believes legislation could be acted on next week .
The developments followed news of a package of up to $ 247 billion aimed at money markets from the U.S. Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank , the Swiss National Bank , the Bank of England , the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Japan .
The injection of cash , which amounts to an expansion of up to $ 180 billion in available funds , is an effort to fuel economic activity .
The New York markets had most time to digest and react , and the Dow Jones industrials , the Nasdaq and the S&P all ended the day more than three percent up .
The Dow wiped out much of its Wednesday losses which was its second worst day of the year .
In Europe the picture was positive for much of the day but by close of trading , Britain 's FTSE - 100 was down half a percent , despite Lloyds TSB 's proposed $ 21.8 billion deal to acquire struggling HBOS , Britain 's biggest mortgage lender , helping to ease some concern among traders there .
Germany 's DAX finished down 0.39 percent and France 's CAC 40 index down 1.5 percent .

With major financial and insurance institutions teetering , commercial banks have tightened their lending policies and increased interest rates , taking billions of dollars out of the economy .
Under the rescue plan , the European Central Bank will inject up to $ 110 billion , the Swiss National Bank up to $ 27 billion , the Bank of Japan up to $ 60 billion , the Bank of England up to $ 40 billion and the Bank of Canada up to $ 10 billion .
In addition , the Federal Reserve acted to ease a spike in overnight lending rates in the U.S. by injecting $ 55 billion into the domestic banking system .
" We 're very grateful that the rescue package has been put on the table , because frankly the world 's inter - bank markets are just simply not working in the manner that they should do , " said David Buik of the BGC Partners brokerage firm in London .
" There 's a wholesale mistrust ... amongst everybody . "
" It is essential that the central banks do stand there and massage the trust back into action , " Buik said .
" Without them , we would be in unbelievably uncontrollable turmoil . "
Britain's Financial Services Authority also temporarily stopped short selling -- the practice of selling securities the seller does not own , in the hope of repurchasing them later at a lower price .
TIME.com looks at the short sellers
It is an attempt to make money out of an expected fall in price and has been partially blamed by some analysts for pushing down share prices .
Thursday 's more positive news contrasted sharply with the previous day on Wall Street , when the Dow Jones industrials tumbled 449 points -- its second worst day of the year , but only the second worst day this week .
The Nasdaq and the S&P also suffered drops of more than 4 percent .
The sell - off came in the wake of investment bank Lehman Brothers ' bankruptcy , Merrill Lynch 's sale to Bank of America , and the U.S. government announcing an $ 85 billion plan to bail out insurance giant American International Group ( AIG ) .
American financial investor Jim Rogers told CNN : " It 's going to get worse .
There are going to be more bankruptcies .
There 's going to be a big cleanout in the financial system . "
" It 's a complete collapse of confidence , " Francis Lun , general manager of Fulbright Securities Ltd in Hong Kong , told The Associated Press .
" The financial crisis in the U.S. is hitting everyone , everyone is running for cover .
If the largest insurance company can fail , than no one is safe . "
The remaining two Wall Street investment banks were hit particularly hard on Wednesday with Morgan Stanley down 29 percent and Goldman Sachs down 21 percent .
British bank Barclays said it had reached a deal Wednesday to purchase key units of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers for $ 1.75 billion .
The deal came just two days after Barclays walked away from talks to buy the beleaguered financial institution in its entirety .
Barclays will acquire Lehman 's North American investment banking and capital markets businesses for $ 250 million in cash .
Barclays will also purchase Lehman 's New York headquarters and two data centers in New Jersey at their current market value estimated at $ 1.5 billion , a company statement said .

Wall Street May Manage Own Bad Debt
Read Treasury 's Fact Sheet on Bailout
Under authority sought by the Treasury Department , the government could purchase as much as $ 700 billion in mortgage - related assets from U.S. - headquartered institutions .
The Treasury , meanwhile , is floating the idea of having Wall Street asset managers oversee the toxic debt , CNBC has learned
The participation of banks in the problem loan pool will be " primarily American " with some participation by US - affiliates of foreign banks , Congressional leaders told CNBC .
Foreign governments would not be eligible under any scenario currently under discussion , they said .
Congressional leaders also said the Treasury 's initial proposal " has nothing in it " as of now because Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is pushing for maximum flexibility .
The legislation also does not currently include warrants for the government to take stakes in participating institutions , as it did in the AIG bailout , these leaders said .
There is a very strong push from some Democrats to include salary restrictions for CEOs of participating financial institutions .
But Paulson is resisting the idea , calling it a " poison pill . "
Democrats also are seeking to include something for " Main Street " in the bill , such as relief for distressed mortgage holders .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initially was inclined to accept Paulson 's wish that a second economic stimulus plan not be included in the bill .
But some Democratic members are pushing back , trying to get it attached in return for support .
The outcome may hinge on how many Republicans defect and oppose the package .
The more Republican who vote no , the more Democrats have leverage to insist on their terms .
So far , Republican support has appeared reasonably strong , but that could change quickly as the jockeying in Congress continues .
For Investors
The Treasury 's bailout proposal is just one of a series of measures unveiled in the past few days as the Treasury and Fed try to unfreeze credit markets and prevent a growing storm that could engulf the global economy .
The Treasury said on Friday it would siphon up to $ 50 billion from a fund established in the 1930s to backstop the rattled U.S. money market mutual fund industry .
This long - safe corner of financial markets , home to some $ 3.5 trillion of deposits , has increasingly appeared at risk
Money market fund assets dropped by a record $ 169.03 billion in the week ended September 17 as jittery investors pulled money out .
The Securities and Exchange Commission also imposed a 10 trading - day ban on short sales of 799 financial stocks .
As the government brought out the big guns to tackle the financial crisis , investment bank Morgan Stanley bought itself some time to come up with a plan for its future and talked to Wachovia and other banks about a merger .
On Saturday , a U.S. bankruptcy judge approved British bankBarclays ' deal to purchase the core U.S. business of Lehman Brothers Holdings .
Congressional leaders have promised swift action on the bailout package but many details are still to be worked out .
New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer , chairman of Congress ' Joint Economic Committee , said the government plan is a good start .
" But it includes no visible protection for taxpayers or homeowners .
We look forward to talking to Treasury to see what , if anything , they have in mind in these two areas , " he said .
Schumer added that Congress hopes to pass the plan this week .
" The aim is to get this on the president 's desk by Friday , " Schumer said at a news conference .
As lawmakers ' aides huddled on Capitol Hill , President Bush acknowledged the plan would put large amounts of taxpayer money on the line to buttress shaky markets .
Sex offenders will be given medication to reduce their testosterone levels
LONDON : Convicted paedophiles in Britain are to be offered chemical castration in order to keep their libido in check .
Backed by the government , the scheme would offer paedophiles who have finished their time in jail , medication to reduce their testosterone levels to those of pre-pubescent boys giving results which are similar to the effects of castration .
Professor Don Grubin , a criminal psychiatrist from Newcastle University ’s Institute of Neuroscience has been appointed by the Department of Health to co-ordinate the treatment nationally .
The medication which would be offered to control sexual behaviour include Prozac and cancer drugs .
“ This is n’t part of the punishment , but aims to reduce the likelihood that they will need to be punished again .
The question is , do you want them out there with treatment , or without it ? ” said Grubin .
By offering the scheme , Britain joins Sweden , Denmark , Canada and eight states in the USA which have similar projects and are said to have been successful .
Evidence from Scandinavia suggests that rates of reoffending by paedophiles have been cut to five per cent from more than 40 per cent thanks to the drugs .
Critics of the scheme express concerns that too little is known about the side - effects of the drugs , which can also leave people feeling lethargic and trigger hormone problems in men .
Currently the only treatment available to sexual offenders through the National
Offender Management Service ( Noms ) was of a psychological nature .
But Noms states in a circular to probation officials : “ Whilst psychological intervention will remain the preferred method of treatment for most sex offenders , in certain cases this could usefully be supplemented by medical treatment . ”
Interestingly public reaction to the scheme has been supportive
There is also the feeling that leaving it up to the offender to take the medicine is not a foolproof method .
The goliath grouper , including the Atlantic variety from Cuba ( shown here ) , sports five rows of teeth in the lower jaw .
The teeth help grouper to hold tight to prey , which they usually swallow whole .
A man-sized grouper that trolls the tropical waters of the Eastern Pacific Ocean for octopuses and crabs has been identified as a new fish species after genetic tests .
Called the goliath grouper , the fish can grow to six feet ( 1.8 meters ) in length and weigh a whopping 1,000 pounds ( 454 kg ) .
Until now , scientists had grouped this species with an identical looking fish ( also called the goliath grouper , or Epinephelus itajara ) living in the Atlantic Ocean .
" For more than a century , ichthyologists have thought that Pacific and Atlantic goliath grouper were the same species , " said lead researcher Matthew Craig of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology , " and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques . "
Once upon a time , about 3.5 million years ago — before the Caribbean and the Pacific were separated by present - day Panama — they were , in fact , the same species .
Now , DNA tests have revealed the two populations have distinct genes , indicating they likely evolved into two separate species after their ocean homes were divided by Central America .
Scientists disagree about how to define the term " species " and what separates species from one another biologically , though some say that a species is a group that can mate with one another and produce offspring that are not sterile .
However , this biological definition does n't always hold up , for instance , with coyotes and wolves ( considered separate species ) , which can successfully produce fertile offspring .
In this study , the scientists relied on differences in the fishes ' genetic codes to establish the separate grouper species .
The new Pacific species , now designated as Epinephelus quinquefasciatus , is described in a recent issue of the journal Endangered Species Research .
The Atlantic variety , E. itajara , is currently listed as critically endangered by the IUCN , or International Union for Conservation of Nature .
Due to its scarcity , E. quinquefasciatus also may be considered critically endangered .
" In light of our new findings , the Pacific goliath grouper should be treated with separate management and conservation strategies , " said researcher Rachel Graham of the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York .
The research was funded by Programa Petrobras Ambiental , Conservation International Brazil to Projeto Meros do Brasil , The Summit Foundation , National Science Foundation and Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology .
In his speech Sept. 2 , 2008 , to the Republican National Convention , former U.S. Sen .
Fred Thompson , R - Tenn. , recounted John McCain 's time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam after his Navy plane was shot down in October 1967 .
" They took him to the Hanoi Hilton , where he lapsed in and out of consciousness for days , " Thompson said in St. Paul , Minn .
" He was offered medical care for his injuries if he would give up military information in return .
John McCain said , ' No . ' "
Thompson compresses details of McCain 's biography to offer the most positive picture of the Republicans ' 2008 standard - bearer .
But in doing so he contradicts statements McCain made in his bestselling autobiography , Faith of My Fathers .
In the book , co-written with Mark Salter , McCain recounts the grievous wounds he suffered when shot down and afterward at the hands of angry Vietnamese .
He was taken to the Maison Centrale , known to POWs as the Hanoi Hilton , where he did lapse in and out of consciousness for four days and refuse his interrogators ' demands for information .
But then , McCain recounts , he tried a different approach with a prison officer nicknamed " Bug . ' '
" Desperate , I tried to bargain with him .
' Take me to the hospital and I 'll give you the information you want . '
I did n't intend to keep my word , reasoning that after my injuries had been treated , I would be strong enough to deal with the consequences of not holding up my end of the bargain , '' McCain wrote .
As for never cooperating with Vietnamese , McCain also admits he eventually gave up information about his ship and Navy squadron .
" I regret very much having done so , '' he wrote .
Thompson needs to get his story straight .
This claim is False .

When Charles Darwin boarded the H.M.S. Beagle in 1831 as the ship 's naturalist , he had only one challenge — to keep himself entertained for the next five years .
His scientific assignment was to collect anything that crawled , swam or flew , and to keep track of all sorts of biological measures such as water temperature and currents .
But really , boredom was the big problem .
Charles Darwin came of age as a scientist during the Golden Age of Exploration ; doing science meant crossing the globe in search of specimens , working by living and breathing biology in the field .
That era in science is long over , and it has been replaced by a much more dangerous mission — figuring out how to do science amid political strife and disintegrating habitats .
Ran Boytner of the University of California , Los Angeles , and Lynn Swartz Dodd of the University of Southern California know all about the modern conundrum of the field scientist .
Over the past five years they have been working on an agreement between Palestinians and Israelis to protect thousands of ancient artifacts and delicate archaeological sites from political bickering .
And their situation is common for field scientists today .
Over the past three decades , archaeologists , animal behaviors , botanists and others have had to curtail their research , or step right into the conflict , to do their work .
It 's no longer just about science , it 's also about politics , poverty and diplomacy , subjects they do n’t teach in graduate school .
For my field , primatology , this difficult situation became shockingly real back in 1975 when four research assistants were kidnapped from Jane Goodall 's chimpanzee site in Tanzania .
After months of talks , they were released by Zairian rebels , but the field of primatology was never the same .
Every primate researcher who goes abroad , every professor who takes students into the field , worries endlessly about safety .
And these worries have changed the path of research and affect what we know , or will ever know , about monkeys and apes .
For example , it 's now nearly impossible to watch the elusive Bonobo in The Democratic Republic of Congo because of civil war ; some say that only someone with a death wish would walk into a forest there .
However , somehow a group of Wildlife Conservation Society scientists did just that and discovered a previously unknown trove of critically endangered western lowland gorillas .
Primatologists have tried to adapt , but it is n’t easy .
Some hire locals , with rifles , to walk beside them over hill and dale following animals , knowing that at any moment a bullet might whiz by .
Or they switch their study sites to more peaceful countries .
But to walk away from years or decades of the intricate details of animals that you have grown to know and care about is like throwing your life , and the animals , away .
For every field primatologist , there is also the specter of habitat destruction , especially in countries sunk in poverty .
Do you fight to save the habitat and the animals , or do you come down on the side of people living in poverty who might need the life - saving resources of a forest ?
And there is the guilt of knowing the road you need for access to a field site is the same road that opens up virgin forest to corporate exploitation and poaching .
Scientists of Darwin's time and those of today are linked by a love of nature and a curiosity about how it works .
And they share is a sense of urgency that compels them off to far - flung places .
But for Darwin and his ilk , it was about gathering nature in all its complexity .
Today , it 's all about keeping that nature from destruction .

The federal government would need to quarantine infected households and ban public gatherings to contain pandemic flu , according to a computer simulation study conducted by researchers from Virginia Tech and published in the " You would n't go out to the movies .
You would n't congregate with people , " said researcher Stephen Eubank .
" You 'd pretty much be staying home with the doors and windows battened down .
"
The consensus among health experts is that a pandemic , or global epidemic , of influenza is inevitable .
The last such pandemic , in 1918 , killed between 40 and 100 million people .
Because of the belief that a pandemic cannot be avoided , researchers are instead looking into ways to limit its effects .
In the current study , researchers used a computer to model the hypothetical spread of flu pandemic in the city of Chicago under various containment scenarios .
They found that a vigorous early response could reduce the infection rate by 80 percent .
" Depending on how fast it is spreading , it seems as though you really need to throw everything you can at it , " Eubank said .
Under the containment scenario , people infected with or exposed to the disease would be confined to their homes , and schools and day - care centers would be shut down , as would places of public gathering like bars , restaurants and theaters .
Offices and factories would remain open but would operate at reduced capacity due to quarantines .
The extreme measures would need to continue for months , until a vaccine was developed .
" We are not talking about simply shutting things down for a day or two like a snow day , " Eubank said .
" It 's a sustained period for weeks or months .
" The computer model assumed widespread compliance with the response plan , but Eubank says he does n't anticipate that as a problem .
"
In the context of a very infectious disease that is killing a large number of the people , I think large fractions of the population wo n't have a problem with these recommendations , " he said .
Joanna Philbin Lands Three Book Deal ( Photos )
Joanna Philbin , 34 year old daughter of talk show host Regis Philbin and Joy Philbin , is about to become a published author .
According to Page Six , Joanna 's agent Rebecca Oliver at Endeavor has sold a three book deal to publisher Little , Brown imprint Poppy .
Joanna 's first book , The Daughters of ...
Club tells the story of three childhood friends - the geeky daughter of a supermodel , the flat broke daughter of a famous business tycoon , and the self conscious daughter of a pop star .
The first installment will debut in 2010 .
We 're not sure if the working title is set in stone - it looks like it is crying out for something more .
Regis invited his daughter to co-host his Friday show to share her book deal .
She also interviewed Robert Downey Jr. and Will Farrell .

It 's long been evident to beachcombers after rainstorms , but now it 's official : Marine debris is getting worse .
A panel of scientists took a hard look at the issue and came to the conclusion that the tonnage of plastic and other debris swirling in the sea is likely to increase throughout this century .
Its key recommendation : The United States needs to take a leadership role in cleaning up its own act and coaxing other nations to follow .
" Despite all the regulations and limitations over the last 20 years , there are still large quantities of waste and litter in the oceans , " said Keith R. Criddle , a marine policy professor at University of Alaska in Juneau .
He was the chairman of a National Research Council committee asked by Congress to assess how well national and international laws are doing to halt the profusion of trash in the oceans .
The answer : not very well .
The committee 's 224 - page report breaks down the issue and focuses mostly on how to reduce the trash that is dumped intentionally or inadvertently into the ocean from ships and boats .
Although this accounts for roughly one - fifth of plastic debris in the ocean , it 's the easiest problem to solve .
The rest of the oceanic trash comes from land , blown by the wind or washed off city streets into streams and rivers , then to the sea .
The way to halt this steady flow of garbage involves either weaning society 's addiction to the convenience of products made of plastic -- which can take decades or centuries to decompose -- or changing human behavior on a massive scale .
So the committee largely focused at solutions at sea , such as tightening up the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships ( MARPOL ) , which went into force in 1988 to ban plastic being jettisoned .
But the convention still allows many other types of garbage dumping .
The report recommends a zero solid - waste discharge goal , as is practiced by some of the more conscientious shipping companies .
The panel 's report also makes a number of recommendations to decrease the amount of " ghost nets " and other plastic fishing gear that is lost or dumped at sea and continues to do its job : entangle animals .
The problem is that it 's not just fish , but whales , seals , turtles , birds and other marine life continually snared by this debris that rides the currents and collects along the shoreline of islands and continents .
A key solution is giving commercial fishing boats easy access to port trash bins headed for the landfill and incentives to use them .
As it stands now , ports charge fishermen top dollar per pound to dispose of trash , including heavy lines and nets .
So for some fishermen , it 's easier and more economical to simply dump them overboard -- when no one is looking .
This is particularly true among Asian countries , as is evident by the debris that washes up on the Northwest Hawaiian islands .
Some experts in the cleanup business believe it would be more economical to pay fishermen a bounty to dispose of their own nets and lines properly than pay crews to cut them off coral reefs or from around the bodies of suffering marine mammals .
The report also delves into the idea of a " no fault " policy to encourage reporting of lost fishing gear and make it politically feasible to mark floats , gill nets , long lines and other gear with owner 's identification -- meaning fishermen in the United States and other countries .
Scientists say it 's feasible to embed chemical markers in nets and lines so that each one can be traced to when and where it was sold .
Fishermen do n't want to lose valuable gear , which is expensive to replace .
The report said it is difficult , if not impossible to tell the difference between willful abandonment and unpreventable loss in the risky fishing industry .
To make fishermen strictly liable for their derelict gear and the damage it causes , the report said , " would be problematic and could lead fishermen to underreport losses or obscure the location of gear losses . "

The latest Franklin and Marshall College of registered Pennsylvania voters finds Democrat Barack Obama leading Republican John McCain 44%-36 % .
The margin is closer among likely voters .
Obama leads this group 46 % - 41 % .
In general , each candidate leads with their expected bases .
Obama leads with younger voters , non-white voters , college grads , women , and in the city of Philadelphia .
McCain leads with Protestants , fundamentalists , and those who live in northeastern and northwestern Pennsylvania .
Obama leads with Independents 49 % - 27 % .
Seventy seven percent of Pennsylvanians said that the country is heading in the wrong direction , and 37 % said that they are economically worse off than they were last year .
It is no shock that Obama leads with both of these groups .
Although the recession has n’t hit all of Pennsylvania quite as hard as other states , the economy is always the top issue in the Keystone state , and 2008 is no different .
43 % of those surveyed said that the economy is the issue that will most influence their vote .
The bad news for McCain is that 55 % of those asked said that McCain will mostly continue Bush ’s economic policies .
Sixty nine percent of those asked said that their family had suffered some form of economic hardship in the past year , and these people support Obama over McCain 51 % - 27 % .

The biggest problem Obama faces in the state is the experience question .
51 % of respondents said that they would be concerned if Obama was elected president .
Thirty percent of people in each party cited Obama ’s lack of experience as the basis for their concern .
Pennsylvania is the second oldest state in the country so one would assume that McCain would have a chance here .
The problem for McCain is that the state is also home to base of older Democrats who are located around the Pittsburgh area .
Obama currently leads McCain 50 % - 30 % there .
While Pennsylvanians are concerned about Obama ’s inexperience , their greater concern is the economy , and McCain ’s lack of an economic message is hurting him in the state .
Pennsylvania is a state that the Republicans keep fooling themselves into believing that they have a chance at , but they really do n’t .
Obama currently leads with all age and income groups in the state .
National Republicans keep coming into the state with the wrong economic message , and they keep losing .
By this point in time , this really is n’t a surprise .
Unless McCain gets a clue about the economy , and the message that Pennsylvanians want to hear , the GOP will lose the state again .

Drugging children for gender differences could be harmful
by Steve Edelman
Far more males than females are diagnosed with ADHD .
Is this a result of diagnostic bias ?
There is no denying that boys are different than girls .
Does this mean that boys should be routinely given drugs like Ritalin ?
The fact that they seem less interested in disruptive behavior when drugged does not necessarily mean that they are being more attentive .
An understanding of the gender differences in male and female brains can help in the search for alternative approaches to dealing with innate gender differences in behavior .
Our brains have evolved little in terms of instincts and natural function .
As Thomas Hartmann documents in Hunters in a Farmer ’s World , there was an original division of labor between men and women that is maintained by biology in spite of modern attempts to make males and females equal .
Men were the hunters .
They explored , they moved , their creative efforts focused on obtaining animal protein for the entire tribe .
Women rarely went hunting .
They stayed at home ( cave , tent , hut , etc. ) .
Women might wander within earshot of their child ’s cries in order to gather vegetable material for food , medicine and clothing ( the ability to pay attention to two or more things – gathering while not concentrating so much on this activity that they forget to remain aware of the activities of their child ) .
A quote from Project Lab expresses it well :
“ Hunters have a unique way of concentrating that one author ( Hartmann ) calls ‘ global concentration . ’
While concentrating , every sense is turned on and is rapidly processing information ( e.g. , sight , sound , smell , feel , intuition , etc. ) .
It is nearly impossible to sneak up on a hunter and they are usually extraordinarily observant of their environment .
In the average classroom , however , this characteristic becomes a liability when minor distractions constantly tug at their consciousness and compete with the teacher and / or the textbook for attention . ”
How many times have men gotten into trouble when their wives or significant others told them something while they were watching a football game ?
Most men who get involved with what they are watching on television have been on the receiving end of complaints from wives , who feel that their husbands are being inattentive to their needs .
The best help is to develop a method to redirect attention .
Men and women need to work out an understanding of their attention differences .
This is significantly related to a major problem for boys in school .
Boys in school can’t pay attention if there are distractions .
They may be thinking about a girl , or planning what they want to do after school .
The teacher ( usually a female in elementary school classes ) can become concerned when a boy ’s attention seems to have drifted .
It may help when the teacher consistently uses phrases such as “ This is important class , ” or claps her hands for emphasis to get attention .
One of the best teachers I know ( a male , third grade teacher ) uses several tricks to gain the attention of his class , including a rather loud air horn that he keeps on his desk .
Another important difference between boys and girls that makes it more likely for boys to be diagnosed with ADHD or ADD is developmental .
Most educational psychologists and sophisticated teachers know that boys , as a group , learn to read at a slower pace than girls .
Boys do not catch up to the reading level of girls until the sixth or seventh grade .
Requests to read at a higher level can cause inattentive and disruptive behavior .
( Girls , as a group , are much slower than boys at learning math and math concepts . )
Traumatic brain injuries on the left side where most people process language demonstrate that there are important differences between male and female brains .
An injury to the language processing area of the brain is usually much more catastrophic for males than it is for females .
Failing to take into account gender differences in the way the brain functions could lead to gender bias in the diagnosis of ADD / ADHD .
A fourth important difference also increases the tendency for more boys to be diagnosed with ADD / ADHD than girls :
The social maturity factor .
Many trained professionals say that boys are slower to develop social skills .
Girls in school frequently make negative comments about the social maturity of the boys in their grade .
This may explain why girls tend to form relationships with older boys .
A lack of social maturity is part of the diagnostic framework of identifying children with ADD / ADHD , and once again , it is women ( as teachers ) who do most of the referring .
What , then , is the purpose of claiming gender bias against males in the identification of ADD / ADHD ?
First , we must get past the step of bashing women or men .
Then educators in the US urgently need to reevaluate their basis for the all too frequent diagnosis of ADD / ADHD .
Drugs should be the last choice for problem solving , rather than the first .

Some spectrum watchers were disappointed by the results of the recent 700MHz auction .
They had grand dreams of Google swooping in , dropping millions of dollars , and picking up a nationwide license that it would use to offer high - speed wireless broadband that could be accessed from any device , would support any application , and which would be resold at wholesale rates to anyone else — " line - sharing " come to wireless .
While the dream vanished beneath the cold reality of Google 's merely strategic bidding , the basic idea may still come true ; Sprint Nextel and Clearwire are promising that their new WiMAX network will support both open access and wholesale access and that it will reach 140 million people by the end of 2010 .
A lengthy document filed this week with the FCC asks for permission to merge the 2.5GHz spectrum assets of Sprint and Clearwire into " New Clearwire , " the company backed by Sprint , Clearwire , Intel , Time Warner , Google , and Bright House .
In the filing , Clearwire makes the case that it will provide true " third pipe " Internet access to home and mobile users at speeds of 6 M bps ( and 3 M bps uplink ) .
The companies involved know how to make the right promises :
" New Clearwire will permit consumers to use any lawful device that they want so long as it is compatible with and not harmful to the WiMAX network
" New Clearwire also will permit consumers to download and use any software applications , content , or services they desire , subject only to reasonable network management practices and law enforcement and public safety considerations
" New Clearwire will offer non-exclusive wholesale access to its network
" New Clear wire will deploy an advanced mobile WiMAX broadband network that will cover up to 140 million people in the United States in 30 months "
Both Sprint and Clearwire have constructed WiMAX networks .
Sprint's , which was to have been marketed under the name Xohm , is up and undergoing testing in Chicago and the Washington , DC area , while Clearwire currently offers service in 50 markets in the US and Europe and is building its first mobile WiMAX service in Portland .
Skepticism about WiMAX as a technology has n't yet been completely dispelled , but Sprint and Clearwire claim that " each of these systems has consistently demonstrated the ability to deliver up to 6 M bps downlink and up to 3 M bps uplink while the end user is moving at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour . "
The combined company 's build out schedule looks aggressive , but the new Clearwire is spurred on by billions in cash ponied up by its partners and by the imminent 4G threat coming from AT&T , Verizon , and others .
Most other wireless operators in the US have already announced plans to develop Long Term Evolution ( LTE ) - based 4G networks , but Clearwire could beat most of them to market with an aggressive deployment schedule .
With the backing of Intel , which has its own grandiose plans to slap WiMAX radios into tons of laptops , Clearwire appears to have at least a real chance of making inroads into the broadband market for both home and mobile users .
And executives announced today that they hope to cover 220 million people by 2017 .
One interesting tidbit that emerged from the filing was the fact that Sprint , Comcast , Time Warner Cable , and Bright House Networks " have already committed to enter into non-exclusive wholesale agreements with New Clearwire . "
Under the arrangement , the companies will become mobile virtual network operators ( MVNOs ) that can resell Clearwire services under the own brands , giving the cable companies in particular a way to offer the ridiculously - named " quadruple play " of voice , video , data , and wireless .
The pitch is simple : pay one bill and have seamless access to a high - speed network while at home and a 6 M bps national wireless data network the moment you walk out the door .
Google also has the right to resell service , but we 're skeptical such a thing would happen .
Instead , it seems far more likely that the company will try to boost the network 's attractiveness by building " novel Internet applications and services for WiMAX devices operating over the New Clearwire and other WiMAX broadband networks , " just as the filing says it will .
And he told the 150 or so of us to forget about Single Payer , forget about getting Rove to testify or impeaching Bush .
Forget about all that .
Because as we learned in 2000 , elections matter .
Until after November 4 , we should do nothing but WORK to make sure that this election results in electing a President and larger majorities in the Senate and House in order to make those things we want more likely .
On November 5 , we can go back to work on each of our individual causes .

And this from National Impeachment Network co-founder Cynthia Papermaster :
“ Conyers has been giving us this message all along .
John Conyers is NOT correct that an impeachment inquiry would hurt Obama ’s chances , but his and the leadership ’s flawed judgment is going to rule the day and it could possibly cost Obama and the Democrats the election .
I told Wexler ’s Chief of Staff Eric Johnson , his Legislative Director Ellen McLaren , and Wexler himself that convincing the Obama campaign that starting a hearing will help Obama win , and then letting Conyers know to go ahead , would help all Democrats if they do n’t cave to the media spin about it being a partisan stunt .
It would have to be completely behind the scenes ; Obama ca n’t be seen to play a part .
Eric was all ears .
He even embellished the plan and said he ’d talk to Robert about it .
The Democrats are stuck in old , illogical thinking and this is one reason they have lost in the past .
It was only by coming out with strong rhetoric against the war that they won in 2006 .
The party has n’t made the connection that ending the war equates with winning .
If they did get it they would overrule the blue dogs and work to end it .
So if their anti-war stance was acceptable to the media and public , then why would n’t impeachment be acceptable to the public ?
Ca n’t the Judiciary Committee defend itself from the right wing ?
Do n’t the numbers show that voters want accountability , especially now that they ’re seeing the economy crumble ?
But the Democrats do n’t learn , do they ?
Even when they have a winning strategy staring them in the face , they flub it .
The Democrats make mistake after mistake .
They ca n’t even figure out how to win !
( I do n’t agree with those who say the Democrats do n’t care if they win or not because they take money from corporations too so it does n’t matter who ’s in the White House . )
I was going to keep this strategy under wraps , but since I ’m now in favor of the blank vote strategy , I ’m sharing it .
If you know someone who can talk to the campaign , like Bobby Kennedy Jr. , please go ahead and work it .
[ Ed . Note :
The blank vote strategy is to make clear to Democrats that in key districts with competitive races , we favor a write - in vote of “ None of the Above ” if the Democrat has been in breech of their oath of office to defend the Constitution by not actively pushing for impeachment of Bush and Cheney . ]

A Williamsburg artist who sought to export his American right of free expression to China , and was abused by the tyrants of Tiananmen Square for his trouble , is back in Brooklyn .
James Powderly , an internationally acclaimed light artist , was jailed by Chinese authorities in Beijing and held for six days during the Olympics ; five other American artists in his group were also held .
They were in Beijing to help a group of activists use lasers to project a pro-Tibet message on the side of a building near Tiananmen Square — but Chinese officials , eager to stifle any protest during the Olympics , nabbed him and his collaborators before they could flip the switch on Aug. 19 .
Powderly said that prison guards believed — correctly — that he was the man who assembled the laser but not the protest ’s organizer .
They accused him of trying to “ murder China , ” he said .
“ We know that you did n’t murder China , but you made the knife and you ’re going to take credit for it — unless you show us the hand , ’ they said , ” in an apparent bid to learn the leader ’s identity , Powderly said .
Safely back in his Grand Street apartment , Powderly told The Brooklyn Paper how he was deprived of sleep , water , food and medicine , cuffed into painful positions , and had $ 2,000 stolen from his bank account — “ non-lethal methods of waging war on people ” that he considers “ just as insidious as waterboarding . ”
After hours without sleep and threats against their lives and the lives of their loved ones , Powderly and the other Americans began to crack .
“ That ’s when I started to realize that I ’m really good at being a douche - baggy art star , but I ’m really bad at this secret agent business , ” he said .
Powderly said he first realized that his plan to project the words “ Free Tibet ” was drawing the attention of Chinese authorities when he noticed that a woman was trailing him on his way to a bar on the night of his arrest .
“ I gave her the slip by standing by the subway door and waiting for it to close , then jumping through , ” he said .
“ Then I saw her staring at me out the subway window when the train pulled away . ”
When the 32 - year - old artist , co-founder of the Graffiti Research Lab — whose ephemeral works have appeared on the base of the Brooklyn Bridge and the walls inside the Museum of Modern Art — arrived at the bar , he told his friends that he had been followed , but it was already too late .
More than 30 cops nabbed the activists and artists one - by - one when they left the bar , placing them in unmarked black SUVs while cameramen from the state - run Chinese press filmed the arrests , Powderly said .
Police brought the Americans to the basement of an upscale restaurant where they were each held in individual rooms and interrogated for 26 straight hours .
“ They were grilling us about who we were and what we were doing , ” said Powderly , who had successfully assembled a laser in Beijing and projected “ Free Beer ” on a wall , but had not yet made any kind of political statement when he was arrested .
“ We had all agreed in advance that we would treat them like mushrooms — feed them bulls–t and keep them in the dark . ”
But it was n’t so easy .
After many hours , the Americans began to cave in .
Powderly said that the police knew that he and his collaborators were involved in some kind of political protest — and their high - tech projection lasers had convinced Chinese authorities that they were more dangerous than most foreign activists .
Powderly understood that projecting a pro-Tibetan message could get him in trouble , but he thought that his punishment would end in deportation — not incarceration .
Lucky to be an American
“ These were the things we signed up for — but they were n’t things we expected to happen , ” he said .
“ I understood that the repercussions could be serious .
If I was n’t American — if I was Tibetan , a pro-democracy Chinese national , or a member of the Falun Gong — I would be taken somewhere and shot in the back of the head .
But I thought they would just send us home . ”
After more than a day of continuous questioning , cops drove the artists and activists — who assumed they were headed to the airport for deportation — to a Beijing jail , where they were stripped , photographed , screened , separated from each other , and placed in cells with other prisoners .
Powderly joined 11 other prisoners in a cell with only eight beds , no potable water , and bright lights that illuminated the tiny room 24 - hours a day to keep the detainees from sleeping .
“ When I first got put into a detention cell I thought I was going to have to fight someone like a mad man or get owned — then this guy gives me a blanket and a candy bar , and I ’m thinking I ’m already being made his bitch , ” he said .
“ But it turns out that none of these people had committed crimes — they were all there for visa issues and paperwork problems , and they were doing everything they could to help each other survive . ”
Despite the camaraderie between the captives , prison life was anything but comfortable .
Whenever Powderly was able to fall asleep , guards awoke him , brought him to a caged interrogation room , cuffed him tightly around the waist to a metal chair atop an intimidating bloodstain , and questioned him about the plot “ to murder China , ” he said .
Throughout his incarceration , Powderly survived on a hard - boiled egg for breakfast , and a bowl of rice and broth for lunch and dinner .
The tap water in the cell was undrinkable , so the prisoners shared bottles of lukewarm shower water .
Despite daily requests , Powderly was never given his medication for the stomach disease Crohn’s .
The threat :
You ’ll never leave
On Aug. 22 , Powderly and his collaborators — whose last contact with the outside world was a message on the website Twitter on the day of their arrest — met with representatives from the United States consulate who informed them that they were sentenced to 10 days in jail for “ upsetting public order . ”
But Chinese officials told them otherwise .
“ It was said to us constantly that we would never leave this place and that there was nothing that we could do , ” he said .
After another day behind bars , an announcement crackled over the prison loudspeaker , and Powderly ’s cellmates cheered .
“ One of the other prisoners comes over to me and says : ‘ You ’re going home ! ” Powderly said .
“ Everyone was hugging me and celebrating , but all I could think was that these guys were n’t going home , and I do n’t know if they ever will . ”
But before Powderly and the other artists were released , cops removed $ 2,000 from their bank accounts — fees police said would cover airline tickets to America .
When some of the activists refused to fork over their cash , police roughed them up , Powderly said .
Hours later , the artists and activists were en route to Los Angeles , gladly pigging out on airline food — which did n’t sit well for Powderly after a week of meager portions .
But the cash — and his lunch — were n’t the only thing that Powderly lost in the ordeal .
“ Initially , I was thinking that everything was fine , ” he said .
“ I had this big smile on my face — I was ready to soak up all the famousness , but then it dawned on me : I ’m going through all the stages of traumatic stress .
I had something when I went in that I did n’t leave with .
Torture strips you of something you ca n’t get back . ”
But even though he is n’t allowed to visit China again , Powderly — who says he undertook the project in defense of freedom of speech — is n’t done protesting against the authoritarian regime .
“ I plan to make the Chinese government regret not keeping my ass there the rest of my life , ” he said .

What do our officials most fear ?
They fear the public ’s loss of confidence .
Events are driving their improvised attempts to stem a general loss of confidence in the dollar , in them , the financial and monetary system , and the government as a whole .
It is not clear that they recognize that this is their greatest fear .
But even if they do recognize that this is their greatest fear , they have no clear roadmap for dealing with it .
Barack Obama ’s speeches have kindled some hope .
If and when he takes office , he can maintain that hope and a degree of confidence for a spell , by strong government action , for , despite its perverse effects , strong measures are what give many voters confidence in the system .
They feel good if something is being done , even if it means they ’ll pay double or triple in the end .
A recent news headline reads " Obama gives Bernanke vote of confidence . "
Obama is not even President yet , and he is already trying to bolster confidence in the system .
On May 13 , 2008 , Chairman Ben S. Bernanke spoke of many things , as he often does , of economic growth , of housing losses , of liquidity , of financial strains , and so on .
And in doing so , he obscured his main fear .
He fears our fears .
He fears fear itself .
He fears our loss of confidence in the currency and the monetary system and in the entire system itself .
If he does n’t , he should or soon will .
Such a loss of confidence is inevitable .
Bernanke does not fully and openly express these broadscale fears .
It would not be politic to do so .
He might fan the flames of fear .
When he is alone with himself in quiet moments , do these large fears cross his mind ?
Maybe , but it is just possible that he is not fully aware that these are his main fears .
His self - knowledge may be deficient .
In his speech , he expressed only part of this fear - cluster ; but he expressed more than enough to support my statement that our officials fear a loss of confidence .
I quote :
" Walter Bagehot ’s Lombard Street , published in 1873 , remains one of the classic treatments of the role of the central bank in the management of financial crises .
Bagehot noted that the basis of a successful credit system is confidence .
In one passage , he writes , u2018 Credit means that a certain confidence is given , and a certain trust reposed .
Is that trust justified ?
and is that confidence wise ?
These are the cardinal questions ’ ( p. 11 ) .
He pointed out that confidence is particularly important in banking and in other situations in which the lender ’s own liabilities are viewed as very liquid by its creditors .
In such situations , as Bagehot put it , u2018 … where the ‘ liabilities , ’ or promises to pay , are so large , and the time at which to pay them , if exacted , is so short , ’ borrowers must demonstrate u2018an instant capacity to meet engagements ’ ( p. 11 ) . "
And Bernanke went on to note that " the loss of confidence , even if not originally justified by fundamentals , will tend to be self - confirming .
If the loss of confidence becomes more general , a broader crisis may ensue . "
In this passage , he puts his finger on the larger fear , which is a general loss of confidence .
The Fed Chairman understands that confidence in the financial system and in banks in particular is the foundation of the system .
Without it , lending evaporates and the economic system grinds to a halt until people arrange new channels of borrowing and lending .
Bernanke , being a central banker , sees the solution to this as providing liquidity in a host of new and creative ways .
It is the " how " of providing liquidity that interests Bernanke .
The techniques of providing liquidity while not introducing moral hazard and not inflating the money supply are what fascinate him .
Our other major financial official is Henry Paulson , who is Secretary of the Treasury .
I need only provide the titles of two of his speeches to make my point .
On July 22 , 2008 , he gave a speech with the title : " Reinforcing Market Stability and Confidence . "
He stated unequivocally that these were his " highest priority . "
He means it .
On June 5 , 2002 , while still Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs Group , Inc. , he made a speech titled " Restoring Investor Confidence : An Agenda for Change . "
Paulson in his speech tackles the topic of confidence in a very broad way .
He touches upon banks , failing banks , the IndyMac failure , the FDIC , the financial markets , and non -bank financial institutions .
Paulson is always attempting to reassure the people that the system is sound , so that they will have confidence in it .
On January 22 , 2008 , for example , he said , " I continue to have confidence in the underlying strength of the global economy . "
Paulson , like Bernanke , thinks in terms of confidence in the system .
And so does a former Secretary of the Treasury , Lawrence Summers .
He supported the bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because , for one thing , " Failure to pass even this minimal measure would undermine confidence . "
Summers weights the confidence factor very , very highly because his list of reservations about the bailout bill is very long .
Is the focus that these officials have on confidence misplaced ?
Not at all .
They are all right on target .
Where we can fault them , if we must , is that they do not express clearly and cogently enough the precise nature of their fear that the American public will lose confidence .
They raise the issue clearly enough , but it is always to pour the syrup of comforting reassurances into the public ’s ears so that any troubles will be smothered in sweet talk .
If we want to understand what the most basic issue of confidence is really about , we need to look elsewhere .
One good place is Human Action by Ludwig von Mises .
Chapter 17 deals with Indirect Exchange , that is , exchange using money and other media .
In a pre-FDIC ( Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ) system , a bank traditionally stands ready to redeem its notes in money ( like gold or silver ) .
The bank ’s assets , however , are mostly illiquid securities like mortgages and loans .
The bank needs to manage its position such that if called upon to redeem a large volume of notes in money , it can .
But in this system , the banks issue money - substitutes or what Mises calls fiduciary media .
These are notes in excess of its available money .
Like Bagehot , Mises notes that confidence in the bank is essential to the bank ’s survival :
" People deal with money - substitutes as if they were money because they are fully confident that it will be possible to exchange them at any time without delay and without cost against money .
We may call those who share in this confidence and are therefore ready to deal with money - substitutes as if they were money , the clients of the issuing banker , bank , or authority . "
In the post -FDIC system that we have , banks do not redeem notes in gold and silver .
They do n’t redeem them at all !
There is confidence in this arrangement , not because the FDIC exists with its meager insurance fund , but only because depositors regard the banking system ’s assets — its loans and mortgages — as sound .
Liquidity is not an issue because the central bank can print certificates on demand .
If bank assets in general come under suspicion , confidence will evaporate , nonetheless .
Mises points out that the bank can undermine confidence ( in the pre-FDIC system ) in several ways .
One way is to increase its fiduciary media too greatly , at which point the public may engage in a run on the bank and demand redemption .
The public will become suspicious when the bank over - issues notes because it is in the bank ’s interest to take on any loan whatever that pays a rate of interest greater than the cost of issuing money - substitutes .
Hence , the bank will be tempted to make bad loans as it extends credit .
Sound familiar ?
Nowadays , depositors who are insured do n’t seem to worry about this , which means that a vital depositor control over bank lending is absent .
The gap is supposedly filled in by bank regulators and examiners , but the subprime fiasco is evidence that such measures have failed to control bad loans .
However , there is another check on the system .
As investors see that the assets of the banking system are unsound , they mark down the stock and bond prices of the banks .
The banks find their capital costs rising and they are forced to cut back on loans .
Some banks go bankrupt and the stock and bondholders lose , as well as large depositors who are uninsured .
A justifiable loss in confidence of the system results in its contraction , and that negatively affects the entire economy .
The second way in which banks can undermine confidence is this :
" It must not increase the amount of fiduciary media at such a rate and with such speed that the clients get the conviction that the rise in prices will continue endlessly at an accelerated pace .
For if the public believes that this is the case , they will reduce their cash holdings , flee into u2018real ’ values , and bring about the crack - up boom .
It is impossible to imagine the approach of this catastrophe without assuming that its first manifestation consists in the evanescence of confidence . "
This path faces us even in the post -FDIC system because if people lose confidence in the money when they observe a rapid rise in prices of goods , then they still have the option of converting cash and fixed - income assets into real assets .
Done in great volume , this conversion causes a rash of speculation , asset and commodity price bubbles , and an eventual crash .
Our officials are worried about a loss in confidence , and they are trying to stem it by shoring up institutions like Fannie Mae .
The loss in confidence is coming from one basic source , which is the banking system ’s over issue of fiduciary media .
This has had the effects of a large volume of bad loans and asset price bubbles .
It may lead into the further effect of a flight into real - valued assets .
The damage to bank assets is system - wide .
If the lion ’s share of the banks and other lenders have made bad loans or made loans that have gone bad , then the amounts become unmanageably large for taxpayers and their government to handle .
There is , in fact , no action that government can devise that will not make the situation worse .
Bailouts are bad .
Nationalization is bad .
Inflation is bad .
A loss in confidence in the system is justified because the system is faulty to begin with .
There is nothing for it but to end legal tender laws and go to fully free markets in banking and money .
There is no need to legislate that gold , silver , or anything else serve as money .
People acting in free markets can decide that on their own .
The answer is free banking .
If there is one thing that our officials fear more than a loss of confidence in the existing banking system , it is free banking .
Von Mises knew of this .
I close with several quotations of his on free banking :
" It is extremely difficult for our contemporaries to conceive of the conditions of free banking because they take government interference with banking for granted and as necessary . "
" Today even the most bigoted étatists cannot deny that all the alleged evils of free banking count little when compared with the disastrous effects of the tremendous inflations which the privileged and government - controlled banks have brought about . "
" The establishment of free banking was never seriously considered precisely because it would have been too efficient in restricting credit expansion . "
" Free banking is the only method available for the prevention of the dangers inherent in credit expansion . "
" Only free banking would have rendered the market economy secure against crises and depressions . "

12.10 Full - Text Search Functions
MATCH ( col1 , col2 , ... ) AGAINST ( expr [ search_modifier ])
search_modifier : { IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE | IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE WITH QUERY EXPANSION | IN BOOLEAN MODE | WITH QUERY EXPANSION }
MySQL has support for full - text indexing and searching :
Full - text searching is performed using MATCH ( ) ... AGAINST syntax .
MATCH ( ) takes a comma-separated list that names the columns to be searched .
AGAINST takes a string to search for , and an optional modifier that indicates what type of search to perform .
The search string must be a string value that is constant during query evaluation .
This rules out , for example , a table column because that can differ for each row .
There are three types of full - text searches :
A natural language search interprets the search string as a phrase in natural human language ( a phrase in free text ) .
There are no special operators , with the exception of double quote ( " ) characters .
The stopword list applies .
For more information about stopword lists , see Section 12.10.4 , “ Full - Text Stopwords ” .
Full - text searches are natural language searches if the IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE modifier is given or if no modifier is given .
For more information , see Section 12.10.1 , “ Natural Language Full - Text Searches ” .
A boolean search interprets the search string using the rules of a special query language .
The string contains the words to search for .
It can also contain operators that specify requirements such that a word must be present or absent in matching rows , or that it should be weighted higher or lower than usual .
Certain common words ( stopwords ) are omitted from the search index and do not match if present in the search string .
The IN BOOLEAN MODE modifier specifies a boolean search .
For more information , see Section 12.10.2 , “ Boolean Full - Text Searches ” .
A query expansion search is a modification of a natural language search .
The search string is used to perform a natural language search .
Then words from the most relevant rows returned by the search are added to the search string and the search is done again .
The query returns the rows from the second search .
The IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE WITH QUERY EXPANSION or WITH QUERY EXPANSION modifier specifies a query expansion search .
For more information , see Section 12.10.3 , “ Full - Text Searches with Query Expansion ” .
For information about FULLTEXT query performance , see Section 8.3.5 , “ Column Indexes ” .
For more information about InnoDB FULLTEXT indexes , see Section 15.6.2.4 , “ InnoDB FULLTEXT Indexes ” .
Constraints on full - text searching are listed in Section 12.10.5 , “ Full - Text Restrictions ” .
Santa Barbara County became a symbol of the national environmental movement ’s passionate opposition to offshore oil drilling when an oil spill devastated its coastline in 1969 .
On Tuesday , it became a symbol of the changing national mood as its board of supervisors debated whether to welcome new wells along California ’s shores .
The supervisors voted 3 to 2 on Tuesday to end the county ’s opposition to offshore drilling , although the vote will have no practical impact on state or federal policies .
But the speed with which opinions have changed in Santa Barbara County as gasoline prices have climbed has been astonishing .
The vote there reinforces , at the local level , a shift evident in national polls and in the delicate willingness of Democratic leaders like Senator Barack Obama , the presumptive presidential nominee , and the House speaker , Nancy Pelosi of California , to open the door to limited coastal drilling .
Three weeks ago , the Public Policy Institute of California released a poll showing that 51 percent of Californians now approve of offshore drilling , a 10 - point increase in a single year .
“ I do n’t think any of us expected to see the day when there ’d be more than 50 percent support for oil drilling , ” said Mark Baldassare , the institute ’s research director .

Click to viewWill Smith 's drunk - and - disorderly superhero movie , Hancock , hits theaters today , a full three days early .
You can't help but wonder if Warner Bros .
is trying to get the movie out there before all the bad buzz , and horrendous reviews , take effect .
The sad thing is , there are a bunch of ways that Hancock could have turned into a pretty decent film .
Our review , with spoilers and a list of where Hancock went wrong , below .
Advertisement
Ways Hancock could have sucked considerably less :
# 1 : Do the cruddy - superhero thing right
The first half of Hancock is a watered down version of the comedy that those trailers promised you : Hancock is a superhero who 's fallen into disgrace , thanks to hard - drinking roughneck ways .
This is a premise with almost unlimited potential , and yet the movie still manages to flub it .
The movie repeats the same joke a dozen times : someone calls Hancock an asshole , and Hancock gets pissed , so the guy calls Hancock an asshole a second time .
Hancock scowls and says , " Call me an asshole one ... more ... time . "
And the other person says " asshole " one more time .
Then Hancock uses his superpowers to fuck this person up in a hilarious way .
The joke works once or twice , but then you start to wonder : who would ever knowingly fuck with Hancock ?
He 's bulletproof and has super strength !
People know all about him and his superpowers , but they still challenge him .
Do n't they know how it 's going to end up ?
It 's almost as if the scriptwriters think the fact that people do n't respect Hancock means they do n't fear him .
It would have made more sense - and been funnier - for people to trash - talk Hancock and yet be terrified of getting in his way .

# 2 : Have some supervillains
So Hancock is the world 's only superhero , in a world with no supervillains or other oversized threats .
Hancock spends his time fighting small - time crooks , who pose no threat to him .
Do you like watching a drunk guy swat flies ?
Then you 'll love this .

Why are there no supervillains ?
It 's a problem with superhero movies in general : they want to tell a simple , easily comprehended story in under two hours , so they keep the world - building simple .
You can't really have Batroc the Leaper jump into Iron Man , because you 'll have to explain who the hell this guy is and why he 's jumping around with his silly French accent .
Much simpler just to have Iron Man fight a guy who 's using Iron Man 's own stolen technology .
Iron Man vs. Fake Iron Man .
It 's our world , just with super - armor .
Or Hulk vs. Fake Hulk .
Hancock takes this weird paradigm to its furthest extreme , and in the process it shows how flexible our modern mythology of superheroes is n't .
Plus supervillains = automatically funny .
The boasting , the giant gadgets , the Dr. Horribleness .
# 3 Explain why exactly Hancock is a superhero anyway .
Hancock is a god among mortals .
Should n't he be , I do n't know , king of the world or something ?
Instead he 's living in two smushed - together trailers and sleeping on a park bench .
He 's drunk all the time and people hate him because he causes tons of property damage in the course of fighting criminals .
And it 's never explained why Hancock feels the need to fight small - time hoods .
There 's a throwaway line late in the movie that says Hancock is a " protector " by nature , with an in - built need to help people .
But it 's very throwaway .
And he could protect people lots of other ways besides foiling liquor - store robberies in L.A .
He could be stopping the genocide in Darfur .
As anyone who 's read Michael Chabon 's Kavalier And Clay knows , the crucial question is not , " How does Batman fight crime ? " but , " Why does Batman dress up as a bat and fight crime ? "
In the case of Hancock , we probe his psyche a little bit , and get a vague sense that he 's filled with self - loathing because nobody came to get him when he turned up , amnesiac , in a hospital 80 years ago .
But it 's all pretty thin sauce .

# 4 More Jason Bateman being funny
This movie 's MVP is really Jason Bateman from Arrested Development .
Actually , Will Smith brings his usual charm to some horrendous material , but Bateman 's the actor who really shines in Hancock - even though his character is actually super lame .
Bateman 's supposed to be the world 's greatest PR guy , but all we ever see him do is fail to convince companies to sign on to his incredibly weak charity project , which involves putting an ugly heart logo on their products .
The funniest parts of Hancock have to do with Bateman trying to rehabilitate Hancock 's image and convince him to play nice .
The long sequence of the white guy in a suit trying to " civilize " the scary black guy is a little creepy , but it does yield some actual humor .
Bateman convinces
Hancock that he should say " Good job " to police officers when he shows up at at a crime scene , because the cops are putting their lives on the line .
So Hancock goes around woodenly saying " Good job " to everyone .
( First , Hancock has to go to jail so he can show some humility , and make everybody miss him . )
Advertisement
It 's just too bad that the funny Bateman moments are outweighed by the dull Bateman - pimping - his - charity moments , and the later Bateman - feeling - sad - about - his - marriage moments ( we 'll get to that in a sec . )
# 5 Make this movie about something
One of the things that 's frustrating about Hancock is it 's full of metaphors - which are n't examined or explored at all .
Like the idea that he 's the world 's only superpower , and everybody hates him .
Do you think they maybe hate him because he 's the only superpower ?
Also , the fact that he 's filled with self - loathing because of his amnesia - what 's that about ?
And the idea that superheroes are our " modern mythology , " and a god who came to Earth would decide to be a superhero .
There 's got to be some potential there somewhere .
Any one of those ideas , explored in an interesting way , would be way funnier than what we got .
Advertisement
# 6 Put back the dirty stuff .
As we mentioned a couple of times , Hancock was gutted to squeak into a PG - 13 rating , which is the money sweet spot in Hollywood .
Along the way , everything really outrageous got sliced out of the movie .
There 's no more sex with underage ( well , 17 - year - old ) girls .
No more projectile semen ripping holes in the roof of Hancock 's trailer .
( Although you can still see the holes , in one scene . )
I 'm guessing a bunch of other crazy comic material got removed at some point , and what 's left is sort of sad .
Plus , Smith is determined to make Hancock likable even though he 's supposed to be an asshole .
As a result , Smith seems kind of bewildered .
In fact , Hancock seems borderline autistic at times , especially in his interactions with Bateman .
Smith is determined to make us love a superpowered drunk quasi- homeless guy with anger issues , so he settles on making him seem sort of childlike and befuddled .
Why ca n't Hancock just be a cock ?

# 7 Totally rethink the movie 's big twist
As you may have heard , Hancock is really two movies smushed together .
The first half is a weak comedy , and you 've already seen the funniest parts in the trailers .
And then the second half is an unbearable melodrama .
It happens really suddenly .
There 's a moment where Hancock suddenly turns into My Super Ex -Girlfriend for a moment , and then it switches gears and becomes a schlocky love story devoid of chemistry .
And here 's where things get spoilery .
Advertisement
So it turns out that Jason Bateman 's wife , played by Charlize Theron , is actually an immortal superbeing like Hancock .
And she and Hancock have been quasi- married before , but Hancock lost his memory of their past together .
And whenever the two of them are together , they start to become mortal .
Which is how the rest of their immortal race died off , by pairing up .
Theron 's character
Mary is trying to hide her super - being status - so she flings Hancock through a wall .
Good job , Mary !
Advertisement
# 8 Can the love story .
At some point , you realize that we 're supposed to care about the relationship between Hancock and Mary , even though there 's no chemistry between them and they 're talking about gods and immortality and destiny and blah blah blah .
The later scenes between them are up there with Hayden and Natalie in the Star Wars prequels .
It 's fully Lake on Naboo - tiful .
And the idea that they become mortal when they 're in each other 's presence is just kind of ludicrous and annoying , and makes for a horrendously schlocky climax .
Advertisement
# 9 Decide what kind of movie you 're making .
And here 's really the crux of what went wrong with Hancock .
Is it a crazy outrageous comedy about a shitty superhero ?
Then fucking go for it , and show us how crazy you can get .
Is it an understated Jason Bateman comedy about a P.R. exec who tries to work with a superhero to improve his image ?
That actually could have been a great film , if the whole movie was about that .
Is it an exploration of why Hancock is such a dick ?
Or is it a tragic love story of two immortal and nice - looking people who can never be together ?
( If so , then no thanks . )
If Hancock had picked one movie to be , it might have managed to be pretty okay .
Instead , it 's a mash - up of five really bad movies .
WASHINGTON 
In a year of mesmerizing political scenes , one of the most remarkable will begin to play out next week just down Constitution Avenue from the Capitol .
Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska , who as the longest serving Republican senator has prowled the corridors of Congress since 1968 , will go on trial in federal court on charges of failing to disclose $ 250,000 in gifts and home renovations from a politically connected oil services company .
What makes the proceedings so astounding is not just that Mr. Stevens is a figure of outsize proportions in Alaska and the Senate .
Or that the gifts came from a company headed by a longtime friend of Mr. Stevens at a time when the relationship between federal officials and the oil industry is under scrutiny .
Or that his state , usually an afterthought in national elections , is now at the center of America ’s political conversation because of the selection of Alaska ’s little - known governor for the Republican presidential ticket .
Or that he is the king of earmarks when such spending is itself on trial on the campaign trail .
No , on top of all that , the criminal proceedings will start about 40 days before Alaska ’s voters must decide whether Mr. Stevens , 84 , merits a seventh full term .
His trial , near enough to the Senate so that he can excuse himself from the defense table to go cast votes if necessary , will substitute for his campaign in the closing weeks of the race .
Gun Control Lobby Claims McCain Insider Had Ties to NRA Spy Op
The NRA allegedly hired a spy to pose as a gun control activist .
August 19 , 2008  -- A Republican political operative considered part of the McCain campaign's " kitchen cabinet " oversaw a National Rifle Association lobbying campaign that allegedly hired a spy to infiltrate gun control groups , according to Paul Helmke , president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence .
James Jay Baker served as executive director of the National Rifle Association 's Institute for Legislative Action ( ILA ) in the late 1990s when it allegedly hired a woman to pose as a gun control activist and funnel information back to the NRA .
A McCain campaign spokesperson said Baker was only a " high level volunteer " for the campaign .
Investigative journalism magazine Mother Jones first reported the political espionage scandal last month , naming Mary Lou Sapone .
Beginning in 1998 , according to the gun control group , Sapone , using her maiden name McFate , infiltrated the gun violence prevention movement and remained extremely active in a variety of gun control groups , even sitting on the boards of some , until they say she was outed two weeks ago .
" She was one of the major players in the movement , " said Helmke .
" She was at every meeting possible and made you think she cared so much about the issues . "
Mother Jones reported that the NRA paid the now - defunct security firm that hired Sapone to snoop , Beckett Brown International ( BBI ) , $ 80,000 in a 12 - month period spanning 1999 and 2000 .
Baker , who is still registered as a lobbyist for the NRA , is now Managing Director of the Washington - based lobbying firm , Ogilvy Government Relations .
Ogilvy has billed the NRA $ 90,000 so far for 2008 , according to the company 's financial disclosure forms , and $ 360,000 in 2007 .
Congressional lobbying disclosure reports show the NRA has paid Ogilvy $ 2.34 million since Baker left the NRA and joined the firm .
Gun control activists who say they are " stunned " to learn about the allegations that McFate / Sapone was a spy , are calling on McCain to take a stand against Baker whom the Brady Campaign has linked to the underhanded business of spying .
" Senator McCain describes himself as a ' straight talker ' and a critic of the Washington lobbying establishment , " said Helmke .
" Senator McCain and his campaign need to answer whether or not they approve of this spying on victims , and whether they will ask Mr. Baker and the NRA to explain the extent of their involvement in these activities . "
The McCain campaign today sought to distance itself from Baker .
A spokesman for McCain said that though Baker is on McCain 's Sportsman Committee and is a high level volunteer who supports the campaign , he is not one of McCain 's chief advisors .
The spokesman said that the McFate - Sapone issue has nothing to do with the candidate , adding that McCain has a stricter policy against lobbyists working on the campaign than Obama .
In March of 2007 , Baker gave the maximum amount of $ 2,300 to McCain 's campaign , and in August of 2006 , he gave $ 1,000 to Straight Talk America , McCain 's Leadership Political Action Committee .
The NRA did not return phone calls requesting comment .
Neither did Baker , who did , however , tell Mother Jones that he was not aware of any infiltration of the gun control movement .
Baker 's deputy director at the NRA 's ILA , Patrick O'Malley , who is identified as Sapone 's contact at the NRA in BBI depositions , did not return phone calls requesting comment .
Sapone 's home telephone number has been disconnected and messages left on her cell phone were not returned .
Helmke said that lawyers for the Brady Campaign are still determining what kind of legal action , if any , the group can take against Sapone and the NRA .

The flight was delayed for an hour , so I wandered up and down the plane , making sure everyone knew what was going on .
Tim made an announcement - " You 'll be pleased to know the weather is sunny and dry in Malaga and we should be on our way shortly . "
It was 13 minutes after take - off and we had just reached 17,300 feet , 5000 feet beneath our assigned altitude .
I went onto the flight deck and asked if they 'd like tea .
I was just stepping out , with my hand on the door handle , when there was an enormous explosion and the door was blown out of my hands .
I thought , " My God .
It 's a bomb . "
Explosive decompression made the whole cabin mist up like fog for a second - then the plane started to plummet .
I whipped round and saw the front windscreen had disappeared and Tim , the pilot , was going out through it .
He had been sucked out of his seatbelt and all I could see were his legs .
I jumped over the control column and grabbed him round his waist to avoid him going out completely .
His shirt had been pulled off his back and his body was bent upwards , doubled over round the top of the aircraft .
His legs were jammed forward , disconnecting the autopilot , and the flight door was resting on the controls , sending the plane hurtling down at nearly 650 kmh through some of the most congested skies in the world .
Everything was being sucked out of the aircraft : even an oxygen bottle that had been bolted down went flying and nearly knocked my head off .
I was holding on for grim death but I could feel myself being sucked out , too .
John rushed in behind me and saw me disappearing , so he grabbed my trouser belt to stop me slipping further , then wrapped the captain 's shoulder strap around me .
Luckily , Alistair , the co-pilot , was still wearing his safety harness from take - off , otherwise he would have gone , too .
The aircraft was losing height so quickly the pressure soon equalised and the wind started rushing in - at 630 kmh and - 17C .
Paper was blowing round all over the place and it was impossible for Alistair to hear air - traffic control .
We were spiralling down at 80 feet per second with no autopilot and no radio .
I was still holding on to Tim but the pressure made him weigh the equivalent of 500 pounds [ about 200 kilograms ] .
It was a good thing I 'd had so much training at rugby tackles , but my arms were getting colder and colder and I could feel them being pulled out of their sockets .
Simon came rushing through and , with John unwrapped Tim 's legs and the remains of the doors from the controls , and Alistair got the autopilot back on .
But he continued to increase speed , to lessen the risk of a mid-air collision and to get us down to an altitude where there was more oxygen .
He dived to 11,000 feet in 2 minutes , then got the speed down to 300 kmh .
I was still holding Tim , but my arms were getting weaker , and then he slipped .
I thought I was going to lose him , but he ended up bent in a U - shape around the windows .
His face was banging against the window with blood coming out of his nose and the side of his head , his arms were flailing and seemed about 6 feet [ 1.8 metres ] long .
Most terrifyingly , his eyes were wide open .
I 'll never forget that sight as long as I live .
I could n't hold on any more , so Simon strapped himself into the third pilot 's seat and hooked Tim 's feet over the back of the captain 's seat and held on to his ankles .
One of the others said : " We 're going to have to let him go . "
I said : " I 'll never do that . "
I knew I would n't be able to face his family , handing them a matchbox and saying : " This is what is left of your husband . "
If we'd let go of his body , it might have got jammed in a wing or the engines .
I left Simon hanging on to Tim and staggered back into the main cabin .
For a moment , I just sat totally exhausted in a jump seat , my head in my hands , then Sue came up to me , very shaken .
In front of all the passengers , I put my arms around her and whispered in her ear : " I think the Captain 's dead . "
But then I said : " Come on , love , we 've got a job to do . "
By now , Alistair was talking to air traffic control , who were talking him through landing at Southampton Airport .
All pilot training is done on the basis of two pilots , one to fly and one doing the emergency drill , but Alistair was alone , with a crew he did n't know and relying on memory , because all the manuals and charts had blown away .
He asked for a runway of 2500 metres because he was worried that the plane was so heavy with fuel , a tyre would burst or it would go off the runway , but all they could offer was 1800 metres .
Over the intercom he told the passengers we 'd lost the windscreen .
Some of them could see Tim out of the window but the cabin was silent as the grave .
We walked up and down , preparing the passengers for an emergency landing .
People gasped as they saw the blood on my face .
The plane was very shuddery , very rocky .
I remember one man at the very back , with a little baby on his knee , saying to me : " We 're going to die , " and I said , " No , we are not , " lying through my teeth .
All I could see out of the windows was a line of trees , and I thought we 'd either smash into those or into the housing estate beyond .
I had a partner , Jean , and a stepson , Jamie , but I was thinking most about my Mum .
She 'd lost my brother in a car crash the year before , and I could n't bear to think how she 'd take the news .
But , in spite of everything , Alistair did the most amazing landing , what we call a greaser - completely smooth and stopping the aircraft only three - quarters of the way down the runway .
There was n't even any need to use the emergency chutes .
We got all the passengers down the steps in an orderly fashion , although I did have to shout at a couple of people who were trying to get their handbags from the lockers .
The whole time from the explosion to the landing had been 18 minutes , but it seemed like hours .
I got back on board to check everyone had left .
The paramedics had Tim in the cockpit on a stretcher and I went in to see him .
He was lying there , covered in blood , but to my amazement I heard him say : " I want to eat . "
I just exclaimed : " Typical bloody pilot . "
Luckily , he'd been in a coma throughout the ordeal , his body had just shut down .
I went out onto the front steps , and shouted at the others " He 's alive ! " and then I cried my eyes out .
Hero came crashing down
Air steward Nigel Ogden was left with a dislocated shoulder , frostbitten face and some frostbite damage to his left eye .
Amazingly , Captain Tim Lancaster suffered only frostbite , fractures to his arm and wrist and a broken thumb .
Within five months he was flying again and today he 's a pilot for easyJet .
Ogden returned to work after a break but suffered post - traumatic stress and took early retirement in 2001 on the grounds of ill health .
He is now a night watchman at a Salvation Army hospital .
In 1992 , a report was published showing that a BA engineer , working under pressure , had fitted a new windscreen with bolts that were too small .

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was the Nobel Prize - winning author of The Gulag Archipelago and many other works critical of Stalinism and Russian life , which earned him both the scorn and the praise of his people , depending on who was in power .
Stalin 's regime threw him in a Siberian Gulag for eight years for referring to the dictator sarcastically in a private letter ; Kruschev liked him , and personally okayed the publication of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich , which in 1962 was the strongest indictment of Stalinist repression to date .
Both the semi-autobiographical Denisovich and the non-ficiton Archipelago described Gulag life in harrowing detail , and forced the West to finally acknowledge the grave human rights abuses perpetrated inside Stalin 's brutal work camps , which at their peak housed more than two million prisoners .
To mark Solzhenitsyn's passing -- he died yesterday at the age of 89 -- we 're taking a look at Gulags as they were , and given our penchant for the creepy and the abandoned , how some of them remain today , moldering in the remote wilds of Siberia and Northern Kazakhstan .
Rather than relying on blurry black - and - white pictures to depict life inside the camps , we 're using a much more colorful source : the drawings of Eufrosinia Kersnovskaya , a gifted artist who spent more than a decade in the Gulags and illustrated her memoirs upon release .

The gulags now
Built in remote corners of Siberia , many camps were simply abandoned and left standing after the Gulag system was disbanded in the 1950s .
What was left behind is a grim reminder of Stalin 's legacy of terror , repression and death .

Ah , Dell .
Seeming inventors of the tech support pit of bureaucratic indifferences , inventors of the flamingo pink Inspiron , perpetrators of fraud in New York …
I have , for over a year now , been on a crusade trying to get them to stop sending me their Dell Home and Home Office catalog to my mailbox .
It has been a bundle of fun , let me tell you .
They have a nice - sounding privacy policy .
It says you can opt out of all their mailings by filling out a form online .
Yeah , good luck with that .
First of all , there are different forms for different departments at Dell .
I ’ve filled out them all , multiple times .
They do nothing whatsoever .
Perhaps they use them as lists of known - good addresses to send new advertisements to , rather than lists of people to remove .
Oh well .
Now , unfortunately I feel compelled to bore you with the saga so far , involving telephone hang - ups , broken privacy policies , and the like .
But there is a silver lining at the end , in which I submitted a request to the postal service asking them to block Dell from sending me any more mail , and it appears that they are very likely to violate Federal Law any day now .
I have called them about it .
Dealt with the old “ let me transfer you to the correct department ” then hang up on me ploy .
Spoken to people that have promised up and down that I ’ll be off their list in 30 - 60 days .
It ’s always 30 - 60 days , is n’t it ?
Very convenient that I can’t tell for 2 months whether or not they ’ve processed my request .
I ’ve tried their online chat .
One of my attempts went like this :
Session Started with Agent ( Sneha Ranga ) Agent ( Sneha Ranga ) : “ Due to circumstances that have affected Dell Communications I am temporarily unable to pull up any information .
The down time is temporary .
We apologize for the inconvenience , as we value your time as a customer .
Please contact us back after an hour . ”
Session Ended
Ah Dell , only you could reach such a pinnacle of customer service .
/ kicking someone out of a chat room before they have a chance to say a word .
Finally , last fall , I blogged about the situation ( that ’s the link above ) .
Debbie from Dell read the post and emailed me .
Great , I thought .
She asked for my address information and catalog information and sent me a removal confirmation :
From : Debbie@Dell.com
Date : Thu , 18 Oct 2007 13:08:18 - 0500
To : jgoerzen@complete.org
Subject : RE : Dell mailing list
Thank you , Mr. Goerzen , your request to have the below address
information removed from our marketing lists has been received : [ my address here ]
We will process your request promptly .
However , it may take several
weeks for some changes to take effect .
If you are still receiving
catalogs after thirty ( 30 ) days feel free to email me .
Sorry for any
inconvenience you may have experienced .
Thank you ,
Debbie
So that was October .
In December , I replied to that message , saying : “ I received another mailing today , and it ’s been nearly 2 months since your initial message .
If there ’s anything further you can do , I ’d appreciate it . ”
Debbie said , “ I am very sorry Mr. Goerzen , I will resubmit your request . ”
Guess how successful that was .
So in February , I manage to figure out a way to send in a support ticket without having a Dell system serial number .
I wrote :
I keep getting your Dell Home and Home Office catalog .
I have tried for months to get off your mailing list .
I have called in , talked to people in multiple departments , who have promised to remove me from the list .
I have contacted you online .
NOTHING IS HELPING .
This has gone on for MONTHS .
PLEASE NEVER SEND ME MAIL AGAIN , EVER , AND DO NOT RENT OR SHARE MY NAME .
My address is above .
The code on the mailing I received is : [ snipped ]
The form letter I got back said :
If you are currently receiving our catalog or mailings and would like to be removed , please visit the following web page and select the appropriate link under the “ Opt - out of direct mail , phone or fax communications ” heading : http://www.dell.com/OptOut
I replied , saying that form did n’t work .
Guess what I got back ?
Thank you for signing up for Dell Email Subscriptions .
Please save this email for your records .
Yes , that ’s right .
Asking them to take me off their postal mailing lists got them to PUT ME ON their email lists .
ARGH .
So they eventually manage to correctly take me off the email list , and of course promise to do the same with the postal list .
This back in February .
I contacted them again in March and July , only to have a similar stupidity - laced run-in with clueless form - answer - laden Dell support reps .
Each one claimed to have now , finally , and permanently removed me from the list .
It never happened , and none of them lifted a finger to find out way , and no amount of begging could make them .
So , here ’s the good part .
Junkbusters has spent years educating people on how to get rid of unwanted mail , and documents getting a prohibitory order against the sender .
It was originally designed for people that did n’t want to receive obscene advertising mailings , but thanks to the happy fact that one non-adult - mailer challenged a prohibitory order all the way to the Supreme Court , you can now get prohibitory order against anyone .
Yes , even Dell .
( The supreme court ’s ruling even gave an example : you can prohibit a clothing catalog if you want . )
And last month , that ’s exactly what I did .
The USPS sent me back a copy of the letter they sent to Dell , as well as a second page with instructions on reporting violations .
Here ’s the letter they sent to Dell :
Somehow I get a chuckle over some Dell mail clerk trying to figure out how an 11 - pound laptop is sexually provocative .
From August 25 on , it is a federal offense for Dell to send me another Home and Home Office catalog .
This is a branch of criminal law , not civil law .
That is , it ’s the maybe - go - to - jail branch of law .
How disappointed I was to receive yet another catalog from them today .
If only they had waited 5 more days , I could have turned them in now .
Oh well .
There ’s always next month ’s catalog .
Let ’s just hope the clerk that received the USPS letter removed my name with a better system than everyone else at Dell uses , eh ?
LANSING , Mich .  Senator Barack Obama altered his position on Monday to call for tapping the nation ’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower gasoline prices as he outlined an energy plan that contrasts with Senator John McCain ’s greater emphasis on expanded offshore drilling and coal and nuclear technology .
In a speech here and in a new advertisement , Mr. Obama , the presumptive Democratic nominee , also sought to portray his Republican rival , Mr. McCain , as “ in the pocket ” of oil giants that are profiting from gasoline priced at more than $ 4 a gallon .
And in his speech , Mr. Obama called for a windfall profits tax on oil companies to finance rebates for Americans .
At the heart of Mr. Obama ’s proposals is a focus on fostering alternative energy development by investing $ 150 billion in emerging technologies and renewable fuels .
Seeking to put a million fuel - efficient hybrid plug - in automobiles on the road , he said that he would offer a $ 7,000 tax credit to buyers , the overall cost of which he did not specify .
In addition , Mr. Obama said his goal was to have 10 percent of the country ’s energy needs met by renewable resources by the end of his first term , more than double the current figure .
While focusing on alternative energy production , Mr. Obama has veered in recent days toward increasing access to fossil fuels , both in seeking to tap the strategic oil reserve and in softening his opposition to offshore oil drilling .
He said he might be willing to accept some exploration of limited offshore drilling as part of a more comprehensive energy bill that would include things he favors , like renewable fuels and batteries for electric - powered cars .
An end - of - session event that cut short a Democratic filibuster and paved the way for lawmakers to refer the same - sex - marriage ban to the fall ballot is now the subject of a rare formal ethics complaint .
Democratic Sen. Ken Cheuvront of Phoenix has asked the Senate Ethics Committee to issue a formal reprimand against Sen. Jack Harper , R - Surprise .
Cheuvront accuses Harper of conspiring with other Republican leaders to intentionally break the rules of the Senate by turning off microphones and allowing the Republican majority leader to make a motion in the middle of a debate between Democratic senators .
Cheuvront calls the move , which enabled the ban on same - sex marriage to go to a vote , an " unconscionable " violation of Senate rules .
" If we can not follow our own rules , how can we expect people to follow the rules we set for them ? "
Cheuvront asked .
Senate rules generally provide that senators can speak on the subject of a bill as long as they want without interruption once they are recognized .
Harper refused to comment about his actions when he chaired the Senate session June 27 , but he said he believes the Democratic filibuster was itself in violation of the Senate rules .
He called the ethics complaint a partisan attack meant to help his opponent in the Republican primary .
" Their filibuster was not allowed by Senate rules :
They were repeating points , not making new points , and they did not have the right to keep the floor , " said Harper , who had helped stage an all - night filibuster to stall the passage of a state budget a day earlier .
The dispute began during a Democratic filibuster on the final day of the session .
Cheuvront and Sen. Paula Aboud , D - Tucson , who are the Senate 's only openly gay members , had control of the floor in a question - and - answer session over an unrelated tax bill .
As Aboud began to respond to a question from Cheuvront , Harper announced from the chair that there had been a technical problem with the microphones .
" One second - I clicked on the wrong thing , " he said .
" I clicked on the ' clear mikes . ' "
Instead of turning the floor back over to the Democrats , whose microphones had been shut off , he called on Senate Majority Leader Thayer Verschoor , R - Mesa .
As Verschoor began to speak , Democrats shouted " point of order " repeatedly - a call that under Senate rules is supposed to be acknowledged immediately by the chairman , Cheuvront said .
Instead , Harper announced that Verschoor 's motion passed , which ended the debate and allowed the ban on same - sex marriage to come to a vote .
In the complaint , Cheuvront accuses Harper of intentionally cutting off the debate in violation of the Senate rules after plotting the ruse with Verschoor .
Verschoor could not be reached for comment .
The complaint is now before Sen. Jay Tibshraeny , the Republican chair of the Senate Ethics Committee , who must decide whether to hold a hearing on the matter .
Tibshraeny , who criticized his fellow senators on the floor for a loss of decorum in the final hours of session , said he will make his decision this week .
If the ethics committee decides there was an ethical violation , the committee can recommend that the full Senate take action ranging from a reprimand to expulsion from the Senate , which require a majority vote and a two - thirds vote of the full Senate , respectively .
Cheuvront has requested a reprimand .
Harper was the subject of the only other ethics complaint filed in the last four years , Tibshraeny said .
That complaint was also filed by a Democrat , who accused Harper of using his subpoena power to feed information to the Phoenix New Times .
It was dismissed after a preliminary hearing .

( Controversial unretouched photo of John McCain by Jill Greenberg )
When I moved to San Francisco in 1978 , within a week I met another young radical , Dusty , who had moved there the week before from Nebraska .
We quickly became close friends , and she remained one of the best friends I ever had .
At age 40 , she gave up waiting for the perfect partner to come along and arranged to get pregnant on her own .
Eventually she had Tom , a beautiful little boy who gave her life all its meaning from that point on .
When Tom was four , I went back for a visit and stayed with them for a week .
After he went to bed the first night , she said " I want to show you something . "
She pulled up her pants cuff and pointed out a faint spot on her ankle .
She said " This did n't used to be here .
I 'm worried it 's cancer . "
I am not a doctor and have no medical training , but at that time I worked in a major cancer clinic and I saw skin cancer daily .
I bent over her ankle , peered at the spot and said " I dunno .
I think it 's probably some kind of freckle , but you should have it checked out by somebody who 's competent , not me . "
She said she planned to -- she was in the medical field , and responsible .
Her own mother had died of cancer when Dusty was five , and it had been a loss she 'd never quite overcome , in part because her mother lied to her about her terminal condition and promised she'd be coming back from the hospital when she went in to die .
Not long after I returned to Texas , Dusty called me and said it was melanoma .
She was fair - skinned , had always been diligent about using sunscreen , but it had occurred anyhow .
She began rigorous treatment .
I never saw her again .
She was dead within the year , leaving Tom without his mother at age five , just as Dusty had grown up .
It 's so hard to think about this tragedy , I actually try to suppress the memory .
I 've never written about it .
Last week , when I got the letter from Robert Greenwald talking about John McCain 's refusal to release his medical records to fair scrutiny , the fact that there are 1,000 pages of them ( I create medical records for a living , 1,000 pages is EXTREME ) , and the news that he has had malignant melanoma , deep primaries with removal of lymph nodes , my immediate thought was " Then he 's dying . "
If he were to be elected , he'd have an almost 2 out of 3 chance of having a recurrence if he does n't have one already .
This is not the kind of cancer you count on escaping from .
This is not Stage II , as it has been reported : Stage II by definition does not have lymph node involvement .
By definition , it must be either Stage III or Stage IV .
When I worked in the cancer clinic , my favorite doctor there , Dr. S. , the one I went to when I got my own cancer diagnosis , was known for being extremely blunt with his patients .
There were several physicians on staff , so the intake nurses screened a new patient to assess whether they wanted a doctor who was going to use euphemisms and hopeful language or whether they wanted honesty at all costs .
If they wanted honesty , they got Dr. S. He ate lunch with us whenever he could , and one day he explained why he did n't offer people language they could use to deny the seriousness of their condition .
( Because of the nature of our practice there , half the patients coming through the doors were likely to die -- we did n't get the easy cases . )
He said " If I care about them , and I do , it 's not kind to let them die without preparing for it .
Folks need to talk with their families , talk with God , settle their affairs , and get ready .
I give them what I 'd want someone to give me . "
As he was in all other respects a deeply kind and generous man , I knew he meant it .
And if I ever need oncological care , he will be my first choice .
Obviously , some patients do n't want to hear that kind of assessment and they do n't want the people around them to be thinking about their death .
I cannot say personally whether or not John McCain is in that kind of denial about his health , but I can say he 's a pathological liar at this point ; he 's surrounded himself and his campaign with blatant lies , so it would be in character .
Since Brave New Films released their video John McCain 's health records must be released this week , over 44,000 people have signed the petition requesting full disclosure , including over 2,000 doctors .
My post about it a few days ago was written within an hour of finding out the diagnoses McCain ALREADY carried :
My alarm bells rang loud and clear .
Similarly , in Matt Stoller 's column yesterday he tells of having visited his own dermatologist and asking for a reality check on McCain 's malignant melanoma issue :
He was told " It 's bad .
Real bad .
And unlike most cancers , it does n't really go away , even after years in remission . "
John McCain is , in effect , applying for the job of the most powerful position on the planet .
Whether or not he is going to die in office , or have a cancer remission ( the treatment for which will render him utterly unable to perform his job duties ) , is a critical question that must be answered BEFORE we " hire " him by voting him in .
As Kathy Geier points out in yesterday 's G - Spot article , " For years , releasing a candidate 's complete medical records has been standard practice for major party presidential candidates .
The way the McCain has dealt with the medical records issue is highly unusual , to say the least ...
If McCain 's medical history was entirely reassuring and he really were in excellent health , I doubt that the campaign would have dealt with his records the way they did .
The campaign knows that voters have serious concerns about this issue , and if the medical records really were unproblematic , they would n't hesitate to release the whole enchilada to any reporter who asked , with no conditions and no strings attached . "
If he is in fact a Dead Man Walking , then the choice of Sarah Palin as Vice President also becomes more than a Hail Mary pass intended to destroy any bounce from the wildly successful Democratic Convention .
It becomes reckless in the extreme : Choosing an heir apparent who lies , engages in petty revenge , wants to know how to ban books , faithfully attends a church which believes dinosaurs were around 4000 years ago and Jews are punished by God for not believing in Jesus , has less foreign policy experience than a Delta flight attendant , does n't know what the Bush Doctrine is , and has less than two years experience governing a state with a population less than that of Wichita , Kansas or Raleigh , North Carolina .
We know that the secret cabal , the Council for National Policy , who hopes to replace American democracy with religious rule ( THEIR religion , not yours ) , are the people who investigated Sarah Palin and " chose " her for McCain as his VP .
Since he accepted their decision , fundamentalist organizations have thrown themselves behind his campaign in a way they had not before .
It raises the question of a deal .
What would a dying man have to offer power brokers in order to have their backing for the U.S. Presidency ?
Quite the deathbed request that would be .
Demand access to the medical records NOW .
Or insist that we treat their refusal as proof of the answer they dare not give .
Here we go again : The Federal Reserve is bailing out another tanking financial institution — the insurance behemoth American International Group — by sinking $ 85 billion into AIG in return for a stake in the company .
Meanwhile , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called for a Wall Street investigation following this latest startling agreement between big government and big business .
The New York Times :
Still , the move will likely start an intense political debate during the presidential election campaign over who is to blame for the financial crisis that prompted the rescue .
Representative Barney Frank , Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , said Mr. [ Henry ] Paulson and Mr. [ Ben ]
Bernanke had not requested any new legislative authority for the bailout at Tuesday night ’s meeting .
“ The secretary and the chairman of the Fed , two Bush appointees , came down here and said , ‘ We ’re from the government , we ’re here to help them , ’ ” Mr. Frank said .
“ I mean this is one more affirmation that the lack of regulation has caused serious problems .
That the private market screwed itself up and they need the government to come help them unscrew it . ”
The decision was a remarkable turnabout by the Bush administration and Mr. Paulson , who had flatly refused over the weekend to risk taxpayer money to prevent the collapse of Lehman Brothers or the distressed sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America .
Earlier this year , the government bailed out another investment bank , Bear Stearns , by engineering a sale to JPMorgan Chase that left taxpayers on the hook for up to $ 29 billion of bad investments by Bear Stearns .
The government hoped at the time that this unusual step would both calm markets and lead to a recovery by the financial system .
But critics warned at the time that it would only encourage others to seek bailouts , and the eventual costs to the government would be staggering .

Man discovered by apes
When I think of the 1990s , it ’s the Ice Man I remember .
He was found in 1991 , in an Austrian glacier melting from global warming .
At first the authorities took him for a murder victim ( it was Silence of the Lambs time ) .
They hacked his body out of the slush with a jackhammer , eager for their CSI moment , then started to realize he did n’t fit the profile of a Hannibal Lecter scorecard .
His shoes were made of bearskin and deerskin and stuffed with dry grass ; his cloak was woven of grass ; he carried a flint knife that looks like a folded , dented can lid tied to a stick with twine .
It began to dawn on the investigators that this guy was old , pre-war ( or so they thought ) .
Tourists swarmed him ; fungus started to grow on his greasy amber hide ( his outer layer of skin had come off long ago ) from their eager , sweaty little hands .
The Austrians finally announced that carbon dating showed the corpse was 5,300 years old .
At that point Italy and Austria tried to have a nineteenth - century dispute about who owned the ex-glacier , and thus the body .
But this was Europe in the 1990s , without the energy for another War of Jenkin ’s Ear .
The Austrians kept it , and in true 90s style the only fights were in court , between the hikers who found him and the government , and came down to money .
The hippies tried him on first .
After all , he was wearing all those hemp clothes .
And he was clearly alterno , because he had tattoos , little dot patterns on his lower back and right knee .
Stoners from Amsterdam to Taos fried their brains with the question :
What would a 5,300 - year - old New Ager be doing up on a glacier ?
And realized that there was only one explanation ( snowboarding was rejected as ahistorical ) : the deceased was , had been , a shaman .
On a vision quest .
They knew their Native American mentors ( the ones in the movies , anyway ) sent their spaciest dudes up into uninhabitable territory so that frostbite could work its mind - expanding magic .
Clearly , and despite his regrettable leather footwear , what we had here was a dedicated Seeker who sought a little too high , a little too cold , and slipped into the big sleep .
Another casualty of expanded consciousness , like Hunter Thompson ’s lawyer , who demanded to be electrocuted screaming , “ Tell them I just wanted to get higher ! ”
Then came the autopsy , and suddenly the corpse belonged to a newer , stronger next of kin : the Ice Man was gay .
Because “ they ” found sperm in his frozen , folded anus .
This was by far the biggest impact the corpse could have had on mid-90s popular culture .
It was too good not to be true .
Ellen was coming out , and now the Ice Man .
It trumped the Bible by eons .
Before those Levantine schizophrenics even started their censorious , homophobic gibbering , gay Austrians were having joining the gay mile - high club .
Notice Ice Man ’s backwards facing position …
It was like finding a lost deed granting title to the youngest , most confident claimant .
Joy was unrefined .
That ’s when the Ice Man entered the airless Business School classroom where I taught Creative Writing in New Zealand .
Somebody submitted a poem on the corpse , not mentioning the gay angle but just gloomily commemorating it — a depressed poem trying to find something to celebrate and finding it in a corpse that at least did n’t decay .
But that angle was of little interest .
The gay lobby , in the form of Christy , claimed the body as soon as the poem was read in class : “ Yes , and he was GAY !
They found another man ’s sperm in his arse !
The Ice Man was GAY ! ”
Christy was our resident lesbian activist .
Every 90s writing group had one , and Christy suited the role perfectly .
She was about five foot nothing , ash - blond hacked hair and minimum flesh on her sharp little bones — but what a voice .
Christy never spoke below a hundred decibels , and her tone veered between denunciation and embrace .
You were either with her or against her , depending on your position on a few key issues .
And the greatest of these was gayness .
It ’s funny thinking back on what “ gay ” meant in the 1990s .
You ’d think the Ice Man would be claimed by gay men , but …what gay men ?
I grew up in the Bay Area in the disco era ; I remember when they defined gay .
But in the seven years I taught creative writing , from 1995 to 2001 , I do n’t remember any male students who were willing to announce themselves as gay .
They were there , but lying very , very low .
Whatever new freedoms that decade brought , they did n’t include gay men .
Maybe it was an anomaly , specific to New Zealand , where men have to be blokes or nothing , and women … well , women have to be blokes too , unless they want to embrace the utterly thankless role of the female heterosexual in Rugby culture , which features a level of misogyny I ’d never seen before heading down under — “ girl ” is an insult there .
Which makes it a great place to be a lesbian , and Hell for gay men .
Not to mention that the bravest of them were , well , dead .
Thom Gunn , the only brave man I ever met at Berkeley — no , he would n’t have been dead at that point , but he was dying .
So Christy had no competition when she claimed the Ice Man as gay Adam .
I remember her voice blasting through that classroom .
The rooms in that building were the most expensive in the entire university .
It was the new Business School , after all , the spoiled child of the new generation of academic managers .
I hear it ’s bankrupt and almost empty now .
Instead of windows these classrooms had banks of metal shutters , dozens of them , each equipped with its own engine , about the size of a Walkman .
The shutters were wired to the fidgety thermostat , so that halfway through somebody reading a poem , usually at its most sentimental or delicate moment , the room would fill with a huge whirring , as the shutters decided to open or close .
And when they were done , they ’d finish with a huge sucking sound as the airlock closed .
It wrecked many a pronouncement , but Christy was never fazed .
She had a huge voice ; it was the voice for its time and place .
It fit right in there .
And she got a respectful silence when she claimed the body of the Ice Man .
Nobody would have been so stupid as to quibble with any pro-gay statement in public ; there were places for that .
Pubs , parties .
New Zealand culture features more kinds of silence , more nuances of non-response , than the alleged Inuit and their alleged 26 words for snow .
The silence that absorbed Christy ’s announcement was formal , cautiously gratified ; an opportunity to demonstrate correct thought had arisen and been accepted .
Christy made her point again , the shutters did their noisy chorus , and we moved on .
But it ca n’t have been so easy for Christy after all , because a year later she was dead .
Very murkily dead .
There were a lot of murky deaths in Dunedin .
The attitude there reminds me of my parents ’ beliefs about language : it ’s a sport , a pastime , but when something is really important , it is never , ever to be mentioned .
So Christy just died ; an accident , or drink , or a fall .
She had been abused , they said , as if that was why she died .
Then the man who ’d written the poem about the Ice Man died .
He was older than most of the students , a longhaired local who ’d never gone very far from Dunedin .
Americans have trouble understanding — I had trouble understanding — how , in a culture that does n’t reward egotism , lives can just shrink and shrivel to nothing .
Californians like me tend to expand until they burst and die with a comic balloon Ffffffpppt ! ; New Zealanders , especially the men , just discipline themselves until they just are n’t alive any more .
Although this guy took some killing , he did n’t just die .
He went off into the woods and hanged himself .
He ’d always been very friendly with the group , but there was something off about him .
Depression is n’t attractive except in the movies ; it ’s annoying .
He was annoying , ten years older and sucking up to everybody , out of it , old hippie .
He volunteered to hold the end - of - semester party at his house .
It was not a success .
The house was bleak even by local standards , and in the cold monsoons of Dunedin his nervous smiles , his patchouli - stinking stagnant rooms , brought everybody down .
It was the kind of house that needs to be burned down , the kind of life that would be helped by conscription in an army , any army .
Once he was dead , he became a more sympathetic object of contemplation .
It was clear why he ’d so desperately invited us to his wretched house in the rain : he was trying to find a reason not to hang himself .
It followed , then , that he must have been trying to find friends in our group — friends !
Among a bunch of poets !
No wonder he died .
And it was suddenly , equally clear what had drawn him to write that poem about the Ice Man .
At a conscious level , it was that lethal hippie cant — hemp shoes , shamanistic nonsense — all the flabby Aquarian lies , to borrow Leonard Cohen ’s phrase , that had sent his life down that lousy , rain - sodden cul de sac .
And beneath the surface hippie ideology , the real attraction : the fact that the Ice Man was so dead , so dead - dead - deadsky .
But it was hard to be very sympathetic for very long .
He was too annoying , even in death : it seems that when he went off to hang himself , he ’d left a note telling his friends to stop smoking .
The Ice Man ushered out the Nineties as brilliantly as he introduced the decade .
He had one last , biggest post - mortem epiphany in him .
It arrived via X -ray : they found an arrowhead embedded in the Ice Man ’s chest .
A bit of a surprise , is n’t it , that it took several years for scientists to notice an arrowhead embedded in the body of the world ’s most autopsied corpse .
It ’s as if they were …well , you know : stupid .
All the fondest dreams of the Ice Man ’s fans were suddenly X’d out .
That little sliver of flint killed them as surely as it killed him .
He died because somebody goddamn well killed him , meaning e was n’t a shaman too spaced to bundle up .
He was n’t an alpine Ellen , a wandering Whitman .
He was a killer himself ; there was evidence on his knife and arrows that he ’d killed several people before they got him .
And they got him good .
The wound was expertly inflicted ; according to pathologists , it would have been fatal even if he ’d had access to 21st - century medical care .
He ’d been ambushed .
And if another man ’s sperm was indeed present in his ass , it was n’t friendly sperm .
The Romans used to do that when they took a city .
A way of reminding the defeated who won .
Who claims the Ice Man now ?
It ’s like a punchline : “ Who do you want ? ”
As far as I know , he ’s available .
You ’ve just got to want him .
The only reason to state the moral explicitly is the moral itself : we do n’t have a clue .
We wo n’t get the point if we can possibly help it .
Stratum after stratum of vicious cant and obvious lies , cheered and shelved , immunity for all past lies .
Except that along the way people do tend to die for what they believe .
Everyone dies for what they believe .
When you consider that , the way we die for stupid , transparent cant , well … you know , those suicide bombers do n’t look so bad .
Which is odd , because I just remembered that the last time I taught that course , in 2002 , there was a whole slew of poems about the horror of suicide bombers .
I remember somebody saying , “ I just ca n’t understand the mentality of someone like that . ”

Like most conservatives , I look at the looming November election with a certain sense of gloom .
While Senator McCain has a good shot at taking the White House , Democrats look certain to expand their majorities in both the House and Senate by considerable margins .
As the Democratic Party gathers in Denver this week , it will lay out an aggressive policy agenda worthy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
The 111th Congress has the potential to pass legislation of the magnitude of the New Deal and Great Society ; indeed , we may face a historic turning point in our economy in the wake of the 2008 election .
Examining the legislative proposals laid out by Democrats for a potential Obama presidency , I see the four horsemen of the economic apocalypse gathering on our horizon .
The first horseman will bring higher taxation , which , as students of Economics 101 learn , destroys incentives to save and invest , reducing economic growth .
When Ronald Reagan was elected president , one of his top priorities was to fight the stagflation and economic lethargy that dominated the 1970s .
Legislatively , this plan became the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 , an across the board 25 percent tax cut , and the 1986 Tax Reform Act .
Together , these bills lowered the top marginal tax rate from 70 percent in 1980 down to 28 percent by 1988 .
The long term effect of the tax cuts is clear , with a surge in activity and investment in the private sector that ended the lethargy of the 1970s and unleashed three decades of record growth .
Between 1980 and 1988 , inflation dropped form the double digit levels to bellow 5 percent and unemployment levels tumbled from over 10 percent to 4.5 percent
The economic benefits of the tax cuts were summarized by President Clinton 's Council of Economic Advisers in its 1994 Economic Report : " It is undeniable that the sharp reduction in taxes in the early 1980s was a strong impetus to economic growth . "
By letting the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 expire , Congress will foist a crippling $ 280 billion tax hike on the American economy .
As if that tax hike is not enough , President Obama 's ' solution ' to the impending bankruptcy of Social Security is simple : raise payroll taxes .
This proposed payroll tax hike would cost employers and employees $ 1 trillion over ten years .
At a time when the economy is still reeling from the housing market meltdown , hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes will pummel American families and businesses .
Higher income taxes are only part of the story .
American companies currently face the highest tax rates in the industrialized world - - hardly an incentive to expand in the United States .
Rather than tackling this taxation crisis , the 111th Congress will be busy passing a windfall profit tax on successful companies and increasing payroll taxes across the board .
In an era when tax rates are falling across the globe , American families will bear a greater tax burden while American businesses will find it more difficult to compete .
The second horseman , seen lurking Capitol Hill for nearly a decade , is energy regulation .
In the past Congress has rejected energy restrictions like Al Gore 's Btu tax , the Kyoto Protocol , and , more recently , the Warner - Lieberman cap and trade program because of the devastating effects on energy prices and the economy .
But cap and trade energy restrictions will certainly be back in the 111th Congress .
Should they pass , the government will be in the position of rationing energy through a complicated system of carbon ' allowances , ' creating not a free market for carbon but an artificial market where politicians decide which industries live or die as revenues and carbon permits from a cap and trade program would be doled out as environmental pork .
The effect on energy prices will be devastating , to say the least .
Research by the Heritage Foundation estimated that the costs of a cap and trade program could reach $ 4.8 trillion by 2030 .
While consumers would not pay a direct tax , they will pay for cap and trade legislation through higher electric and gas prices , as well as more for goods that are energy intensive such as food , cars , airfare , and manufactured goods .
The National Association of Manufactures and the American Council for Capital Formation estimate that if cap and trade legislation became law , in six years gas prices would rise an additional 13 to 50 percent , electricity rates would jump 13 percent , and natural gas prices would climb 20 percent .
By 2014 , higher energy costs would translate into 850,000 lost jobs .
The Congressional Budget Office says even a mild , 15 percent reduction in emissions will cost the average family $ 1300 more per year in household energy costs .
Union bosses have their own horseman and have invested heavily in seeing his success .
The SEIU union alone has committed to spending $ 90 million to support the Democrats .
We can expect the third horsemen to unleash a new wave of union building legislation in the 111th Congress , beginning with " card check , " a plan to boost sagging union membership by eliminating the secret ballot when it comes to the important decision of whether workers want to unionize .
The effect will be felt in all sectors of the economy , from hotels to retail to manufacturing .
American businesses would lose their dynamism and ability to react quickly to changing market conditions , threatening jobs and weakening the economy .
Introducing new rigidities in America 's labor markets does little to help our competitiveness in an increasingly global marketplace .
The fourth horseman first began to ride during the 1930s under President Roosevelt , and came of age during the Great Society .
This horseman is government - run health care , and a new Congress provides the perfect opportunity to expand .
Rather than harnessing the market and empowering individuals , expect to see policies that expand the role of government in the health care system , with more bureaucrats , more price controls , and more taxes to pay for it all .
Our health care system is facing a crisis of spiraling costs , but what is lost in the rush to socialize medicine is that the federal government is already the largest buyer and provider of health care services .
Much of the higher cost is driven by government mandates , as well as an expensive regulatory mandates open to abuse under the current system .
Not to mention the Medicare Trustees Report estimates that Medicare alone has an unfunded liability of $ 48 trillion .
Our economy rewards entrepreneurship and investment , allowing all Americans to benefit .
The policies of the four horsemen share a top down , command - and - control philosophy that is out of step with global economic trends and costly for America 's taxpayers and consumers .
In fact , the four horsemen have the potential kill the goose that laid the golden egg , shackling an economy that has allowed generations of Americans to prosper .
Is this the legacy , high taxes and a stagnant economy , we want to leave our children ?
Good news for couch potatoes .
There may be a pill that lets them watch their TV and get their exercise , too — without moving a muscle .
Scientists have found a drug that mimics the effects of a workout by , among other things , increasing the body 's ability to burn fat .
The study shows the pill can also increase endurance ; lab mice that took it ran more than 40 percent longer on a treadmill than their untreated peers .
" It 's tricking the muscle into ' believing ' it 's been exercised daily , " says Ronald Evans , a developmental biologist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies , in La Jolla , Calif . , and co-author of a study published in Cell .
" It proves you can have a pharmacologic equivalent to exercise . "
In addition to supercharging stamina , the drug , called AICAR , may also be useful in treating debilitating muscular disorders such as muscular dystrophy as well as metabolic diseases such as diabetes , because it also appears to help the body use and remove sugar from the blood more effectively .
Researchers say that AICAR — which is in clinical trials to treat some heart ailments — in essence works by reprogramming muscle , switching it from sugar - burning , fast twitch muscle — which is better for speed and power — into fat - burning , slow - twitch muscle that does not tire as easily .
The key to this transformation is a protein called PPARdelta , which Evan 's team previously showed could create so - called high - endurance " marathon mice " if it genetically engineered the animals were genetically engineered to make a lot of it .
But , another experimental drug that targeted only PPARdelta had some metabolic benefits , including lowering fatty acids and blood sugar , but it only boosted endurance in mice that were running regularly .
Enter AICAR , which targets a protein called adenosine monophosphate - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) .
AMPK is produced when cells need more energy -- as they do when we 're exercising -- and triggers increased levels of PPARdelta .
As a result , researchers thought that AICAR could kick off the process inlieu of exercise .
After four weeks of treatment with AICAR , the mice that took it could run on treadmills nearly 1.5 times as long as untreated animals — and without any training .
Sound too good to be true ?
It may be .
Laurie Goodyear , a n associate professor at Harvard Medical School and an investigator at the Harvard - affiliated Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston , applauded the findings but says no pill can duplicate all of the benefits that exercise has on the body .
Warning to athletes who think popping the pill might give them a leg up on the competition : Evans has developed urine and blood tests designed to detect the drug — so do n't get any ideas .
Ninety years after the sweeping destruction of the 1918 flu pandemic , researchers at Monroe Carell Jr. Children ’s Hospital at Vanderbilt have recovered antibodies to the virus – from elderly survivors of the original outbreak .
In addition to revealing the surprisingly long - lasting immunity to such viruses , these antibodies could be effective treatments to have on hand if another virus similar to the 1918 flu breaks out in the future .
The study , led by James Crowe Jr. , M.D. , professor of Pediatrics and director of the Vanderbilt Program in Vaccine Sciences , Christopher Basler , Ph.D. , at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine , and Eric Altschuler , M.D. , Ph.D. , at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey - New Jersey Medical School , is published online in the journal Nature .
The influenza pandemic of 1918 killed nearly 50 million people worldwide , many of whom were young , healthy adults .
With fears of another looming flu pandemic stoked by the emergence of “ bird flu ” in Asia , researchers have wanted to study the 1918 virus and the immune response to it .
In 2005 , researchers from Mount Sinai and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington , D.C. , resurrected the 1918 virus from the bodies of people killed in the outbreak .
The bodies , and the virus , had been preserved in the permanently frozen soil of Alaska .
When the investigators approached Crowe , whose lab had developed methods of making antibodies , to try to make antibodies to the 1918 flu , he was skeptical , but agreed to try .
The researchers collected blood samples from 32 survivors age 91-101 years and found that all reacted to the 1918 virus , suggesting that they still possessed antibodies to the virus .
Crowe ’s team was then able to isolate exceedingly rare B cells – the immune cells that produce antibodies – from eight of those samples and grow them in culture .
Seven of those samples produced antibodies to a 1918 virus protein , suggesting that their immune systems were waiting on standby for a long - awaited second outbreak .
“ The B cells have been waiting for at least 60 years – if not 90 years – for that flu to come around again , ” Crowe said .
“ That ’s amazing … because it ’s the longest memory anyone ’s ever demonstrated . ”
Crowe ’s team then fused cells showing the highest levels of activity against the virus with “ immortal ” cells to create a cell line that secretes monoclonal ( or identical ) antibodies to the 1918 flu .
The antibodies reacted strongly to the 1918 virus and cross-reacted with proteins from the related 1930 swine flu but not to more modern flu strains .
To test if these antibodies still work against 1918 flu in a living animal , Crowe ’s collaborators at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention infected mice with the 1918 flu and then administered the antibodies at varying doses .
Mice receiving the lowest dose of 1918 antibody – and those receiving a non-reactive “ control ” antibody – died .
All mice given the highest doses of 1918 antibodies survived .
Although aging typically causes immunity to weaken , “ these are some of the most potent antibodies ever isolated against a virus , ” Crowe said .
“ They ’re the best antibodies I ’ve ever seen . ”
The findings suggest that B cells responding to a viral infection – and the antibody - based immunity that results – may last a lifetime , even nine or more decades after exposure .
These antibodies could be used as potential treatments for future outbreaks of flu strains similar to the 1918 virus .
And the technology could be used to develop antibodies against other viruses , like HIV .
Most importantly , said Crowe , “ the lessons we are learning about the 1918 flu tell us a lot about what may happen during a future pandemic . ”

August is here , and if you watch NBC for more than 30 seconds , you know that means the Olympics are here with it .
And for me , a former gymnast with an unrequited wish to be a commentator about the sport , the Olympics mean only one thing : leotards , and lots of them .
Growing up in Australia , gymnastics was my life for six years .
It taught me focus and balance , and how to throw myself into or at something at high speed , with all my might and without hesitation or fear .
It taught me how to fall and get up again .
Unfortunately , it also taught me how to get injured , which I did , repeatedly , until there was no choice but to quit .
Eight years on , I still love to watch gymnastics , and still find my muscles flexing and releasing as I watch and live vicariously though the gymnast who wobbles and struggles with all her might to stay on the balance beam .
So every four years when the Olympics roll around and a fresh crop of 16 - year - olds in leotards grace our television screens , I sit down on the couch for hours at a time , watching routines , comparing teams and snapping at anyone who dares to disturb me .
Today I went onto the website of USA Gymnastics to check the final roster for the women ’s Olympic team , which was decided last week .
I was pretty surprised to discover that the U.S. women ’s Olympic gymnastics team is sponsored by CoverGirl cosmetics .
The team ’s three best and most photogenic members , Shawn Johnson , Nastia Liukin and Alicia Sacramone , are the new faces of the company , and USA Gymnastics is running a competition with a meet - and - greet with the gymnasts and a complete CoverGirl makeover as first prize .
Gymnastics is a sport that places enormous demands on its athletes .
It demands strength , flexibility , speed , agility , grace and power .
It demands that gymnasts throw themselves upside down , rotating and twisting , at once defying and depending on gravity .
And if they do n’t land with their feet stuck together , perfectly steady and without a step sideways , the judges take points off .
Moreover , female gymnasts , if they are ever to reach Olympic standards , need to do so by a very young age , with 16 being the minimum age for the Games , and few gymnasts over 20 competing at world standard .
As a result , gymnasts hoping to achieve that standard train for hours a day from before their teenage years and often move away from home to live with their coaches and teammates .
In recent years , the level of difficulty in women ’s gymnastics has skyrocketed , and so too has the amount of makeup .
The U.S. team , like many others , has begun to coif and buff its gymnasts so that close - ups of their faces as they prepare to dismount the beam show not only their concentration and determination , but also their perfectly applied eye shadow and long , mascara - coated lashes .
This practice is not entirely surprising , and gymnastics is certainly not the first sport to do it .
Recent attempts to doll - up WNBA players and sex - up other women athletes have garnered press attention , and the reactions of the general public and the sporting community have been mixed .
The fact that the team is now not only beautified , but also sponsored by a cosmetics brand , is no surprise either .
The rise of tweens as a major consumer group means that girls like Johnson ( 16 ) , Liukin ( 18 ) and Sacramone ( 20 ) — pretty , talented and slightly older than the tweens who aspire to be like them — are the Hannah Montanas of the sporting world .
Making them , and the rest of the Olympic gymnastics team , a little easier on the eye this August will surely benefit the bottom lines of NBC , USA Gymnastics and now CoverGirl .
So I guess I should n’t have been surprised upon arriving at the USGA website , but it was disappointing .
Gymnastics , at its core , is not about beauty — at least , not beauty in the CoverGirl sense of the word .
It can be beautiful to watch , and it requires grace and elegance , but at it ’s about raw power , explosive strength and remarkable discipline .
Is it not enough that women like Johnson , Liukin and Sacramone possess all these in spades ?
These women and the other six gymnasts going with them to Beijing have spent their lives missing school and family holidays and birthday parties to practice so that they could one day represent their country at the Olympics .
They ’ve torn ligaments , broken bones and herniated discs to reach this level of competition .
Liukin and Sacramone are almost guaranteed medals and Johnson , the reigning world champ , is a safe bet for individual all - around gold .
And yet , their faces will not appear on television or on the competition floor this August without first being coated with makeup .
( Johnson and Liukin also have valuable endorsement deals with a number of other companies , including Coke , McDonald ’s , Adidas and Visa , but the CoverGirl deal is unique in that the makeup is the only product that the gymnasts will promote by wearing during competition . )
The message this sends to young women , aspiring athletes or otherwise , is a worrying one : “ Your talent , your determination and your success matter , but your beauty matters more . ”
Even though these girls are now completing stunts so difficult that they were once considered impossible for women to even attempt , endorsing and being sponsored by a cosmetic company says that no matter what she accomplishes , a woman is little more than a pretty face .
Johnson , Liukin and Sacramone , as their membership on the Olympic team demonstrates , are so much more than that .
So are thousands of young gymnasts across the country who will be watching them this August .

Recall that I defined a rational tangle to be what you get by starting with a pair of untangled strings whose ends are at infinity and then sliding the strings around as much as you like keeping the ends at infinity .
If you do n't like the infinity bit , just think of strings inside a sphere with the ends constrained to lie on ( but free to slide around ) the surface of the sphere .
We also insist that the ends end up at the four diagonal directions .
Two rational tangles are considered to be isotopic if you can slide the strings about to turn one into the other , this time keeping the ends of the strings fixed .
( Such a motion is called an isotopy . )
As I 've previously mentioned , you only need twists , antitwists and rotations to untangle a rational tangle .
Here are the twist operations again : I 'm using a box to represent some unknown tangle .
The antitwist really is an inverse for the twist because one followed by the other gives you what you started with once you pull the strings straight :
We can also draw a rotation like this :
Let 's call the twist T ( so the antitwist is T ) and the rotation S and write products of operations from right to left in the usual way .
As both S and T are invertible , they generate a group .
It 's pretty clear that S=1 , where 1 is the identity operation .
So we do n't need a clockwise rotation , we can just use SBut here 's a surprising fact : S=1 .
If we perform a 180 degree rotation on a rational tangle the result might look different at first , but it is isotopic to what we started with .
I 'll leave you to convince yourself of this , but you can prove it by induction on the number of twists or antitwists you have in your diagram .
Try it for simple rational tangles first , maybe real ones made with real string .
Here 's an even more surprising fact , ( TS ) =1 .
I can demonstrate this pictorially .
Start with he result of applying T : The result of ST : The result of TST : The result of STST : After TSTST : But by sliding one string behind the tangle , allowed in an isotopy , we find that that is isotopic to this :
It 's not hard to see that another S brings us back to where we started .
( To do that we need to rotate the block labelled A , but that is allowed in an isotopy as we 're not moving the ends of the strings . )
This means we can write an antitwist in terms of twists and rotations .
But it 's convenient to keep using antitwists .
So we have S=1 and ( ST ) =1 .
It can also be proved that any other relationships between S and T can be derived from these using the operations in a group .
But this is a well studied group .
We can approach it like this .
Define two functions s and t byIt 's easy to show that s=identity =( st ) .
In fact , we have an isomorphism between the group of operations we can perform on rational tangles and the functions we can build with s and t .
It goes further .
Take the rational numbers and throw in ∞ to give us the extended rationals .
Let s and t act in the usual way on most of the rationals but throw in the extra rules s( ∞ ) =0 , s( 0 ) = ∞ and t( ∞ ) =∞ to handle infinity .
We have defined an action of s and t on the extended rationals .
We can exactly parallel this with the rational tangles .
Call this tangle 0 : We can reach every rational tangle by applying the operations S and T to 0 .
But if we replace S with s and T with t then the sequence of s's and t's will give us an extended rational number that labels the tangle .
Because S and T obey the same equations as s and t , isotopic knots will end up getting the same extended rational .
So we can use extended rationals to label the rational tangles .
Here are some examples :
Firstly just an antiwist , T . That corresponds to t( 0 ) = - 1. Two antitwists gives - 2:Composing a 90 degree rotation givesAnd applying another antitwist subtracts one again giving :
The name rational tangle is justified .
So , given any any rational tangle we simply need to find the corresponding extended rational and then figure out how to write it as a composition of s's and t's applied to 0 .
This is more or less the usual technique for finding the continued fraction representation of a rational .
And once we know the sequence , we can then apply it in reverse to untangle the tangle .
But there 's one catch , how can we go from the monadic representation of a tangle that I described previously to the corresponding extended rational ?
We 'll start on that problem in my next post , but amazingly the vector space monad can be used to do almost all of the work .
It 's surprising : it 's only a short bit of code that works out the untangling operations , but the explication is getting rather long now ...
An amazing application of this work is in the study of the untangling of DNA .
DNA is a double helix and the two parts of the helix must be separated in order to transcribe it .
As you might imagine , the DNA can become incredibly tangled by this process .
To deal with this , the topoisomerases snip , manipulate and repair the DNA so as to eliminate these tangles .
It was realised that it was possible to work out exactly what operations the topoisomerases were performing by analysing the before and after DNA strings in terms of rational tangles .
The perosn who first figured out this relationship between tangles and rational numbers was the ubiquitous JH Conway
For the proofs missing above , these references should fill in the details : Rational Tangles , Kauffman and Goldman Knots and Physics , KauffmanAnd if I 've lost you above , the following is a nice easy introduction : Conway 's Rational Tangles , DavisOne last thing .
I 've noticed some , but not all , papers define the twist oppositely from me .
Decision - making  whether it ’s taking out a loan or deciding whom to marry  is n’t a coldly rational , self - conscious act .
Instead , decision - making is a long chain of processes , most of which happen beneath the level of awareness .
We absorb a way of perceiving the world from parents and neighbors .
We mimic the behavior around us .
Only at the end of the process is there self - conscious oversight .
According to this view , what happened to McLeod , and the nation ’s financial system , is part of a larger social story .
America once had a culture of thrift .
But over the past decades , that unspoken code has been silently eroded .
Some of the toxins were economic .
Rising house prices gave people the impression that they could take on more risk .
Some were cultural .
We entered a period of mass luxury , in which people down the income scale expect to own designer goods .
Some were moral .
Schools and other institutions used to talk the language of sin and temptation to alert people to the seductions that could ruin their lives .
They no longer do .
Norms changed and people began making jokes to make illicit things seem normal .
Instead of condemning hyper - consumerism , they made quips about “ retail therapy , ” or repeated the line that Morgenson noted in her article :
When the going gets tough , the tough go shopping .
McLeod and the lenders were not only shaped by deteriorating norms , they helped degrade them .
Despite all the subterranean social influences , there still is that final stage of decision - making when individual choice matters .
Each time an avid lender struck a deal with an avid borrower , it reinforced a new definition of acceptable behavior for neighbors , family and friends .
In a community , behavior sets off ripples .
Every decision is a public contribution or a destructive act .
And now the reckoning has come .
The turn in the market punishes many of those seduced by financial temptations .
( Sometimes capitalism undermines the Puritan virtues , but sometimes it reinforces them . )
Meanwhile , social institutions are trying to re-right the norms .
The government is sending some messages .
The Treasury and the Fed are trying to stabilize the system while still ensuring that those who made mistakes feel the pain .
But the important shifts will be private , as people and communities learn and adopt different social standards .
After the Depression , a savings mentality set in .
After the dot - com bubble , a bit of sobriety hit Silicon Valley .
Now it ’s the borrowers ’ and lenders ’ turn .
As the saying goes : People do n’t change when they see the light .
They change when they feel the heat .
It is one of the world 's most remote islands but has a community spirit that is almost utopian , reports Huw Cordey from Anuta in the Pacific .
Anuta is the smallest permanently inhabited Polynesian island Sailing from Santa Cruz , in the eastern Solomons , it took us five days to reach Anuta .
It was one of the most tedious journeys I have made , the continuous pitching of our small yacht making it impossible to either read or write .
So it was with some relief when the speck of land that was Anuta finally appeared on the horizon .
Harbour master
But as the island grew larger , the question of how 300 people could live on such a tiny and isolated piece of land loomed even larger .
An outrigger canoe , paddled by two men with another bailing , came to meet us .
The bailer introduced himself as Joseph , who said he would look after us while on Anuta .
He told me he was the island 's harbour master , though this is something of a misnomer as the island has no harbour .
Indeed the anchorage is so poor that our boat had to leave a few hours after dropping us off .
It is also a job that does not exactly have Joseph rushed off his feet .
We were their first visitors in two years .
For a moment though , the feeling of isolation was overshadowed by Joseph's T shirt which was emblazoned with the words " Planet Hollywood , Las Vegas " .
It would be hard to imagine a greater contrast between two places .
Las Vegas , the capital of excess , and little Anuta where even a mirror is considered a luxury .
But while Anuta 's remoteness may have severely limited the quantity of consumer goods the island 's isolation has forged a community spirit that would be very hard to beat .
Island harmony
The Anutans have their own word for this , " aropa " , which means love and compassion .
It is an ideology that is applied to almost everything they do .
You can see it at work in the way food and tasks are shared , but it goes further than this .
Bizarrely they even adopt each other 's children .
Joseph 's oldest daughter was adopted by a couple who gave him their son in return a few years later .
When I asked Joseph about this , he simply said that it was not an issue as Anutans saw children as communal .
What was important was that everyone who wanted a child had one .
So if a couple was childless for any reason they would be perfectly entitled to ask another family member or friend if they could have their next child .
Both mother and father have to agree but requests are seldom refused .
Sharing Aropa also extends to outsiders .
During our two - week stay we had at least one meal in every one of the 24 households .
Anuta 's isolation has meant that few visitors ever return Sitting on the floor of each hut we were served communal dishes of fish and glutinous puddings of taro or manioc , all wrapped up in forest leaves .
The meals , prepared by the women , were virtually identical from one hut to the other , but this was all about aropa , affection through sharing .
Anutans see a strong similarity between aropa and Christian teachings like " love thy neighbour " , a fact that made the work of the first Anglican missionaries rather easier than I imagine they thought it would be .
Ukulele habit Twice a day the sound of a conch shell summons the faithful to church .
Or to put it another way , everyone .
Individuals may backslide for the odd service but attendance is so good it would be the envy of any British vicar .
Once inside the church women sit on the left , men on the right , apparently for no other reason than that is what they have always done .
Anutans are very protective of their traditions .
All the decisions on the island are , for instance , still made by a single , unelected Chief .
We worry about our children getting in with the wrong crowd , taking drugs , drinking , teenage knife crime , Anutans worry about their kids playing homemade ukuleles
When I asked Joseph what the biggest changes have been in the last 20 years he said " young people playing ukuleles " .
Was this a problem ?
I asked rather jokingly .
" Well , " he replied more seriously , " before the ukuleles the younger generation would dance every evening .
Now it is rare . "
I got the same response from at least half a dozen other adults .
As trivial as this sounds it does make one think about our own , supposedly advanced , society .
We worry about our children getting in with the wrong crowd , taking drugs , drinking , teenage knife crime .
Anutans worry about their kids playing homemade ukuleles .
Few return
On the day we left , a group of men came onto our yacht and with little notice broke into their farewell song , " Sorrow come to us . "
One of the chorus lines was : " Sorry we will never see your faces anymore . "
It was enough to bring a lump to my throat .
The lyrics had a point however .
Anuta 's isolation has meant that few visitors ever return .
But then this is probably just as well .
The beauty of the Anutan way of life comes from the relative absence of outside influence .
In the end it was easy to see what the island 's 300 people saw in the place .
As a hardened traveller I do not say this lightly , but the Anutans were the most harmonious and hospitable people I have ever met .

What are these ?
BOSTON — Massachusetts may have been the first state to legalize same - sex marriage for its residents , but when California last month invited out - of - state gay and lesbian couples to get married , the potential economic benefits did not go unnoticed here .
Now Massachusetts wants to extend the same invitation .
On Tuesday , the State Senate voted to repeal a 1913 law that prevents Massachusetts from marrying out - of - state couples if their marriages would not be legal in their home states .
The repeal , which passed with no objections on a voice vote , is expected to pass the House later this week .
Gov. Deval Patrick , a Democrat and a supporter of same - sex marriage whose 18 - year - old daughter recently disclosed publicly that she is a lesbian , has said he will sign the repeal .
The repeal of the out - of - state marriage ban would come more than four years after Massachusetts became the first state to allow gay men and lesbians to marry , and same - sex marriage advocates said the timing was carefully calculated to catch the prevailing political — and economic — winds .
State officials said they expected a multimillion - dollar benefit in weddings and tourism , especially from people who live in New York .
A just - released study commissioned by the State of Massachusetts concludes that in the next three years about 32,200 couples would travel here to get married , creating 330 permanent jobs and adding $ 111 million to the economy , not including spending by wedding guests and tourist activities the weddings might generate .

The Great Cougar Hunt G4 Video Triggers Lawsuit
Hot spot Chapter 8 in Agoura Hills in southern California was the trigger point that caused three women to launch a lawsuit .
The trio went to the club in 2007 and ended up being video taped and featured on a G4 program called Attack of the Show in a story segment entitled " The Great Cougar Hunt " .
The lawsuit defines the word cougar as " a sexually cunning 35 + female who is on the hunt for a much younger energetic male " .
The suit further specifies that the women were portrayed as " older women who were attempting to pick up younger men at Chapter 8 , which was described on the show as a ' world famous cougar hot spot ' .
The segment describes cougars as the easiest and most ravenous prey for younger men . "
The women in question claim that they were filmed without their consent and were NOT on the hunt for younger men - or any men for that matter .
The lawsuit was emphatic in stating that " the Plaintiffs do not date younger men at all . "
In fact , the show was so outrageous and offensive to the three women that they are suing G4 and the two hosts of the show in excess of $ 1 million .

Despite criticism from the right , today Barack Obama stood by his call for American schools to increase their emphasis on teaching foreign languages .
On Tuesday , Obama said , “ We should be emphasizing foreign languages in our schools from an early age . ”
This brought the wrath of the right wing immigrant haters who claims that Obama wants to teach American kids Spanish but not force immigrants to learn English .
Obama clarified and stood by his earlier in statement in Dayton , Ohio today , “ I said something the other day down in Georgia , and the Republicans jumped on this .
I said , you know , absolutely immigrants need to learn English , but we also need to learn foreign languages . ”
He called this flap a problem that comes up when somebody tries to tell the truth , “ This is an example of some of the problems we get into when somebody attacks you for saying the truth , which is we should want children with more knowledge .
We should want our children to have more skills .
There ’s nothing wrong with that !
It ’s a good thing . ”

Obama did n’t say that American kids had to learn Spanish .
He said that American students should learn a foreign language .
Studies show that students who learn a foreign language have higher test scores .
Plus most four year colleges and universities have a foreign language requirement , so students who are n’t taught a foreign language earlier are less prepared for college .
I am also a strong believer that English language proficiency must be a requirement for immigrants coming into this country .
Anyone who does n’t speak English is putting themselves at a disadvantage in our economy , and immigrants who speak English earn more money than those who do n’t .
No matter how much the immigrant haters try to fence and wall us in , they ca n’t deny that we live in a global economy , and the ability to speak multiple languages benefits both the foreign worker who comes to the United States , and the American worker who works abroad .
It is a no brainer to suggest that our public school curriculum should be updated to reflect the realities of the 21 st Century , but those who want to live in a white world that is stuck in the past will always find a way to resist change .
Obama quotes came from here .

Boy Pushed Girl Off a Bridge After She Refused to Give Him Her iPod
On Tuesday , August 19 , Indian police arrested a schoolboy in eastern India on suspicion of killing a younger student because she did not want to give her iPod .
According to Swapan Banerjee , police officer in charge of the police station in Seuri , West Bengal , the 14 - year - old boy pushed the girl off a 30 - foot bridge .
Then he approached her unconscious body and strangled the 10 - year - old student .
The police officer believes that the boy intentionally murdered the girl because she refused to give him her iPod .
It is worth mentioning that the economic boom in India made millions of people richer , but it also increased the gap between the rich and the poor .
" We were always worried about students bringing such gadgets to the school .
We have issued several notices and given enough warnings asking them not to bring iPods and cell phones to class , " said Tanmay Ghosh , the headmaster of the school where the two students attended their classes .
The boy was arrested when he tried to hide the girl 's body in a bush .
If he is convicted of murder , the student could spend up to 10 years in a juvenile detention center .
Indian police mentioned that the boy 's family refused to give any comments .

NEW YORK -- Both major presidential candidates have promised to roll back the Bush Administration 's torture archipelago .
Both say they 'll close Guantánamo , abolish legalized torture , and respect the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war .
Obama also pledges to eliminate " extraordinary rendition , " in which the CIA kidnaps people and flies them to other countries to be tortured , and says he will investigate Bush Administration officials for possible prosecution for war crimes .
If followed by other meaningful changes in behavior -- withdrawing from Afghanistan and Iraq and foreswearing preemptive warfare -- restoring the rule of law and respecting the rights of " enemy combatants " can start America 's long , slow climb back to moral parity in the community of nations .
But there are worrisome signs that Barack Obama and John McCain 's commitment to moral renewal is less than rock - solid .
McCain , who claimed to have been tortured as a POW in North Vietnam , says a lot of the right things .
" We do not torture people , " he said in a 2007 Republican debate .
" It 's not about the terrorists ; it 's about us .
It 's about what kind of country we are . "
He used his Vietnam experience against fellow Republicans , bullying Congress into passing a law banning torture against detainees held by the military .
Bush signed McCain 's bill in late 2005 , saying it " is to make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture , whether it be here at home or abroad . "
Days later , however , Bush issued a secret " signing statement " declaring that he would ignore the Detainee Treatment Act.
NYU law professor David Golove , an expert on executive power , said : " The signing statement is saying ' I will only comply with this law when I want to , and if something arises in the war on terrorism where I think it 's important to torture or engage in cruel , inhuman , and degrading conduct , I have the authority to do so and nothing in this law is going to stop me . "
McCain , who says as president he would veto a bill rather than issue a signing statement negating its contents , was no doubt angry about Bush 's perfidy .
But , fearful of alienating Bush and the GOP leadership as he geared up for his '08 presidential campaign , he remained silent .
In February of this year , McCain backtracked still further from his anti-torture position , voting against legislation that would have blocked the CIA from subjecting inmates in its secret prisons to waterboarding , hooding , putting duct tape across their eyes , stripping them naked , rape , beatings , burning , subjecting them to hypothermia , mock executions , and other " harsh interrogation techniques . "
" The CIA should have the ability to use additional techniques , " he argued .
He refused to explain why the CIA ought to be allowed to torture while the DOD should adhere to international standards of civilized behavior .
The U.S. continues to torture .
Unlike McCain , Obama remains a critic of officially sanctioned torture .
" We 'll reject torture - - without exception or equivocation , " Obama says .
He would also end " the practice of shipping away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far - off countries , of detaining thousands without charge or trial , of maintaining a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law . "
The trouble is , Obama is n't laying the groundwork for stopping torture or closing Guantánamo or other U.S. gulags in his stump speeches .
He talks a lot about energy policy , healthcare , jobs and the economy -- and withdrawing troops from Iraq so they join the war against Afghanistan instead .
If he becomes president , people will expect him to do those things .
Without a sustained focus on human rights issues , however , any moves he makes will seem to come out of the blue -- and face stronger pushback from Republicans anxious to bash him as weak on national security .
Why does n't Obama emphasize Bush 's war crimes ?
Maybe he 's trying to play the Great Uniter , or maybe he knows that many Americans do n't give a rat 's ass about the pain inflicted against people they 'll never meet in places they 've never heard of .
Who knows ?
All we know for sure is that , day after day , Obama fails to talk about what is arguably the worst crime of the corrupt Bush Administration .
Of course , renouncing torture is n't enough .
Those who authorized it must be held to account .
However , it does n't seem likely that they will .
Asked in April whether he would prosecute Bush Administration officials for authorizing torture , Obama delivered his now - familiar duck - and - cover : say the right thing , then weasel out of it .
" If crimes have been committed , they should be investigated , " he said .
But not for at least four years : " I would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of the Republicans as a partisan witch hunt , because I think we 've got too many problems to solve . "
Memo to Barack :
This is n't about prosecuting Republicans .
It 's about prosecuting torturers .
" Prosecution of any officials , if it were to occur , would probably not occur during Obama 's first term , " Slate reports , citing Obama campaign insiders .
" Instead , we may well see a Congressionally empowered commission that would seek testimony from witnesses in search of the truth about what occurred .
Though some witnesses might be offered immunity in exchange for testimony , the question of whether anybody would be prosecuted would be deferred to a later date -- meaning Obama 's second term , if such is forthcoming . "
First would come a South African - style " Truth and Reconciliation Commission , " where the truth would come out .
But the torturers would get off scot - free .
" The commission would focus strictly on detention , torture and extraordinary rendition , or the practice of spiriting detainees to a third country for abusive interrogations .
The panel would focus strictly on these abuses , leaving out any other allegedly illegal activities during the Bush Administration , such as domestic spying , " says Slate .
Second - - well , there might not be a second .
Even if there is , shortsighted Americans ' appetite for justice and accountability will probably have been diluted by the time 2013 rolls around .
Mainline media liberals , in conjunction with Obama supporters , are even going so far as to suggest that Bush issue his torturers with a blanket pardon in exchange for their testimony at Obama 's toothless commission .
Regardless of who wins in November , we will get a president who 's better on torture and other human rights issues than George W. Bush .
At least their words sound nice .
But real change and moral redemption will only begin if we -- Democrats , Republicans and everyone else -- demand the next president stands by his pretty promises .
Until they start taking taking torture , Gitmo and human rights seriously , neither Obama nor McCain should be able to appear in public without facing questions and heckling about these issues .

( NaturalNews ) Xerox subsidiary Palo Alto Research Center ( PARC ) has developed a type of paper that , combined with a special printer , can print documents that erase themselves after a day so that the paper can be reused .
Xerox says that 25 percent of all documents get recycled the same day they are printed , and that 44.5 percent are intended only for a single viewing .
Using the new printer and paper for one - shot documents like daily menus , work summaries and office memos could vastly reduce paper and energy use , the company said .
" Think of the Google map you printed to get here , " PARC Area Manager Eric Shrader said at a product demonstration .
" Thirty years ago , we said the future was paperless . " " Despite our reliance on computers to share and process information , there is still a strong dependence on the printed page for reading and absorbing content , " said Paul Smith , manager of Xerox 's new materials design and synthesis lab .
The new paper is coated with a chemical that turns dark upon exposure to ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation .
In order to create a document , the printer simply bombards the paper with UV radiation in the appropriate places .
While the " ink " will eventually fade on its own , after 16 to 24 hours , the printer can also be used to erase a page and print something new .
Tests by Xerox found that if it was not torn or crumpled , a single piece of paper could be put through the print - and - erase cycle hundreds of times .
According to Shrader , it takes 204,000 joules of energy to create a new piece of paper and 114,000 to recycle one .
Printing onto a normal sheet of paper uses about 2,000 joules .
It takes only 100 joules to print one page of the special erasable paper .
If the printer also has to erase the prior image , printing uses about 1,000 joules of energy
The erasable paper and ink are available in a variety of colors .
Xerox expects to take the new product commercial within the next few years .

Still , Passarella said it 's much ado about very little .
In the past 15 years , there might have been one or two instances in Montgomery County of someone making an issue out of someone wearing a political T - shirt or button .
Since 2004 , doctors in rural emergency rooms have been using webcams to get an expert opinion before treating stroke patients .
A report , published on Aug. 3 in The Lancet Neurology says that the new technology helps them make the right decision .
“ When a person suffers a stroke , time is of the essence , ” says Brett Meyer , a UCSD professor who led the study .
Clot busting drugs , like alteplase , should be given within three hours of a stroke , but deciding which patients actually need that medication is tricky .
If a stroke specialist can see and hear their patient , zoom in on their pupils and facial muscles , and ask them questions , they are far more likely to offer the right advice .
In fact , experts who examined patients with the webcam made the right decision 98 percent of the time , compared to 82 percent when they simply talked to the emergency room doctor by phone .

Making homemade corn and flour tortillas is easier than you think , and the results are above and beyond anything you can buy at the grocery store .
What 's the Difference Between Flour and Corn Tortillas ?
There are two basic types of tortillas , flour and corn :
Flour tortillas are most often made with a mixture of all - purpose wheat flour , baking powder , and fat .
Lard is the traditional fat used to make flour tortillas , and it helps the dough roll easily at room temperature .
But , if you do n’t have lard on hand or want to make a vegetarian option , you can swap it out with vegetable shortening or butter .
Flour tortillas are usually made larger and thinner than corn tortillas because the gluten in the wheat flour allows the dough to be stretched without falling apart , plus the fat in the dough keeps it from cracking and tearing when you 're rolling it out .
Corn tortillas are made with masa harina , water , and sometimes but not always a little fat .
Masa harina is dried hominy that has been soaked , washed , and treated with slaked lime or ash , then ground to produce a flour or dough .
Do n’t mistake it with cornmeal or corn flour – tortillas made with these other flours will not turn out right .
Some stores even offer pre-mixed masa harina dough , so all you have to do is roll and cook .
And , there ’s no reason to stick to just masa harina or all - purpose flour .
Have some fun and experiment with different grains , which change the flavor and texture , like Mexican Whole Wheat Flour Tortillas or Oat Bran Tortillas .
You can even make tortillas for special diets , like Keto Tortillas or gluten - free Cassava Flour Tortillas .

How to Make Tortillas
Image zoom HOMEMADE FLOUR TORTILLAS Holiday Baker
Whether you ’re making flour tortillas or corn tortillas , or any other homemade tortilla recipe , the steps to making tortillas are basically the same .
This recipe for flour tortillas is made the traditional way using lard .
Watch the video to see how to mix the ingredients to make the flour tortilla dough , how to knead the dough , divide it into balls , roll the balls flat into rounds with a rolling pin , and cook the tortillas in a hot , dry skillet .
1 . Mix the dough .
Mix your ingredients for the dough .
Start with combining any dry ingredients , and then add the wet .
If you 're making corn tortillas , slowly stream in the liquid ( usually water ) .
If you 're making flour tortillas , mix in the lard or butter with a fork , pastry cutter , or your hands until it resembles coarse crumbs , then slowly add the water .
Use your hands or a wooden spoon to mix the dough until it comes together in a ball .
2. Knead it .
Once the dough has come together , turn it out onto a work surface and knead until it ’s smooth and elastic .
This will just take a minute or two .
It should spring back , like Play - Doh , and wo n’t be sticky .
Wrap it in plastic and let rest at room temperature to let the flour absorb all of the water and let the dough relax .
Tip :
If at any point the dough becomes dry and brittle , you can add a little more water to make it pliable again .
3. Divide and press .
Divide the dough into the number of tortillas your recipe calls for .
If you own a tortilla press , let it do the work for you .
If you do n’t have this pretty specific kitchen gadget , no worries !
Working with one piece of dough at a time , place it in a large plastic bag or in between two pieces of parchment paper , very lightly dusted with corn or all - purpose flour .
Use your palm to flatten it a bit , and then roll it as evenly as possible with a rolling pin .
Aim for 4 to 6 inches for corn tortillas and 8 to 10 inches for flour .
Tip :
No rolling pin or tortilla press ?
No problem .
You can place a ball of dough between sheets of plastic , a gallon zip - top plastic bag with the sides cut open , or parchment paper , and press it flat with the bottom of a glass , metal pie plate , or cast iron skillet .
If you plan to make tortillas frequently , this cast iron tortilla press will help speed the process .
4 . Get cooking .
As soon as you begin rolling out your tortillas , you can start cooking them .
A cast iron pan is best – whether it ’s a large skillet or a flat griddle that lays across two burners .
( You can use a non - stick skillet , but it might cause the tortillas to get a little tough . )
Stick with cast - iron , if you have it .
Heat your pan over medium - high heat .
There ’s no need to add any oil .
Cook the tortilla until brown spots appear on the bottom , 1 to 2 minutes , then flip and cook on the other side .
Tip : Hot enough ?
To know if your skillet or griddle is hot enough , flick a few drops of water on the cooking surface .
The water should sizzle immediately when it ’s at the right temperature .
5 . Wrap ‘em up .
While you ’re still cooking and before you wrap your tortillas around delicious fillings , keep the hot - off - the - griddle tortillas wrapped in a dry towel .
This not only keeps them warm but also helps to steam and soften the tortillas , as they can be a little dry and brittle right off the grill .
If you ’re not planning on eating them right away ( though , it ’s hard not to ) , let them cool completely then store tightly wrapped in the fridge for up to 3 days .
Tip :
If you want to reheat your tortillas , wrap them loosely in a damp kitchen or paper towel and microwave in 30 - second bursts until warmed through .
How to Make Corn Tortillas
Image zoom CHEF JOHN'S CORN TORTILLAS Chef John
For corn tortillas , mix the dough as directed in your recipe , but divide the dough into smaller balls — about the size of a walnut .
Keep the dough wrapped in plastic while you work with one piece at a time so the masa does n't dry out .
Chef John shows you how to mix the corn tortilla dough , plus a special trick for laying the flattened tortilla in the hot pan to cook .
Made too many ?
If you have leftover tortillas , turn them into chips to serve with salsa , guacamole , and other dips .
Simply cut them into wedges and fry or bake them .
Do n’t forget to sprinkle the chips with a little bit of salt right after they have cooked !
People have different motivations for heavy drinking
The government believes it has identified nine types of heavy drinker as it launches a new alcohol campaign .
Research by the Department of Health in England with focus groups found heavy drinkers often fell into one of a number of categories .
These ranged from de-stress and depressed drinkers to people who boozed because of boredom or to bond .
Experts said helping people to understand the reasons for their drinking habits was " very useful " .
THE NINE TYPES OF DRINKER Depressed drinker De-stress drinker Re-bonding drinker Conformist drinker Community drinker Boredom drinker Macho drinker Hedonistic drinker Border dependents
The nine types of heavy drinker
The research showed that those drinking heavily - defined as consuming 35 units a week for women , 50 for men , which is twice the recommended limit - did so for a variety of reasons .
For example , de -stress drinkers were defined as people in pressured jobs who used alcohol to relax .
Whereas it said bonding drinkers could be anyone in society who had hectic social lives and lost track of their drinking .
The research was done to inform a new drive by ministers to crack down on heavy drinkers .
A pilot is being run in the north west of England over the coming months to specifically target heavy drinkers .
Over 900,000 households will receive leaflets through the post highlighting the link between drinking and conditions such as cancer and liver disease .
The campaign is focusing on adults aged over 35 who fall into the nine drinking categories .
Risk Along with the information about disease risk , people will be given details about where they can go to get help .
This will include a website where they can calculate their own individual risk from drinking and get access to a self - help manual .
A telephone helpline will also be set up .
The government hopes the tailored approach will help 4,000 people in the region to reduce their drinking within a year .
If it is successful , officials hope to roll it out to other parts of England .
Public health minister Dawn Primarolo admitted these heavy drinkers were a " tough one to crack " .
But she added : " This is a totally fresh approach to helping people understand the effects of their drinking habits and help them make changes for the better . "
Alcohol Concern chief executive Don Shenker said : " This type of marketing is very useful .
" In order to get people to examine their drinking they need to become aware of why they are doing it and what motivates them . "
Click here to return The Nine Types of Drinker Name Characteristics Key motivations Depressed drinker Life in a state of crisis eg recently bereaved , divorced or in financial crisis Alcohol is a comforter and a form of self - medication used to help them cope De-stress drinker Pressurised job or stressful home life leads to feelings of being out of control and burdened with responsibility Alcohol is used to relax , unwind and calm down and to gain a sense of control when switching between work and personal life .
Partners often support or reinforce behaviour by preparing drinks for them Re-bonding drinker Relevant to those with a very busy social calendar Alcohol is the  shared connector ' that unifies and gets them on the same level .
They often forget the time and the amount they are consuming Conformist drinker Traditional guys who believe that going to the pub every night is  what men do ' Justify it as me time ' .
The pub is their second home and they feel a strong sense of belonging and acceptance within this environment Community drinker Drink in fairly large social friendship groups
The sense of community forged through the pub -group .
Drinking provides a sense of safety and security and gives their lives meaning .
It also acts a social network Boredom drinker Typically single mums or recent divorcees with restricted social life Drinking is company , making up for an absence of people .
Drinking marks the end of the day , perhaps following the completion of chores Macho drinker Often feeling under-valued , disempowered and frustrated in important areas of their life Have actively cultivated a strong alpha male ' that revolves around their drinking  prowess ' .
Drinking is driven by a constant need to assert their masculinity and status to themselves and others Hedonistic drinker Single , divorced and / or with grown up children Drinking excessively is a way of visibly expressing their independence , freedom and  youthfulness ' to themselves .
Alcohol used to release inhibitions Border dependents
Men who effectively live in the pub which , for them , is very much a home from home A combination of motives , including boredom , the need to conform , and a general sense of malaise in their lives
Your comments
Interesting article but it's not clear whether the research indicates that heavy drinkers fall into one category or can fall into a variety of categories .
I , myself , am a heavy drinker and happen to be keeping a weekly drinking diary as part of an exercise .
I have been drinking more than 100 units a week , and can say with certainty that I do not fall into just one category .
Several of those apply .
Dan , London I do n't think I fit into any group , I drink because I enjoy a few pints now and then .
It might be at the pub with friends and family , it might be at home with the wife , or it might just be a couple of pints of ale because I want to drink it because I like beer .
Why do we always have to classify everything ?
James Harding , Chippenham , England
Yet another article aimed at destroying the pub trade !!!
Why do n't they just ban alcohol all together and close down all the pubs in the country .
A lot of pubs ( especially village pubs ) rely on their regulars ( all be them heavy drinkers ! ) to support them , and this is just another way the government is going to get rid of even more pubs .
Why can't these red tape producers just leave the hard working people alone and let them make their own choices ???
If people want to drink heavily ... just let them !

This type of stereotyping known as ' behavioural segmentation ' is all the rage in government nowadays .
They seem to have missed the ' I drink because I enjoy wine and being a bit drunk is enjoyable ' segment - the starting point appears to be that all drinking is a problem .
What a miserable , preachy , interfering bunch .
Mrs B , Bedfordshire
It seems to me that we move on from one type of drinker to the next .
I can identify with at least four of them , ending up with moving from the de-stress to the depressed type .
The move from one type to another comes without being aware of the change until you get to the depressed type and then we realise we need help .
Anne , Oxford , UK I have a 70 year old mum , who has been drinking progressively heavier since being made redundant approx 20 years ago .
She has been hospitalised several times as a result .
She is receiving counselling which is not proving to be very effective .
I would classify her the boredom drinker .

Up the street , a sign ...

OK , now I really have heard everything !
The Israeli city of Petah Tikva is seemingly fed up with all the doggie poop lying around on their streets .
So their solution is to set up a dog poop DNA database .
To build this , all the dog owners of the city are being asked to take their canine pals into the local vet to have their dog ’s mouth swabbed .
Rover or Tiddles can then have their DNA information entered into the computer .
From that point on , whenever Rover or Tiddles does his or her poop business , the owner can pick it up and put it into one of the specially marked bins on Petah Tikva ’s streets .
If they do that , they will be instantly eligible for doggie prizes such as pet foot coupons and dog toys !
Sounds like a game show does n’t it ?
“ Congratulations !
You and Fido have won the Poop Show !
Let ’s see what you have won tonight …. oooh , a juicy bone ! ”
If on the other hand , your dog does their business and you decide to leave it on the street , then the Israeli Poop Mossad will come kicking in your door in the middle of the night and issue you with a hefty fine .
No coupons or toys for you !
Twinkles wo n’t be able to lower her bottom onto that piece of grass ever again !
Oh the disgrace !
This unique Israeli project serves to remind you of one thing .
Whenever you think your job sucks , remember that somewhere in Petah Tikva , someone is opening bags of dog poop and comparing them to DNA in a database to find out which dog it belongs to !
Suddenly your job does n’t feel so bad does it ?
With the IAEA ’s next Board of Governors meeting set to begin tomorrow , the probe into Syria ’s alleged secret nuclear facility appears to be faltering over lack of evidence .
While the analysis of the samples taken from the facility during the IAEA ’s June visit to the site are only partially complete , the tests so far have found nothing to back up the US claims about the nature of the target .
Israeli planes attacked the site in September of last year , with the help of the United States .
While Israel ’s government has remained officially silent about the operation to this day , the Bush Administration told Congress in April that the facility was designed to produce small amounts of plutonium .
Dana Perino also said the White House was convinced the facility “ was not intended for peaceful purposes ” .
But other than a handful of Israeli diplomats claiming to have overheard a Syrian admit the site was a “ nuclear facility , ” the evidence so far remains elusive .
While a still - in - construction facility would n’t have had radioactive material yet , the Israeli strike should have strewn a significant amount of graphite around the area if the was truly being built for the alleged purpose .
The only explanation given for the lack of this evidence is a quote from an anonymous diplomat who claimed “ the feeling is that the Syrians may have dumped all of it down the hole “ .
Syria built a new building over the top of the attacked site , which it insists was just an ordinary military building .

Stay quiet on your salary , or come out with it ?
This is a topic that 's spurred a lot of discussion .
The post that started it said that saying what you want was a no - win game when it came to interviews , ending with you either leaving money on the table or nixing your chances at the job by shooting high .
While we can't claim to be experts on the matter , we think commenter vered has a good point :
If you 're confident in your job hunt and really do n't want to pen yourself in , you can refuse to offer your own number — but only if you 're willing to let the job fall away .
If not , you probably can't stonewall on the issue , and it 's seemingly best to try and shoot a little high .

Profiling the award - winning environmental campaign work of Archbishop Bartholomew of Constantinople , spiritual leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians , Riazat Butt asks if religion can help prevent eco-catastrophe ( The pope of hope , June 18 ) .
After all , as the archbishop told Butt : " Religious people were indifferent , or even hostile , to science .
Scientists and ecologists could see little relationship between their world and the world of faith . "
At a global environment conference in London last year , my professional institution , the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management , brought together representatives of all the major faiths .
There was one matter on which they all agreed : the need to collaborate for action on the environment , and especially on climate change .
The leadership of Archbishop Bartholomew was seen as a beacon .
But faith groups have been silent for too long on this crisis , and should do far more to remind us of our moral duty to restore and protect the fragile ecological balance of the planet .
As the archbishop said : " We are all culpable .
Each one of us has a smaller or greater contribution to the deliberate degradation of nature . "
Butt , in reporting the environmentalism of some religious leaders , suggests that an ecological coalition of faiths is possible : " There is hardly a religious leader in the world now who is not preoccupied by the problems of pollution and climate change . "
And it 's true .
In the last year or so we have seen faith leaders including the Dalai Lama , the Bishop of Liverpool and Pope Benedict step down from the pulpit and speak directly on environmental issues .
This is good news and " God- bothering " of the sort we need for the 21st century .
What the faith groups can offer is a framework - ethical , spiritual , imaginative and intellectual - for the pursuit of all the good that relates to human destiny .
Fazlun Khalid , director of the Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Sciences , has urged faiths to civilise and change behaviour for a fairer , sustainable world .
But they must engage with people and evangelise first - heeding Bartholomew 's big idea for an economic model that is about replenishment , compassion and nurturing .
In other words : it 's creation , stupid !
In the meantime , as Archbishop Bartholomew warns , cohorts of secularists continue to pursue greedy and harmful lifestyles believing that techno - fix solutions alone will be our salvation .
The truth is that blind faith in the ability of technology to sustain a growing global population - hard - wired to materialism - that has already breached environmental limits is bonkers .
Faith group leaders must be more vociferous in challenging this - they have unique access to governments and institutions .
They must exercise that influence by holding them to account .
Religion can help prevent eco-catastrophe .
And , as Butt 's report argues : " Religious leaders are in a better position to make an impact on their congregations than politicians or celebrities . "
They have a huge audience and legitimacy over the issue .
What are they waiting for ?

Watching game film with Andy Reid , head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles , can make you woozy .
He lounges behind the wide desk in his office , feet up , using a wireless control to freeze the image of a play on a screen at the opposite end of the room , and then starts rolling it forward and backward , forward and back , first the whole play and then only portions of it , forward and back , forward and back , until he has pieced all the moving parts together .
Reid is a very big man , a former collegiate offensive lineman , and when I met him last spring , he was in full off - season mode : tan , relaxed , and draped in a colorful Hawaiian silk shirt large enough to display the entire Amazon rain forest .
Reid was coming off another winning year — the Eagles had made it to the second round of the postseason playoffs just months earlier — and he was already well into his preparations for the next season .
Pro football is a year - round occupation these days , so he was doing me a favor by agreeing to help me with research for my book , The Best Game Ever , an account of the celebrated 1958 NFL championship game between the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants .
I ’ve written about football in the past , but I am by no means an expert , so I had gone looking for a pro coach to help me break down film of the famous game .
I live just outside Philadelphia and once covered the Eagles for the local newspaper , so I phoned Derek Boyko , the team ’s affable public - relations director .
Boyko warned me that the club ’s assistant coaches were probably too busy , but he nevertheless agreed to ask around .
He called back to say that all of the coaches , curious about the way the game was played before most of them were born , had expressed an interest .
“ But they need permission from Andy , ” he said .
“ I ’ll ask him when he comes back from leave in a few weeks . ”
Boyko called me weeks later to say , “ Andy wants to do it . ”
It seemed odd at first for a pro coach to have never seen film of this historic game — a little like finding a doctor of English literature who had never read Macbeth .
But success in pro football , as in any intensely competitive , constantly evolving arena , depends primarily on current intelligence :
What did my opponent last do against me ?
What did he do last week ?
A pro coach is not inclined to search for what he needs in old black - and - white film .
History is … well , history .
But no craftsman or professional can be completely uninterested in seeing how he measures up against past standards of excellence .
How good was the game then ?
How capable were the players ?
How clever were the coaches and schemes ?
The game in question defined excellence for an era .
It pitted the best defense in the NFL , the Giants , against the best offense , the Colts , playing for all the marbles .
It featured 17 future NFL Hall of Fame players , coaches , and owners .
On the field were great athletes like Johnny Unitas , Raymond Berry , Lenny Moore , Gino Marchetti , Frank Gifford , Andy Robustelli , Emlen Tunnell , Rosey Grier , and Sam Huff .
Coaching on the sidelines were Vince Lombardi and Tom Landry for the Giants , and for the Colts , Weeb Ewbank , the only pro coach who ever took teams from two different leagues ( the NFL and the AFL ) to national championships .
Reid was born in the year this game was played , and one reason he had never seen it is that the TV broadcast has been lost .
But for serious study , I had wrested something even better from the archives of NFL Films : the grainy , monochrome “ coaches ’ film ” of the game , soundless footage shot from the sidelines high over midfield , with all the time - outs , huddles , and game breaks edited out .
Instant analysis envelops pro football like a cloud , but with most plays there is no way to tell what really happened and why without a careful , slow - motion dissection of the film .
Reid is one of this craft ’s most successful practitioners .
Even among pro coaches , he is notable for toting thick binders filled with notes and plans , and for fielding highly complex systems on both sides of the ball .
Earlier in his career , he was quarterbacks coach for the Green Bay Packers , grooming Brett Favre and helping that team to a Super Bowl championship in 1997 .
His tenure in Philadelphia has been the most successful of any coach ’s in the team ’s long history : starting in 2001 , he led the Eagles to four consecutive National Football Conference championship games and a Super Bowl — although , much to the consternation of long - suffering Eagles fans , he has yet to bring the Lombardi Trophy home to Philadelphia .
We watched the game in his office in the Eagles ’ training complex , just a few blocks from Lincoln Financial Field , where they play .
When I covered the team in the early 1990s , the Eagles ’ offices , locker room , and workout facilities were housed in a few cramped , dark , damp rooms in the basement of the now - demolished Veterans Stadium .
Today the team , whose worth is estimated at more than $ 1 billion , is housed at a state - of - the - art facility that sprawls over an area as large as a college campus .
“ Okay , ” he ’d say , when he had examined a play from snap to tackle , “ here ’s what happened . ”
Then out would pour a detailed explication : what the offense was trying to do , how the defense was trying to stop it , the techniques ( good and bad ) of the various key players , the historical roots of the formations and the play ’s design , and ultimately why it worked or failed , and who was responsible , either way .
The wealth of information Reid gleaned from a single play reminded me of the way Patrick O’Brian ’s 19th - century naval hero , Jack Aubrey , eyeballing an enemy ship during a sea chase , could read from the play of its sails and the disposition of its crew the experience , intentions , strengths , and weaknesses of his opponent .
Reid ’s insight told on the first offensive play of the game .
Colts coach Weeb Ewbank had designed a trick play , so secret that in his pregame meeting with his team in the visiting locker room at Yankee Stadium , he had mouthed the play call to them , fearful that the room was bugged .
Observing the opening formation , Reid noted with surprise that all but one of the Colts linemen were positioned to the left of center Buzz Nutter .
“ This is a completely unbalanced formation , ” he told me .
“ You ca n’t even do that today . ”
The rules would no longer permit it : “ You have to have some guys on the line of scrimmage . ”
In the backfield , fullback Alan “ The Horse ” Ameche , a Heisman Trophy winner at the University of Wisconsin , was lined up behind quarterback Johnny Unitas ; right halfback Lenny Moore was three steps to Ameche ’s right ; and left halfback L. G. Dupre was split far out to the left side of the backfield .
Unitas did n’t give the Giants a chance to set up in a recognizable defensive formation , even if they had one for such a bizarre look .
He bent over , and Nutter immediately snapped the ball .
Moore took the handoff — and was tackled for a loss .
“ So they came out with a trick play in mind , and it really was n’t all that good , ” Reid said , chuckling .
The main reason the play failed , he pointed out , was a missed block by Dupre , a speedy back whose initials , which stood for Louis George , had earned him the nickname “ Long Gone . ”
While Moore took the handoff from Unitas and followed Ameche around the left side of the Colts line , Dupre ’s job was to race forward and hit Harland Svare , the Giants ’ right - side linebacker , taking him out of the play .
But the film tells the tale : “ He did n’t get the crack [ block ] right here , ” said Reid , using a red laser to point at Svare dodging Dupre , “ and he kind of screws the play up . ”
Svare races into the backfield , forcing Moore to step in front of Ameche , his blocker ; the two briefly collide , and then as Moore tries to recover and race to the outside , he is pulled down for the loss .
“ And then , the fullback forgot the snap count , ” Reid said , rolling the play back to the beginning again .
Sure enough , on the snap of the ball , Ameche remains in a set position until Moore actually takes the ball from Unitas .
“ He forgot that it was a quick count … That ’s that Wisconsin education right there . ”
I told Reid that I had listened to the NBC radio broadcast , and had been struck by how much more quickly the game moved then than it does today .
Breaks between plays and possessions are longer and more frequent now , to allow for more commercials , and the use of video replay to reexamine contested calls by the referees causes still more delays .
Modern coaches use these gaps in the action for analysis , for sideline conferences and hand signals , or , in the case of the quarterback , for giving instructions over a direct radio link to his helmet .
In 1958 , the game , once started , was primarily in the hands of the players .
Unitas called his own plays .
Defensive field captains like the Giants ’ Sam Huff were on - field tacticians .
The game was faster and simpler .
It also lacked many of the refined mechanical and tactical innovations that are commonplace in modern football .
For instance , Reid was surprised to note that wide receivers assumed a three - point stance before the snap of the ball — today they stand upright , which allows them a broader view of the defensive backfield .
The pass defenders , meanwhile , stood upright on the old film , with one foot forward , one back , and then just backpedaled to stay with the receivers .
In the modern NFL , backfield defenders poise in a forward crouch with their weight evenly balanced on both legs , and retreat by taking short stutter - steps backward , ready to bolt in either direction and avoiding the crossover step , a potentially costly mistake that can offer a receiver the split - second advantage he needs to break away .
Basic positioning along the line of scrimmage has changed as well .
A few plays in , Reid noted that the Giants defensive tackles , Dick Modzelewski and Rosey Grier , were “ flexed back off the ball ” — that is , set up more than a yard away from the Colts linemen .
“ That ’s probably for the run game , ” Reid said , explaining that by hanging back from the line of scrimmage , the defenders could get a better look at the direction of the play before attacking .
I asked , “ Why would n’t you do that today ? ” “ Well , you give those big guys a head start on you , ” Reid said .
“ At that time I would imagine that the linemen were fairly equal athletically , and now the offensive linemen are so big and the defensive linemen are relatively smaller . ”
If you ’re a defender today , he went on , and you spot a 300 - plus - pound blocker a two - step running start , he ’ll knock you “ right on your ass . ”
Reid surmised correctly .
I checked the average weight of the starting offensive and defensive linemen in the ’ 58 game : the Colts ’ offensive front five weighed an average of 243 pounds , and the Giants ’ defensive front five weighed an average of 244 pounds .
Today , offensive lines on average weigh nearly 25 pounds more than defensive fronts .
Sean McCabe
Not everything has changed as much .
Reid recognized one Colts offensive formation as “ the one we run the most — two receivers , two backs , and a tight end . ”
And he even noticed some of his own plays in the mix .
“ Look , this is a rattler route , ” he said , watching Raymond Berry twist his way into the backfield , turning the Giants cornerback completely around and gaining a step .
“ This is the one we ran in the Super Bowl that got picked by stinkin ’ Rodney Harrison . ”
( Harrison ’s interception in the closing minutes of Super Bowl XXXIX clinched the New England Patriots ’ 24 – 21 win over the Eagles . )
After the Colts ’ opening boondoggle , the Giants settled into a 4 – 3 defense , which remains the pro standard .
What we were watching on film was the original 4 –3 , contrived by New York defensive coach Tom Landry , years before he helped create a dynasty as head coach of the Dallas Cowboys .
It features four players on the line of scrimmage backed by three linebackers ; four pass defenders back up this formation : two cornerbacks split wide on either side , and two deep defenders , or safeties .
The 4–3 was designed to counter the growing sophistication of passing offenses .
Before the 1950s , football had primarily been a ground game , but after the invention of the wide receiver in 1949 , defenses struggled to cover pass catchers without becoming too vulnerable to the run .
But while the 4–3 has survived to the present day , the simplicity of the old game often amazed Reid to the point of disbelief .
The offensive formations were so basic that many of them are no longer even used in the pro game .
The Giants frequently lined up in the T - formation — the quarterback behind the center , and the three running backs lined up horizontally about three yards behind him — and both teams employed the antiquated “ single wing , ” where one halfback and the fullback line up beside each other , behind the quarterback , while the other halfback splits wide , sometimes all the way out to the flanker position .
The game as it was played in 1958 “ is still an entertaining sport to watch , but it ’s just not near as complicated , ” Reid said .
“ If I ’m calling the plays ” on offense , he went on , “ I get paid to get into a rhythm with the guy calling the defense ” on the other side .
When a coach achieves the right “ rhythm , ” he can sense what his opponent is thinking — and for Reid , grasping the “ rhythm ” of the classic game was fairly easy .
“ I can see what the offense is doing , ” he said .
“ You can almost call it offensively and defensively . ”
For instance , he was struck , early in the game , by how close behind the line of scrimmage the Giants safeties , Emlen Tunnell and Jimmy Patton , were setting up .
Safeties ordinarily play five to 10 yards back .
Tunnell and Patton were just three or four yards back .
“ First time I saw those safeties that tight , ” said Reid , “ I ’d take the tight end up the seam , ” referring to the hash marks that line the field to the right and left of the center .
As if hearing Reid ’s advice , that ’s what Unitas did two plays later .
First , he felt out the defense : facing second down and long , the quarterback handed the ball to Dupre , who plunged into the left side of the Giants ’ defense , where he was hit by Tunnell .
“ ‘ Okay , ’ the Colts are saying , ‘ this guy , number 45 [ Tunnell ] , is getting tight , and he was very aggressive on the last play , so we ’ll sell a hard fake , ’ ” Reid speculated .
The Colts would set up as if they were going with another running play , he predicted , with the tight end , Jim Mutscheller , “ coming up and out like he is going to crack ”
Tunnell with a block , but instead going past him up the field .
“ Then they should try and get [ a pass ] over the top to Mutscheller . ”
On third down , Mutscheller moved just as Reid had suggested , faking a block on Tunnell and racing up the hash marks .
Unitas faked the handoff and dropped back , looking downfield toward his tight end .
“ But this guy [ Tunnell ] sniffs it out ! ”
Reid said , impressed , watching as the safety turned and matched the tight end stride for stride .
Unitas , harried suddenly by the Giants ’ blitzing right cornerback , instead hurried a throw to Moore — “ his safety valve , ” said Reid — that was almost intercepted .
Because the ploy failed , most spectators , myself included , would not have recognized Baltimore ’s intent , or understood why it failed .
Reid saw the reason .
He froze the play and noted the fullback , Ameche , missing his block on the Giants cornerback , forcing the quarterback to hurry his throw .
Players are forever screwing up the coach ’s perfect plans .
The Eagles coach saw another opportunity later in the game , when the Giants safeties opted to line up farther downfield in a “ cover four ” defense , with the four players in the backfield — Patton , Tunnell , Carl Karilivacz , and Lindon Crow — divvying up the defensive secondary into four lanes , each covering one .
“ The thing you ’d tell Johnny [ Unitas ] right here , ” Reid said , “ is to take your best mismatch .
You put T.O. [ former Eagle , now Cowboys receiver , Terrell Owens , a noted deep threat ] here and just picture him running a post over the top of that guy [ Crow ] . ”
Sure enough , several plays later , the Colts exploited the formation , zeroing in on the most obvious mismatch by sending the speedy Moore racing down the right side of the field one - on - one with Crow .
Unitas heaved the ball for a 60 - yard gain .
Reid was impressed with Moore ’s speed and hands ; less so with his blocking .
On a later play , when Moore lined up in the backfield , Reid laughed and rolled the film back .
“ Watch this , ” he said .
The ball is snapped and Unitas is eventually brought down by the Giants ’ defense , while Moore simply stays put in the same stance he was in before the snap of the ball .
In slow motion , his statue - like pose is comical .
On a later play where Unitas was sacked , Reid again laughed and pointed to Moore missing an assignment .
“ Lenny did n’t help , picking his nose right there , man .
That ’s pissing me off . ”
Then , on another play , “ Lenny needs his ass whipped a little bit right here . ”
( In the Hall of Famer ’s defense , his back was injured early in the game when Huff picked him up and slammed him into the ground .
Moore nearly came out after that , but Ewbank urged him to continue playing , if only as a decoy , because the Giants ’ defense was keying on him . )
Time after time , watching the vaunted Giants defense in action , Reid remarked how much he wished he could play against it .
Landry ’s squad lined up in the same formation , with the same personnel , on almost every down .
“ Very seldom do you see the same formation in a game anymore , ” he said .
“ That ’s just the way it is today .
But this was just a part - time job for these guys .
They did n’t have the time to be in the building [ for classroom study ] all day . ”
Again , Reid was right .
Most pro players in the 1950s held down full - time jobs off the field .
Huff was a salesman for the textile company J. P. Stevens .
Unitas and many of his teammates worked at Bethlehem Steel .
Art Donovan , the Colts ’ hilarious defensive tackle known as Fatso , was a liquor salesman .
Most of the men earned less than $ 10,000 a year playing football .
The highest - paid stars made between $ 15,000 and $ 20,000 — enough to support a middle - class lifestyle in 1958 , but nothing like today ’s hefty paychecks .
Players who took off from their full - time jobs to play were often expected to make up the time by working long hours in the off - season .
This made them better prepared for life after football than many of their modern counterparts are , but it also meant that they were less prepared for Sunday ’s action .
Still , even if players had been able to devote time to perfecting more - complex schemes , Reid noted , there simply would n’t have been enough time to implement them , because of the quicker , pretelevision speed of the game .
In today ’s NFL , coaches will often alter both the personnel and the formation of their teams between downs .

Interviews : Football ’s Founding Fathers ( September 19 , 2008 )
Mark Bowden discusses the legendary Giants - Colts game of 1958 and reflects on how the sport and its players have changed in the past half century .
The biggest difference between the two eras — literally — is the size and speed of modern athletes .
The average player on the 1958 Colts starting team weighed 222 pounds .
The average weight of a 2007 Indianapolis Colts starter was 243 pounds .
And there is ample reason to believe that today ’s pros are not just bigger , but faster .
For one thing , the league draws on a talent pool far broader and deeper than in the past .
It was widely believed ( and the evidence on the field suggested ) that in the 1950s the league limited the number of African American players , with an unwritten agreement restricting each team to seven .
Today , merit is the only criterion , and in some parts of the country , prospects for the pro game are selected and groomed when they are still in grade school .
Training methods , dietary habits , coaching , and the quality of competition at all levels have vastly improved .
In most cases , the modern pro football player has been preparing to play the game for most of his young life .
Even the kickers have evolved .
Few modern teams lack field - goal kickers who can readily boot the ball through the uprights from 40 yards out , while the old toe - kickers , like Steve Myhra for the Colts and even Pat Summerall for the Giants , were shaky beyond 20 .
The consistency of modern kickers has transformed offensive strategy .
In the overtime period of the classic game , for instance , the Colts elected to run five plays from inside the Giants ’ 20 - yard line , because Ewbank did not trust Myhra enough to wager the game on his leg .
I asked Reid whether any of the legends on the field in 1958 might be able to keep up in today ’s game .

Wikipedia is considering a basic change to its editing philosophy to cut down on vandalism .
In the process , the online encyclopedia anyone can edit would add a layer of hierarchy and eliminate some of the spontaneity that has made the site , at times , an informal source of news .
It well could bring some law and order to the creative anarchy that has made the site a runaway success but also made it a target for familiar criticism .
The idea , which is called “ flagged revisions , ” has only been possible in the last few months because of a new extension to the software that runs Wikipedia .
It is sure to be a hot topic here at Wikimania 2008 , in Alexandria , Egypt , because it promises to enact a goal for “ stable versions ” of articles that has long been championed by Wikipedia ’s founder , Jimmy Wales .
An administrator at the German Wikipedia , where the first large - scale experiment is happening , will give a talk Friday on how it ’s going .
The German site , which is particularly vexed by vandalism , uses the system to delay changes from appearing until someone in authority ( a designated checker ) has verified that the changes are not vandalism .
Once a checker has signed off on the changes , they will appear on the site to any visitor ; before a checker has signed off , the last , checker - approved version is what most visitors will see .
( There are complicated exceptions , of course .
When a “ checker ” makes a change , it appears immediately .
And registered users , who make up less than 5 percent of Wikipedia users , will also see “ unchecked ” versions . )
Approximately 60 percent of the more than 750,000 German articles have been checked , and thus are under watch in the future .
There are approximately 3,000 checkers , though Mathias Schindler , one of the administrators of German Wikipedia , says he expects the numbers to grow , since the only requirement is that someone have made a total of 300 edits , none of them vandalism .
The Germans who are implementing the idea stress that the checkers are not a heavy hand , but are doing the most cursory examination to see that no curse words or obvious non sequiturs have been added .
While some revisions can wait a day , usually they only take minutes , as checkers like Mr. Schindler spend hours going through lists of changes to approve .
Also , they point out that edits that have n’t been approved are still in the system and show up to anyone who later wants to make edits .
So contributions would not be lost or overwritten as they wait for a checker to approve them .
Administrators at Wikipedias in other languages , as well as people at the Wikimedia Foundation , said they were watching the German experiment carefully expecting that some version of it would migrate to the other versions .
Ultimately , the checkers hope for their own obsolescence .
If vandals , online or off , cannot show their work to the world , perhaps fewer vandals will take up the task .

Do they secretly desire certain things more than others – if so , what are they ?
EIGHT :
Is there anything about the way they make decisions which could be seen as a built - in bias .
Example : Architects = exceptionally analytical ) .
NINE :
Do they speak ‘ their own ’ language ?
If they do and you can then weave their language into your copy – how powerful do you think this will be ?
TEN :
Who else is selling a similar product or service to you and how are they selling it ?
ELEVEN :
Who else has tried selling them something similar and how or why did such an effort fail ?
As you begin to get inside your customer ’s mind , as you peel it open with all the precision of a scalpel wielding brain surgeon . . . you WILL discover the answers to the 11 Profiling Questions above .
Find out what types of magazines , trade journals , check online to see what e-zines your customers subscribe to and sign up yourself , check forums , blogs , groups such as Yahoo groups , boards and so on .
With today ’s technology there ’s no excuse for you not to be able to collate as much detail as you can about your ideal customers .
To build your profile – which then allows you to be able to describe your customer (s ) – you want to discover certain information such as :
Their age , sex , marital status , do they own their own home , what type of car do they drive , what are their purchasing habits , do they have credit cards and if so , what type , their income level , their occupation , what magazines do they subscribe to etc. etc .
When you have built such a profile about your customers , how valuable do you think this will be to you ?
Here ’s an example of a one - on - one mentoring session with a customer .
The discussion was about a leaflet drop which had been handed out which had received a good response .
I proceeded to ask a few of the 11 profiling questions above and in less than 60 seconds the answers changed his business .
Question 1 :
I asked what sex his customers were ?
Answer :
His reply : Female .
Questions 2 :
He was then asked what % are female .
Reply : 80 % .
Question 3 :
Then he was asked what was the age group of the women ?
Answer :
He replied : 45 - 55 .
So in less than 60 seconds , it was known that 80 % of his paying customers were females aged between 45 - 55 .
There ’s more !
Question 4 :
He was then asked did he know the number one reason his customers went to him ?
He answered : Stress .
He was then asked to not guess his answers , to find out for sure and get back with his findings .
It turned out that 90 % of his customers ( not 80 % ) were female , aged between 45 - 55 and there to overcome stress .
Now , this powerful knowledge was sitting in his head swimming around like a one legged duck swimming in circles with nowhere to go .
None of this information was telegraphed in his headline or his sales message .
Imagine then running a headline which screamed out to these specific customers and then including the relevant information in his body copy too .
These are the ones he knows generates 90 % of his sales .
Can you see how powerful these types of questions and the impact they can have on your business ?
“ Dedicated to Kicking Your Ass Until You Succeed ! ”

Pro-McCain yard sign shows burning twin towers David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday September 17 , 2008
Print This Email
This A group of Republican activists is displaying signs in Florida with a provocative image of the burning World Trade Center to argue on behalf of John McCain 's presidential campaign .
The yard sign , which was spotted outside a McCain campaign appearance in Jacksonville , displays the message " Keep America Safe ! Vote McCain Palin . "
The signs were produced by the Ronald Reagan Republican Assembly of Central Florida , a chapter of the National Federation of Republican Assemblies , which appears to be a conservative activist organization unconnected to the party itself .
MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann noted the sign 's existence in a segment in which he also condemned a separate group of conservative activists who are purchasing newspaper insert advertisements including DVDs of the right - wing movie " Obsession : Radical Islam 's War Against the West . "
Olbermann referred to the DVD as " neocon pornography " and accused the right of using 9/11 as a political tool , a practice he himself has occasionally engaged .
" Remind yourself that when we were attacked the government that let us down was Republican and that their new candidate has a secret plan to capture the guy who masterminded 9/11 , but he wo n't tell anybody about it until we elect him president , " Olbermann said to end his Monday night segment .

Efficient computation with Dedekind reals
Andrej Bauer
, , ,
Two versions of this talk were given at Computability and complexity in analysis 2008 and at Mathematics , Algorithms and Proofs 2008 .
Joint work with Paul Taylor .
Abstract : Cauchy ’s construction of reals as sequences of rational approximations is the theoretical basis for a number of implementations of exact real numbers , while Dedekind ’s construction of reals as cuts has inspired fewer useful computational ideas .
Nevertheless , we can see the computational content of Dedekind reals by constructing them within Abstract Stone Duality ( ASD ) , a computationally meaningful calculus for topology .
This provides the theoretical background for a novel way of computing with real numbers in the style of logic programming .
Real numbers are defined in terms of ( lower and upper ) Dedekind cuts , while programs are expressed as statements about real numbers in the language of ASD .
By adapting Newton ’s method to interval arithmetic we can make the computations as efficient as those based on Cauchy reals .

I 'm thinking philosophically .
I 'm wondering , at the conceptual level , about gadgets .
And it occurs to me that my life can be divided into two time periods : without stuff and with stuff .
In the without - stuff period , things were things .
If something new came into the house , such as a chair or even a vase , it got noticed .
The arrival of a television was like a visit from the Queen .
We were n't well off and the stuff we wanted was either too expensive or had n't been invented .
All that changed with the dawning of the with - stuff era .
These days , I 've got so much stuff , I do n't really know how much stuff I 've got .
Most of it useless .
But out of all the crap , I can point to four gadgets from the past two decades that I value for their indispensable brilliance , and the first is the mobile phone .
I once wrote that it will never be cool to talk on the mobile phone , and I still believe that .
But , as a device , it is genius .
It works virtually everywhere , can cost relatively little and is smaller than your average chocolate bar .
About two years ago I was having a dark Wednesday of the soul in a small town in southern Poland .
It was late , wet , cold .
I pulled out my phone , pushed one button , and in a couple of seconds I was talking to my wife .
We were thousands of miles apart and connected by nothing other than excited atoms .
Define the word miracle in a way that excludes the mobile phone , if you can .
Item two is the MP3 player - an iPod , in my case .
I do n't listen to music on headphones - feels like migraine .
And I love my vinyl to the point of fetishism .
But I travel a lot and vinyl is heavy , and did you ever try playing an LP in the car ?
Ten thousand songs on something smaller than a cassette .
Put that in the miracle basket as well .
Item three : the debit card .
Internationally accepted , near - weightless , super - convenient , largely idiot - proof .
And cheque books .
Yes , we have fraud and banking errors and all the rest of it , but then we used to have robbery .
Last , there 's the satnav .
As a geography graduate , I eschewed ( first time I 've ever used that word , wo n't happen again ) the satnav on all kinds of ideological grounds .
I like maps , I'm " spatially aware " , I want to comprehend where I am , not just be given the coordinates by a voice - print .
I thought satnav would compromise all those things , and maybe it has done , but who cares , because it 's made life easier .
Sure , it makes mistakes , sends articulated lorries into farmyards , etc , but it makes far fewer mistakes than I do .
A couple of weeks ago it took me from one school in deepest Shropshire to another , through a ford and down a cart - track , but it got me there without fuss and without having the map in one hand and only one eye on the road .
Phone , card , iPod , satnav - I 'm good to go .
Most of the stuff that does n't work is to be found at the back of our kitchen cupboards .
No matter how many arms or pulleys or grippers are added , the basic corkscrew cannot be improved upon .
Basters , broilers , ice - cream makers , melon ballers , juicers , zesters , corers , peelers , steamers , mixers , kneaders - the list is endless .
Most come under the title " labour - saving " - a beautiful contradiction , because , when it comes to getting them out and setting them up and rinsing them out and putting them back , who can be bothered ?
But the epitome of pointlessness , and the device for which I reserve the most scorn , is Volkswagen 's electronic handbrake .
Since when was it a problem to pull up the handbrake ?
The handbrake , that most reassuring and necessary of driver aides , reduced to a button on the right - hand side ( ie the wrong side ) of the steering wheel , a button that basically does n't work
In the post - stuff era , when civilisation fragments and society collapses through weakness of mind and feebleness of body , the designer of VW 's electronic handbrake must be hauled in front of the rioting mob and held accountable for their crime .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China expressed “ deep concern ” on Monday over a meeting last week between U.S. Republican presidential candidate John McCain and exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama .
China has ruled Tibet with an iron fist since its troops marched into the remote Himalayan territory in 1950 and accuses the Dalai Lama , who fled into exile in 1959 after an abortive uprising , of being a separatist .
McCain met the Nobel Peace Prize laureate in Colorado on Friday and urged China to address human rights concerns and free Tibetan prisoners .
But China ’s Foreign Ministry repeated its long - standing position that anything to do with Tibet was purely an internal affair .
“ The Chinese side expresses deep concern about the above report , ” spokesman Liu Jianchao said in a statement , referring to the McCain meeting .
“ We oppose the Dalai engaging in splittist activities in any country in any capacity , and oppose anyone using the Dalai issue to interfere in Chinese internal affairs .
This position is consistent and clear , ” he added .
Though China and envoys for the Dalai Lama have met twice this year following rioting in Tibet in March , the government regularly blasts him for supporting violence , seeking independence for the region and wanting to harm the Beijing Olympics .
The Dalai Lama denies supporting violence , says he wants only true autonomy for the region rather than independence and that he supports China holding the Olympics .
Beijing last year cancelled a number of high - level meetings with German officials after Angela Merkel became the first German chancellor to meet the Dalai Lama .
The ubiquity of secure online transactions often makes us take them for granted .
Most people will happily type their credit card and other personal information into a web form and hit Submit , as long as they see that little padlock in the status bar .
Sometimes they do n’t even check for that .
Have you ever had your browser cough up a security warning dialog about the certificate on the page you ’re viewing ?
Either the certificate has expired or it ’s self - signed — which means that no independent certificate authority can verify that the page you ’re visiting is really who they say they are .
How many times have you just accepted it anyway ?
It could mean that someone malicious is trying to initiate a man - in - the - middle attack , in which they intercept your conversation while they forward it to the real site so everything looks normal .
You think you ’re talking directly to your bank , but a black hat just copied your username and password .
How do they do it ?
If they can gain control of your network access ( for instance , an unsecured wireless connection ) or poison a DNS cache , then they can redirect your HTTP requests to their own server first .
Of course , in order for them to read what you type over a secure connection , they have to give you their public key for encrypting the message .
After they decode it , they ’ll re-encrypt the message using the public key from the site you think you ’re accessing .
To prevent that , public keys are issued by certificate authorities in digital certificates that verify the identity of the key ’s owner , so your browser can check it .
Now of course that does n’t mean that I can’t pay a certificate authority to say that I ’m someone I ’m not , but if the key on your bank ’s site is different today than it was yesterday then you might be under a MitM attack .
With self - signed certificates , no CA is involved at all , so you never know for sure when someone else is peeking at your packets .
That ’s the principle behind a new Firefox 3.0 extension called Perspectives , developed by some smart people at Carnegie Mellon University .
This extension verifies that the public key for a site matches the key obtained for that same site by “ notaries ” — external servers that monitor key values .
If the key you obtained does n’t match the known value for that site , then you get a stern warning that you might be under attack .
You can tune the sensitivity of the extension quite a bit , as seen in this dialog :
With the default settings ( shown here ) , the extension only checks when you ’d normally get a warning from the browser .
If the notaries check the key out OK , then the browser warning is suppressed .
Chad Perrin ( who writes for TechRepublic on IT Security ) commented to me that the social engineering aspect of this feature could be beneficial , as fewer false warnings may lead the user to pay more attention to warnings when they do occur .
To test this out , I went into “ Certificates ” and deleted my trusted certificates for a couple of sites I know that use self - signed certs — then I navigated to each one .
After a slight pause , the “ Perspectives ” in the status bar displayed a green check - mark icon , and the following ribbon appeared at the top of the window :
If you ’re really paranoid , you can crank the settings way up .
For instance , you could change the Quorum to 100 % ( all notaries have to have the same key ) , and set the Duration to a non -zero value ( the notaries had to have seen the same key for more than a day ) .
You can also tell Perspectives to contact the notaries for all HTTPS sites , even if the certificate checks out with the CA .
I ran it that way for a while to see how it would work .
I would guesstimate that it adds 1 to 2 seconds to each secure page load .
Noticeable , but not onerous .
Whenever you ’re on a secure page , you can click the “ Perspectives ” in the status bar to see what Perspectives thinks of the current page .
Here ’s what it looks like for GMail ( with validate all HTTPS turned on ) :
If I had to guess , I ’d say that the notaries have been in operation for 60.75 days .
As the authors note , this is no silver bullet .
A “ powerful adversary ” might be able to spoof the notaries as well as the site under attack .
And there ’s nothing here to stop a malicious site from pretending to be something it is n’t .
But it should cut down on some MitM attacks by helping users to validate self - signed certificates .
SAN FRANCISCO / Pelosi's first priority is to halt Iraq war / Speaker taking office Jan. 4 comes home to talk up plans

Incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told cheering supporters Saturday that Democrats would move the nation in " a new direction ... for all Americans , not just the chosen few , " and pledged an ambitious agenda on subjects ranging from House ethics to foreign policy .
Speaking in San Francisco the day after adjournment of the Republican - controlled 2005 - 06 Congress , Pelosi declared -- as she had throughout her party 's successful November election campaign -- that " my highest priority , immediately , is to stop the war in Iraq . "
In that effort , she added , " We extend a hand of friendship and cooperation to the president .
We hope we can work together . "
But while promising a " spirit of civility and bipartisanship " in the Congress that convenes on Jan.
4 , Pelosi took a few partisan shots at Republicans , saying they catered to the very rich and fostered corruption .
The first House vote of the year , she said , will be on new rules that will transform " the most corrupt and closed Congress in history into the most honest and open . "
She gave no details and did not refer to the current debate among Democrats over the ethics proposals .
Pelosi has endorsed new restrictions on lobbyists and some disclosure requirements for lawmakers sponsoring " earmarks , " or local projects tucked into larger spending bills .
Other Democrats have proposed going further by banning earmarks and transferring ethics enforcement from congressional committees to an independent agency .
Nearly 1,000 supporters had hors d'oeuvres and drinks and applauded Pelosi and other Democrats at the annual campaign - funded event in the Fairmont Hotel 's Gold Room .
Pelosi 's staff said it was about twice the size of past gatherings .
Rep. George Miller , D - Martinez , who will become chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee , told the crowd that Washington pundits who had relegated Democrats to permanent minority status had n't reckoned on Pelosi , " a political disruptor . "
Pelosi later said she welcomed " an opportunity to disrupt , an opportunity to make a difference . "
She noted she would become not only the first female speaker , but also the first from California .
She reviewed her plans for the first 100 hours : raising the minimum wage , cutting student loan interest rates in half , requiring Medicare to negotiate lower prices with prescription - drug makers , rolling back tax breaks for oil companies and passing legislation to promote stem cell research .
Also high on her agenda , Pelosi said , are " very aggressive measures to stop global warming " and a labor - backed " card check " proposal to require employers to negotiate with any union that signs up a majority of a company 's employees .
Pelosi and Mayor Gavin Newsom , who also spoke , had ripostes for Republicans who warned during the campaign that electing a Democratic majority would foist " San Francisco values " on the nation .
" While we are diverse , we speak with one voice when it comes to fairness and giving people hope in the city of St. Francis , " Pelosi said .
Newsom lauded " a city of dreamers , a city of doers ... a city where we unite around our common humanity .
... Those are the values of San Francisco . "
Boston - Today , a federal judge lifted an unconstitutional gag order that had prevented three Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) students from disclosing academic research regarding vulnerabilities in Boston 's transit fare payment system .
The court found that the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Agency ( MBTA ) had no likelihood of success on the merits of its claim under the federal computer intrusion law and denied the transit agency 's request for a five - month injunction .
In papers filed yesterday , the MBTA acknowledged for the first time that their Charlie Ticket system had vulnerabilities and estimated that it would take five months to fix .
Tuesday 's ruling lifts the restriction preventing the student researchers from talking about their findings regarding the security vulnerabilities of Boston 's Charlie Card and Charlie Ticket -- a project that earned them an " A " from renowned computer scientist and MIT professor Dr. Ron Rivest .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) represents the students as part of its Coders ' Rights Project .
" We 're very pleased that the court recognized that the MBTA 's legal arguments were meritless , " said EFF Legal Director Cindy Cohn , who argued at the hearing .
" The MBTA 's attempts to silence these students were not only misguided , but blatantly unconstitutional . "
The students had planned to present their findings earlier this month at DEFCON , a security conference held in Las Vegas , while leaving out key details that would let others exploit the vulnerability .
The students met with the MBTA about a week before the conference and voluntarily provided a confidential vulnerability report to the transit agency .
However , the MBTA subsequently sued the students and MIT in United States District Court in Massachusetts less than 48 hours before the scheduled presentation , without providing any advance notice to the students .
The lawsuit claimed that the students ' planned presentation would violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ( CFAA ) by enabling others to defraud the MBTA of transit fares .
A different federal judge , meeting in a special Saturday session , ordered the trio not to disclose for ten days any information that could be used by others to get free subway rides .
" The judge today correctly found that it was unlikely that the CFAA would apply to security researchers giving an academic talk , " said EFF Staff Attorney Marcia Hofmann .
" A presentation at a security conference is not some sort of computer intrusion .
It 's protected speech and vital to the free flow of information about computer security vulnerabilities .
Silencing researchers does not improve security -- the vulnerability was there before the students discovered it and would remain in place regardless of whether the students publicly discussed it or not . "
Although the gag order was lifted , the MBTA 's litigation against the students still continues .
The students have already voluntarily provided a 30 - page security analysis to the MBTA and have offered to meet with the MBTA and walk the transit agency through the security vulnerability and the students ' suggestions for improvement .
" The only thing keeping the students and the MBTA from working together cooperatively to resolve the fare payment card security issues is the lawsuit itself , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kurt Opsahl .
" The MBTA would be far better off focusing on improving the MBTA 's fare payment security instead of pursuing needless litigation . "
This case is part of EFF's Coders ' Rights Project , launched two weeks ago to protect programmers and developers from legal threats hampering their cutting - edge research .
EFF was assisted in this case by John Reinstein , ACLU of Massachusetts Legal Director , and Fish & Richardson attorneys Adam Kessel , Lawrence Kolodney , and Tom Brown .

I just found this today while browsing Reddit : Practicality : PHP vs. Lisp ?
This is exactly the psychology that goes through the head of everybody who hears about Lisp and decides to check it out .
Summary : Lisp is awesome , except for the multitude of trivially annoying things that make it much less so , to the point that everybody just throws in the towel and uses PHP or Ruby or whatever .
I hate reading articles like this because I know that it 's basically all true .
I also know that within 24 hours , the comments section of that blog post will be filled by Lisp apologists who keep suggesting workarounds and fixes .
These are the same people who went nuclear a couple of years ago when Reddit got rewritten in Python , and it's all the same old arguments .
If Brian Carper 's blog post annoys you , stop apologizing and start innovating .
Languages exist in a market place and right now Lisp marketing itself quite poorly .
Yes , I know that " marketing " is rejected by techie types who think that it should never matter , but as a marketing guy who markets to techies , I 'll tell you that it absolutely does .
And those who reject marketing will flat - out lose to those who understand it .
As a " customer " of a particular language , nobody wants to hear how their particular issue is unimportant in the grand scheme of things .
Nobody wants to hear that such and such a problem was " solved " 20 years ago with this particular hack or workaround that only Lisp gurus know about .
Nobody wants to hear that it's a simple job to port that particular library over to that particular implementation .
People have a ton of free language options these days , and if Lisp is n't going to compete in terms of ease of use and productivity , then people will choose languages that will .
Note that theoretical ease - of - use does n't count .
Everybody will probably admit that Lisp macros are all - that - and - a - bag - of - chips , and building DSLs is way more productive than writing boilerplate code , and nevermind CLOS and closures , etc .
Those are GREAT things that Lisp brings to the party , but they are completely useless if a newbie can't crank out a web page in 30 minutes like he can with PHP .
If you step back for a second and really try to listen to the arguments against Lisp , you 'll find that there are two classes of gripes : fundamental dislikes and competitive disadvantage .
Things like griping about the parenthesis are a fundamental dislike .
Some people do n't like parenthesis .
Fine .
Lisp is not for you .
Parenthesis and sexprs are pretty fundamental to Lisp .
They 're part of its DNA .
If you do n't like them , then you do n't like Lisp itself .
There 's no issue with that .
Just use something like Java .
Most Lisp programmers hate Java syntax , too .
If you 're really enlightened , take a look at Dylan .
In short , as a guy who likes Lisp , I 'll defend Lisp 's parenthesis until I die .
The other type of gripes are about competitive disadvantage .
These are issues that are not fundamental to the language itself , it 's just that the Lisp community has n't done much to solve them .
Things such as having a reasonable set of standard libraries to do programming in today 's Internet - connected world have nothing to do with the fundamentals of Lisp .
Library documentation and tutorials would help .
Having a decent system for the installation of libraries that does n't depend on little - known and sometimes unmaintained web servers would also help .
Everything in this category is hard to defend , and Lispers should universally be ashamed of it .
Imagine saying to a " customer " something like , " Yes , I know that everything is undocumented and the installation infrastructure is unreliable , but you know , that 's a feature . "
Rubbish !
In short , while somebody , somewhere , will always be griping about Lisp , the Lisp community , all of us , could go a long way toward making all those gripes fall into the " I hate parenthesis " category rather than the " There are n't any libraries and what libraries do exist do n't have any documentation . "
There is a lot of work to do .
Let 's get coding ...
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
An influential investment strategist has a dire forecast for U.S. stocks , credit markets and the continued independence of some of the nation 's top financial institutions .
Jeffrey Gundlach , chief investment officer at Los Angeles - based mutual - fund company TCW Group Inc. , told clients on a conference call late Wednesday that the crisis in credit and housing may not abate for several years and is actually getting worse .
In the deteriorating climate he sees unfolding , Gundlach said , the Standard & Poor 's 500 Index SPX , - 0.48 % could fall another 30 % , giant Citigroup C , - 2.12 % could become an " AIG - sized debacle , " Morgan Stanley MS , - 2.35 % would merge with a banking company , Wachovia WB , - 3.74 % wo n't be able to stand alone , default rates on even prime mortgages could soar , and European banks ' woes are just beginning .
" This is no market for old men , " said Gundlach , who also manages TCW 's flagship Total Return Bond Fund TGLMX , +0.18 % .
" This is no market for old - school thinking . "
Gundlach based his assessment on a belief that housing prices still face several more years of decline , a protracted slump , he said , not seen since the Great Depression .
Moreover , Gundlach said it 's possible that home prices could be sluggish until 2022 .
" If it 's like the Depression experience -- and it sure is shaping up that way -- it could take several years .
Maybe we wo n't see a bottom in home prices until 2014 , " he said .
Write - offs could top $ 1 trillion
As a forecaster , Gundlach did n't just climb aboard the gloom - and - doom wagon .
He was early to spot the cracks that subprime loans were making in the financial system , and among the first to warn that an era of easy money would come to a bad end .
" The subprime market is a total unmitigated disaster and it's going to get worse , " Gundlach told money managers and financial advisers at an investment conference in June 2007 .
See full story .
And Gundlach has put his shareholders ' money where his mouth is , shunning derivatives and counterparty risk in his bond fund portfolio .
That defensive posture should offer protection in the continuing credit storm that Gundlach foresees .
In this bleak scenario , an unprecedented -- and growing -- number of home foreclosures , along with mortgage loans that are under water as soon as they 're originated and a glaring lack of buyers for even modestly risky assets keeps the financial system under enormous stress .
Expect loan default rates to rise , Gundlach said , not just in the subprime market , but among the top - drawer prime borrowers as well .
The prime default rate could approach 10 % from a current 2 % before the carnage is over , he said .
" The current environment is maybe a little worse that what was experienced in the Depression in terms of the housing market , " Gundlach said .
More troubles ahead
Accordingly , financial institutions may suffer write - offs that could surpass $ 1 trillion before conditions improve , he said .
As of late August , credit losses and writedowns at the world 's 100 - largest banks and brokerages topped $ 506 billion , he noted .
Among the casualties , Gundlach said , could be Citigroup .
The company earlier this week made public a memo to employees from CEO Vikram Pandit highlighting Citigroup 's balance sheet strength and solid cash position .
Gundlach disagreed with that assessment .
He said Citigroup has balance sheet problems that he likened to that of insurer American International Group , which the U.S. bailed out this week .
" I would give a very meaningful probability to the biggest , next AIG - size debacle being Citigroup , " the strategist said .
" I would definitely not be a buyer of Citigroup stock , " Gundlach said .
" If I were going to buy financial market stocks , " he added , " I would be a buyer of Wells Fargo WFC , - 2.35 % , JP Morgan JPM , - 0.84 % and Bank of America BAC , - 1.32 % . "
Other financial giants also wo n't escape the crisis unscathed , Gundlach said .
" I do n't see how Wachovia can make it as a stand alone , " he said .
He expressed the same sentiment about Morgan Stanley .
Indeed , late Wednesday the New York Times reported that Morgan Stanley was exploring a merger with Wachovia or another bank .
See full story .
Europe 's financial giants are in similar or even worse shape than their U.S. counterparts , Gundlach said , with " substantial exposures to assets which U.S. banks are now getting taken to the woodshed over .
I would rate all European banks as not a buy . "
The breakdown will take a further toll on U.S. stocks , Gundlach added .
The S&P 500 will tumble below 800 , he said , about 35 % below its 1156 close on Wednesday .
Said Gundlach : " None of us have ever seen this , and it's no market for old men , but risk aversion is the order of the day . "
CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson apologized Wednesday for " crude and hurtful " remarks he made about Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama after an interview with a Fox News correspondent .
The Rev. Jesse Jackson apologized to Sen. Obama 's campaign Wednesday over " hurtful " remarks .
The remarks came Sunday as Jackson was talking to a fellow interviewee , UnitedHealth Group executive Dr. Reed V. Tuckson .
An open microphone picked up Jackson whispering , " See , Barack 's been talking down to black people ... I want to cut his nuts off . "
Jackson told CNN's " Situation Room " that he did n't realize the microphone was on .
" It was very private , " Jackson said , adding that if " any hurt or harm has been caused to his campaign , I apologize . "
An Obama campaign spokesman , Bill Burton , said that the senator from Illinois " of course accepts Rev. Jackson 's apology . "
Watch Jackson whisper comments about Obama »
Jackson 's son , Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois -- co-chair of Obama 's presidential campaign -- publicly blasted his father 's comments Wednesday .
" I 'm deeply outraged and disappointed in Rev. Jackson 's reckless statements about Sen. Barack Obama , " the younger Jackson said .
" His divisive and demeaning comments about the presumptive Democratic nominee -- and I believe the next president of the United States -- contradict his inspiring and courageous career . "
Jackson Jr. added that he 'll " always love " his father .
But , he said , " I thoroughly reject and repudiate his ugly rhetoric . "
The elder Jackson repeated his apology in a news conference in Chicago a couple of hours before Fox News aired Sunday 's remarks .
He said he wanted to address the issue publicly before the cable network aired the comment , because " I know that they will further violate the context of it . "
Earlier , Jackson told CNN he felt " very distressed because I 'm supportive of this campaign and with the senator . "

" I was in a conversation with a fellow guest on Sunday .
He asked about Barack 's speeches lately at the black churches .
I said he comes down as speaking down to black people , " Jackson said .
In a recent Father 's Day speech at a black church , Obama took absent black fathers to task , saying , " We need them to realize that what makes you a man is not the ability to have a child -- it 's the courage to raise one . "
While Jackson did n't cite any particular comment , he told CNN that Obama 's message to black voters must be broader and serve as more than a " moral challenge . "
The black community is faced with high levels of unemployment , home foreclosures and violence , " so we have some real serious issues -- not just moral issues , " he said .
However , Jackson said after finding out about the open microphone , he immediately contacted the Obama campaign to apologize .
Burton , Obama 's spokesman , said the senator is quite familiar with the issues facing African - Americans and that " he will continue to speak out about our responsibilities to ourselves . "
" As someone who grew up without a father in the home , Sen .
Obama has spoken and written for many years about the issue of parental responsibility , including the importance of fathers participating in their children 's lives , " Burton said .
" He also discusses our responsibility as a society to provide jobs , justice , and opportunity for all . "
The Rev. Al Sharpton , president of the civil rights group National Action Network , said Jackson 's remarks were " most unfortunate , " adding he was happy that Jackson apologized .
" I hope people will remember the great work he 's done in this country as one assesses this last incident , " Sharpton said in a statement .
Sharpton said people " must be careful not to segregate Sen.
Obama and impose some litmus test that is unfair and unproductive . "
" We must be very clear that Sen. Obama ... is running for president for all Americans , not just African - Americans -- which is why most Americans have embraced his campaign , " Sharpton said .
At Wednesday evening 's news conference in Chicago , Jackson said : " I have supported Barack 's campaign with passion from the very beginning . "
Watch Jackson 's comments in Chicago »
Jackson , whose Rainbow / PUSH Coalition is based in Chicago , has publicly endorsed Obama , most recently in a piece published Tuesday in the Chicago Sun -Times , and said he enjoys a close relationship with the Obama family .
The incident is the latest of several in which the issue of Obama 's relationship with the African - American community has become a part of the campaign , raised either by opponents or by Obama 's allies .
Nearly two weeks ago , Ralph Nader -- who is running his own presidential campaign as an independent -- accused Obama of attempting to " talk white " and appealing to " white guilt " in his quest for the White House .
" There 's only one thing different about Barack Obama when it comes to being a Democratic presidential candidate .
He 's half African - American , " Nader told Colorado 's Rocky Mountain News in a June 26 story .
Obama is still bouncing back from the weeks - long controversy over his former minister , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , whose fiery sermons at Chicago 's Trinity United Church of Christ drew unwanted attention for the campaign .
In the sermons , Wright suggested the U.S. government may be responsible for the spread of AIDS in the black community and equated some American wartime activities to terrorism .
Wright 's sermons and his eccentric behavior at later public appearances became a major political headache for the Obama campaign , especially since Wright officiated the senator 's wedding , baptized both of his children and was a spiritual adviser to his presidential campaign until he was asked to step down in March .
This week 's remarks by Jackson were not the first time he criticized Obama .
Last fall , he was critical of Obama 's reaction to the severe charges filed against six black students in the beating of a white student in Jena , Louisiana , a racially charged case that sparked a national outcry .
Jackson accused Obama of " acting like he 's white , " according to a South Carolina newspaper that cited a speech by Jackson at the historically black Benedict College in Columbia .
" If I were a candidate , I 'd be all over Jena , " Jackson said , according to the The State newspaper .
" Jena is a defining moment , just like Selma [ Alabama ] was a defining moment . "
The newspaper reported Jackson later said he did not recall saying Obama is " acting like he 's white , " but he continued to criticize Obama and other presidential candidates for not bringing more attention to the issue .
During the Democratic primary race , Jackson also said Sen.
John Edwards was the only candidate speaking to the issues of the black community .
He later apologized .

All About Jesse Jackson • Barack Obama
A blog which tries to demystify computer security , point out the half - truths and misinformation which floats around about this subject and hopefully reduce the hype created by semi-informed people .
It also has some useful tips from time to time .
When Democrats gather in Denver later this month to nominate Barack Obama for president , one of the event ’s main corporate sponsors will be AT&T , which will splash its brand all over the convention , right down to the 2008 Democratic National Convention totebags that will be given to all the delegates and credentialed media .
For progressives , who have watched with dismay this summer as the presumptive nominee staked out increasingly rightward positions on a number of issues , including immunity for telecoms that participated in President Bush ’s domestic spying programs , the cozy partnership of Obama and the Democrats with AT&T is just one more thing to grind their teeth about .
“ The Obama brand has always been about inspiration , a new kind of politics , the audacity of hope , and ‘ change we can believe in , ’ ” writes Arianna Huffington of Huffington Post .
“ I like that brand .
More importantly , voters — especially unlikely voters — like that brand .
Pulling it off the shelf and replacing it with a political product geared to pleasing America ’s vacillating swing voters would be a fatal blunder . ”
A more useful way to assess Obama ’s politics is to take a closer look at some of the dominant forces in the Democratic Party that he has openly embraced .
While it is impossible to convey all the thousands of interlocking relationships that bind the corporate center of the Democratic Party , even a small sampling strongly suggests that it will take a lot more than voting for one man for us to see real change in this country .
Corporate money flows through many channels to reach congressional Democrats .
Candidates raise millions from lobbyists and corporations to fill their own war chests .
Prominent Congresspersons also bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars for their personal political action committees , which they use to bankroll needy colleagues in return for future favors and support .
And then there ’s the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ( DSCC ) and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) , which raise and spend tens of millions of dollars to help Democratic candidates .
The recipients of this largesse , of course , come into office indebted to the party ’s congressional leadership .
Rep. Nancy Pelosi ( Calif . ) —
Pelosi ’s rise to the House Speaker ’s chair was fueled by her fundraising prowess .
Her largest contributor this election cycle is the powerhouse corporate law firm Akin & Gump .
Rep. Steny Hoyer ( Md. ) — House Majority Leader .
Top donors include JPMorgan Chase and Comcast .
His Political Action Committee ( PAC ) has received $ 15,000 in donations from top execs at MacAndrews and Forbes , whose chairman , Ronald Perelman , made hundreds of millions of dollars off the 1980s - era Savings & Loan crisis .
Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( Ill . ) —
Widely credited with helping the Dems regain the House of Representatives in 2006 as the head of the DCCC , this former Clinton aide - turned - investment banker - turned Congressional leader is known for his relentless fundraising .
Top donors to his own campaign include UBS AG , Blackstone Group and JPMorgan Chase .
Emanuel ’s PAC has also scooped up more than $ 600,000 in the 2008 election cycle , mainly from the finance , real estate and entertainment industries .
Sen. Chuck Schumer ( NY ) — Chair of the DSCC and a powerful member of the Senate Finance Committee , Schumer is a champion fundraiser with close ties to Wall Street who led the Democratic takeover of the Senate in 2006 .
Rep. Charles Rangel ( NY ) — Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee , which writes tax legislation , Rangel has received over $ 4.1 million in campaign donations since he became the committee ’s new chair in Jan. 2007 .
Meanwhile , his political action committee has been showered with $ 1.04 million in contributions , much of it from New York City real estate interests .
Rep. John Dingell ( Mich . ) —
Chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , this longtime Congressman has been the auto industry ’s most dogged advocate for decades , fighting everything from air bags to higher gas mileage standards to the science of global warming .
Blue Dog Democrats —
A coalition of 47 conservative Democratic lawmakers whom effectively hold the balance of power in the House of Representatives .
They mostly represent rural or ex-urban districts in the South and the West , and support both large military budgets and cuts in social spending .
LOBBYISTS AND LAW FIRMS
The biggest winners of the 2006 mid-term elections may have been Democratic lobbyists , many of whom team up with their Republican counterparts to work for some of America ’s largest corporations .
Thomas Hale Boggs Jr./ Patton
Boggs :
Son of a former Democratic majority leader and older brother of television journalist Cokie Roberts , Boggs was ranked as the capital ’s top lobbyist in 2007 by Washingtonian Magazine .
Boggs represents more than 50 corporations , trade associations and state and foreign governments , while his firm Patton Boggs rakes in $ 70 million per year in fees from a roster of 350 clients .
Patton Boggs specializes in international trade law .
Since its founding in 1962 , it has participated in the formation of every major multilateral trade agreement considered by Congress .
Tony and Heather Podesta :
This husband - and - wife team are both prominent Democratic Party fundraisers and each runs their own lobbying firm .
Tony Podesta heads
The Podesta Group which was rated the third most effective lobbying firm in 2007 by Washingtonian Magazine .
His clients include Lockheed Martin , the National Association of Broadcasters and BP America while Heather Podesta & Partners represents Boeing and HSBC North America , among others .
Jack Quinn / Quinn Gillespie & Associates :
This former Clinton White House Counsel has teamed up with former Republican National Committee Chair Ed Gillespie to pull in millions in fees from public accountants , drug companies , banks and telecommunications companies .
John Merrigan / DLA
Piper : Merrigan is the brains behind DLA Piper whose roster of lobbyists included former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell , former Democratic House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt and former Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey .
DLA Piper ’s clients include Kraft Foods , Lockheed Martin and Lehman Brothers .

Akin , Gump , Strauss , Hauer & Feld : Founded by former DNC Chairman Robert Strauss , Akin Gump has offices in 14 countries and provides both lobbying and legal services to its blue - chip clients .
It has given more than $ 2 million to the Democrats in this election cycle .
THE PRESIDENTIAL MONEY RACE
While the Obama campaign has had unprecedented success with raising small donations through the Internet , it is also getting a friendly reception from big business interests .
SECTORAL DONATIONS
While presidential elections are official contests between two candidates and their respective parties , they can also be seen as battles for supremacy among different sectors of the economy .
The Republicans are running strongest among resource extraction industries located in the interior of the country , while the Democrats ’ financial base is centered in the finance , real estate and insurance industries and blue - chip corporate law firms .
Here are how the candidates are faring as of July 28 , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
OBAMA BUNDLERS
Campaign finance laws now restrict individual campaign donations to a single candidate to $ 2,300 in the primaries and another $ 2,300 in the general election .
This has given rise to “ bundlers ” who can draw on large social networks of well - to - do friends and colleagues .
To date , Obama has raised $ 112 million in donations of $ 1,000 or more , thanks in large part to the efforts of more than 500 bundlers who have each collected contributions totaling $ 50,000 and up .
Top bundlers who have raised more than $ 500,000 for Obama include : hedge fund executive Orin Kramer ; Robert Wolf , President of UBS Investment Bank ; healthcare investor Alan Solomont ; entertainment mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg ; and Bill Kennard , Clinton - era Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission , who is now a managing director of the Carlyle Group .
WAL - MART & THE DEMOCRATS
Wal - Mart has given more to Democrats than ever before this election cycle — $ 565,500 , or 43 percent of its total contributions — when counting both PAC contributions and individual donations , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
In 2006 , Wal - Mart hired longtime Democratic Party operative Leslie Dach to lead its public relations offensive against critics of its labor and environmental policies .
DEMOCRATIC PARTY WISE MEN
These gatekeepers of conventional wisdom have close ties to corporate interests and advocate a dominant role for the US in world affairs .
Robert Rubin : Treasury Secretary and top economic advisor in the Clinton administration , Rubin was the architect of the financial deregulation that set the stage for the subprime mortgage crisis .
Days after leaving office in 1999 , Rubin took a $ 15 million - per -year job at Citigroup , one of the main beneficiaries of his deregulatory zeal .
More recently , Rubin founded the Hamilton Project , a centrist think tank that advises Democrats on economic issues .
He is also co-chair of the Council on Foreign Relations .
Jason Furman : A champion of free trade and Wal - Mart ’s low - wage business model , Furman was chosen by Robert Rubin to head the Hamilton Project in 2006 .
In June , Obama named him to head his economic policy team , much to the dismay of unions and liberal activists .
Sam Nunn : Former head of the Senate Armed Services Committee , Nunn is Co-Chair of the Georgetown Center for Strategic and International Studies , a bastion of hawkish foreign policy elites from both parties .
Nunn is currently a top foreign policy advisor to Obama and is frequently mentioned as a possible vice - presidential nominee .
Nunn serves on the board of ChevronTexaco and is a partner in King & Spaulding , a giant Atlanta law firm with extensive dealings in the Middle East .
David Boren :
He chaired the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence before retiring in 1994 .
His top aide and protege George Tenant went on to lead the CIA under Presidents Clinton and Bush , famously providing the “ slam dunk ” evidence for going to war with Iraq .
Like Nunn , Boren serves as an Obama foreign policy advisor .
His son Dan Boren is an Oklahoma Congressman and one of the leaders of the conservative Blue Dog faction that holds the balance of power in the House .
James R. Jones : Think Obama will renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) ?
Ask this former Oklahoma congressman and D.C. insider who helped shepherd NAFTA into existence as Clinton ’s Ambassador to Mexico from 1993 to 1997 .
Since leaving office he has served as the head of the U.S. - Mexico Business Commission , sat on a half - dozen corporate boards , and teamed up with former DNC Chair Charles Manatt to launch a company that helps foreign investors enter the Mexican and Latin American markets .
Lee Hamilton :
This former Indiana congressman has been a go - to guy for “ bipartisan ” foreign policy solutions since he helped bring Congress ’ investigation into Ronald Reagan ’s role in the Iran - Contra scandal to an early end in 1987 .
Hamilton was appointed by President Bush to be the top Democrat on the 9 - 11 Commission and he was also co-chair of the Iraq Study Group .
He currently heads the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Studies and is a director of the National Endowment for Democracy , which provides training and assistance to U.S. - friendly political candidates around the world .
Tom Daschle : Daschle was the Senate Majority Leader in 2001 - 2002 when the Democrats signed off on the USA PATRIOT Act and the Iraq War .
Former staffers of his are prominent in the Obama campaign including Denis McDonough , who is Obama ’s top foreign policy advisor .

Apparently , there 's a tentative deal for a revised bailout plan on the Hill , and lawmakers now hope to get it ready for an announcement before Asian markets open on Monday and a quick vote .
According to Reuters today , the deal involves :
- A structured layout where $ 300 billion would be allocated immediately , $ 100 billion would be reserved under presidential discretion for later allocation if needed and the remaining $ 350 billion under only the say - so of Congress .
- Taxpayers would gain stock warrants in companies using bailout money - an asset stake and an opportunity for future profits to recompense any federal outlay .
- Executives would have their Golden Parachutes cut off if their company used bailout money .
-
There will be an oversight board and management also would be under close scrutiny by Congress ' investigative arm and an independent inspector general .
- the government could use its power as the owner of mortgages and mortgage - backed securities to help more struggling homeowners modify the terms of their home loans .
-
" In the end , House Republicans won support for a provision that would create a privately funded insurance program for mortgage - backed securities , congressional aides said . " -
" Democrats jettisoned proposals that would have put money into a trust fund for affordable housing and would have allowed judges to alter the terms of mortgages for bankrupt borrowers , according to aides . "
Of course , there 's a possibility that Dems will fall into a trap of the GOP 's making .
Republican talking heads are still urging the GOP to walk away from the bailout or various provisions of the deal .
They 're simply playing politics with imminent financial disaster , aware that most people are outraged that taxpayers are having to bail out fat - cats at banks and investment houses and fanning that outrage in an attempt to tie Bush and the bailout to Democrats before the November elections .
They 're hoping , in their zeal , that people will forget that it was Republican pushes for deregulation and lack of oversight ( the " free " market ) that caused the problem in the first place .
Meanwhile , John McCain 's campaign is getting ready to jump on whichever bandwagon looks like it will travel farthest .
Today on the talking heads shows , " at the same time that Sen .
John McCain was saying that he did n't deserve credit for getting a economic bailout package to the brink of completion , his campaign 's chief strategist was arguing that the Senator played an integral role " .
And it 's still uncertain that House leaders can drum up enough votes to pass the bill over Republican obstructionism for petty political ends .
It 's telling that they expect to get their Republican support from those not facing re-election this year - in other words , those Republicans who can vote for sense instead of political grandstanding .
So yes , it might become a political trap for Dems .
But what else to do ?
Play the same game as the Republicans and watch the economy go down ?
This is n't just about big numbers , it 's about people 's lives .
Even if the people who would all be affected do n't quite get that , no matter how unpleasant it is to save the fat - cats asses , the fat - cats have put us in the position where it 's unavoidable if we 're to save our own asses too .
The bailout may not work - there are many who say it wo n't - but in the meantime , Dems will have tried to shield common folk from the massive social and lifestyle fallout of a crash .
That 's worth doing , in my view , even at this horrendous price tag .
Crossposted from Newshoggers
In a corner of Istanbul today , the man who might be described as Turkey 's gay poster boy will be buried – a victim , his friends believe , of the country 's deepening friction between an increasingly liberal society and its entrenched conservative traditions .
Ahmet Yildiz , 26 , a physics student who represented his country at an international gay gathering in San Francisco last year , was shot leaving a cafe near the Bosphorus strait this week .
Fatally wounded , the student tried to flee the attackers in his car , but lost control , crashed at the side of the road and died shortly afterwards in hospital .
His friends believe Mr Yildiz was the victim of the country 's first gay honour killing .
" He fell victim to a war between old mentalities and growing civil liberties , " says Sedef Cakmak , a friend and a member of the gay rights lobby group Lambda .
" I feel helpless : we are trying to raise awareness of gay rights in this country , but the more visible we become , the more we open ourselves up to this sort of attack . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Turkey was all but closed to the world until 1980 but its desire for European Union membership has imposed strains on a society formerly kept on a tight leash .
As the notion of rights for minorities such as women and gays has blossomed , the country 's civil society becomes more vibrant by the day .
But the changes have brought a backlash from traditionalist circles wedded to the old regime .
Bungled efforts by a religious - minded government to loosen the grip of Turkey 's authoritarian version of secularism have triggered a court case aimed at shutting the ruling party down , with a verdict expected within a month .
Against this backdrop , the issues of women 's rights , sexuality and the place of religion in the public arena have been particularly contentious .
Ahmet Yildiz 's crime , his friends say , was to admit openly to his family that he was gay .
" From the day I met him , I never heard Ahmet have a friendly conversation with his parents , " one close friend and near neighbour recounted .
" They would argue constantly , mostly about where he was , who he was with , what he was doing . "
The family pressure increased , the friend explained .
" They wanted him to go back home , see a doctor who could cure him , and get married . "
Shortly after coming out this year , Mr Yildiz went to a prosecutor to complain that he was receiving death threats .
The case was dropped .
Five months later , he was dead .
The police are now investigating his murder .
For gay rights groups , the student 's inability to get protection was a typical by - product of the indifference , if not hostility , with which a broad swathe of Turkish society views homosexuality .
The military , for example , sees it as an " illness " .
Men applying for an exemption to obligatory military service on grounds of homosexuality must provide proof – either in the form of an anal examination , or photographs .
" The media ignores or laughs off violence against gays , " says Buse Kilickaya , a member of the gay lobbying group Pink Life , adding that Ahmet Yildiz 's death " risks being swept under the carpet and forgotten like other cases in the past " .
Turkey has a history of honour killings .
A government survey earlier this year estimated that one person every week dies in Istanbul as a result of honour killings .
It put the nationwide death toll at 220 in 2007 .
In the majority of cases , the victims are women , but Mr Yildiz 's friends suspect he may be the first recorded victim of a homosexual honour killing .
" We 've been trying to contact Ahmet 's family since Wednesday , to get them to take responsibility for the funeral , " one of the victim 's friends said yesterday , standing outside the morgue where his body has been for three days .
" There 's no answer , and I do n't think they are going to come . "
The refusal of families to bury their relatives is common after honour - related murders .

Mazhar Bagli , a Turkish sociologist who has interviewed 189 people convicted of honour killings , has never heard of a death revolving around homosexuality but has no doubt that it could be used as justification .
" Honour killings cleanse illicit relationships .
For women , that is a broad term .
Men are allowed more sexual freedom , but homosexuality is still seen by some as beyond the pale . "
While his death may be unique , Mr Yildiz is by no means the first victim of widespread homophobia .
When an Istanbul court decided to close down the city 's largest gay rights group late this May , commentators took the decision as evidence of a crackdown on the community spearheaded by Turkey 's current religious - minded government .
Lambda Istanbul had been taken to court by the Istanbul governor 's office on the grounds that it was " against the law and morality " .
However , many gay activists are reluctant to draw a connection with the ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) , noting it was the first party in Turkey 's history to send a deputy to attend a conference on gay rights .
This year 's Gay Pride parade in Istanbul was the largest ever , they also point out .
Long active in more liberal parts of western
Turkey , gay groups are even beginning to meet relatively openly in the conservative east of the country where Ahmet Yildiz came from .
But according to the former neighbour , the physics student 's blank refusal to hide who he was in any way may have been too much for his family .
" He could have hidden who he was , but he wanted to live honestly , " the neighbour said .
" When the death threats started , his boyfriend tried to persuade him to get out of Turkey .
But he stayed .
He was too brave .
He was too open . "
Killed by those they loved
So - called " honour killings " continue to be a grim reality wherever conservative social mores resist the rule of law .
In Turkey , a recent government study estimated that around 1,000 honour killings have been committed in the past five years .
The victims are mostly young women , murdered by male relatives for transgressing chauvinistic social rules .
Women have been killed for having illicit affairs , talking to strangers , or even for being the victim of rape .
Turkey 's justice system has recently increased penalties for honour killings , and ended the practice of allowing murderers to claim family honour as an extenuating circumstance .
However , getting a child relative to carry out the killing remains a horrifying way around the law .
The problem is not confined to Turkey .
The UN estimates that 5,000 honour killings take place globally every year , from Brazil to Pakistan to Britain .
Police estimate more than a dozen honour killings take place in the UK every year , such as the brutal rape and murder of 20 - year - old Banaz Mahmod by her uncle and father in 2006 , or the murder of Rukhsana Naz , strangled by her family because she wanted a divorce in 1999 .
Honour killings have not so far really targeted gay men , although in 2006 a wave of anti-gay killings took place in Iraq , carried out by fanatical Islamist militias .
A Jordanian man was shot and wounded by his brother in 2004 , apparently for being gay .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
Tree shrews that thrive on fermented nectar suck up amounts that would inebriate a human but seem to have no such ill - effects themselves , researchers reported on Monday .
They said their findings may shed light on how animals evolved a taste for alcohol and may help in understanding why so many humans abuse it .
The tree shrew , found in Malaysia , is very similar to the last common ancestor of all living primates -- a group that includes people -- and it could be that the human taste for alcohol evolved millions of years ago , the researchers reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
“ For humans alcohol consumption often has devastating consequences , ” Frank Wiens of Bayreuth University in Germany and colleagues wrote .
“ We discovered that seven mammalian species in a West Malaysian rainforest consume alcoholic nectar daily from flower buds of the bertam palm ( Eugeissona tristis ) , which they pollinate , ” they added .
The flower buds of the palm collect yeast , which ferments the nectar , they said .
“ The 3.8 percent maximum alcohol concentration that we recorded is among the highest ever reported in a natural food . ”
The amount they sip would cause drunkenness if a human drank the equivalent , they said .
“ Yet , the flower - visiting mammals showed no signs of intoxication , ” they wrote .
They plan further study to find out how the shrews ’ bodies cope with constant alcohol intake with no apparent bad effects .
Scientology Facing Murky Future in France Scientology sued for fraud in France ; conviction could lead to banning .
LONDON , Sept. 18 , 2008  --
The Church of Scientology faces trial on deletion fraud charges in Paris , with the possibility that the organization , which claims around 5,000 active members in France in addition to a bevy of Hollywood celebrities such as Tom Cruise , could be banned in France if it loses .
While it enjoys an active presence in the U.S. -- it has been recognized as a religious organization by the I.R.S. since 1993 -- Scientology has faced strong opposition from French authorities .
France has refused to acknowledge Scientology as a religion , and Miviludes , the French government agency in charge of protecting its citizens from sectarian manipulations , has warned French citizens against participating .
" Scientology is a dangerous movement , " Milivudes president Jean - Michel Roulet told ABCNews.com .
" It puts pressure on its victims , it tries to intimidate them and blackmails them . "
Isabelle Montagne , spokesperson with the Paris court of Justice , told ABCNews.com that if Scientology is found guilty of fraud or illegal practice of medical activities , the president of the Paris Scientology Celebrity Centre , one of the biggest centers in France , could be sentenced to seven years in prison and the organization could be forced to close its doors .
Part of the French wariness of Scientology likely stems from a culture that is skeptical of any purported religious organization that requires members to pay money , says Roulet , who says members spend up to $ 40,000 within their first years in Scientology .
" It is possible for members to pay that amount within a few years , " Daniele Gounord , spokesperson for Scientology in France , told ABCNews.com .
" It is possible , if a member is willing to progress fast . "
" This does not fit with the French mentality , " answered Roulet .
" At church you are free to give money or not .
We are not used to religions in which you have to pay for everything . "
Scientology : ' A Dangerous Movement '
In the latest legal challenge , the plaintiff in the fraud case reportedly says she was approached by Scientologists on a Paris street in 1998 and offered a free personality test .
She says she was pressured to spend more than $ 28,000 for courses , books , illegally prescribed drugs and an " electrometer " that was supposed to measure fluctuations in her mental state , according to the BBC .
Gounord said the person who is accusing Scientology of fraud and illegal practice of pharmacy has been reimbursed by Scientology .
" We have never been found guilty of fraud by a court , " she said .
In 2002 the organization was found to have violated France 's data privacy law after a former member said he was still receiving mail from the organization despite having asked that his name be removed from their database .
The organization and the president of its Paris center were each ordered to pay $ 7,000 , though the fines were later suspended
Gounord said the organization kept the former member 's personal data by accident .
" That was a technical problem , " she said , " no one really understood what happened .
" It 's just a lot of noise about nothing , " Gounord told ABCNews.com .
" The case is empty .
We are not worried at all . "
According to Roulet , legal procedures against Scientology are often laborious and the organization has often been acquitted .
" They have a lot of money and they can afford to pay a lot of lawyers , " said Roulet .
French Members Feel Persecuted by Government
French members of Scientology who spoke to ABCNews.com said they see themselves as victims of the French secular system and of a typically Gallic religious narrow - mindedness .
" The French system attacks minorities , " said Gounord .
" It is easier to attack smaller religious movements . "
Scientology , founded in 1954 by American science - fiction author L. Ron Hubbard , promotes " well - being " and its own vision of a " better world " through collective spiritual sessions , readings and social actions .
The first Scientologist church in France was open in 1959 .
" I would like France to be more like the United States , " said Paris - based Scientology member Michel Raoust , " where there is more tolerance towards religions . "
" I cannot even consider the end of Scientology in France , " said Raoust .
" The truth will be known , and the truth is that we are a religion of goodwill . "
Former Member Cries Foul
Roger Gonnet , who said he was a prominent member of Scientology in Lyon , France , between 1974 and 1982 , strongly disagrees .
" Scientology is a cult and a rip - off , " Gonnet told ABCNews.com .
" They promise you perfect health and a life without any problem , " said Gonnet , " but when I reached the highest levels of the organization I found out that their ' secrets ' were completely dumb . "
" There were no positive results in my life , but fares kept going up , " he said .
Gonnet said he got kicked out of the organization because he was too outspoken -- a humiliation that led many of his member - friends to follow him and abandon Scientology .
According to Gounord , Gonnet , who worked for Scientology , was expelled because he mishandled the group 's finances .
" The only thing that is free with Scientology is the entry questionnaire , " said Miviludes ' Roulet .
Raoust , a Paris - based engineer who is still a member , said he joined Scientology in 1975 and has paid large amounts of money to the organization , though he says he never counted exactly how much .
" I make good money , so it does n't bother me to invest in my personal development , " Raoust said .
" I would rather do that than buying a beautiful convertible . "
Leaving Presents Issues
According to Roulet , leaving the Scientology can be particularly tricky .
" The victims join the group willingly , but little by little they stop thinking for themselves and do whatever their guru tells them to do , " he said .
It happens sometimes that people realize that they spent all the money they had to progress within the organization and that that did not yield anything positive , said Roulet .
But Scientology spokesman Gounord said that if members reach a point where they decide to actually leave the organization , Scientology offers them a reimbursement package .
" We are the only ones who do this , " Gounord told ABCNews.com .
Although today it struggles to get recognition in France , Scientology is indeed a powerful and internationally established organization , but this does not seem to intimidate Roulet and the like .
" It may take several years , " he said , " but we can ban this organization in France . "
A hotheaded chef at China City restaurant in Brooklyn has been charged with dousing two women with scalding cooking oil after they complained about bad take - out food .
The melee started when Sylvia Grice , 44 , and Dorranne Leggett , 42 , stormed into the Myrtle Avenue eatery Thursday night to confront the chef , Luien Jhing , 28 .
The disgruntled diners angrily threw their uneaten dinners at Jhing .
Cops said the chef hurled a pot of hot oil , burning Grice ’s back and Leggett ’s shoulder .
Jhing was charged with assault , menacing , harassment and criminal possession of a weapon – the oil . 
Even if you do n't like the outdoors , you 're probably pretty fond of air , clean water and food .
That makes you a fan of biodiversity , because those essentials for life - human and otherwise - are maintained as a direct result of the Earth 's biodiversity , the abundance and variety of species and populations on the planet .
Preserving a substantial amount of biodiversity is critical to a healthy future for us , but how best to do that has been a subject of ongoing debate .
A multi-pronged approach is the only way humanity can pull it off , according to Stanford biologists Paul Ehrlich and Robert Pringle .
In an article to be published next week in the online early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , they argue that it is going to require not just governments but everyone to pitch in , on the individual level and in small groups .
But the good news , Ehrlich said , is that everyone can .
While many people have gotten the impression that only government - level action can have a significant impact , many small effective efforts are already under way .
What is needed , he said , is for these small - scale efforts to be implemented more broadly and scaled up dramatically .
Only through tackling the state of the environment on all fronts and with a variety of approaches will we be able to call a halt to environmental degradation , global climate disruption and the ongoing mass extinction of species , the authors say .
If we fail , we will have a world of dirtier air , scarce or undrinkable water and inadequate supplies of food .
Even as small an action as choosing to eat less beef or pork results in less of a resource drain .
The more people who make that choice , the less the environment will be negatively affected .
Other actions in the " hopeful portfolio " that Ehrlich , the Bing Professor of Population Studies , and Pringle , a graduate student in biology , present are " stabilizing the size of the human population and reducing its consumption " and taking a series of steps " to ensure the efficacy and permanence of conservation areas . "
Making human - dominated landscapes hospitable to biodiversity through such modest actions as " maintaining living hedges around agricultural plots and preserving remnant trees in pasture " can often buttress the biodiversity in these areas .

Ehrlich and Pringle liken each action to a wedge .
Even though a particular action might start out small , as more people participate and the size of the effort grows , so does the effect .
And just as many hands make work lighter , many wedges combine to have a significant effect of keeping down the rates of species extinction and destruction of habitats , thereby preserving biodiversity .
The authors also recommend other " wedges , " such as reclaiming degraded land , reintroducing species to areas where they lived before human activity drove them out or killed them off , and educating people everywhere about the values of biodiversity .
They note that increasing coverage of biodiversity on the Internet has vast potential for educating and prompting people to take action .
The researchers were optimistic about efforts like The Natural Capital Project , a joint effort of Stanford , the Nature Conservancy and World Wildlife Fund to align financial and conservation incentives and integrate the ecosystem - service values into land - use decisions .
As an example of ecosystem services in action , they cited the conservation of the Catskill watershed , which to date has spared the city of New York the $ 8 billion it would cost to build a water - filtration plant .
Like any ecosystem , the watershed is only able to function properly ( in this case , as a natural filtration system ) if most parts of the complex system are present - that is , if the biodiversity of the watershed is largely preserved .
But Ehrlich and Pringle said there is still a lot of work to be done in changing people 's attitudes .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez 's plan to move 100,000 people into a brand new city being carved out of the forest in the vicinity of a national park , to alleviate overcrowding in Caracas , is a prime example .
But Chavez is hardly alone in his lack of appreciation for preservation .
Noting that the typical mammalian species persists for about a million years , according to the fossil record , the writers observe that humans , who have been around for about the last 200,000 years , are in the equivalent of " mid-adolescence . "
Ehrlich and Pringle say that it is a " fitting coincidence , because Homo sapiens is now behaving in ways reminiscent of a spoiled teenager , " mistreating its life - support systems , " mindless of the consequences . "
Under business - as - usual , they continue , the loss of species and populations , which supply critical ecosystem services to humanity , will accelerate .
Despite uncertainties , " we know where biodiversity will go from here : up in smoke ; toward the poles and under water ; into crops and livestock ; onto the table and into yet more human biomass ; into fuel tanks ; into furniture , pet stores , and home remedies for impotence ; out of the way of more cities and suburbs ; into distant memory and history books . "
In short , Ehrlich said , " The support system for civilization will be destroyed , and the world as we now know it will disappear . "
To avoid that dismal fate , Ehrlich and Pringle call for an exodus of academicians ( including themselves ) from the ivory tower .
Noting that " academic ecological papers are often tinseled with one or two sentences about the applied significance of the science , which accomplishes little , " they say that researchers have to begin promoting among themselves the importance of outreach work .
Funding agencies that require applicants to explain the " broader impacts " of their research need to push for researchers to communicate those societal benefits of the work to society .
People cannot do the right thing unless they know what it is , the authors say .
Time - wasting is not just an irritating habit .
It is an affliction that ruins millions of lives and often requires therapy and other treatment for sufferers , psychologists have warned .
According to new research , one person in five now suffers from the problem so badly that their careers , relationships and health are threatened .
Many researchers blame computers and mobile phones for providing too many distractions for people .
' The subject is seen as joke , ' said Professor Joseph Ferrari of DePaul University in Chicago .
' But the social and economic implications are huge .
These people need therapy .
They need to change the way they act and think . '
Ferrari says that chronic procrastination is now so serious a condition it needs to be recognised by clinicians .
In a study to be published later this year , he estimates that 15 to 20 per cent of people are chronic procrastinators .
' We now have data on 4,000 people , and it does n't seem to matter what age you are , or your sex or background . '
He has devised a questionnaire to help diagnose the condition , which he says is ' much more common than depression or common phobias ' .
Procrastination also has knock - on effects - it encourages depression , lowers self - esteem , causes insomnia , and indirectly affects health by discouraging visits to the dentist or doctor .
Sufferers are also more likely to have accidents at home involving unmended appliances .
Cognitive psychologist Professor John Maule , of Leeds University 's business school , agreed that a significant proportion of the population were prone to procrastination , and argued that mood changes - particularly depression - might be to blame .
Research by Professor Piers Steel from Calgary University indicates that the incidence of chronic procrastination has risen dramatically in recent decades , from one person in 20 to one in four , as new technology has come to dominate our lives .
Even the beeps notifying the arrival of email are said to be causing a 0.5 per cent drop in gross domestic product in the United States , costing the economy $ 70 bn a year .
Ferrari , however , is less convinced that new technology is to blame for time - wasting .
' People have wasted time for centuries , ' he said .
' Lots of people , particularly people who often have to work under time constraints , put work off because they kid themselves that they work best when under pressure , when there 's a deadline .
' Studies have shown this is n't true .
They 're conveniently forgetting the times when it all went horribly wrong - and selectively remembering the odd occasion when things went well under severe time pressure . '
Once , humans probably did have stronger excuses for delaying chores that did n't need immediate attention , say brain scientists such as Alan Sanfey at Arizona University , whose work has shed light on the evolutionary origins of procrastination .
It appears that the brain is divided into two parts .
One triggers ' automatic responses ' which take precedence over everything else - such as fleeing sabre - toothed tigers .
The other governs ' deliberate responses ' - writing that report due next week or booking a visit to the optician .
Evolution has dictated that the former take precedence .
Today there are n't any sabre - toothed tigers , but we still put things off .
The original untranslated English version of John McCain ’s interview with Radio Caracol Miami has now been released .
Have a listen ( the key passage about Spain starts at 2:58 in ) :
At first it sounds like McCain is taking a hard neocon line against Prime Minister Zapatero , but as the interviewer continues to press the point , it becomes pretty obvious that McCain has no idea who she ’s talking about .
His broad , generic answer is clearly meant to cover Latin American leaders generally , known and unknown — sort of a blanket “ we ’ll stand up to tinpot dictators ” — even if they happen to be NATO prime ministers .

Please take 5 minutes and read it .

Last week Pew Research released their latest poll on the Presidential election .
It has the horse race question at 46 - 43 for Obama – within margin of error .
At this point in 2004 , Kerry led Bush 47 - 45 , in 1992 Clinton led Bush 57 - 37 .
The Pew poll shows the following :
Three weeks ago Obama had a statistically significant 8 point lead .
Today he ’s got a 3 point lead with a 2.5 % margin of error .
The race is effectively a tie .
McCain has solidified his base and now gets 87 % of Republicans to Obama ’s 82 % of Democrats .
There has been no shift in Clinton supporters since June – 72 % will vote for Obama , 18 % of McCain with 10 % undecided .
Only 6 % of Republican primary voters who supported other candidates indicate they will vote for Obama .
McCain is now over 50 % with white voters , 51 % overall , leads Obama in all groups other than college graduates where they are tied , and McCain is now at 60 % with white voters in the south , a 7 point move in three weeks .
These numbers all mirror the same vote breakdown in 2000 and 2004 .
The only group that has flipped since 2004 is 18 - 29 where Obama leads with 51 % – a 13 point shift since 2000 .
McCain ’s support among evangelical voters has moved up 7 points since June .
In a series of either / or trait questions , voters believe McCain is personally qualified to be president ( 54 - 27 ) , shows good judgment in a crisis , ( 51 - 36 ) , and is willing to take a stand even if it ’s unpopular ( 49 - 38 ) .
Obama leads on having new ideas ( 69 - 17 ) , connects well with people ( 57-30 ) , and , interestingly , shares my values ( 47-39 ) .
When supporters of a candidate were asked to find something they like most about the opponent , 53 % of McCain supporters said nothing at all , compared to 34 % of Obama supporters .
37 % of Obama supporters said McCain ’s personal abilities and experiences were what they liked most about McCain , only 11 % of McCain supporters said the same about Obama .
More disturbingly for Obama , when asked what they liked most about the candidates , 40 % noted McCain ’s personal abilities and experience .
The number one answer on Obama ?
Nothing – 28 % – a volunteered answer , not an option provided by the pollster but recorded only if volunteered by the voter .
Obama ’s position on economic issues was second at 24 % .
When asked what troubled them most about the candidates , voters said for McCain it was his position on economic issues ( 26 % ) and his position on foreign policy issues ( 25 % ) .
For Obama , it was his personal abilities and experience ( 33 % )
Obama has a higher level of strong support than McCain. 27 % of voters strongly support Obama to 17 % for McCain .
One in three voters may change their mind between now and election day – 46 % of independent voters indicate they may switch .
Voters are paying closer attention to the election .
Comparing the same timeframe , August , attention is at levels not seen since 1992 .
While some here think everything is going just fine , and that Obama has a secret plan lying in wait , I ask you to think back a year ago .
Imagine if someone had told you that the most charismatic Democratic speaker in a decade would be in a dead - heat with a Republican has - been corrupt waffler – you would have laughed in their face .
After eight years of George Bush ?
No way , people are fed up – that ’ll never happen .
Well , that ’s the reality today .
This race is a dead heat and is up for grabs both in the national polls as well as in key states like Ohio , Florida , Missouri , etc .
Face reality folks – something is n’t working .
While some say ignore the polls at this stage , you ca n’t really do that .
To be sure , some polls are worth looking at and some are worth ignoring .
How do you tell the difference ?
Let ’s talk about polling methodology .
There are two different ways to poll – registered voters and likely voters .
At this stage , I ignore likely voter polls .
Why ?
Well after a primary full of polling errors , I ’m skeptical that anyone at this stage in the game can really determine who a likely voter is .
( Read more about likely voter methodology on my prior post . )
Having said that , we do have a more accurate indicator – the registered voter poll .
In order to be able to vote in an election , you have to be registered .
Registered voters are the total universe of possible voters in November .
Now Obama ’s campaign will tell you that they are registering tons of new voters .
That ’s great , but those people are already showing up in registered voter polls .
One of the first questions asked by the pollster is usually “ are you registered to vote ? ” – all the people Obama has registered will answer that question yes and will be included in the current poll results .
Now some have raised the question of whether mobile - phone only households – generally younger and possibly new voters – are being missed by the polls .
Sorry to burst the bubble folks , but the good polling firms have already addressed this question and resolved it .
Polling panels are now comprised of phone interviews ( including mobile phones ) as well as online polling .
The Pew poll specifically addresses this issue on page 11 of this PDF file – page 10 of the report .
A well executed registered voter poll at this point in the race is a relevant barometer of where the country is today .
So then what does the Pew poll say about where we are and what to do moving ahead ?
What is says is that the demographic breakdown of the 2008 vote looks an awful lot like 2004 , and 2000 .
You can draw from that , and other public polls , that the same states in play in 2004 will likely be in play in 2008 , and that the races in those states are highly competitive .
The Pew poll says that voters are concerned about McCain ’s stand on the economy and on foreign policy ( i.e. , Iraq ) , but that they are n’t yet sold on Barack Obama and question his experience .
They like Obama ’s positions on the economy , but they are n’t there yet .
Not all is lost folks , Obama has time and money to make a shift .
But if you thought that somehow this year was going to be different – something would change and somehow the American electorate would look completely different this year than any other year , the numbers today just do n’t show that .
This is n’t a transformative election , it ’s another hardscrabble , claw out each and every vote , election .
To win that kind of election , you need to fight for every vote and fight hard .
That ’s why you hear the concern you hear from Josh Marshall , John , Joe , etc .
And it ’s backed up by years of experience watching the Republicans make Democrats look weak – Carter , Mondale , Dukakis , Gore , and Kerry .
That line of attack works when not countered and we were defeated .
None of us want that in 2008 .
このアンケートから分かることは、「回答者は質問文を真面目に読まない」ということだな。
まぁ、締め切られるまでの時間の短さを考えると、アンケート回答者は定期的に新着アンケートを監視している「プロ回答者」が多そうだし、
アンケートに答える作業がルーチンワークになっていて質問文を流し読みしてしまうことは想像に難くない。
西尾さんの設問にも実は穴があって、一問目のタイトルは

だけど、 「答える」という日本語は別に「正解する」という意味ではなく「回答する」という意味にすぎない。だから取りようによっては、
Q01でいずれかの選択肢を選んだ人は全員Q02に答える権利がある(笑 ) 。 しかも警告 がQ02の頭ではなくQ01の終わりに入っているので、悪意を持って無視したというよりは単に警告を見落とした人が多いんじゃないか。
ここはいっそ、回答者が質問文を流し読みすることを前提にして

California nightmare for the global economy ?
Will the California budget crisis tip the United States into recession ?
The California economy is certainly large enough to inflict such damage .
It 's the seventh - largest economy in the world and home to close to 38 million Americans .
California 's budget deficit is by any reasonable measure enormous .
This budget deficit is estimated at $ 17.2 billion and represents more than 17 percent of the state 's general fund expenditures ( about $ 101 billion ) .
In contrast , New York , which faces the second - worst budget gap in the nation for fiscal year 2009 , has a gap of about $ 5 billion , which represents less than 10 percent of its budget .
In closing its past budgetary gaps , California has acted more like the federal government rather than merely one of 50 states .
Indeed , unlike the federal government ( or sovereign nations ) , each state is required to balance its budget each year ; and no state , at least in principle , has the authority to engage in the kind of discretionary deficit spending both the federal government and nations around the world routinely use to stimulate their economies .
In the past , a profligate California has gotten around this balanced - budget requirement by using a technique that effectively allows the Golden State to administer its own fiscal stimulus .
In particular , California - under both Democratic and Republican governors - has simply issued new bonds every time that it has spent far beyond its means .
California 's problem this time , however , is that its deficit is so big , its balance sheet is so bad , and world credit markets are so tight that issuing new bonds alone is no longer a viable option .
Instead , California 's politicians are inexorably being forced toward a solution that will prominently feature both a large tax increase and significant spending cuts .
Indeed , this is not a partisan matter of choosing one 's poison .
The budget deficit is so large that it cannot be eliminated without raising taxes , anathema to the state 's Republicans , and spending cuts , equally unpalatable to California Democrats .
Of course , the faster the state Legislature accepts this harsh reality , the faster the deadlock can be broken .
Viewed from a macroeconomic perspective , there is an even harsher reality .
Increased taxes and reduced spending will send a very nasty contractionary shock through a California economy that is already reeling from a housing market meltdown and punishing gas prices .
Should Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's budgetary medicine - including firing many state employees - trigger a recession , this may well serve as a tipping point for a national recession and , in the worst case scenario , even a global recession .
In considering these dangers , it is worth noting that California provides close to 13 percent of America 's real GDP growth .
In contrast , the second - largest contributor to U.S. gross domestic product is Texas , and it provides only half that stimulus .
It also worth noting that California is an important destination for both U.S. manufactured goods and world imports , particularly from Asia .
Already , California 's unemployment rate is more than 6.8 percent and well above the national average of 5.7 percent .
At least some economists believe California may already be experiencing negative growth .
The economy is likely to get a lot worse before its gets better .
If there is any one civics lesson to be learned from this fine mess , it is that the state 's politicians must learn to resist overspending in good times so that the state wo n't face bankruptcy when bad times hit .
It should be equally clear that any damn fool can issue bonds to balance a budget .
However , it takes real political courage and economic foresight to put a state budget on an even keel through fiscally conservative tax - and - spend policies .
At this juncture , California is nowhere close to that - and the rest of the country , and perhaps the world , may soon pay the Golden State 's piper .

Apparently , Nevada Republicans are having some trouble with the nomination process ...
Instead , the party ’s executive board , in a private conference call July 25 , would decide who from Nevada will attend the Republican National Convention to formally nominate U.S. Sen.
John McCain .
The state party abruptly ended its state convention in April to head off a delegation of Ron Paul supporters who had captured control of the proceedings and appeared on track to elect a majority slate to the Sept. 1 - 4 national convention .
Party officials planned to reconvene on July 26 .
But only about 300 delegates sent in RSVPs , well short of the 675 needed for a quorum .
Star Wars : The Clone Wars is a lot of firsts .
It 's the first new Star Wars film since Emperor George Lucas wrapped up the canonical series three years ago .
It 's the opening salvo of a wave of Expanded Universe TV series — the film launches The Clone Wars animated series , and meanwhile a live - action one set between the prequels and the original trilogy is deep in development .
It 's the first animated Star Wars feature film .
And most importantly , it 's the first Star Wars movie you will truly loathe .
Click to viewLet 's be honest .
We did n't hate the prequels , we were disappointed by them .
There 's a difference .
Okay , maybe we hated The Phantom Menace , at least a little bit .
Alright , yeah , Anakin was annoying in pretty much every single prequel film .
Guess what ?
He 's annoying here too .
Yet he 's not nearly as bad as his new Padawan , Ahsoka Tano , introduced to give the kiddies a protagonist they can relate to .
Yoda assigns her to Anakin as a Padawan to make him seem more mature and less , well , all of those qualities we hate about him .
Problem is , she 's all of those things times 7.6 , and he never stops being himself , so the onslaught of whine when they 're onscreen together makes you wish you brought a bucket of cheese to the theater .
It 's a heavy burden to deal with in order to watch The Clone Wars since she 's a focal point of it .
( Imagine Jar Jar getting 75 percent of the screentime in one of the prequels . )
Unfortunately , there 's not a whole lot of reasons to want to look past the incessant snottiness .
The 98 - minute film is at least 20 minutes too long , propelled by what could 've been a decent plot line that 's instead twisted and stretched into a sloppy mess .
Obi-Wan ( voiced by a solid Ewan McGregor doppelganger ) and Count Dooku ( happily , still voiced by the inimitable Christopher Lee ) offer brief moments of actual satisfaction in what 's otherwise a series of disappointingly generic battles .
Maybe the reason the battles are so lifeless is that they 're droids vs. clones - essentially nothing against nothing .
It could be the wholly uninspired , unexciting way it's " shot , " combined with the woodblock animation style that makes it look like action figures against action figures .
Regardless , after the second fight , they all kind of run together , and from all appearances , it 's what we can look forward to in the TV series .
Battles in Star Wars should not be boring .
Two of the movie 's better moments actually come from new Star Wars tech , or at least stuff not seen in the live action movies .
The first — which sets up the battle that gets the movie rolling , and establishes at least moderate hopes — is a giant red neighborhood - sized forcefield that surrounds the invading droid army , shielding them from Republic 's massive artillery canons .
Okay , really it 's borrowed from the Gungans in Phantom Menace , but it 's different because it 's red !
It 's a plot device that still works , anyway .
Anakin and Ahsoka 's first mission is to disable it , while Obi-Wan holds off the droids as long as he can - toward the end this battle is when your heart first drops into your stomach .
While we 've seen the AT - TE before , it does something incredible here that we have n't - it vertically scales a goddamn mountain .
Somehow , the director manages to make a vertical less enthralling than it should be , but to see this six - ton beast walk up a wall is one of the few times I said " Wow " during the movie .
Sadly , the few things there are to like are vastly overwhelmed by everything you wo n't .
Here 's a quick list of everything else you 'll hate : • The Huttlet ( aka Stinky ) • Ziro the Hutt ( aka Truman Capote + Black New Orleans Crack - Dealing Whore ) • Stupid droids •
The non-John Williams music •
The animation , mostly ( Mace Windu looks ghastly , though Count Dooku looks awesome ) •
The lightsaber battles ( you 'll see ) • Most of the dialogue •
The fact you paid to see it In short , it 's the worst Star Wars movie you 'll ever see in theaters , if you go , so do n't .

Flat screens for computers ?
They will soon be passe if the vision of Queen 's University computing professor Roel Vertegaal takes off outside the lab .
The Ontario school 's Human Media Laboratory is cooking up futuristic computer screens on Coke cans that can receive RSS feeds and videos ( as seen above ) and even on paper ( as seen below ) that blow away some of the other PC form factor improvements on the market or in the works ( see our recent slideshow on Desktops of the Future ) .
The lab describes its mission as being : to develop disruptive technologies and new ways of working with computers that are viable 10 to 20 years from now .
popularized by Apple with its iPhones and one that Microsoft is also touting for its upcoming Windows 7 .
Vertegaal also sees lots more in the way of touch screens , a notion hugely
" What we 're talking about here is nothing short of a revolution for human - computer interaction , " says Vertegaal , who writes about " organic user interfaces " in the June issue of the Association of Computer Machinery publication called Communications of the ACM .
Touch technology ( such as a tank top user interface being tested this summer in the lab ) , flexible displays and the really out there Kinetic Organic Interface , which involves computers that can change shape depending on what they 're displaying .
" We want to reduce the computer 's stranglehold on cognitive processing by imbedding it and making it work more and more like the natural environment , " says Vertegaal , in a statement .
" It is too much of a technological device now , and we have n't had the technology to truly integrate a high - resolution display in artifacts that have organic shapes : curved , flexible and textile , like your coffee mug . "

An Introduction to Prolog and RDF
April 25 , 2001
Bijan Parsia
Introduction : SW is AI
Many Semantic
Web advocates have gone out of their way to disassociate their visions and projects from the Artificial Intelligence moniker .
No surprise , since the AI label has been the kiss of , if not death , at least scorn , since Lisp machines were frozen out of the marketplace during the great " AI winter " of the mid-1980s .
Lisp still suffers from its association with the AI label , though it does well by being connected with the actual technologies .
However , it is a curious phenomenon that the AI label tends to get dropped once the problem AI researchers were studying becomes tractable to some degree and yields practical systems .
Voice recognition and text - to - speech , expert systems , machine vision , text summarizers , and theorem provers are just a few examples of classic AI tech that has become part of the standard bag of tricks .
The AI label tends to mark things which are n't yet implemented in a generally useful manner , often because hardware or general practices have n't yet caught up .
That seems to describe the Semantic Web pretty well .
An aside -- one interesting phenomenon is that a lot of AI ends up , after fleeing the CS department , in Information and Library Sciences .
And , of course , librarians , even the non-techie ones , are really into cataloging , searching , sharing , correlating , using metadata , intelligent agents ... to wit , all the elements of the Semantic Web .
AI folks do n't end up in library departments because librarians are pushovers ( as my overdue fines attest ) , but because there 's a pretty good fit between what ( some ) AI - ers like to do , what the library folks want , and between what the librarians want and what the Semantic Web requires .
So the Semantic Web is an AI project , and we should be proud of that fact .
Not only is it more honest , but it means that we can be clearer about what constitutes prior art , relevant research and literature , similar projects , and available technology .
As I 've written before , narrowness of understanding is a pernicious barrier to sensible progress .
Reinventing the wheel is n't nearly as bad as having to continually reconceptualize it : " not thought here " generally causes more systematic problems than " not invented here " .
In these articles , I 'm going to do a little down - to - earth exploration of RDF , a core Semantic Web technology , using a classic AI programming language , Prolog , plus some standard AI techniques and technologies .
A Gentle Prolog Primer
Prolog was the first logic programming language , and it 's still popular in industry and in the classroom .
There are many implementations , most of rather good quality .
Interestingly , Prolog implementations are often used as logic servers or drop - in inference engines for larger programs , so the implementations have gotten fairly good at integrating with other programs ( for example , there are several Prolog - style inference engines for the JVM , and some truly fine ones built on Common Lisp ) .
Prolog is an excellent prototyping language .
It 's quite easy to pull together programs with interesting and sometimes surprising properties .
There is a large , high - quality corpus of Prolog literature and code , much of which is easily adaptable to one 's ad hoc needs .
For example , a simple backward - chaining expert system is perhaps a page or two of sample code in just about any Prolog textbook .
While not production quality , such toys are ideal for getting a concrete sense of the problems and possibilities of an idea .
Syntax and Simple Semantics
There 's not room in this article to give a reasonable Prolog tutorial , but a few preliminaries will be useful for getting a grip on RDF and how Prolog can deal with it .
It 's helpful to contrast Prolog programs with invocations of them .
A typical Prolog program will form a knowledge base -- a database of facts and rules which is used as a basis for inferences .
To initiate computations , you query the knowledge base .
Here 's a very simple Prolog program which forms a small knowledge base about the readers of some popular web sites .
reads ( john , ' XML.com ' ) .
reads ( mary , ' XML.com ' ) .
reads ( mary , xmlhack ) .
reads ( cristina , xmlhack ) .
Each line in this program asserts a fact .
The first line claims that john reads ' XML.com ' ; the second that mary reads ' XML.com ' , and so on .
reads , john , mary , ' XML.com ' , cristina , and xmlhack are all Prolog atoms ( a.k.a. " symbols " ) .
The atom is the most basic and prevalent datatype in Prolog .
If an atom begins with an uppercase letter , or contains certain special characters ( like the full stop , which is also the statement terminator ) , then one encloses it in single quotes ( hence , ' XML.com ' ; while standard , you may find Prolog systems with alternative syntax for atom literals ) .
Given the types of characters that tend to show up in URIs , they almost always need to be enclosed in single quotes to produce their eponymous atoms .
RDF makes heavy use of URIs , which basically means that , worst case , when processing RDF with Prolog you 'll be writing ' http://purl.org/yadda/yadda/yadda/' a lot ( for some reasonable value of " yadda " ) .
Now that we have our knowledge base , we can interrogate our Prolog system .
After loading the program into my Prolog ( " consulting " it , in Prolog lingo ) , I can enter questions and receive answers at the " query " prompt .
?-reads ( john , ' XML.com ' ) .
yes " John reads ' XML.com ' ? "
Prolog says , " Sure does . " ?- reads ( mary , X ) . X = ' XML.com ' yes " mary reads what ? " X is a variable .
Prolog searched the knowledge base and found that if X was bound to ' XML.com ' we get a " true " statement ( i.e. , one in the knowledge base ) .
?- reads ( Person , ' XML.com ' ) .
Person = john ; Person = mary ; No " What Person reads ' XML.com ' ? " " john does ! " ( read " Who else ? " for " ; " )
" And mary ! " " Anyone else ? " " Nope . "
( Thus we see one standard Prolog development cycle : edit the knowledge base in a text editor .
Load it into the system , i.e. " consult it " .
Then interact with it from the read - query , evaluate , print loop . )
( Note : an unquoted capitalized atom is a variable .
Hence X is a variable , as is Person . )
Notice that in the second and third examples , there 's more than one answer that will satisfy the query : mary reads both ' XML.com ' and xmlhack , and both john and mary read ' XML.com ' .
In the last session , after Prolog told me that john read ' XML.com ' , instead of hitting " enter " , I hit the semicolon , which told Prolog to look again for other ways my query can be satisfied .
I kept doing this until there were no solutions that had n't already been given .
( While these particular commands are quite common in Prolog read - query - print loops , they are not universal . )
Suppose we want to know if any one person reads both ' XML.com ' and xmlhack ?
?-reads ( Person , ' XML.com ' ) , reads ( Person , xmlhack ) .
Person = mary ; No
( The comma between the clauses is pronounced " and " . )
Suppose we want to derive some targeted email marketing lists .
We will probably find , in those circumstances , that this last query is quite a common one .
It would be quite a drag to have to type that query out every time we wanted to send some spam .
More importantly , the concept " a reader of both ' XML.com ' and xmlhack " has a special status for us : it defines the term spam_target .
We could add the statement spam_target ( mary ) to our knowledge base , but that 's both redundant ( as we can figure out that mary 's a spam_target from what we already know ) and a pain to maintain ( e.g. , if mary stops reading xmlhack due to having to spend all her time deleting our spam , we have to change two lines in the program which are n't obviously connected ) .
Fortunately , we can add a rule to our knowledge base to define our new concept .
spam_target ( Sucker ) :- reads ( Sucker , ' XML.com ' ) , reads ( Sucker , xmlhack ) .
" A Sucker is a spam_target if That Sucker reads ' XML.com ' and That Sucker reads xmlhack . "
Assuming that we do n't alter our knowledge base any other way , the query spam_target ( Person ) will return mary .
Moving to RDF
In the pre-rule knowledge base , each fact had three parts :
the predicate , reads ; the subject of the predicate , i.e. , the reader ( john , mary , and so forth ) ; and the thing they read , i.e. , the object of the predicate ( ' XML.com ' and xmlhack ) .
By a striking and carefully planned coincidence , these are exactly the components of an RDF triple ( hereafter , I 'll use " RDF triple " and " triple " interchangeably ) .
The RDF triple is one of several formal models offered by the core RDF spec , and it consists of an ordered 3 - tuple of URIs ( with the exception that the object position may take a string literal ) with the first URI naming a predicate , the second naming a subject , and the last item being either an URI naming an object or a string literal .
While the example Prolog facts have the same slots as a triple , the symbols which fill those slots are n't URIs .
Happily , it 's not that hard to convert our simple knowledge base :
The Objects : since all the objects currently in our knowledge base are web sites , it seems natural to use their base URL as their name , thus , ' http://www.xml.com/' and ' http://www.xmlhack.com/'
( remember , to make URIs into standard Prolog atoms , you typically need to single quote them ) .
The Predicate : the predicate atom ( reads ) has no intrinsic , natural URI , but we can simply use the URL of this article ( which is unique and not particularly useful for anything else ) prepended to the atom , which yields : ' http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/04/25/prologrdf/reads' .
The Subjects : again , there 's no natural intrinsic URIs , but it seems a little nasty to use that same long URL prefix that we used for the predicate .
To add a little visual difference , we 'll invent mailto : based URIs for each person : ' mailto:mary@prologarticle.xml.com ' , ' mailto:john@prologarticle.xml.com ' , etc .
We can now covert the example knowledge base to a collection of RDF triples :
Predicate Subject Object ' http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/04/25/prologrdf/reads' ' mailto:john@prologarticle.xml.com ' ' http://www.xml.com/'
' http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/04/25/prologrdf/reads' ' mailto:mary@prologarticle.xml.com ' ' http://www.xml.com/'
' http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/04/25/prologrdf/reads' ' mailto:mary@prologarticle.xml.com ' ' http://www.xmlhack.com/'
' http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/04/25/prologrdf/reads' ' mailto:cristina@prologarticle.xml.com ' ' http://www.xmlhack.com'
Of course , this table presentation of the triples is bit hard to query .
It would be nice if we could encode these triples in a form that Prolog understood .
Fortunately , those URI atoms are just atoms , and we can use them just as we did our original ( more concise ) ones :
' http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/04/25/prologrdf/reads'( ' mailto:john@prologarticle.xml.com ' , ' http://www.xml.com/').
' http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/04/25/prologrdf/reads'( ' mailto:mary@prologarticle.xml.com ' , ' http://www.xml.com/').
' http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/04/25/prologrdf/reads'( ' mailto:mary@prologarticle.xml.com ' , ' http://www.xmlhack.com/').
' http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/04/25/prologrdf/reads'( ' mailto:cristina@prologarticle.xml.com ' , ' http://www.xmlhack.com').
?-'
http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/04/25/prologrdf/reads'(
Person , ' http://www.xml.com/').
Person = ' mailto:john@prologarticle.xml.com '
Yes
This is rather ugly as it stands ( adding XML style namespaces will help ) , but it gives us a nice , constructive demonstration of how RDF triples are , or can be seen as , Prolog facts ; and , hence , how a collection of RDF triples ( say , as serialized in an RSS document ) can be a Prolog program .
However , since Prolog knowledge bases can have facts with many arguments , and can have rules , we might want to keep our RDF - based facts somewhat distinct from the rest of program .
One way we might do this is by explicitly saying that a triple of URIs are in the RDF subject - predicate - object relation .
We could call that predicate rdf_triple , as in
rdf_triple ( ' http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/04/25/prologrdf/reads', ' mailto:john@prologarticle.xml.com ' , ' http://www.xml.com/'). rdf_triple ( ' http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/04/25/prologrdf/reads', ' mailto:mary@prologarticle.xml.com ' , ' http://www.xml.com/'). rdf_triple ( ' http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/04/25/prologrdf/reads', ' mailto:mary@prologarticle.xml.com ' , ' http://www.xmlhack.com/'). rdf_triple ( ' http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/04/25/prologrdf/reads, ' mailto:cristina@prologarticle.xml.com ' , ' http://www.xmlhack.com').
We can recover our old , easier to type , formulation by defining a few rules :
reads ( Person , Website ) :- rdf_triple ( ' http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/04/25/prologrdf/reads', Person , Website ) .
Our spam_target rule will work with this new knowledge base essentially as it did with the old one , without modification .
The definition of the rdf_triple predicate establishes a RDF knowledge base .
Our reads rule can be thought of as an RDF application .
In other words , our rules process the RDF .
The kind of processing we do is a form of inference .
We can use inferences to produce results similar to other forms of processing ( such as transformations or SQL queries ) though often with less work and more clarity .
Taking Stock
The root RDF data model is deliberately very minimal and , as with XML , that minimalism is intended to make things easier for programs .
One consequence of that minimalism , when coupled with other machine - friendly design tropes , is that though " human readable " , RDF is not generally very human writable ( although the Notation3 syntax tries to improve things . )
Furthermore , while RDF 's data model is specified , the processing model is n't ( deliberately ) , so one should expect a wide variety of processors , each working in its own way , depending on a variety of constraints and desiderata .
Standard Prolog provides a rich processing model which naturally subsumes RDF data .
As we saw above , deriving RDF triples from Prolog predicates , and then the reverse , can deepen our understanding of both .
Furthermore , there is a lot of experience implementing a variety of alternative processing models ( both forward and backward chaining systems , for example ) in Prolog -- from the experimental toy , through the serious research project , to the industrially deployed , large - scale production system level .
Furthermore , Prolog 's roots in symbolic processing and language manipulation support a wide array of mechanisms for building expressive notations and languages for knowledge management , which serve well for hiding the less friendly aspects of RDF .

Our schools teach the fundamentals we all love ; reading , writing , math , science and history .
What concerns me is our school system lacks some of the ‘ street smart ’ skills that kids will need to be those successful leaders , healers and entrepreneurs .
As parents , we must take teach our children ‘ money smarts ’ .
Can you imagine how empowered you would be if your parents taught you how to balance a checkbook , invest in the stock market , manage credit card debt , start a business , or the power of compounding interest ?
If you were one of the lucky few whose parents did teach you money skills , consider yourself blessed .
The present economic situation is a perfect time to teach our kids the importance of money management and the need to respect money for what it is , and is n’t .
So , where do we start ?
With the basics .
Depending upon your child ’s age , you can start with talking about money .
Most of us do n’t discuss the family ’s financial situation at the dinner table .
I propose you do .
I think it ’s important that children understand what is happening , good or bad , with the money being earned .
Do n’t get me wrong here ; I ’m not suggesting you tell your kids your annual income or the balance of your investment portfolio .
What I am suggesting is to bring the kids into conversations regarding ways to save , creative ways to earn additional money and what to spend that money on .
Involve them with decisions on vacations , donating to a charity or cause , or how they plan to buy their first car .

From middle schools to teens , open a savings account and teach them the importance of monthly deposits , regardless of the amount .
Create in them the healthy habit of making that deposit every single month .
Compounding interest and time are on their side and simple , small deposits made regularly add up to huge money later .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
A last - minute jump Thursday pushed crude - oil futures up more than $ 5 to above $ 141 a barrel , partly recovering a loss of over $ 9 a barrel in the first two sessions of the week , as geopolitical tensions in oil - rich countries such as Nigeria and Iran intensified .
Crude for August delivery closed up $ 5.6 , or 4.1 % , at $ 141.65 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Crude was mostly trading up less than $ 2 during the session , but jumped as much as $ 6 a few minutes before the market closed .
" This market , losing $ 9 in two days , has really been oversold , " said Zachary Oxman , senior trader at futures brokerage Wisdom Financial .
" Geopolitical pressures mixed with the oversold condition are " pushing up oil prices .
In Nigeria , the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta , or MEND , said it will end its two - week ceasefire on Saturday , the BBC reported .
Meanwhile , Iran test fired missiles for a second day Thursday .
Crude was also reacting to a new report by the International Energy Agency saying that global oil demand will rise in 2008 .
" Fresh Iranian missile tests overnight and a declaration by MEND rebels of an end to the current cease - fire are probably motivating buyers , " said John Kilduff , an analyst at MF Global , in a research note .
Crude futures had plunged by $ 9.25 a barrel over this week 's first two sessions , pummeled by a rising dollar and economic worries , before adding just a penny Wednesday .
Crude slumped $ 5.33 on Tuesday , the biggest daily loss since January , 1991 .
Also in Nymex trading , August natural gas futures rose 20.9 cents , or 1.7 % , to $ 12.22 per million British thermal units .
U.S. natural gas inventories gained 90 billion cubic feet in the week ending July 4 to stand at 2,208 Bcf , the Energy Information Administration reported Thursday .
Analysts at Global Insight had expected a buildup of 102 Bcf .
Last week 's stocks were 389 Bcf less than last year at this time and 70 Bcf below the five - year average of 2,278 Bcf , the EIA said .
Also on the energy markets Thursday , August reformulated gasoline gained 5.52 cents to $ 3.44 a gallon and August heating oil futures gained 19 cents to $ 4.04 a gallon .
Separately , Russia 's state - controlled energy giant Gazprom is in negotiations to buy Libya 's total export volume of gas , oil and liquefied natural gas at competitive prices , according to a statement Wednesday on Gazprom 's Web site .

Geopolitical developments
The MEND said it 's calling off the ceasefire following a U.K. offer to help Nigeria quell violence , the BBC reported .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said at the Group of Eight summit in Japan this week that the U.K. would help Nigeria " deal with lawlessness . "
A spokesman for the MEND vowed that U.K. interests would " suffer the consequences , " according to the report .
Nigeria , a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries since 1971 , is the fifth - largest crude exporter to the U.S .
In a further escalation of tensions with the West , Iran tested more missiles after firing at least nine Wednesday , including one that could reach Israel .
The U.S. said it will defend its interests and those of its allies , according BBC news reports .
But a senior U.S. military official disputed that Iran carried out a second day of missile tests , according to CNN .
The unnamed source told CNN the U.S. believes Iran fired seven short - to medium - range missiles on Wednesday , and that a missile that was fired the following day was one that had failed on launch on Wednesday
Iran holds the world 's second - largest proven oil reserves , beaten only by those of Saudi Arabia .
It 's also the fourth - largest crude producer after Saudi Arabia , Russia , and the U.S.
In terms of exporters , Iran ranks fifth after the Saudis , Russia , the United Arab Emirates and Norway .
Separately , France 's Total SA TOT , - 1.36 % ( 012027 ) , the last of the major oil firms considering an investment in Iran , has opted not to go ahead , its chief executive reportedly said .
Christophe de Margerie told the Financial Times that Total wo n't invest in a project to develop natural - gas fields in Iran , leaving Tehran without the technical know - how to significantly raise its gas exports until late next decade .

IEA raises demand outlook
The IEA said Thursday that it expects 2009 global energy demand to rise 1 % from 2008 levels .
Robust growth in developing economies will more than offset demand contractions in developed countries , the Paris - based IEA said .
The IEA also said that the bunching of new projects and Saudi Arabia 's pledge for 250,000 barrels a day in additional production should lead to an increase in spare capacity for crude oil next year .
But it said current high prices are not just about tight crude supplies , pointing to refinery capacity as another major contributor .
Dollar falling
The dollar fell slightly lower Thursday , partly helping push up crude prices , as a weaker greenback makes dollar - denominated commodities less expensive to buyers holding other currencies .
The dollar index DXY , +0.04 % , which measures the greenback against a trade - weighted basked of currencies , fell 0.1 % to 72.52 See Currencies .
Elsewhere , gold futures rose sharply Thursday , as the news from Iran boosted the safe - haven appeal of the precious metal .

Almost the entire world is appalled at the farce of the Palin pick , and what it says about McCain 's contempt for foreign policy and national security .
Here 's a take from Israel :
" This would never have happened in Israel , ever " remarked a journalist friend , referring to the choice of Governor Palin , whose credentials in the realms of foreign policy , statecraft and the military are limited in the extreme .
With irony bordering on the painful , the journalist added , " Sarah Palin has restored my faith in Israel . "
Yes : Palin would be an unimaginable pick in any other advanced country .
Foreign leaders and publics have been told one thing by this selection : McCain is not a serious world leader .
But for neocons who regard alliances as impediments to the projection of raw military power , the opinions of mankind are actually a reason to vote for Palin .

As landfills fill up we are always looking for new and clever ways to sweep our trash under the rug .
The vast oceans are a tempting frontier … but how do we use them without polluting them ?
A lot of waste that runs into our waters becomes habitats for fish and other sea life but only recently have people begun to think about doing this intentionally .
From a set of subway cars to an entire aircraft carrier here are a few projects that take recycling to new depths – not to mention above - water reuses of sea bases by pirate radio operators and micronation founders .
( Images via : NYPress , NJScuba and Inhabitat )
Who would have thought that hundreds of old subway cars could find a second life with exotic marine passengers ?
Starting with a few dozen retired New York City cars , this East Coast habitat project is expected to unload hundreds of cars by the time it is done .
The dumped vehicles can support thriving sea life in , on and around them within a mere six months and help bring back communities of depleted oceanic animals .
The USS Oriskany is one of a number of gigantic vessels that has been systematically sunk by the US Navy in order to create massive artificial underwater reefs .
Weighing nearly 50,000 tons and housing dozens of species , the vessel had to be thoroughly cleaned before it could be sent under .
While the oceans ca n’t be a dumping ground for every kind of waste they are a great place for objects like this that can be effectively assimilated into local ecosystems and promote rather than disturb sea life .
If we take a somewhat looser definition of ‘ marine habitat ’ there are a host of aquatic structures that have been adaptively used in all kinds of created ways – but by and for people rather than sea animals .
The army sea forts shown above have been converted into everything from luxury hotels to pirate radio stations and even micronations .

Clearly , there is a pressing need for an open standard for document formats .
Documents that can be shared across platforms , across products , and across time .
The solution to the problem is ODF , which was created by a technical committee of the OASIS industry consortium and has benefited from industry wide participation in its development .
ODF gained acceptance as an ISO standard in May 2006 .
Microsoft has no date for implementing OOXML on its own platform , but has agreed to implement the rival ODF format on Microsoft Office .
Microsoft has given its blessings to ODF by joining the OASIS committees , and to cap it all , a senior Microsoft spokesman has conceded that " ODF has clearly won " .
Questions are being asked in Europe about the way that Microsoft went about the standardisation process .
At least four countries have succeeded in having their objections raised to the fast - tracking of OOXML through the International Standards Organisation ( ISO ) , and as a consequence , the ISO has put the standard on hold , at least for the time being .
Microsoft 's problems with OOXML just wo n't go away .
MS - OOXML was supposed to supplant the Open Document Format ( ODF ) , but is becoming an embarrassment .
As a format it betrays its hurried origins , and is over - complex .
At best , it has technical problems .
At worst , it is barely fit for purpose .
The promise of an open standard is that it opens the market to competition .
More importantly for the end user it is future proof and offers accessibility .
No longer will it be necessary to have the latest version of the latest software from the biggest vendor on the latest upgraded computer to read the latest document from your latest customer , and in the future there will be some chance of recovering the document you saved some years ago with whatever office application you choose to use .
Microsoft opts out
In the beginning , despite invitations to join the OASIS ODF specification committees , which included all the other leading office software vendors , Microsoft opted out of the standardisation process .
Presumably the assumption was that if the market leader ignored the format it would go away , or conversely , if ODF was given credibility by Microsoft 's participation it would open the market to competition and be an unacceptable threat to Microsoft 's grip on the market .
Either way , Microsoft stood aside .
Microsoft 's position was that its own proprietary formats were the " de facto " standard , and as such , others would just have to live with things the way they were , or fade away .
Part of the problem for the competition , of course , is that Microsoft's " de facto " Office formats are not publicly available .
Moreover , producers of competitive products have no chance of producing " in time " translators of Microsoft 's latest format changes .
Competitors are excluded , and interoperability is a one way journey .
Everything changed when the State of Massachusetts chose ODF as the format for its future documents .
Eric Kriss , Secretary of Administration and Finance in Massachusetts , was reported as saying : " It is an overriding imperative of the American democratic system that we cannot have our public documents locked up in some kind of proprietary format , perhaps unreadable in the future , or subject to a proprietary system license that restricts access . "
Other state and national governments began to make similar demands , and MS - OOXML , confusingly titled Office Open XML , was Microsoft 's response .
Stopping ODF
The ostensible reason for the subsequent fast - tracking of MS - OOXML as an ISO standard was that ODF was inadequate to Microsoft 's purposes .
Critics suggest that the real reason was to stop ODF and standardisation in its tracks .
OOXML will undoubtedly defeat the appeals process and achieve full ratification as an ISO standard , but fails to satisfy the remit that governments require of an open standard .
In a sensible world a standard cuts across political and proprietary concerns , is independent , fit for purpose , and open .
OOXML satisfies none of these requirements .
There is no current implementation of the OOXML format as approved by ISO , and Microsoft has admitted that it will not support the ISO specification until the release of the next version of Office , which has not yet been given a release date .
Despite , or because of , the fast tracking of MS - OOXML through the ISO ratification procedure , the specification , as it was presented to the ISO , is incomplete , as has been well documented by Rob Weir and others .
Backlash against open access
In recent years , scientific publishing has changed profoundly as the Internet simplified access to the scientific journals that once required a trip to a university library .
That ease of access has caused many to question why commercial publishers are able to dictate the terms by which publicly funded research is made available to the public that paid for it .
Open access proponents won a big victory when Congress voted to compel the National Institutes of Health to set a policy of hosting copies of the text of all publications produced by research it funds , a policy that has taken effect this year .
Now , it appears that the publishing industry may be trying to get Congress to introduce legislation that will reverse its earlier decision under the guise of strengthening copyright protections .
Under existing law , the products of federally funded research belong to the scientists that perform it and institutions that host them .
Academic journals have traditionally had researchers transfer the copyright of publications resulting from this research to the journals .
The current NIH policy requires that authors they fund reserve the right to place the text and images of their publication in an NIH database hosted at PubMed Central ( PMC ) .
To protect commercial publishers , papers submitted to PMC are not made accessible until a year after publication , and are not required to include the formatting and integration of images performed by the publisher .
This one - year limit is longer than that required by other governments and private funding bodies such as the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Wellcome Trust .
Many publishers have embraced this policy , and allow the fully formatted paper to be made available , sometimes after a shorter embargo .
Open Access meets resistance
Not all publishers have embraced it , however , and some have tried to exact exorbitant fees for allowing manuscripts to be transferred to PMC .
Others have engaged in aggressive lobbying against open access efforts .
John Conyers ( D - MI )
introduced HR 6845
Those efforts may be paying off .
The House of Representatives has seen the introduction of legislation , HR 6845 that , depending on its final format , may significantly curtail or eliminate the NIH 's ability to continue its open access policy .
The current bill would prevent any arm of the federal government from making research funding contingent upon " the transfer or license to or for a Federal agency of ... any right provided under paragraph ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) of section 106 in an extrinsic work , to the extent that , solely for purposes of this subsection , such right involves the availability to the public of that work . "
Those Section 106 rights include the reproduction of the work .
Although that would seem to rule out the existing NIH policy , there is a certain amount of legal wiggle room there .
For example , the NIH could fund a private entity to maintain PMC , and thus have the right to reproduction transferred to an independent entity .
Nevertheless , the bill would appear to directly target the prior legislation that put the NIH in the business of mandating public access in the first place .
The Intellectual Property Subcommittee comes up to speed
Last week , the Judiciary Committee 's Subcommittee on Courts , the Internet , and Intellectual Property held a hearing on the proposed legislation .
If anyone was thinking that policies related to publicly funded scientific research were free of politicking and rampant self - interest so frequently involved in the copyright and intellectual property battles , the hearings would have erased them .
Legislators questioned whether it made sense to mandate the transfer of copyrights at a time when the US government was pushing for other governments to respect those rights .
At one point , hearing chair Howard Berman ( D - CA ) noted that the N in NIH should n't stand for Napster .
Howard Berman ( D - CA )
chaired the hearings
It also became apparent that there was a bit of a turf battle going on .
The Intellectual Property Subcommittee clearly felt that it had been ignored during the original passage of the bill that compelled the NIH 's open access policy , and several members expressed displeasure at having been bypassed , and suggested the bill was useful simply for allowing them to have a voice on the matter .
That said , many of the representatives were clearly in need of a primer in academic publishing .
Different members of the Subcommittee expressed surprise at various aspects of the current system , such as the fact that peer reviewers perform the function free ( although , as noted , the process of arranging for peer review can be expensive ) .
Also eliciting surprise was the revelation that authors are not paid by publishers for the transfer of copyright .
In fact , many publishers charge money for the publication of scientific research , even those that obtain copyright to the work in the process .
Dr. Elias Zerhouni , director of the NIH , shocked Berman when he mentioned that the NIH hands out $ 100 million a year to grant recipients specifically to cover the cost of publishing their results .
It would certainly have been possible for those testifying in favor of the open access policy to argue that the public pays part of the cost of nearly every stage of the publishing process , and might expect to have some access to the end product .
VA still failing to make timely appointments for patients , report says

Ancient yeast reborn in modern beer
A tiny colony of yeast trapped inside a Lebanese weevil covered in ancient Burmese amber for up to 45 million years , has been brought back to life in barrels of beer .
Emeritus Professor Raul Cano of the California Polytechnic State University , originally extracted the yeast a decade ago , along with more than 2000 different kinds of microscopic creatures .
Today , Cano uses the reactivated yeast to brew barrels of pale ale and German wheat beer .
" You can always buy brewing yeast , and your product will be based on the brewmaster 's recipes , " says Cano .
" Our yeast has a double angle :
We have yeast no one else has and our own beer recipes . "
The beer received good reviews at the Russian River Beer Festival and from other reviewers .
The Oakland Tribune beer critic , William Brand , said the beer has " a weird spiciness at the finish , " and The Washington Post said the beer was " smooth and spicy . "
Part of that taste comes from the yeast 's unique metabolism .
" The ancient yeast is restricted to a narrow band of carbohydrates , unlike more modern yeasts , which can consume just about any kind of sugar , " says Cano .
Eventually the yeast will likely evolve the ability to eat other sugars , which could change the taste of the beer .
Cano plans to keep a batch of the original yeast to keep the beer true to form .
If this has a ring of deja vu , it could be because Cano 's amber - drilling technique is the same one popularised in the movie Jurassic Park , where scientists extracted ancient dinosaur DNA from the bellies of blood - sucking insects trapped in fossilised tree sap .
Cano 's original goal was to find ancient microscopic creatures that might have some kind of medical value , particularly pharmaceutical drugs .
Going to sleep
While that particular avenue of research did n't yield significant results , the larger question of how microscopic creatures survived for millions of years could help scientists understand certain diseases , says Professor Charles Greenblatt , a scientist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem who studies ancient bacteria .
" We 've got cases of guys who contracted [ tuberculosis ] during World War II and lived with it for 60 , 70 years , " says Greenblatt .
" Then suddenly they get another disease , the TB wakes up from its dormancy and kills them . "
Inducing dormancy could be a new way to fight disease and infection , says Greenblatt .
Instead of outright killing infectious creatures , doctors could instead put them to sleep .
The infection would still be present in the patient 's body , but it would n't hurt the patient .
Neither Cano nor Greenblatt can say what the upper limit for hibernating yeast or bacteria is - it could be hundreds of million years .
But while other scientists work on that , Cano plans to spend his time tossing back a few cold ones , and hoping others will too .
" We think that people will drink one beer out of curiosity , " says Cano .
" But if the beer does n't taste good , no one will drink a second . "

Advertisement Social factors - rather than genetics - are to blame for huge variations in ill health and life expectancy around the world , a report concludes .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has carried out a three - year analysis of the " social determinants " of health .
The report concludes " social injustice is killing people on a grand scale " .
For instance , a boy living in the deprived Glasgow suburb of Calton will live on average 28 years less than a boy born in nearby affluent Lenzie .
See life expectancy in Glasgow compared with other places
The research also shows that a girl in the African country of Lesotho is , on average , likely to live 42 years less than a girl in Japan .
People need the opportunity , the possibility , to take control of their lives - but the conditions need to be right to allow them to do that
Sir Michael Marmot
WHO 's Commission on the Social Determinants of Health
GP explains Scots ' life expectancy gap
In Sweden , the risk of a woman dying during pregnancy and childbirth is one in 17,400 , but in Afghanistan the odds are one in eight .
The report , drawn up by an eminent panel of experts forming the WHO 's Commission on the Social Determinants of Health , found that , in almost all countries , poor socioeconomic circumstances equated to poor health .
The differences were so marked that genetics and biology could not begin to explain them .
Toxic combination
The authors write : " ( The ) toxic combination of bad policies , economics , and politics is , in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible . "
LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH
Selected countries ( 2006 ) Country Life expectancy at birth ( years ) Japan 83 Australia 82 Sweden 81 Canada 81 Italy 81 UK 79 Finland 79 US 78 Chile 78 China 73 Iran 71 Egypt 68 India 63 Senegal 59 Tanzania 50 Mozambique 50 Lesotho 42
The report calls for governments to consider how all their policies impact on health .
It says that it is entirely possible to reduce health inequality within a relatively short period of time .
But it warns that , without action , injustice and inequality will only increase .
Sir Michael Marmot , chairman of the commission , told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said :
" There are examples where health inequalities have narrowed but , in too many cases , we have seen a widening .
" But that means the magnitude of inequalities is flexible - if the gap can widen , it can get narrower . "
" In the UK , we have seen an improvement in people 's health over the last eight years . "
But Sir Michael said the benefits to the worst off had not been as significant as those seen among the best off .
He said : " The key message of our report is that the circumstances in which people are born , grow , live , work , and age are the fundamental drivers of health , and health inequity . "
" We rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy . "

More from Today programme " A more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity ; to make health and health equity a marker for government performance . "
" People need the opportunity , the possibility , to take control of their lives - but the conditions need to be right to allow them to do that . "
Forefront
The report highlights education , affordable housing , management of access to unhealthy foods and social security protection as key .
It also said that governments should take action to ensure a living wage for workers , and working conditions that reduce work - related stress and ensure a healthy work - life balance .
Ann Keen , health minister for England , said the recent Darzi review had identified the reduction of health inequalities as a key priority for the NHS , and tackling the social factors driving the problem was a core plank of government policy .
She said : " The UK is at the forefront of tackling health inequalities , but the challenge of reducing the gap in life expectancy is still very much an issue . "
Norman Lamb , Liberal Democrat health spokesman , said : " The WHO makes it clear that while healthcare has improved , it is the rich who are reaping the benefits .
" It is shocking and disgraceful that this contrast can exist in modern Britain . "
Shona Robison , Public Health Minister for Scotland , said : " This government has put tackling health inequalities at the forefront of the future health agenda , and importantly , at the heart of every government policy whether that be housing , employment , communities or education .
" Until now , social ills such as crime , poor health and poverty have held too many people back in Scotland . "

What are these ?
IT 'S an ill wind that blows nobody any good .
The fall of Bank rate on Thursday by another half per cent is an outward and visible sign that the dramatic and precipitous slump of the last three weeks in Wall Street has definitely relieved the pressure on the world 's money markets which the New York situation has been exerting so continuously for the last two years .
Very few could have dared to hope , when Bank rate was raised to 6 ½ per cent on September 26th , that it would be back again at 5 ½ per cent in less than two months .
That advance , indeed , was a by no means negligible factor in turning into the opposite direction the tide of funds which had been flowing so strongly towards New York , and in causing the edifice of American speculation to totter .
But that it would collapse so completely was hardly to be expected .
In the event the financial strain has been lifted , and money rates have fallen to such an extent that for the last two weeks , Bank rate , which fell to 6 per cent on October 31st , has been ineffective , three months ' bills having fallen this week to a bare 5 per cent .
In the circumstances the Bank had no alternative but to lower its rate .
Indeed , some people had thought that it should be even bolder and reduce the rate to 5 per cent .
This optimistic view , however , did not take sufficient account of the gold situation .
Since the end of September the Bank has continued to lose gold to France , and has barely balanced these losses by receipts , its holding today being about the same as when the rate was raised .
But there is a vast difference between a situation in which the Bank is fully holding its own and one in which it was losing heavily every week .
There is no urgent need for the Bank to embark on a drastic policy for the purpose of rebuilding its reserves .
It is clear that we are about to enter on a period of considerably cheaper money , and the rebuilding process can take place steadily when a new world level has been attained .
The slump on the New York Stock Exchange , which has resulted in this great change in the monetary outlook , is one of the spectacular episodes of financial history .
A prolonged upward movement , the extent of which is illustrated by some graphs which we print in a later column , has been built up over a series of years on the amazing and unexampled prosperity of America .
But some two years ago the speculative movement seemed to lose all touch with reality ; and in spite of occasionally vigorous but more often half - hearted , measures by the banking authorities of the United States , speculative fever spread throughout the nation and carried prices , mainly with the aid of borrowed money , to fantastic heights .
Writing of the efforts made to check the movement , a high authority observes :
" The market fought its way upward against Reserve banks and member banks , and there was truth in the boast that it defeated them . . . bankers are not the owners of the funds in their custody , and the market defeated them by going round them and inducing depositors to place their funds at the disposal of ' the street . '
Democracy triumphed over authority and leadership in the advance , and the orgy at the finish was all its own . "
Highly coloured stories of devastating ruin and of paralysis of economic life must , as always in such cases , be heavily discounted ; but it is natural that people should be asking themselves how widespread and of what character will be the economic reactions of this slump .
The question acquires added importance from the fact that in its later stages the Wall Street movement pervaded the whole world by drawing money , not merely from all corners of America , but from every continent .
It resulted in an embargo on the export of gold from Canada and monetary difficulties in the Argentine , while its financial repercussions were painfully felt in every monetary centre .
If this was the effect of the boom what will be the effect of the collapse ?
Turning first to the direct effects in this country , there are undoubtedly many private investors , as well as trust companies and other financial institutions in London who have suffered substantial losses .
But circumstances have somewhat mitigated what might easily have been much more serious effects in Great Britain .
There has notoriously been considerable British buying of American securities during the last two years , and the advent of the Labour Government gave an added incentive to those who thought that it was time to escape from the British frying - pan into what , in the event , proved to be a very hot American fire .
In September , however , the shock to the London Stock Exchange caused by the Hatry disclosures , together with the growing uneasiness as to the giddy heights to which American securities were soaring , undoubtedly led , in some cases , to forced sales and , in others , to precautionary withdrawals of money invested in the United States .
There were signs of a backward movement from the United States even before Bank rate rose in September ; but after the rise these withdrawals rapidly increased .
London 's interest in Wall Street was thus considerably lightened before the slump occurred .
After the slump had taken place , large quantities of international securities were offered in the London market at , in some cases , very low prices .
These have been absorbed and London has thus done something to stop the rot .
But while the direct effects are not of really serious importance to this country , the influence on the economic situation here depends on more general considerations than the technical position at the time of the slump and , above all , on the answer to the question which everybody is asking but no one is prepared to answer , namely , what will be the economic effect of the slump on business in the United States ?
It has many times been pointed out that the present slump differs from most of its predecessors in the fact that it has not been accompanied by industrial over - production or rising commodity prices resulting from an expansion of credit .
If the industrial situation is unduly expanded , as in 1920 , and the whole economic situation is precariously balanced like an inverted pyramid upon its apex , even a moderate shock from the Stock Exchange might produce a general collapse .
This is not the situation today .
The question presents itself rather in this form :
Can a very serious Stock Exchange collapse produce a serious setback to industry when industrial production is for the most part in a healthy and balanced condition ?
Optimists say that there is no precedent for such a harmful reaction , and that the worst that need be expected is a slight shock reflecting itself in a short - lived hesitation .
Even though some temporary contraction of demand for consumers ' goods of the luxury type may be inevitable , it is argued that cheaper money should lead to increased expenditure on capital goods by industrial corporations , and that official encouragement , backed by the steady propaganda of the " sunshine artist , " should quickly produce a renewal of the upward trend of industry as a whole .
A more serious view is taken by others , who point not only to the heavy " break " in certain commodity prices which has accompanied the slump , but to the danger that Wall Street losses may have gravely shaken the psychological confidence of America in the prospect of unlimited expansion .
These observers think that the orgy of speculation in the United States has been so widespread that persons of all classes deceived by , in some cases , real , but in many more cases , purely paper profits from their investments , have been living beyond their means , or , at all events , mortgaging their future by purchasing luxury goods up to , or even beyond , the full limit of their incomes .
It is said that this has resulted in a precarious situation owing to the extensive buying on the instalment plan , and that the slump will lead to widespread defaults and a slowing down of production in the trades chiefly concerned .
The ordinary man , however , cannot spend paper profits without realising them , and while it may be true that the confident expectation of large Stock Exchange profits may have encouraged an extravagant scale of living which may have to be reduced , it remains true that the bulk of instalment buying rests upon the income of wage and salary earners which will not be affected by the present slump , unless it extends its ramifications throughout industry and produces unemployment .
Indeed , as Professor Seligmann has recently argued , " instalment credit , extended as it is largely to recipients of wages and salaries , is likely to produce less effect on the business cycle than producers ' credit , resting upon profits . "
It may , however , be taken for granted that there will be some curtailment of the consumption of luxury goods , and that this will mean a certain restriction of trade .
How far this will extend must at present be a matter of conjecture .
A great deal must in any case depend upon the situation of the banks .
The one influence that could throne back the full brunt of the speculative collapse upon industry and produce a real depression throughout the country would be banking trouble .
Certain Wall Street banks made some spasmodic efforts to check the slump , but were careful to dispose of their holdings at the first opportunity , and there is no reason to suppose that they have seriously handicapped themselves by efforts which never went the length of attempting to stop the rot by holding large blocks of stock off the market .
There are , however , known to be large quantities of securities not yet absorbed by the public which for the time being have to be carried by banks and finance houses .
Many banks will , moreover , have made very large bad debts , while others will have to finance customers for a long or short period .
Some bank failures , no doubt , are also to be expected .
In the circumstances will the banks have any margin left for financing commercial and industrial enterprises or will they not ?
The position of the banks is without doubt the key to the situation , and what this is going to be cannot be properly assessed until the dust has cleared away .
On the whole , the experts are agreed that there must be some setback , but there is not yet sufficient evidence to prove that it will be long or that it need go to the length of producing a general industrial depression .
It remains to consider what effect a setback , whether great or small , in the United States will have upon other countries .
The trade reports contained in our Supplement this month show a not unnatural hesitation as to the effects of the American situation .
The fear is , however , expressed that if United States producers suffer from a diminution of their home market , it will , on the one hand , strengthen the demand for an increased tariff at Washington , and , on the other , lead to the exporting of the surplus products at low prices abroad .
This last event is one which has long been awaited with some misgiving by European producers .
But the expectation that there will be a flood of American exports as a result of the tide having turned in the United States overlooks one or two features of recent American development .
In the first place , American technique has developed on the lines of very greatly reducing production for stock and it is the practice today to curtail output schedules at the first sign of reduced sales .
Secondly , mass production means production at a very narrow margin of profit per unit of output .
Thirdly , the apparatus of foreign sales , except in those products which already have a foreign market , cannot immediately be improvised .
We need not , therefore , assume either that there already exist in the United States , or that manufacturers will continue producing so as to create , large surplus stocks of manufactured goods ; nor can they afford to sell abroad at less than cost , at the expense of the American producer , more than a small proportion of their output .
While , therefore , there may be some sales of goods at low prices , which may prove embarrassing for competing producers , it is not to be contemplated that the great stream of American production can suddenly be switched from the home market into export channels .
In any case , against any disadvantage arising from American competition must be set the great advantage which we mentioned at the outset , namely , the return to cheap money conditions .
This should assist trade recovery throughout the world , which has been handicapped for so many months past by the abnormal financial conditions in New York .
If we are justified in assuming that the setback in American industry will only be temporary , we may look forward to steady development in 1930 , free from the incubus that has of late been hampering world conditions .
1 M barrels of emergency oil are moved
disclaimer : image is for illustration purposes only
by Staff Writers
Washington ( UPI ) Sep 18 , 2008
The U.S. Energy Department has delivered more than 1 million barrels of emergency exchange oil due to supply disruptions caused by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike .
Officials said the emergency oil was delivered along pipeline systems from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to various oil company refineries since Sunday .
The deliveries included 678,000 barrels to the ConocoPhillips Co.'s Wood River refinery , 250,000 barrels to the Marathon Petroleum Co. 's Midwest refineries and 109,000 barrels to a Placid Oil Co. refinery .
The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve , which has a 1 billion - barrel capacity , is the largest stockpile of government - owned emergency crude oil in the world , the Energy Department said .
While the International Olympic Committee is busy trying to catch today 's performance enhancers , athletes are already looking for the next big boost that will give them the edge in 2012 .
Most of the positive doping tests in Beijing – and the IOC president estimates there will be as many as 40 – will likely be for steroids and the blood - boosting hormone erythropoietin , known as EPO .
But the future of doping could get a lot more complicated .
Here are some of the most promising – or threatening , if you 're the World Anti-Doping Agency – candidates for the next Olympics .
Use your genes to grow more muscle
Manipulating genes to block naturally occurring muscle - growth inhibitors could allow athletes to boost their muscle mass .
A lot .
In tests on mice , blocking the protein myostatin gave the mice up to 60 percent more lean muscle mass .
Even more promising , Johns Hopkins '
Se - Jin
Lee recently found that overproduction of one myostatin inhibitor pumps the mice up even more : up to 81 percent in females and a whopping 116 percent in males .
Results of human clinical trials are pending .
Complicating the picture , particularly for WADA , is a small number of people with naturally inhibited myostatin who will have to be distinguished from the dopers somehow .
Pop a blood - boosting pill
Who would n't love a pill that delivers the same record - breaking benefits of synthetic EPO without the hassle of injections or getting caught ?
Clinical trials are under way for a pill that tricks the body into thinking blood - oxygen levels have dropped , causing it to produce more red blood cells , thus improving muscle endurance .
When blood - oxygen levels drop , hypoxia - inducible factor , or HIF , kicks in to stimulate red blood cell production .
Once oxygen is back to normal , the HIF breaks down and cell formation stops .
The drugs , known as HIF stabilizers , stop the breakdown and keep blood production up .
Some suspect athletes may already be using HIF stabilizers , but the health risks are unknown .
Grow more blood vessels
If you do n't mind injections directly into your heart and limbs , vascular endothelial growth factor may be for you .
VEGF causes new blood vessels to grow , which in theory could move more oxygen and nutrients between muscles , lungs and the heart with less effort .
So more effort could be expended on athletic performance .
VEGF gene therapy could potentially help patients with heart and arterial diseases form new blood vessels , keeping them alive and avoiding amputation .
But it 's not a simple hack , and a failed gene - doping test is n't the only risk .
Unregulated VEGF - induced vessel growth appears to also promote tumor growth and metastasis .
Feel less pain , get more gain
Athletes know how to suffer .
Raise an athlete 's pain threshold , and suffering will occur at a higher level of exertion .
Tests on rats suggest that injecting the beta - endorphin gene into spinal fluid through a spinal tap causes the body to release its own painkilling endorphins .
Pain signals get blocked before they reach the brain , without the sleepiness and cloudiness associated with morphine and other painkilling opioids .
Raising an athlete 's pain threshold may improve performance , but it may also cause them to ignore warnings of overexertion and injury .
Beef up specific muscles
Say you 're a cyclist who wants powerful legs but a light upper body so you do n't have to haul the extra weight when riding uphill .
Or a tennis player who needs a bit more shoulder muscle .
Injecting insulin - like growth factor , or IGF - 1 , into specific muscles sparks those muscles to grow while avoiding the full - body muscle growth usually associated with IGF - 1 . Physiologist H. Lee Sweeney at the University of Pennsylvania discovered this while looking for a treatment for muscle - wasting that avoids side effects from unwanted growth , such as cancer and heart enlargement .
The targeted therapy may also make IGF - 1 harder to detect in a doping test .
Sweeney estimates that since his research was published , half of his e-mails are from athletes .
He has worked with WADA , but others developing similar techniques may not .
Get more muscles , fewer zits
Want the muscle - building benefits of steroids without the testicle - shrinking , moob - growing , acne - popping side effects ?
That 's the promise of selective androgen receptor modulators .
SARMs bind to specific tissues , such as muscle and bone .
Unlike some steroids , they do n't indiscriminately also bind to prostate , liver and other tissues .
And SARMs come in a pill .
No needles or skin patches .
These pills could be a boon to people suffering from muscle - wasting diseases and for athletes concerned about health risks associated with steroids .
Sound too good to be true ?
Perhaps :
A test to detect SARMs may be ready before the drugs are widely available .
WADA wo n't tell until they catch an athlete .
Fill up with new blood substitutes
With EPO and blood transfusions increasingly detectable , athletes could return to blood substitutes for an extra hit of oxygen .
Several athletes reportedly used substitutes in the past , and one cyclist may have almost died as a result .
Some new substitutes could have similar problems .
A report in the Journal of the American Medical Association in April criticized blood substitutes such as PolyHeme and Hemopure for causing heart attacks and deaths in test subjects .
But there are alternatives .
Oxygen Biotherapeutics claims their experimental substitute , Oxycyte , carries oxygen 50 times more efficiently than natural blood without the risks of older substitutes .
And Dendritech patented a blood substitute built from 3 - D nanoparticles that the company builds in precise oxygen - carrying shapes .
At least some blood substitutes may be easy to detect , but there are rumors the test is n't regularly used .
Take a next - gen EPO
At the Tour de France in July , Ricardo Ricco got caught using a new EPO - like blood booster , CERA , recently released by Roche .
Before CERA was on the market , the pharmaceutical giant cooperated with WADA to have a test ready to trap cutting - edge dopers like Ricco , a sign that WADA is catching up to , and perhaps even staying ahead of , dopers .
Or it 's a sign that WADA needs help developing tests to detect each EPO variant , a tall order considering EPO and related drugs make up a $ 12 billion market .
There are also dozens of EPO - stimulating agents available or in the works around the world .
Pump up your muscle fiber
Athletes already have more fatigue - resistant muscle fibers than couch potatoes .
But new research shows they may be able widen that gap further by boosting levels of the gene responsible for adding new fibers .
Recently , researchers at the Salk Institute in San Diego found that an existing medication , called GW1516 , raises the levels of this gene , resulting in a 68 percent endurance improvement in fit mice .
The Salk researchers are working with WADA on a test to detect use of GW1516 .
But several other drugs are known to manipulate the muscle - fiber genes , and others are believed to do the same .
A test to detect this type of gene doping would need to cover a lot of uncharted territory .
Lastly , use mustard ?
Athletes turned off by the latest biotech breakthroughs can try this recipe : Strip down and rub mustard oil all over your body .
While exploring the role skin plays in the production of red blood cells , Randy Johnson 's team of researchers at UC San Diego found that rubbing mustard oil on mice caused spikes in natural EPO production , and that led to increased red blood cell levels .
It 's unclear how much mustard oil a human athlete would need to enhance performance , or how much mustard oil could lead to strokes and heart attacks .
With all the crazy , complicated doping schemes out there could the journey to the top of the podium simply require a trip to the grocery store ?
What happens when linguistic tools used to analyze human language are applied to a conversation between a language - competent bonobo and a human ?
The findings , published this month in the Journal of Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science , indicate that bonobos may exhibit larger linguistic competency in ordinary conversation than in controlled experimental settings .
The peer - reviewed paper was written by Janni Pedersen , an Iowa State University Ph.D. candidate from Denmark whose interests in the language - competent bonobos at Great Ape Trust of Iowa led her to the United States , and William M. Fields , director of bonobo research at Great Ape Trust .
Their findings run counter to the view among some linguists , including the influential Noam Chomsky , professor emeritus of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who argue that only humans possess and use language .
In his hierarchy of language , Chomsky believes that language is part of the genetic makeup of humans and did not descend from a single primitive language evolved from the lower primate order , and it must include formal structures such as grammar and syntax .
Fields said the publication opens an important new chapter in a decades - long debate about the linguistic capabilities of apes .
" The resistance to this in the scientific community is enormous , " he said .
" For the first time , we have a student who is using linguistic tools that have normally been applied to humans now being applied to non-humans .
This is a move toward using the kinds of methodology that are appropriate in ape language , based on Savage - Rumbaugh 's 1993 monograph , Language Comprehension in Ape and Child . "
For her paper , Pedersen analyzed a videotaped conversation between the bonobo Panbanisha and Dr. Sue Savage - Rumbaugh , now a scientist with special standing at Great Ape Trust , but a researcher at Georgia State University 's Language Research Center when the video was made about 15 years old .
Since 2000 , students working in the bonobo laboratory have systematically reviewed archived video to track the development of competencies such as language in each of the bonobos for comparison with their current competencies .
" This is a long - term project , starting from the beginning of where we have data , " Fields said .
" All of this is contextualized with our current research and larger programs , such as forgiveness research .
The students are looking at the earlier data , while investigators are looking at new data . "
He expects Pedersen 's paper to be the first in a series of many .
" This paper serves as an investigation into the early ontogeny of these kinds of competencies , " he said .
" These papers will eventually be assembled in a larger volume to look at issues in the development of forgiveness and other cultural dimensions of the apes ' lives . "

In the video that is the subject of Pedersen 's publication , Panbanisha was in the forest with Savage - Rumbaugh and an assistant , who had a dog in tow that Panbanisha did n't like .
Though Panbanisha and Savage - Rumbaugh moved from topic to topic in the conversation , Panbanisha repeatedly used the lexigrams to express her desire to be carried by the assistant , who was tending to the dog .
Savage - Rumbaugh offered other resolutions , but Panbanisha remained firm .
Ultimately , the ape prevailed and was carried from the forest by the assistant .
After applying conversational analysis tools , Pedersen asserted that language is more than the simple act of transferring information , but a conversational interaction between active participants .
Language - competent bonobos use lexigrams , which are made up of arbitrary symbols that represent words , as the basis for conversations with humans .
Pedersen said linguistic aspects of the conversation included turn taking , negotiation , pauses and repetition , and went far beyond information sharing made possible through the use of lexigrams symbols .
" She was using language to get at what she wanted , " Pedersen said .
" She is very , very clever and is fully capable of following the conversation the same way a human does .
This tells me that Panbanisha 's knowledge of language is far beyond understanding the words , to understanding how to use them in a conversation to get what she wants . "
" One of the things Janni has affirmed , and affirmed in a way the lay person can understand , is the aspect of turn - taking .
If there is anything universal in human language , it 's turn of talk , " Fields said .
" The fact that Panbanisha has done this , and it 's accessible even to an untrained reviewer , I think is an important aspect of her paper .
She has looked at the whole social action , and the meaning .
Ideational flow – going back and forth – is obvious .

" Originally , repetition was thought of something that happens normally in human language , " he said .
" Traditionally , repetition in ape communicative behaviors is assumed to be proof that they do n't have language .
It 's a kind of dichotomy or unfairness . "
Fields said Pedersen , who has a master 's degree in philosophy from the University of Aarhus , Denmark , and is working toward a Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology in ISU 's Anthropology Department , " has been able to do something unique " that Chomsky , long regarded as the father of contemporary linguistics , was unable to do .
Pedersen expects to complete her dissertation in ape language research , the second to focus on data collected with the world - famous bonobos at Great Ape Trust .
The first was Pictorial Primates – A Search for Iconic Abilities in Great Apes , by cognitive scientist Tomas Persson from Sweden 's Lund University .
He argued that the bonobos at Great Ape Trust readily grasped the meaning of abstract symbols , such as those found on the lexigrams board , and , like humans , are able to interpret .
" The importance of Janni's Ph.D. can't be overstated , " Fields said .
" Hers will be the first Ph.D. produced in ape language since the research moved to Iowa . "
The ape language research program moved from Georgia to Des Moines in 2005 , and Great Ape Trust is the only place in the world where such research takes place .
" Janni is an important part of the future , and she will help carry ape language research further , " Fields said .
Conservative Leader Stephen Harper came to the defence of Gerry Ritz on Thursday , a day after the agriculture minister came under fire for making jokes about the listeriosis outbreak .
While campaigning in the strategically vital province of Quebec , Harper called Ritz 's comments about the outbreak that has been linked to the deaths of 17 Canadians '' completely inappropriate . "
But Harper dismissed pressure from opposition parties for him to apologize personally on behalf of the government and fire Ritz , noting the minister had already offered his unreserved apologies .
" I think he ’s been doing a good job on this file and applaud him for apologizing completely and forthrightly , " Harper told reporters in Trois - Rivières .
All three opposition parties called for Ritz 's resignation Thursday , as did family members of those who died from the listeriosis outbreak .
The controversy again forced the Conservatives into damage control mode during their campaign for the Oct. 14 federal election after earlier gaffes by campaign staff threw the Tories off message .
The Canadian Press reported on Wednesday that Ritz made the controversial remarks at an August conference call with scientists , bureaucrats and political staff .
Fretting about the political dangers of the crisis , Ritz reportedly quipped : " This is like a death by a thousand cuts .
Or should I say cold cuts . "
When mistakenly told about a reported death in Prince Edward Island , Ritz said : " Please tell me it 's [ Liberal MP ] Wayne Easter . "
It has now been determined that no one has died from the listeriosis outbreak in P.E.I .
' Shows insensitivity to families '
Harper said Thursday that Ritz " was working very , very hard " at the time he made the comments .
" I think this story is obviously very embarrassing for him , very unfortunate , " Harper said .
" But should not detract from the good work that he has done to get on top and understand this matter , to improve the system , and to communicate publicly with Canadians and to make sure that government officials are all doing their job . "
Ritz had initially received praise during the crisis last month for immediately returning to Ottawa and handling the federal response , although opposition critics decried Health Minister Tony Clement 's decision to remain in Denver for the U.S. Democratic national convention .
Easter , the Liberal agriculture critic , told CBC News Thursday morning that his party called for Ritz 's resignation in September over his handling of the outbreak , not for his wisecracking .
Easter also called on Harper to apologize to families who have been affected by listeriosis .
The joke Ritz made about Easter is in keeping with " a pattern of the Harper government in which anyone who disagrees with them is going to be treated with disrespect and attacked , " he said .
" But the real terrible point here is that this shows insensitivity to families who lost loved ones and to the seriousness of the issue itself . "
Ritz showed ' lack of respect , ' families say
The mother of 36 - year - old Kristen Hicks , who died in an Alberta hospital Aug. 14 of listeriosis , said she 's angry about Ritz 's comments .
" I think Mr. Ritz showed very poor judgment and a lack of respect for the Canadians he 's representing , " Mary Hicks told CBC News .
Hicks questioned Ritz 's scripted apology without allowing questions , saying it made her feel that " public safety was secondary to his wish to remain in office . "
Also Thursday , the son of a Saskatchewan woman who contracted the same bacteria strain was offended when he learned of the remarks .
" If Harper is the right kind of person to run this country , he 's got to do the right thing and get rid of this minister .
Simple as that , " said Dennis Schroh , whose 82 - year - old mother Elizabeth Schroh died Aug. 24 .
" For sure , I was a Tory .
Now this is going to change me .
No doubt about it , " he told the Canadian Press .
Elizabeth Schroh 's death is still under investigation to determine whether listeriosis was a contributing or underlying factor in her death .
Ignatieff accuses Tories of ' callous incompetence '
Meanwhile , Liberal deputy leader Michael Ignatieff immediately struck out at Harper over Ritz 's comments during his first national campaign appearance with Stéphane Dion in Toronto .
" This is a government who at a time when Canadians are dying of listeriosis has an agriculture minister making cheap and offensive cracks , " Ignatieff told the crowd of Liberal candidates and supporters .
" That is not leadership ; that is callous incompetence .
A real leader would fire Gerry Ritz . "
The call for Harper to dismiss Ritz was immediately echoed by NDP Leader Jack Layton , who said Canadians are already tired of " weeks of inaction " from the Conservative government on the listeriosis crisis .
" And then when his agriculture minister jokes about it , what do we get but excuses ? "
Layton said at a campaign appearance in Winnipeg Thursday .
" I say that if Stephen Harper was a strong leader , he would take action now . "
The latest controversy has drawn comparisons to an earlier tempest in the campaign over comments made by Conservative communications director Ryan Sparrow .
The party suspended Sparrow indefinitely after he sent an e-mail to a reporter suggesting comments made by the father of a Canadian soldier who died in the Afghanistan mission were politically motivated .
Sparrow immediately apologized .
Harper personally apologized to Dion in the first week of the campaign after the Tory party 's website briefly featured a puffin defecating on the Liberal leader 's shoulder .
In the modern world , wars are won and lost as much in the minds of global public opinion as on the battlefield .
Even as the fighting between Russia and Georgia has raged in South Ossetia and other parts of Georgia , a fierce -- if uneven -- media battle has also unfolded .
Each side is eager to establish its narrative of the situation and unfolding events .
As on the battlefield , Russia enjoys vast material superiority in the information sphere .
Its 24 - hour English - language news channel , Russia Today , has covered the story relentlessly since the fighting erupted on the night of August 7 - 8 .
Over footage of dead soldiers and civilians , moderators have emphasized the growing humanitarian crisis in the region , claiming that Georgia has refused to allow wounded refugees to travel to Russia .
On August 8 , the channel passed along unconfirmed reports that Georgian troops had executed wounded and captured " peacekeepers and civilians . "
Since access to the region has been cut off from the Georgian side for many months , the only journalists able to report live from South Ossetia have passed through the Russian side .
Independent journalists have been denied visas , meaning that media reports from the ground have come largely from Russian state - media journalists , including reporters from Russia Today and the Russian state military channel Zvezda .
Russia Today has reported a steady string of Russian government statements , including Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov 's assertion that he has received reports of " ethnic cleansing " by Georgian troops in South Ossetia .
On August 9 , Russian Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu arrived in the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali , bolstering Russia Today 's narrative that the Russian incursion is a " peacekeeping operation " intended to restore order and provide humanitarian relief .
The news coverage was augmented by near - continuous commentary by Russia Today political analyst Peter Lavelle , who argued that following the failure of the UN to adopt a resolution on the conflict , Russia was obligated to intervene unilaterally to minimize the humanitarian crisis .
Lavelle lamented the " lack of international understanding " about the situation , which he said is " very vexing " for Moscow .
Another analyst accused Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili of launching a " blitzkrieg " and seeking a " short and victorious war , " while a third blamed the United States and the West for fomenting instability in the region in their bid to control the energy resources of Central Asia and the Middle East .
In short , Russian analysts have sought to forestall action on the crisis by Western states with a preemptive strike on their possible motivations for doing so .
Despite the imperatives of breaking news in a fluid situation , Russia Today on both August 8 and 9 found time to run a half - hour report called " The Fragile State " on the political situation in Georgia in general , emphasizing the country 's political crisis last winter .
During that time , the government cracked down harshly on opposition rallies and briefly shut down all nonstate broadcasters .
The tone of the Russia Today report was both that Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili is willing to do anything to maintain an increasingly tenuous hold on power and that the 1994 Rose Revolution is a failure , with Georgians in general pining for the prerevolutionary period and , in some cases , even Soviet times .
The channel scheduled " The Fragile State " for broadcast six times on August 9 .
Georgia Reaches Out To The West
Tbilisi has had a much harder time spinning its version of events , having to rely on exposure in the Western media in competition with coverage of the Olympics in Beijing , the U.S. mortgage crisis , and numerous other stories .
Georgia has also had to explain its decision to launch a heightened military action in South Ossetia .
" The New York Times " reported on August 9 that Georgian government websites have been the targets of cyberattacks and have been intermittently inaccessible .
However , Saakashvili and other Georgian officials have been widely available to Western media and Western journalists are able to report freely from the Georgian side of the conflict zone .
When Russian attacks spread outside of South Ossetia on August 9 to Poti and Gori , Western cameras were on hand , even as Russia Today was denying that any such actions had occurred .
Georgian officials have stressed their claims that Russia launched a massive and well - planned incursion into Georgian territory , in violation of the country 's sovereignty .
On August 8 , Saakashvili appeared on CNN from his office , with a Georgian flag and an EU flag behind him .
Their appeals to the West are reminiscent of similar appeals that were issued from Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 .
" Georgia is a peace - loving nation , but today we are being attacked north to south , east to west , " Saakashvili said on August 9 .
Georgian Ambassador to the UN Irakli Alasania the same day pushed a similar theme .
" [ For us ] it is very difficult to observe the absence of swift and appropriate response from the international community , " he said .
" However , I would like to remind you once again that the Russian Federation -- which represents a side and now , in fact , is the aggressor -- is a permanent member of the Security Council , with veto power .
This , of course , complicates taking any concrete , tangible decisions within the council . "
These two narratives -- Russia 's tale of a humanitarian intervention along the lines of NATO 's actions in Kosovo in the 1990s and Georgia 's account of a small nation being dismembered by its giant neighbor -- would logically seem to compel Russia to restrain itself and limit its military actions to the territory of South Ossetia .
Actions in other parts of Georgia are already showing signs of eroding the official Russian rationale for its presence and further action , particularly on the ground , would give strong visual support to Georgia 's claims .

Kubica leads BMW 1 - 2 at Canada
F1 Grand Prix , GP Canada , Circuit Gilles Villeneuve Robert Kubica has marked his first win of F1 careers masterfully and led his teammate Nick Heidfeld to the finish .
Coulthard is a well deserved third thanks to a solid drive and a perfect pit stop strategy .
Kubica also takes the championship lead thanks to his win .
The Canadian GP of 2008 is started under sunny sies but with a moderately strong wind ( 7.7 m / s ) .
It is possible some rain will fall during the race , but so far the skies look clear .
The track temperature is 34°C .
Jenson Button and Sebastian Vettel will start from the pitlane .
When the lights go out , all three men in front stay in their positions .
Rosberg meanwhile is able to jump Alonso , who on his behalf manages to just hold off Massa .
In the midfield , Heidfeld lost a place to Barrichello but was able to gain it again 3 laps further in the race .
After 8 laps , Hamilton is slowly increasing his lead , being 4.3 seconds ahead of Kubica .
On 9 seconds is Raikkonen and a further 4 seconds down is a trio with Rosberg , Alonso and Massa .
In lap 14 , Sutil is out of the care after parking his car after turn 2 .
Raikkonen has meanwhile returned on Kubica despite having run off all the grooves on his left front tyre .
Two laps after the incident , Charlie Whiting finally realised the car cannot be cleared , so a safety car is brought on track .
Button is meanwhile entering the pitlane for his first stop , a strange moment as he started from the pitlane and will now aso end up with a penalty .
One lap later , a lot of drivers dive into the pitlane .
Raikkonen and Kubica are out side by side and stop at the end of the pitlane due to red lights .
Hamilton meanwhile is inattentive and hits Raikkonen from behind .
Both drivers are out of the race , while Rosberg hit Hamilton too .
He is able to rejoin but must get a new front wing in the next lap .
When the safety car is off , Heidfeld is in the lead as he did n't pit , ahead of Barrichello and Nakajima .
Kubica is tenth and is followed by Alonso , the first of the drivers who have pitted under the safety car .
Heidfeld iis however considerably faster than Barrichello and manages to pull away more than 2 seconds per lap away rom everybody else .
The German might be given the chance of his life if he can continue with the same pace through this race .
Piquet , running just behind Alonso goes off in lap 19 but is able to rejoin the track without damage .
In the event , he dangerously drove backward across the track .
Massa was just able to prevent an accident .
The same lap , Heidfeld is in the pitlane for a considerable time and may be going until the end without a second stop .
It remains to be seen if will manage to do so on the option tyres .
He rejoind the track just ahead of Kubica but is passed by his teammate a single lap later .
In lap 26 , with 34 to go , Barrichello makes his only pitstop , handing Coulthard with the race lead .
Not for long however as he stops one lap later .
Coulthard comes back behind Alonso and ahead of Barrichello .
As a result , Trulli is in the lead , ahead of Glock and Kubica , all running within a couple of seconds .
Just past halfway in the race , Alonso is still blocked behind Heidfeld .
Kubica regained the lead due to both Toyota 's pitting and is ahead of his teammate by 11 seconds .
Robert is immediately told to push hard in order to increase the gap to Heidfeld as he will have to stop in a couple of laps .
4 laps later , Alonso pushes a little too hard and touches the wall , a little too hard it seems as he is out of the race with a broken front suspension .
The pit radio just after that revealed a possible gearbox problem .
With 22 laps to go , Nakajima 's front wing is broken as he touched a Honda in the hairpin .
Not a disaster , had it not been that the front wing just broke off upon entrance , lifting up the car and leaving the Japanese without steering .
He ends up in the pitwall and abandons the race .
One lap later , Kubica makes his stop and rejoins a couple of seconds ahead of his teammate .
Behind Heidfeld , the closest competitor is David Coulthard 5 seconds further down .
Barrichello , 4th at the time is however passed by two cars in move .
The action started with Kovalainen who attempted a pass on Rubens in the hairpin .
Both men braked late , but still Kovalainen was able to get past .
In the gap on the inside of the corner , Massa saw an opportunity and managed challenge both cars succesfully .
Moments later , Fisichella his the barriers but a safety car is not deployed .
The fear of such deployment does make some drivers decide to stop immediately .
12 laps to go and Barrichello goes through the grass in the first chicane , allowing both Toyota 's to pass him .
Rosberg on the other hand tries to pass Vettel on the outside of the straight , but fails .
He loses so much time that he must let Kovalainen pass by .
A lap later Barrichello loses another place to Massa .
The latter is charging incredibly hard and passed Trulli after he is blocked by his own teammate .
Glock made an error in the first corner .
As he rejoined , he cut Trulli's was and Massa profited again .
More homeless people expected to vote this fall Associated Press
Published : Tuesday July 29 , 2008
Print This Email This Among the record number of voters expected to cast ballots this fall may be an increase from an often - invisible population - the homeless .
Advocacy groups and shelters across the country have stepped up efforts to register the 3.5 million people who drift in and out of homelessness in the United States .
" Just because we 're homeless or low income does n't mean we do n't have an opinion , " said Estelle Bearcub , who plans to vote for Barack Obama .
" It 's our right to vote .
And it 's our right to have our opinion count , too . "
The homeless have sometimes struggled to participate in the political process , in large part because of requirements in Washington and 39 other states that voters list a mailing address .
Volunteers encourage transient voters to use the address of the shelter or soup kitchen they frequent in order to receive an absentee ballot .
In states that require a physical address , voters can list a park or intersection where they sleep .
Bearcub has an absentee ballot delivered to the soup kitchen where she eats lunch most every day .
" It works pretty well , " she said , standing outside Bremerton 's Salvation Army post , where a banner announcing a voter registration drive flapped in the breeze .
" They keep it real safe .
We 've never had any problems . "
Inside the Salvation Army , volunteer Walter Washington acknowledged that some homeless people do n't care about politics .
" But others , they know what 's going on , and they have their views , " he said .
Michael Stoops , executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless , said his agency 's efforts have been particularly effective this year because of intense interest in the presidential race .
" I 've never seen it like this , " said Stoops , who has been registering homeless voters since 1984 .
" We 're going to see increased turnout across the board . "
In West Palm Beach , Fla. , advocates registered more than 100 people in a week .
Now they 're scrambling to train volunteers to continue the work through September .
" Our main goal is to dispel the myth that because they do n't have a roof over their head , they 're not entitled to the vote , " said Rita Clark , the county 's homeless coalition director .
In Portland , Ore. , a recent drive by the Sisters of the Road homeless advocacy group registered more than 400 homeless voters , twice as many as the agency registered in 2004 .
Patrick Nolen , who organized the effort , said repeated visits by presidential candidates to Oregon heightened interest in registration among the homeless .
But many homeless voters were also concerned with local races .
Portland 's homeless pay especially close attention to laws prohibiting sitting or lying on sidewalks between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m.
Anti-camping laws prevent them from storing bedding on public property .
" I heard many a discussion about which city councilor supported the sidewalk and anti-camping laws , " Nolen said .
" Those types of decisions affect them a lot more than other voters . "
In Washington state , some government agencies even accept mail for homeless voters during election season .
In Seattle in 2004 , officials allowed more than 500 people to receive ballots at the county administration building , which runs a free shelter on its loading dock during the winter .
Some officials worry about potential election fraud involving homeless voters .
After studying data from the 2004 election , Milwaukee police in March reported a heightened risk of voter fraud among the homeless , because many of them were registered in multiple locations .
Efforts to register homeless voters will continue throughout the summer , culminating in a 50 - state effort slated for late September .
" It 's their right , " Nolen said .
" There are very few reasons why you can't vote .
In most places , it 's only if you 're incarcerated or if you 're dead . "
“ As you simplify your life , the laws of the universe will be simpler ; solitude will not be solitude , poverty will not be poverty , nor weakness weakness . ” – Henry David Thoreau
Post written by Leo Babauta .
Follow me on Twitter .
In the comments of a recent post on simplicity hacks , a few readers seemed to think I was prescribing a path to leading a simple life .
That was n’t my intent , and in fact , I think such a prescription is impossible .
There is n’t one way to simplicity — there are as many ways as there are people who seek a simple life .
What I was trying to do in that post was to provide a few tools for overcoming common obstacles along the way … tools you could use or disregard , depending on your personality and situation .
Today I ’d like to explore what it means to lead a simple life , and how you can get there — or more accurately , the many paths to getting to the many destinations .
What is the Simple Life ?
There is no single definition of simplicity .
My vision of a simple life will be different than yours , or anyone else ’s — and none of us is wrong .
I ’ve read about someone living in a log cabin in Alaska , with no electricity or running water or television or Internet .
They chop wood from the forest outside to burn for heat and cooking .
They use water from a nearby stream for drinking and bathing .
They walk or bike to town to go to the library or to use the Internet .
That ’s a pretty simple life by most definitions — but when I talk about leading a simple life , I do n’t mean you need to live in a log cabin in the woods — I certainly do n’t .
I ’ve also seen photos of pretty expensive houses , decorated in a very minimalist fashion , spartan in their simplicity , but also decorated with expensive furniture .
These houses are gorgeous , and their minimalist interiors are extremely attractive … but it takes a lot of money to get to that point .
This is one kind of simplicity , but it ’s not for everyone .
I ’ve also read about people who live extremely frugally , rarely buying new items , making things last as long as possible , re-using plastic bags and bottles , growing food in a garden , buying things second - hand in thrift shops when necessary .
This kind of frugality is one kind of simplicity , and to some extent I use many of these ideas myself .
But it ’s not the kind of simplicity for everyone .
So what ’s my idea of a simple life ?
Again , this is n’t what you need to shoot for , and it ’s not even what you need to agree with .
We can each have our own vision .
My idea is that I make room in my life for the essentials — the things I love to do and the people I love to be with .
I remove the non-essentials as much as possible , and leave a life that is n’t overwhelmed with tasks and projects and errands , but has space … space for what I want to do , and space between things .
So that I can live a peaceful life , move slowly , work happily , and spend time with the people I care most about .
This might mean that I live frugally ( so that I can work less , or save for what ’s important ) , or it might mean that I sometimes splurge , because life is too short not to enjoy things while you can .
I find ways to enjoy myself without spending money , but at the same time I am not afraid to treat myself and my family now and then .
What ’s your idea of a simple life ?
It ’s almost certainly different than mine .
And that ’s good — we do n’t want cookie - cutter approaches here .
We want something that makes sense to each individual person , that fits their personalities and dreams and life situations .
Think about what your idea of a simple life is , so that you can find your path to get there .
The Many Paths to Simplicity
So with each person pursuing a different destination to a simpler life , how can we find the paths to those destinations ?
There is n’t one answer .
We must each find our own path , obviously , but we can still learn from others .
I ’ve learned from many people along the way , and in fact I still learn from all of you each day .
I think I learn more from the comments of my posts than you learn from the posts themselves , but that ’s what makes this conversation a wonderful thing .
My best overall advice is to think about where you want to go , and then figure out a path to get there .
And then take the first step .
Once you ’ve done that , you can worry about the next step .
You will probably take a different path than the one you first envisioned , and in fact you may get to a different destination than you first imagined .
Just take it one step at a time , and see where you get .
That said , I ’d like to offer some ideas that may help you find your path .
These are not to be adopted wholesale , and in fact some of them contradict each other .
That ’s because they represent different paths — and again , there is no one right path .
Take inspiration from them , try some out if you like , but do n’t take this list as a prescription to anything .
Take it slowly .
There is no need to rush to a simpler life .
Take deep breaths , and take things one step at a time .
Baby steps .
Enjoy the process .

Do a major rehaul .
Sometimes it can be revitalizing to do a rehaul of your entire life .
Wipe the slate clean and start from scratch .
Now , that might mean moving to a new house and only bringing the possessions that mean the most to you .
Or it might mean getting a new job that you love and setting your own schedule around the things you love doing .
Or it might mean doing a major cleansing of your house , getting rid of most of your junk .
It could mean just dropping all commitments except the things you love most .

Remember what ’s important .
Why are you trying to simplify ?
Is it to make room for the things you love ?
Then be sure to identify those things , and keep those things in mind during this process .
Is it simply to reduce your stress and live a more peaceful life ?
Then remember that on your path to simplicity .

Adopt changes gradually .
As one commenter pointed out , and as I have said in the past , if you adopt one small change at a time , you can make major changes over the long - term without the changes seeming very big at all .
Make one small change , and soon that becomes the norm for you .
Then make another , and that becomes the norm .
Each step seems small , but they can add up to really big progress over months and years .

Try different types of simplicity .
You do n’t have to pick one way .
You can try frugality , then minimalism , then cabin - in - the - woods simplicity , then chuck all your responsibilities and hang out on a beach all day .
See what works for you .

Join a community .
There are online communities and maybe even groups within your neighborhood that are going for a common goal .
That might be frugality , or decluttering , or living with a minimal impact on the environment .

Take assessment .
I ’m a big fan of stepping back and taking a look at my life in general , reflecting on what I want my life to be like , on what kind of progress I ’ve made , on what needs to be done .
It ’s good to do this at the beginning of your path to simplicity , and every now and then along the way .
What ’s your path to simplicity ?
What have you learned along the way ?

Yesterday , we detailed how Gov. Sarah Palin 's lawyers have been trying to slow - roll the Alaska legislature 's probe of " Troopergate . "
Well , the effort appears to be in high gear .
Palin has of course been accused of firing Alaska 's top cop for refusing to do the governor 's personal bidding and fire a trooper who was involved in a nasty divorce with Palin 's sister .
( Here 's our backgrounder on the scandal . )
As we wrote yesterday , a Palin aide stood up investigators and did n't show up to give scheduled testimony .
A lawyer for the aide , who had been recorded on a call pressing for the trooper to be fired , explained that his client did n't have to show up since the " governor 's office was contesting the jurisdiction of the Legislature to handle this matter . "
Today we learn via the Associated Press that while witnesses are apparently going AWOL from the legislature 's probe at the governor 's urging , they are at least being questioned ... by Palin 's own private lawyer .
According to the AP , Palin lawyer " Thomas Van Flein has worked aggressively to undermine an Alaskan legislative inquiry and has started questioning potentially damaging witnesses against the governor . "
The AP says Palin 's lawyer has interviewed two witnesses .
One is a manager in the state 's workers ' compensation division .
( There are allegations Palin 's office peeked into the trooper ’s worker comp files . )
The other witness who has submitted to questions by Palin 's lawyer is a gubernatorial aide named Frank Bailey .
That would be the same aide who stiff - armed investigators Wednesday .
According to the AP , interviewing witnesses before the probe gives a serious leg up to the governor because " it means that she already knows at the outset the detailed accounts of potential witnesses against her .
The procedure also locks important witnesses into the accounts they give . "
UPDATE : The legislators overseeing the probe appear to be making some counter - moves .
They are moving toward issuing subpoenas ( though not to Palin ) and are apparently now looking to finish the investigation by early October , three weeks earlier than first planned .
Meanwhile , the lawmaker leading the probe says seven witnesses have now snubbed investigators and canceled their meetings .

Google and GE to Tag Team on US Government
September 18th , 2008 by Joshua S Hill
I ’ve said from the very beginning of my writing here at Green Options , as have many other pundits and journalists the world over , that it will be big business that not only will , but has too lead the way to an environmentally friendly future .
And one of those companies that have taken this challenge in hand is Internet search and advertising giant Google .
And now , announced on Wednesday , Google and technology giant General Electric will be teaming up to promote the need for a change to the US power grid and cleaner energy .
They will also be working together on green energy technologies , as well as lobbying US political leaders to support what they call “ visionary policies ” focusing on renewable energies .
“ Both companies believe that our economic , environmental and security challenges require that we use electricity more efficiently , generate it from cleaner sources , and electrify our transportation fleet , ” the US firms said in a joint release ( PDF ) .
“ This 21st century electricity system must combine advanced energy technology — a major GE focus — and cutting edge information technology — a major Google focus . ”
Google has already poured millions of dollars into research and development of cleaner and renewable energy sources .
Beyond that , they have made the leading step forward to bring change about by implementing change within their own ranks .
The environmental policies at the Google campus in Mountain View , California , are monumental .
But all the research and development will be for naught if the US does n’t make a change to its old power grid .
“ We ’ll start by working together in Washington , D.C. , to mount a major policy effort to enable large - scale deployment of renewable energy generation in the United States , ” said Michael Terrell of Google.org on Google ’s official blog .
“ We ’ll also work on development and deployment of the ‘ smart ’ electricity grid that will empower consumers , utilities , and technology innovators to manage electricity more efficiently and lower their carbon footprint . ”
The partnership is also looking to work together on enhanced geothermal systems , which they believe could provide base - load power .
This comes just a month after Google.org , Google ’s philanthropic division , invested over $ 10 million in enhanced geothermal , another in a long string of renewable investments made by Google .

An envelope arrived in our office the other day .
It had the bulky , tawdry look of junk mail : pink and lavender Easter eggs , a plastic address window and a photo of a young man in fatigue shorts using crutches to stand on his only leg .
“ Thousands of severely wounded troops are suffering , ” it read .
“ Will you help them this Easter ? ”
It was a plea for money from the Coalition to Salute America ’s Heroes , one of the worst private charities  but hardly the only  that have been shamefully milking easy cash from the suffering and heartache caused by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The coalition and its sister organization , Help Hospitalized Veterans , were among a dozen military - related charities given a grade of F in a study last December by the American Institute of Philanthropy , a nonprofit watchdog group .
These and other charities have collected hundreds of millions of dollars from kind - hearted Americans and squandered an unconscionable amount of it on overhead and expenses  70 percent or 80 percent , or more .
The usual administrative outlay for a reputable charity is about 30 percent .
Money that donors surely assumed was going to ease the pain and speed the healing of injured soldiers went instead to junk - mail barrages , inflated executive salaries and other forms of corporate - style bloat .
It ’s all legal .
There is very little regulation in the charity game , and if someone like Roger Chapin , the “ nonprofit entrepreneur ” who founded the Coalition to Salute America ’s Heroes and Help Hospitalized Veterans , wants to mismanage your money , he has great leeway in doing so .
His veterans ’ charities raised more than $ 168 million from 2004 to 2006 , but spent only a pittance  about 25 percent  to help veterans .
The rest , nearly $ 125 million , went to fund - raising , administrative expenses , fat salaries and perks .
Mr. Chapin gave himself and his wife $ 1.5 million in salary , bonuses and pension contributions over those three years , including more than $ 560,000 in 2006 .
The charities also reimbursed the Chapins more than $ 340,000 for meals , hotels , entertainment and other expenses , and paid for a $ 440,000 condominium and a $ 17,000 golf - club membership .

What Is Skirt Length ( Hemline ) Theory ?
The skirt length theory is a superstitious idea that skirt lengths are a predictor of stock market direction .
According to the theory , if short skirts are growing in popularity , it means the markets are going to go up .
If longer skirt lengths are gaining traction in the fashion world , it means the markets are heading down .
The skirt length theory is also called the hemline indicator or the " bare knees , bull market " theory .
Key Takeaways
The skirt length theory proposes that skirt hemlines are higher when the economy is performing better , and longer during downturns .
To its merit , the hemline indicator was accurate in 1987 , when designers switched from miniskirts to floor - length skirts just before the market crashed .
A similar change also took place in 1929 ,
Very few , however , trust the validity of the theory as an accurate predictor of markets and it is considered market lore .
Understanding the Skirt Length Theory
The idea behind skirt length theory is that shorter skirts tend to appear in times when general consumer confidence and excitement is high , meaning the markets are bullish .
In contrast , the theory says long skirts are worn more in times of fear and general gloom , indicating that things are bearish .
First suggested in 1925 by George Taylor of the Wharton School of Business , the Hemline Index proposes that skirt hemlines are higher when the economy is performing better .
For instance , short skirts were in vogue in the 1990s , when the tech bubble was increasing .
Skirt length theory is a fun theory to talk about , but it would be impractical and dangerous to invest according to it .
The Case for Skirt Length Theory
Although investors may secretly believe in such a theory , most serious analysts and investors prefer market fundamentals and economic data to hemlines .
The case for skirt length theory is really based on two points in history .
In the 1920s — or the " Roaring Twenties " — the economic strength of the U.S. led to a period of sustained growth in personal wealth for most of the population .
This , in turn , led to new ventures in all areas , including entertainment and fashion .
Fashions that would have been socially scandalous a decade before , such as skirts that ended above the knees , were all the rage .
Then came the Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression , which saw new fashions dwindle and die in favor of the cheaper and plainer fashions that preceded them .
This pattern seemingly repeated in the 1980s when mini-skirts were popularized along with the millionaire boom that accompanied Reaganomics .
The pendulum of fashion swung back to longer skirts in the late 80s , roughly coinciding with the stock market crash of 1987 .
However , the timing of these incidents , let alone the strength of the potential correlation , is questionable .
Although there may be a defendable thesis around periods of sustained economic growth leading to bolder fashion choices , it is not a practical investment thesis to work with .
Even benchmarking skirt length in North American would be a challenging undertaking .
The time spent auditing clothing outlets to establish the length of top - selling skirts would take more time than it is worth considering that it is far from proven as to whether the hemline indicator is leading or lagging .
Other Unconventional Economic Indicators
The Men ’s Underwear Index is just one of a host of unconventional economic indicators that have been proposed since the advent of market tracking .
Some other Unconventional Economic Indicators that have been promoted include :

What Kind of DBA Are You ?
By Gregory A. Larsen
There are many types of DBAs .
Some DBAs work in the developer arena , while others are heavy into performance and tuning , and still other DBAs fall into the operational aspects of managing SQL Server .
There are a number of different tasks a DBA might perform depending on the environment in which they work .
To help identify all the different kinds of tasks a DBA might perform I have compiled a list .
My list covers many different types of tasks .
I have categorized these tasks into 7 different areas : Configuration , Database Standards , Database Design , Development , Maintenance , Monitoring , and Planning .
For each task , Ive listed a short description of the duties associated with that task .
In some environments , a single DBA might perform each of these tasks but in other environments , these tasks might be shared by many different individuals .
If you are contemplating being a DBA , or are currently a DBA then these are the kinds of tasks you might expect or should be performing .
Configurations
Tasks :
SQL Server Machine Configuration
DBAs should configure the physical machine for each new SQL Server installation .
The DBAs will work with application staff to identify fault tolerance and performance requirements .
These requirements will be used to develop the physical setup requirements .
In some environments , the DBA will perform the actual installation of hardware and installing the operation system .
In other environments , they might just provide information to the systems administration staff in how to configure the hardware associated with a SQL Server machine .
Installing SQL Server Instances
The DBA will be responsible for installing SQL Server software and additional instances on a SQL server machine .
DBAs should consider how each installation should be setup .
When you have multiple instances and machines , you should consider building a scriptable installation so all installations are consistence across all instances .
This consistency will help minimize the maintenance aspects of managing all your instances
Tasks Related Database Standards :
Develop Databases Standards
In order to maintain consistency across an organization the DBA should develop database standards .
The DBA is responsible for developing and communicating these standards across the organization .
Standards should not be developed in a vacuum , so the DBA should facilitate database standard discussions with application developers in an organization .
Standards are an evolving process , once developed they need to be maintained .
The DBA should ensure that as new releases of application technology and database versions come out that the standards are reviewed and modified appropriately to meet the needs of the ever changing environment of information technology .
Review Database Designs for Standard Compliance
Once standards are in place a DBA needs to make sure each new database , or enhanced database is reviewed to make sure it meets the database standards .
If databases dont meet the standards then the DBA should play the traffic cop role , and make sure a database either meets the standards , or some form of exception process is performed to document why a particular database does not meet the standards .
Database Design Tasks :
Data Model Review
Data models are typically one of the first steps in designing a new database .
The DBA should review these models .
This review process will acquaint the DBA with the data that will be contained in the database .
This review process stimulates discussion about how the data in the database will be processed and loaded .
This information will be helpful with architectural decisions on how the data will be stored , read , shared and managed .
This review will help ensure data is appropriately integrated into the enterprise database environment .
Physical Database Design
In some environments DBAs will also be called upon to perform actual databases design .
In other environment applications , programmers / contractors will propose the design of a new database .
In either case , the person developing the database will need to meet with the business analysts to help define business data and processing requirements .
From this discussion , DBAs will develop or assist in the development of a physical database design .
The database design needs to meet the data requirements for inserting , update , deleting , and exporting data .
Database Security Design
This task looks at applications and how they authenticate to SQL Server to gain access to the data the application will be using .
Here the DBA would determine the most appropriate authentication method .
SQL Server has two different authentication methods : Windows Authentication and SQL Server authentication .
The DBA should work with the application developers and business analyst to determine what kind of users will be using the database , and where the applications will live .
The DBA needs to determine if Windows Groups can be used to simplify security and how SQL Server logins and database roles should be used to facilitate securing SQL Server data .
The DBA should consider developing an approach that simplifies managing security and provides the most flexible architecture for the long term .
Index Design
One of the key things each application needs to achieve is optimum performance .
The DBA will work with the developers / business analyst to determine how tables are joined , and queried .
From these discussions , appropriate indexes will be designed .
The DBA needs to help refine the index design decisions overtime .
They can do this by monitoring index usage and identifying missing indexes during the development lifecycle .
This ongoing monitoring will help ensure appropriate indexes have been designed to help maintain optimal query performance .
Backup / recovery planning
When databases are being designed and developed , the DBA needs to determine backup / recovery requirements as well as disaster recovery requirements .
From these requirements , the DBAs will need to design a backup and disaster recovery plan to meet the requirements .
Once the database is actually created and backups are being taken , the DBA should perform restore tests to ensure that the backup and recovery strategy is working .
Development Tasks :
Building Automated / Scheduled Database Load and Data Transfer Routines
Not all data in a database is entered into the database through data entry screens .
DBAs need to be well versed in methods of loading and extracting data from a database .
They need to be able to design and build automated processes that extract , load and transfer data .
Therefore , they need to understand how to use tools like SSIS , BCP , BULK INSERT , SQL AGENT jobs , FTP , etc .
Database Code Reviews
As applications are being built the DBAs should meet with application programmers to have code reviews .
These code reviews will help ensure code meets standards and use best practices .
Ideally , these code reviews should be performed early on in the development lifecycle to minimize the effort required to make any changes that the code review might identify .
Building and Managing Automated Data Extraction , Transformation , and Load Routines
The DBA can be called upon to build data extraction , transformation and load routines ( ETL ) .
To accomplish this , the DBA would work with business analyst to define business requirements for the ETL process .
From these requirements , SSIS packages , scripts and SQL Agent jobs would be built to run the required ETL process routinely .
Maintenance Tasks :
Implementing Database Changes
The DBA should implement a change management process for database code and schema changes .
This change management process would allow you to capture and track changes to stored procedures , views , trigger , table definitions , etc. over time .
Ideally , these changes would be implemented into a source code repository .
The change management process should consider not only how to implement changes but also how to back out changes should any change adversely affect stability of a database / application .
Routine Database Maintenance
The DBA needs to make sure all databases are being maintained and running optimally .
To ensure this the DBA will need to run routine maintenance tasks .
Here is a partial list of some of those tasks : reorg indexes , update statistics , defrag databases , and / or shrink databases .
Mentoring / Training
DBAs are typically the experts in querying data for a database .
DBA staff should provide training and mentoring as needed to junior DBAs and application programmers .
The goal of this task is to help staff gain the necessary skill set required to build efficient T - SQL code .
This training will ensure that programmers write code that performs well .
The DBA should also help ensure that secure coding practices are deployed so SQL Injection attacks are minimized .
The DBA should educate developers in how to ensure steps are taken to properly edit user entered data to minimize any possible SQL injection attacks .
Monitoring Tasks :
Performance Monitoring
DBAs should monitor the performance of the databases they manage .
This performance monitoring will encompass a number of different activities .
First monitoring should capture performance measurements ( statistics ) when applications are first introduced into the environment .
These statistics should then be used to develop a performance benchmark for an application .
Each time enhancements are made to an application the DBA should gather new statistics and compare the results against the baseline .
Any difference in the newly gathered performance statistics and the baseline statistics should be noted .
Secondly , the DBA should be keeping an eye on server wide performance related indicators such as memory usage , buffer cache , object locks , application connections , etc .
When something looks out of place this should trigger some analysis / investigation to determine what has caused these performance indicator changes .
Another type of performance monitoring task a DBA might take on would be to help out with an application performance audit .
This type of performance works would assess the performance status of an established application .
The DBA would use different tools to gather performance information .
This performance information is then reviewed by the DBA and application staff to suggest changes that will improve performance
Query Tuning and optimization
DBAs should be constantly looking for query tuning and optimization opportunities in the production environment .
When poorly performing queries are identified , the DBA should work with the application programmers to determine why a query is running slow .
This process would then develop strategies for improving the slow running queries .
Monitor Databases , Instances , and Database Servers for Availability
This task routinely monitors databases , instance and databases services to make sure applications can connect to them .
This task promotes the idea of a proactive monitoring method to ensure database services are available as needed .
Automated notification tools should be used to help the monitoring effort .
Hopefully by monitoring instance availability , a DBA can resolve any issues prior to them being noticed by database users .
Monitor Error and Event Logs
SQL Servers LOG directory and the Windows  Event log should be scanned routinely by the DBA for each SQL Server instance , and machine .
The goal of this monitoring activity is to identify abnormal error messages .
When abnormalities are found in any of the logs files then an investigation should be undertaken to determine why these events occurred .
All findings should be documented and communicated to the appropriate staff .
SQL Agent Job Failure Monitoring
At least once a day , and possibly more often , the DBAs should review SQL Agent jobs for failures .
The monitoring can be done manually or automatically .
All jobs failures should be investigated so the appropriate actions can be taken to resolve any failures found .
Planning Tasks :
Capacity Planning
This task identifies the amount of space needed for new databases and the growth rate for existing databases .
Capacity planning takes into account the amount of new data added daily , monthly and / or yearly to ensure there is enough disk space available to handle the growth rate of a database .
Grow rates are calculated by gathering disk space statistics periodically for existing databases , or best guess growth rates for new database .
Database Architecture Planning
The DBA needs to develop a database architecture for their environment .
This architecture needs to promote sharing and securing data , as well as connecting to databases .
One of the items of this effort is to make sure there are common , flexible , and supported ways to connect to SQL Server databases .
Another aspect of this architecture is to make sure you design a security model that supports your security requirements and is flexible enough to be adapted and maintain over time .
This item also ensures other management issues , such as backups , maintenance , and troubleshooting are all done using common tools and processes .
Using consistent processes helps minimize effort when managing multiple database servers and instances .
SQL Server Upgrade planning
Microsoft comes out with a new release of SQL Server every 3 years or so .
The DBAs need to consider this and then develop a plan for upgrading and / or installing new versions of SQL Server as they are released by Microsoft .
This planning effort will help identify the requirements and steps / approaches necessary to migrate from one version of SQL Server to another .
What Kind of DBA Are You ?
This list of tasks covers the spectrum of DBA Tasks .
Not all DBAs will perform all of these tasks .
If you are a developer / designer of databases you probably only perform a subset of these tasks .
If you are an operational DBA that covers installing , backing up and disaster recovery then you most likely perform a completely different set of tasks than developer / designer types .
If you work in a small organization then you might perform a lot of these , but may not have time to perform all of these tasks .

Galveston business owners worry the financial crisis will slow efforts to rebuild after Ike. CNN 's Ed Lavandera reports .
Ed Lavandera | BIO
CNN Correspondent
" It 's never a good time to ask for money . "
Those were the rather understated words of Jeff Sjostrom , the President of Galveston 's Economic Development Partnership ( Think of the partnership as the island 's Chamber of Commerce ) , when I asked him if he was worried that Texas officials were asking Congress for more than $ 11 - billion on the same day the $ 700 - billion bailout was being negotiated on Capitol Hill .
As hundreds of residents returned to Galveston Island to clean up it dawned on me that most of these residents have been so overwhelmed with the aftermath of Hurricane Ike that they 'd probably heard very little about the collapsing financial markets .
As I walked the downtown Galveston area known as " The Strand , " most small business owners had barely heard any of this news .
Who can blame them really ?
If you 're not sure your business will survive or your home is in ruins you probably do n't really care to read other depressing news .
But there is concern among the small business owners in The Strand that the struggling economy will slow down the rebuilding in Galveston .
" This is insult to injury here , " Garry Depringre , the owner of Surf Styles told me .
" We 're going to need some help .
We have to have help man .
I can't do this on my own . "
The downtown tourist businesses were hard hit .
Most stores took on 8 feet of floodwater .
Tourism makes up about a third of the island 's economy .
So it 's crucial for these tourists to come back soon .
But if economy is struggling will they return ?
Another area of concern is the wiped - out and pricey beach homes on the west side of Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula .
These are areas that make up about 45 % of the island 's tax base .
But there are several hundred homes that might not be rebuilt .
What kind of impact will that have on the island 's economy ?
But island officials , like Jeff Sjostrom , say they 're confident the economy will bounce back better than ever .
I guess after a double whammy strike like Hurricane Ike and a financial collapse it 's good to have people around who see the silver lining .

• CNN Special : Impact Your World
Somewhere between fifth and sixth gear in this roaring , turbo - charged Audi A5 , I realize I 'm not that excited about electric cars .
As an eco-conscious citizen , I should be a little ashamed of my attachment to pistons and gears .
But in this test drive , I do n't have to be .
While the Audi I 'm test - driving is a regular production car , the fuel inside it is a new , ultra - potent kind of biofuel that has only a quarter of the per-gallon carbon footprint of petroleum - derived fuel .
Sure , that does n't sound that exciting compared to a zero-emission electric car — until you consider that this new fuel does n't require new car factories , new fueling infrastructure , or the turnover of our existing fleet of vehicles , all of which are expensive , massively polluting ventures .
Could it be that the greenest car on the market is already in your garage — it just needs a new kind of juice ?
The New Plant Fuel " Green diesel , " as it 's being called , is n't the first effort to use plants to power cars ; your gas tank probably has a blend of gas and plant - derived ethanol inside it right now .
But it 's hard to get excited about biofuels when they already have such a bad rep .
The use of corn and sugar in fuels has driven up the cost of food by a whopping 75 percent worldwide , according to a recent report by the World Bank .
And a Nobel - prize winning chemist has publicized his findings that biofuels made from nitrogen - thirsty plants ( like corn and canola ) actually produce a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions , because they release nitrous oxide during their production .
As if all that was n't bad enough , ethanol blends hurt your car 's fuel economy .
Not exactly the makings of a green energy panacea .
But high - performance green diesel and gas are n't like other biofuels ; they 're perfect substitutes for petroleum - derived fuels , except they 're made from plant matter like forest detritus , also known as cellulosic waste , or from algae .
Green fuels can also be refined on the exact same equipment that refines petroleum .
By contrast , traditional ethanol requires new equipment and uses edible plants like corn and sugar that need rich farmland to grow .
Also unlike traditional ethanol , green fuels can be also be used in gas tanks in 100 percent concentrations ; their cetane numbers , or combustion quality , are actually higher than those of petroleum fuel .
That means they could also be used to power jet airplanes , another prime polluter .
To boot , green fuels are also more stable and have a lower cloud point than other biofuels .
Regular ethanol breaks down over time when it sits in your tank , and turns viscous and sludgy in cold weather .
The secret to this high - performance green stuff is in the production .
The refinement of green diesel uses a process called catalytic hydroprocessing .
Put simply , cellulosic oils and greases are fed into a " diesel hydrotreater " with a small amount of petrodiesel , and hydrogen is forced into the mixture .
That starts a catalytic reaction , the product of which is a potent petroleum substitute .
What differentiates this process from tradition biofuel production is the infusion of hydrogen — it removes the dilutive oxygen that most biofuels contain , leaving only the combustible isoparaffins and paraffins , which are indistinguishable from the molecules in refined petroleum .
The only byproduct of the process is propane , which can be reintroduced into the production loop as a source of hydrogen .
But Will It Scale ?
When you crunch the numbers , the implications of usingthe most advanced of these feedstocks , algae oil , are tremendous .
Replacingjust 20 percent of America ' scurrent thirst for gasoline with current biofuels made from conventionalfeedstocks like soy or sugar would require a mass of farmland the size of California , Indiana , Nevada and Michigancombined — 260 million acres — devoted only to growing fuel .
That 's because plantslike soy make for a terribly low oil yield : about 100 gallons of oil per acre .
Compare that to algae , which can generate 3,500 gallons of oil per acre , andgreen diesel starts looking feasible on a large scale .
Plus , algae can grow wellin arid land , so it would n't take up valuable farmland in the Midwest .
Build a shallow , algae - growing pool of saltwater about the size of Rhode Island under the hot New Mexico sun and you could replace thatsame 20 percent of our gasoline demand .
The saline pools would n't use uppotable water and could perhaps double as cooling channels for nuclear powerplants .
Then there are the fringe benefits :
Because we couldgrow , harvest , and produce algae - based green fuels here in the US , there would be no expensive and pollutingtransportation from the Middle East , and noenergy - intensive drilling or prospecting .
That would mean production could comewith a 75 percent smaller carbon cost as compared to petro- fuel — not to mentionreduced reliance on OPEC .
Suddenly biofuels are looking like a hot prospectagain .
A Solution In Motion
No matter how fast and guilt - free this Audi feels , revolutions are n't guaranteed and they do n't happen overnight :
A lot of the technology that is required to scale up the production of green fuel is still in development , and green fuels in general need statutory mandates to attain popular use .
Oil is becoming increasingly difficult to find and extract , but it 's still much more profitable than developing alternate fuels .
Strong legislation and tax incentives are necessary to encourage investment in biofuels if they are to be produced widely and efficiently .
But there 's some big money behind green fuel so far : UOP , a division of energy company Honeywell , is one company researching the new fuel .
It 's one of the world 's largest petroleum research companies , with its technologies at work in the production of over 60 percent of the world 's gasoline .
Even though it 's currently entrenched in the oil industry — it 's one of the world 's largest petroleum research companies — UOP created an renewable energy unit dedicated to green fuels in 2006 .
UOP has already licensed green diesel technology to two European refiners , one of which , Eni S.p.A. , intends to have a plant operational in Livorno , Italy , by 2009 .
It is UOP 's research and development folks who 've lent me the Audi full of green diesel in the hopes of demonstrating that it is indeed possible to make a biofuel that results in lower emissions , lower carbon footprint , and lower cost — all while behaving like a wild explosive inside your engine .
According to UOP 's timeline , refiners will start out using conventional vegetable oils as raw materials , called " feedstocks " in fuel jargon .
Within three to five years , they hope to move to more sustainable and efficient feedstocks like forest waste , crop residuals , and municipal solid waste before transitioning finally to inedible plant oils like camelina , jatropha , and algae oil .
As the collection methods for these feedstocks improve , production will grow .
The production process of green diesel was developed ahead of green gasoline — which would be more useful in the US — but UOP is presently in licensing talks with several unnamed North American refiners , too .
Other big names like BP and ConocoPhilips are also investing in the conversion of cellulosic material to fuel , and venture capital firms are lining up to put money into research and development , according to Daniel Sperling , director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California , Davis , and the co-author of a forthcoming book about the future offuels , cars , and energy policy .
Sperling says Congress ' most recent biofuels mandate requires 36 billion gallons of non-petroleum fuel to be in our gas tanks by 2022 , 15 billion gallons of which must be advanced , non-ethanol biofuels like green diesel .
Not So Fast …
Despite the high hopes , there are still factors that could bring down biofuel 's resurgence .
" Algae looks promising , but the volumes of fuel we 'd need to produce are just huge , " says Sperling .
" None of these fuels are obvious winners yet , on a largescale .
They 'll all certainly be produced in the future , but it 's unclear just how successful they 'll be . "
That 's thanks to a laundry list of variables that could vitiate their progress : hitches in the collection of cellulosic material , trouble converting land to agricultural development , or ineffectual government support .
Dr. Jennifer Holmgren is the director of UOP's Renewable Energy and Chemicals division .
While she 's optimistic about the benefits of their green fuel technology , she concedes that our national energy demand is growing faster than any one solution .
" I do n't believe in a future without petroleum , honestly , " she says .
" The demand for fuel is just growing too fast .
I think we 'll need to make a transition to a point where our fuel is coming from other feedstocks in combination with petroleum . "
That means that despite the promise of biomass as a petroleum substitute , demand will require not simply petro - fuel or biofuel or electriccars , but all three .
So with green fuel on the three - to - five - year horizon , what will our transportation energy look like in a decade ?
" It will depend on where you live , " says Sperling .
Midwesterners , for example , might use more cellulosic waste - based green fuel because of their abundance of farm land , while Southwesterners use algae - based green fuel .
People in Texas will plug in electric vehicles to their wind - powered grid , while Northeasterners might rely on nuclear - generated electricity .
A multifaceted solution is n't as exciting as a silver - bullet concept car , but luckily it does n't have to be — it just needs to work .
At present , however , the stars seem to be aligning for green fuel , even if consumers are busy drooling over new fangled hybrids and EVs .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Mohammed Hussain got 3,000 gallons of gas delivered to his Chevron station in suburban Atlanta on Saturday .
By Sunday morning , all of the gas , priced at $ 4.39 per gallon for regular unleaded , was gone .
i Reporter Dustin Gatlin took this photo of a makeshift billboard at an Atlanta gas station .
" We 're dry .
We 've got no gas here , " Hussain , the station 's manager , said Monday morning .
He said he has " no idea " when the next shipment will come , even though he 's been in constant contact with the local terminal .
" It could be days , " he said .
" Obviously , we 're disappointed .
We 're being patient .
That 's all we can do . "
Across metro Atlanta , drivers in one of the nation 's largest commuter cities are running into the same thing : a lack of gas and no clear idea when the situation will get better .
State and industry officials say they 're working as fast as they can and are urging people not to panic .
Christina Wedge , a resident of the Atlanta suburb Decatur , said her tank was on empty Sunday .
When she went to fill up , she passed six stations closed down before finally finding one with gas for nearly $ 5 a gallon .
She got just enough to continue looking for a cheaper price .
Watch how hurricanes have wreaked havoc with gas in the South »
About a mile away , she found a station with long lines for gas around $ 4.29 .
" I waited 30 minutes to get gas , " she said .
" It does concern me .
I 'm actually frustrated that the prices are so high . "
Michael Lanfreschi , an iReporter from the suburb of Alpharetta , shared a similar story .
He said he left work around noon to fill up his tank " when I started noticing all of the gas stations were empty . "

" There was no gas to be found , then panic set in as I approached a gas station with a 40 - car line , " he said .
" This is causing complete chaos .
Why is this happening , and what actions are being taken to prevent this from happening again , and why did it happen in the first place ? "
According to AAA , Atlanta 's drivers are in for sticker shock when they do find a station with gasoline .
The average price in metro Atlanta , as of Monday , for a gallon of regular unleaded was $ 4.02 , nearly 30 cents higher than the national average of $ 3.74 .

The gas supply has taken a major hit as refineries in the Houston area try to get back up to full capacity in the wake of Hurricanes Ike and Gustav , state and industry officials say .
The Colonial Pipeline , which typically delivers 100 million gallons of gasoline , aviation fuel and other petroleum products throughout the southeastern United States , is not running at full capacity .
" Since the hurricanes both hit , we have been tapping the reserves of the stockpiles of the fuels that were made before the hurricanes hit , and we 've been delivering those , " said Steve Baker , a spokesman for the pipeline .
" That 's caused us to operate at a reduced rate , less than we 're capable of .
So that 's been part of the problem that we 've faced , and we 're trying to overcome . "
Further complicating matters is that metro Atlanta has more stringent environmental requirements than other areas , meaning gas from other cities can't be brought in because it does n't meet the city 's smog requirements .
The state is working with the state energy agency and the Environmental Protection Agency about getting a temporary waiver of that rule , said Bert Brantley , a spokesman for Gov. Sonny Perdue 's office .
" I do n't want anyone to think that 's a panacea , " he said .
But he added , " Anything that would help us get another truckload or two ... is going to help the situation . "
Brantley said the state has already lifted some regulations allowing for drivers to work more hours to get fuel from the main terminal to stations and for heavier trucks to be allowed to carry larger loads than normal .
The state is asking people who do n't need to fill up their tanks to wait until later before doing so .
" There 's somewhat of a shortage right now , but it certainly could get a lot worse if people were to panic and react in a way that would cause a run and drain what supply there is out there now , " Brantley said .
" That 's why we 're encouraging Georgians to conserve as much as possible . "
The state would not offer a timeframe on when the situation might return to normal .
Brantley , however , said the situation with Houston 's refineries is getting better every day .
Jim Tudor , the president of the Georgia Association of Convenience Stores , which represents about 2,600 stores , praised the state for lifting some of the restrictions to allow for quicker delivery of fuel .
" We are working as fast as possible to try to get as many stations refilled , " he said .
" Having said that , we 're still in catch - up mode . "
That brings little relief to consumers .
i Reporter Dustin Gatlin said he waited 45 minutes Sunday at an Atlanta QuikTrip before it shut down .
He then waited for well over an hour at a different station .
" Yesterday , we were in line for about two hours and they actually had people [ who worked for the gas station ] out there directing traffic because there were people jumping in line , and they actually had to get people out there to watch , " he said .

Motley Crue rocked the 1980s .
They played hard and partied harder .
Their lifestyle was a toxic mixture of drugs , alcohol , fast cars , and fast women .
Their reputation for drug abuse remains legendary — rivaling Ozzy Osbourne , the Grateful Dead , and even the Rolling Stones .
Anyone supporting drug legalization must reconcile their position with the existence of these coked - up hallucinating tattooed hooligans on motorcycles .
Most citizens fear legalization would lead to the rapid decline of Western Civilization : the youth would jump at drugs ; dope would be in every home and every vein ; morality would fly out the window , and life as we know it would collapse all around us .
With these " esteemed " gentlemen as examples , only the deranged could support drug legalization .
That is , until one examines the specifics more closely .
Sure enough , the Crue 's drug rampage led to countless arrests , innumerable divorces , overdoses , brawls , and even deaths .
The arrests were for the usual drunken idiocy , public intoxication , fights , and vandalism .
A few band members were charged with more heinous crimes : lead singer , Vince Neil was accused of vehicular manslaughter while driving under the influence of alcohol and an all - night cocaine binge .
My bet is that the accident had more to do with the Jack Daniels than the blow .
Lead Guitarist Nikki
Sixx spiraled so far down that he died from an overdose — only to be revived by an adrenaline shot to the heart .
Hours after arriving to the hospital , Mr. Sixx checked himself out , hitchhiked to his house , and once again shot heroin into his arm .
Drummer Tommy Lee had a string of divorces and faced jail time for hitting his wife Pamela Anderson .
His out - of - control antics left a trail of minor offenses and petty misdemeanors .
Almost three decades gone by , 80 million albums sold , and a couple of crashed Ferraris later , Motley Crue is still alive today — sober and rocking .
The common wisdom would have had us predict the opposite : in the case of rock stars , budgets enabling gargantuan drug dependencies should lead to bigger problems not blissful recovery .
Something in this scenario differs from the regular drug mythology .
But consider the fact that Motley Crue 's story is hardly unique .
Almost every major rock band notorious for drug addiction eventually cleaned up .
This list includes countless names : Led Zeppelin , the Rolling Stones , Bon Jovi , Guns n' Roses , and many more .
Those rockers who abuse drugs for more than two decades are the exception , not the rule .
Expensive treatment centers can hardly be the single factor assisting recovery .
Breaking drug dependence comes from willpower .
All men are endowed with similar amounts .
Every benefit that money can bestow comes with an equal vice .
With enough money to pay for a high - end treatment center , a rock star will surely have enough money to continue their debilitating lifestyle upon exiting .
The entirety of Motley Crue 's career follows drug- legalization theory quite well .
Here , we have a set of gentlemen who have no monetary constraints to their drug use .
These rockers could afford mountains of cocaine , fields of dope , and vats of LSD to their hearts ' desires .
The relative monetary cost of drugs is next to nothing for them .
The crimes committed by the Crue were exactly the theory 's expectations .
There was an increase in minor nonviolent misdemeanors , domestic disturbances , bar fights with fellow drunkards , and intoxicated driving .
There were no muggings , break - ins , or gang shootings caused by the inability of the drug addicted to meet their financial ends .
The low drug prices would seem to increase addiction , not lead to postfame sobriety .
Something below the surface must be associated with this phenomenon .
De facto legal immunity is elemental to their recovery success .
Rock stars can afford legal protection to the extent unavailable to most citizens .
They live as if drugs were legal .
Arrests are an inconvenience , at most .
Vince Neil 's lawyers managed to defend the singer so well as to reduce his vehicular manslaughter sentence to 18 days in prison .
Tommy
Lee served a short sentence segregated from the other prison population for domestic violence .
Their lawyers had the ability to get them off on real crimes and could guarantee protection in drug cases .
In comparison , the average Joe has innumerable drug laws to worry about .
Most long - time drug users have the proverbial " rap sheet a mile long . "
Our hellhole prisons turn users into harsher criminals .
The psychological effects of imprisonment , prison violence , and prison rape warp the minds of users going through the system .
Prisons transform a bad habit into horrid degradation , completely ruining lives .
Without the permanent scars of the penal system , rock stars have a full life ahead of them after addiction .
A more common felon 's life is forever twisted ; his job opportunities halved by his conviction .
Drugs seem an understandable way to deal with this desperation and mental anguish from being locked up for years .
Time to build human capital and experience has permanently been stolen by the state .
Addiction spirals lives out of control .
It leads to worsening relationships , depression , and family problems .
Look to alcohol as an example .
Illegal substances begin the fall , but drug laws make the offenders unable ever to lift themselves back out of the gutter .
The system disables those with less willpower and vision to find a way out .
Many drug- legalization critics claim that use would skyrocket after legalization .
After all , supply and demand suggests drastically lower prices will lead to extravagant levels of new users .
These critics do not fully account all costs associated with drugs .
Legalization would only remove monetary and legal problems .
Every other nonmonetary problem would still exist .
Take a look at Motley Crue again .
Despite achieving affordability and legal immunity , the band still decided to stop pursuing this dead - end lifestyle .
Drugs cause an assortment of interpersonal issues from health problems to broken friendships and wrecked families .
Even if drugs were free , the personal cost of doing drugs would always be high .
Even without legal consequences or the high prices , drug use of Motley Crue 's caliber would still be rare and an extreme case .
An important aspect differentiating rock - star usage and common - consumer usage would be , under legalization as it is now , the significance of vocation : a rock star plays a two - hour show every few days , maybe accompanied with a press interview here or there .
In between , the bands travel with little responsibility or concern .
This breeds an environment prone for drug use .
As the old saying goes , " idle hands are the devil 's workshop . "
Even when performing , sobriety is not always a prerequisite .
In fact , the show might be a little better depending on the level of intoxication .
There 's nothing specific about rock n' roll that leads to drugs .
If accountants worked for only two hours every few days at the same pay , one could guarantee a drastic jump in their drug and alcohol abuse .
Most of us have 9 - to - 5 jobs and can't afford to do drugs because of our responsibilities .
How many readers have the time to smoke crystal meth this weekend and stay awake for 36 hours ?
Close to none ( except for college students ) .
It is not an accident that college students , with plenty of time on their hands , have a reputation for heavy drinking and drug use .
Students do n't mysteriously mature from age 22 to 23 and stop drinking .
They get jobs , which increases their time cost of drugs and alcohol and leads to lower usage .
Other groups associated with high rates of drug abuse have a similar profile : lots of time and few responsibilities .
The poor collectively consume large amounts of drugs , especially in the service industry .
Doing drugs did n't necessarily make them poor .
The impoverished have far lower nonmonetary costs for using drugs .
What are a welfare recipient 's opportunity costs for doing drugs ?
Ask the same question about having 36 hours to smoke crystal meth this weekend .
Welfare recipients have plenty of time to smoke any drugs that they please .
The cost of smoking meth is lower for an impoverished welfare recipient than it is for a Wall Street hedge - fund manager .
As Bob Dylan once sang , " When you got nothing , you got nothing to lose . "
Low - paying jobs have similar low costs for drug usage .
If a waiter loses a job , he can grab another in a few days .
Resumes are often unnecessary , as are drug tests .
Past employers are seldom contacted .
If a waiter does drugs on the job , starts showing up late to work , starts slacking , another job is just around the corner .
For an accountant , losing a job could result in months of unemployment .
There is lower turnover in the industry ; resumes will be closely examined ; former employers will be contacted .
Our unfortunate drug - using accountant would be lucky to ever find a job approaching his former stature .
His years of college and experience can burn up in flames quickly .
The costs are extremely high for drug use .
Legal or not these costs remain the same .
With legalization , prices will be so low as to allow beggars to get their fix just like the homeless do now with $ 6 bottles of vodka .
This will discourage the impoverished from stealing , robbing , or killing for drugs .
But the price should have little effect on the consumption decisions of the majority of the population .
Admittedly , some drug use may skyrocket , particularly marijuana .
Pot is already the most - used illegal drug out there .
Smoking weed has the lowest time cost of all the drugs .
In fact , the time cost is lower than alcohol .
An individual can smoke a joint and be sober in an hour .
I 've yet to see the drunk who can do the same .
Further , one cannot binge for days on marijuana as is possible with crack cocaine and other substances with low durations .
The effects of marijuana use are uncertain — perhaps even greatly positive if people stop drinking alcohol in preference to pot .
Without the legal system ruining the lives of nonviolent drug users , there will be a light at the end of the dark tunnel known as drug addiction .
Not all problems will disappear .
Drugs will continue to wreck lives , just as alcohol dependency has been doing for centuries .
But one day , hopefully , drug addiction will be treated by doctors , friends , family , and church — not prison bars and an aggressive police state .
Drug addicts will be allowed to peacefully readjust to society , becoming productive members without the scars of the penal system .
They will have a chance to recover and to rock on , just like Motley Crue .
For a while , it was a standard - issue Al Gore jeremiad , with calls for everything from installing solar panels in Darfur ( seriously ) to legal action against " the carbon lobby " for denying global warming ( ditto ) .
But then Mr. Gore really got going and told his disciples to head -- literally -- to the barricades to " stop " coal .
Speaking last Wednesday on a celebrity panel in New York , the Nobel Prize Laureate proclaimed : " If you 're a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being done right now , and not done , I believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration . "
He added , " clean coal does not exist . "
Mr. Gore did n't explain how far he thinks his young acolytes should go in their rage against the coal - burning machines that provide about 50 % of U.S. electricity .
Sit-ins ?
Marches against power plants ?
How about trashing power lines :
What could he mean by " civil disobedience " ?
As it happens , Mr. Gore 's brand of anticoal radicalism is quickly becoming the liberal consensus .
The greens loathe coal because of greenhouse gases -- and have succeeded in making new coal plants nearly impossible to build .
More than 60 have been canceled in the last year alone .
Democratic Governor Kathleen Sebelius is waging a high - profile campaign against new coal plants in Kansas , and only last week Joe Biden seemed to endorse a coal ban .
Perhaps James Hansen has also paid Mr. Gore a visit at Walden Pond .
The NASA scientist and influential global warming swami recently testified on behalf of the " Kingsnorth Six , " Greenpeace activists who caused £ 30,000 of criminal damage at an English coal utility while attempting to shut it down .
Mr. Hansen argued they had a " lawful excuse " because of the imminence of climate doom ; they were acquitted .
Coming from figures who hold the public trust , such rhetoric is wildly irresponsible , not least for the fanaticism and even violence it could incite .

For the last few years , vendors have been trying to convince us that computers will become our digital media hubs and we 'll extend that experience to our living room TVs .
Microsoft 's Windows Media Center and its " ten-foot experience " is perhaps the best - known example of this idea .
The recent explosion of readily available online media is starting to at least prove the part about the PC being the media hub true ; but transferring the computer interface to the living room TV has proven to be rather stubbornly stagnant .
So why not instead move the living room TV experience to the computer ?
That is exactly what Nero is doing with its new LiquidTV | TiVo PC package -- which brings the TiVo experience to Windows ( XP and Vista ) computers .
Liquid TV does n't just bring a TiVo - like experience to your computer ; it offers the actual TiVo service on your PC - - through a partnership between Nero and TiVo .
The LiquidTV package includes a ( USB - based ) high Definition ATSC digital / analog TV tuner , antenna , remote control , IR blaster , the Nero LiquidTV software , and a 12 - month subscription to the TiVo service , for $ 199.99 ( U.S. ) .
If you already have a compatible TV tuner , you can purchase the software and one - year TiVo subscription without the hardware for $ 99.99 .
LiquidTV is by no means the first or only TV tuner package available for PCs , but it marks the first time that the very popular TiVo service is directly available on computers .
This means that features such as the intuitive TiVo interface , TiVo KidZone , Season Pass , and WishList are now available on your Windows PC .
Other DVR features include pausing live TV and time shifting .
With an additional tuner , you can even record two shows simultaneously .
And as long you leave your computer on and connected to the Internet , you can even schedule recordings remotely from any Internet connection .
Note that high - definition shows can only be watched or recorded from over - the - air ATSC digital broadcasts .
While the included IR blaster allows you to control a satellite or digital cable set - top box , the video signal is passed to the LiquidTV TV tuner via S - Video , which only supports standard definition video .
Also note that high - definition recordings take up a lot more hard disk space than standard definition recordings -- but how much video your can record is only limited by how much free hard disk space you have .
Nero estimates that you 'll need about 8GB for each hour of high - definition video recorded .
LiquidTV also lets you burn your TV recordings to DVD , which can be played back on any regular DVD player .
You can also transfer the video recording files to be viewed on other computers , or export them for viewing on iPods , PSPs , " or other mobile devices . "
LiquidTV will be available " approximately mid October 2008 . "
Check back with us in a few weeks for a review of Nero LiquidTV / TiVo PC .
The International Olympic Committee has trademarked a line from the Canadian national anthem , " with glowing hearts , " and is threatening to sue anyone who uses the line in Canada , as part of the Vancouver Games .
This is par for the course .
The IOC is a corrupt , bullying , greedy , hypocritical organization that uses trademark laws to limit the free speech and commerce of people who have the misfortune to attend or live near the games — for example , in Athens , they forced people to take off or cover up t- shirts that had logos for companies that had n't paid to sponsor the Olympics ; and in Washington , they attacked decades - old businesses named after nearby Mount Olympia .
The Olympics cloak themselves in the rhetoric of international cooperation and development , but everything they touch turns to garbage : totalitarian surveillance camps where corporate greed rules all .
The Canadian IOC ought to be disbanded over this — it's an affront to the entire nation .
Parliament should undo its special legislation that allowed the IOC to assert trademarks over words like " Winter " as well — our language is not property , it is freely usable by all of us .
. VANOC would only challenge the commercial use of the mottoes if a business began using them to create a specific , unauthorized commercial association with the 2010 Winter Games , said the statement .
O Canada is over 100 years old and , according to the Department of Canadian Heritage , is in the public domain so may be used without permission from the government .
The committee is so serious about protecting the Olympic brand it managed to get a landmark piece of legislation passed in the House of Commons last year that made using certain phrases related to the Games a violation of law .
The list includes the number 2010 and the word " winter , " phrases that normally could n't be trademarked because they are so general .
Olympic mottoes borrow lines from O Canada
( Thanks , Dan ! )
Holly Williams is active on MySpace , Facebook , LinkedIn , and Flickr .
She Tweets her Twitter followers on the hour .
While Holly is certain she joined the various networks for good reasons , she ca n’t remember what those were .
She now spends up to four hours a day updating profiles and keeping up to date with friends and friends of friends .
“ It is so overwhelming staying connected to so many people , ” Williams said .
That ’s why she joined the latest addition to her toolbar – IntroVert .
The new social networking site is aimed at introverts and those who would benefit from cultivating the intro lifestyle .
Intro-virgins are encouraged to adopt a plain - faced animated avatar with no smile or frown .
The cumbersome and time - consuming process of adding friends was intentionaly designed to discourage the accumulation of many friends .
Verteran intros progress through a series of anti-social status from Wallflower to Cavedweller .
IntroVert expects a strong revenue stream from advertising home - delivery companies like Netflix and Amazon .
“ We want people to know it ’s okay to stay inside and not interact with anyone , even virtually , ” said an IntroVert spokesman .
As for Holly , she ’s trying , but old habits are hard to break .
“ I ’m still working on my ‘ shy ’ profile .
I just wish there was a way to import all my contacts into IntroVert . ”

Twitter suffered an unplanned outage this afternoon .
Not on the scale of the troubles Twitter has suffered during much of this year – things are definitely getting better – but an outage all the same .
What ’s a Twitterer to do at times like this ?
Quite a few people blog about it .
Others head to Pownce or Plurk , even Jaiku .
A growing number focus on Friendfeed and the relative newcomer Identi.ca .
Everyone always comes back to Twitter as soon as it ’s back up , including me .
But I wonder how long the coming back will last .
When today ’s Twitter outage happened , I headed over to Identi.ca .
I signed up to Identi.ca at the beginning of this month but I ’ve not really used it much .
I use Twitter , I like Twitter , everyone I know is on Twitter .
Many of those in my Twitter social network also use other services especially Friendfeed .
Yet we always come back to Twitter .
Today , though , there was something a bit different .
I do n’t really know what it was but I kind of got into discovering Identi.ca .
What prompted my discovery mode was Twhirl , the third - party application with which you can interact with everyone in your networks in Twitter , seesmic , Friendfeed and Identi.ca ( and who knows what else soon ) .
Twhirl makes it easy to carry on a dialogue in any of these services where how you interact with each one is broadly the same .
So I had some spontaneous chats with a number of my Identi.ca friends , all of whom I ’m also connected with on Twitter .
Some of them were there also because of the Twitter outage .
And it was a pleasant time !
As Sarah Perez noted :
Similar thinking :
Maybe it ’s a lot to do with the fact that my group on Identi.ca is relatively small compared to Twitter ( their groups tend to be relatively small as well ) .
And I ’ve deliberately not connected with literally anyone as I have tended to on Twitter .
Do n’t misunderstand me – I love the cut and thrust interactions on Twitter with lots of people : the firehose , as it were .
But today , it was just nice to be out of that firehose for a while .
I do n’t for a minute think that you ’re going to see a sudden large - scale migration away from Twitter to Identi.ca or anywhere else as a result of outages like today’s .
Apart from anything else , many people ( and organizations ) have a great deal invested in Twitter in terms of connections and time and energy in building up what they do there .
Yet I wonder if other Twitterers who enjoyed the type of singular experience I did today at Identi.ca will want to spend more time there or at another service – alongside Twitter , to be sure – until a tipping point of some kind happens .
I do n’t think we can doubt that a tipping point will happen .
What will it look like ?
It will be something that tips a large number of people over and towards one particular service .
That service will then dominate as everyone else joins in , largely deserting other services .
It could be Twitter , of course .
Nothing ’s a given .
Espen sez , " In a move leading me to suspect they have hired laid - off lawyers from RIAA , Endnote ( owned by Reuters ) has sued GMU and Dan Cohen for the latest version of Zotero ( a Firefox plugin that lets you save , annotate and academically reference articles you find online ) .
This is an amazingly stupid market move :
Suing an academic for making software for other academics because the software allows you to convert styles ( which in turn were freely contributed by other academics ) – when your main market is academics . "
For my part , I 'm going to refuse to use Reuters ' software in future , strongly discourage graduate students from buying EndNote , and try to get this message out to my colleagues too ( at least those of them who are n't using Zotero or some BibTex client already ) .
If I taught any classes where Thomson printed relevant textbooks , I would be strongly inclined not to use these texts either .
I encourage you to do the same ( and , if you 're so minded , to suggest other possible ways of making it clear to Reuters that this kind of behaviour is intolerable in the comments ) .
People have argued that the music industry has screwed up badly by suing its customers – whether that 's true or not , makers of academic bibliography software should be told that suing universities for what appear to be entirely legitimate actions is not likely to do their reputations any good .

Thin - film solar maker Nanosolar was already one of the more well - funded startups in cleantech with at least $ 150 million behind it .
But this morning Nanosolar ’s CEO Martin Roscheisen writes on the company blog that Nanosolar has raised $ 300 million in an oversubscribed equity financing round , which closed in March , that brings its total to just under half a billion dollars .
That could make it one of the most well - funded startups .
Period .
Roscheisen says the funding comes from power company AES , the Carlyle Group , French utility EDF and Energy Capital Partners , which made investments through Riverstone Holdings , and EDF Renewables ; the funding occurred at the same time as AES and Riverstone formed AES Solar , and the funding was part of the business case for forming the joint venture , Roscheisen explains .
A smaller part of the round came from Lone Pine Capital , the Skoll Foundation , Pierre Omidyar ’s fund , GLG Partners , Beck Energy , and Grazia Equity .
Roscheisen says the funding will go toward ramping up production of the 430 MW San Jose plant and the 620 MW Berlin factory .
Nanosolar has been producing its thin - film solar product for utilities since December .
But given we ’ve seen a few U.S. utilities sign solar power contracts that included thin film solar — PG&E with OptiSolar and Southern California Edison with First Solar — we asked Roscheisen if Nanosolar has been bidding on solar power projects in the United States .
Rocheisen tells us that yes , Nanosolar is involved in U.S. utility solar bids through the AES partnership .
Any believer in American democracy is obliged to come to terms with a wing of the citizenry few secular humanists have the wherewithal to think about — Christians .
Not mainline modernists , so useful for validating progressive pieties when we godless need moral ballast , but the 75 million Americans whose Christianity takes such modifiers as the respectable evangelical , the unapologetic fundamentalist , the doctrinal Bible - believing , the thoughtful convinced and the emotional born - again .
Especially the white ones , of course — even black churches that oppose abortion and homosexuality are aligned with the social gospel , while Latino Pentecostals and Korean Presbyterians generally gather in their own congregations .
Anyway , secular humanists are inclined to cut African - Americans and immigrants some slack .
White Middle Americans they have a problem with .
These generalizations are crude , obviously .
For one thing , there are plenty of secular humanists in Middle America , where proximity mitigates incomprehension a little .
But in New York , my eternal home , folks are less sophisticated .
As someone whose atheism proceeds directly from his demographically unlikely childhood in a fundamentalist church in Queens , and whose brother has spent his life ministering to conservative churches in various distant suburbs , I got on this problem back when my colleagues at The Village Voice dismissed Jimmy Carter out of hand because he was a Southern Baptist .
I argued back then that the specifics of Carter ’s religious history suggested levels of honesty and compassion unusual in a politician , which turned out to be true — in 2000 , Carter quit the by then explicitly right - wing Southern Baptist Convention after a fruitless struggle to moderate it .
Other politically prominent Southern Baptists include Pat Robertson , who founded the Christian Broadcasting Network in 1960 , and Jerry Falwell , who founded the Moral Majority in 1979 .
They do not include famed born - againer George W. Bush — or the most devout Christian currently running for president , Barack Obama .
Generalizations are often crude .
The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power By Jeff Sharlet Harper , 464 pages
Jeff Sharlet’s
“ The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power ” examines a group of politically engaged Christians far more secretive than Robertson or Falwell .
Sharlet establishes that since the end of World War II , The Family , aka The Fellowship , has exerted its influence in an impressive and frightening array of mostly dire events .
Its first coup was the wholesale exoneration of minor Nazis and major Nazi collaborators after the war .
The addition of under God to the Pledge of Allegiance and In God We Trust to U.S. currency were its initiatives .
Its first major government operative was Sen. Frank Carlson , R - Kan. , who persuaded Dwight Eisenhower to run as a Republican , purged progressive bureaucrats from his chair at the obscure Civil Service Employees Committee and lobbied for such heads of state as Haiti ’s “ Papa Doc ” Duvalier .
Other dictators abetted by The Family included Ngo Dinh Diem of Vietnam , Haile Selassie of Ethiopia , Park Chung Hee of South Korea , Artur da Costa e Silva of Brazil , Gen. Suharto of Indonesia , Mohamed Siad Barre of Somalia and Carlos Eugenios Vides Casanova of El Salvador , which got its first infusion of special aid at the behest of Jimmy Carter , who has called Family leader Doug Coe a “ very important person ” in his life .
Hillary Clinton has also been a Family “ friend , ” and not just via its major public manifestation , the relatively anodyne annual National Prayer Breakfast .
The Family was instrumental in the creation of Chuck Colson ’s Prison Fellowship , and of the Community Bible Study project through which George W. Bush found Jesus in 1985 .
Deeply researched yet fast paced , moving easily from first person to third person and incident to overview , “ The Family ” is an exceptional piece of bookcraft .
Its revelations are fascinating , especially with political history having propelled Christians deep into polite discourse since 1976 .
Yet since it came out in May , it has attracted just two major reviews , both censorious ; I found out about it only when I was asked to share a panel with Sharlet in June .
You could say this reflects the dismal state of book coverage in a journalistic environment where new arts cutbacks come down from on high every month .
But when I try to imagine how an unbroken phalanx of individual literary editors decided not to squeeze this book into their pathetic page allotments , I keep remembering how exotic my Village Voice co-workers found my hunch that Carter was a smart , sensible , decent guy .
Secular humanists know more about Christians now , but not that much more .
And “ The Family ” does n’t fit their template .
Sharlet is a 36 - year - old historian and journalist of religion , the son of a Jewish father and a Pentecostal mother .
He ’s a contributing editor at Harper ’s and Rolling Stone and has founded two online journals of religion : the NYU - backed The Revealer and Killing the Buddha , which is also the title of his first book , written with co-editor Peter Manseau .
While clearly a left - leaning skeptic , Sharlet is just as clearly drawn to spiritual quests .
“ Killing the Buddha ” alternates between heretical interpretations of Bible chapters — by such guests as Francine Prose ( Exodus ) and Rick Moody ( Jonah ) , though most are less prominent and several outshine the stars — and sojourns with cultists nationwide , more than half Christian .
These tales are both more empathetic than the standard yahoo - bashing expos and less polite than the pained coverage of evangelical activists that has become a journalistic staple since Karl Rove transformed churchgoers into margins of victory .
Sharlet and Manseau feel the pain of almost everyone they write about , but that does n’t blind them to the foolishness of these suffering seekers and penny - ante ideologues , which they ’re not above mocking when the joke is good enough .
The world of “ The Family ” is much different .
For its first three quarters , the individuals Sharlet observes and interviews come from more money and wield more power than those who populate “ Killing the Buddha . ”
Yet you wo n’t meet the usual cast of hucksters and theocrats — James Dobson , Tony Perkins , John Hagee , Rick Warren , Tim LaHaye , whoever .
A few politicians pass through , notably Sam Brownback , but for the most part you ’ve never heard of these rather colorless people , every one of whom Sharlet engages on a human level .
This failure to flatter stereotype could n’t have helped Sharlet get reviewed and typifies his insight into American Christianity , which subdivides endlessly .
The most important such grouping , argues Gallup - pollster - turned - Rice - University - sociologist D. Michael Lindsay in “ Faith in the Halls of Power ” ( a well - researched — and widely reviewed — 2007 overview of American evangelicals whose “ sympathetic perspective ” Sharlet notes with some asperity ) , pits populists against cosmopolitans .
The populists have become familiar figures in secular humanist folklore .
The Family — which is neither an official organization nor a coherent
conspiracy — enlists only cosmopolitans .
Among
The Family ’s members is none other than Jeff Sharlet , who in 2002 was invited by an acquaintance to spend a month at Ivanwald , a Family training facility in Arlington , Va. , along with a shifting cast of some dozen young men .
All of them tended the house and grounds , served occasional meals at a nearby Family mansion , played ball and horsed around , joined a female auxiliary at weekly swing dances and attended meetings where they learned what it meant to serve Jesus .
Everyone knew Sharlet was a half - Jewish journalist who might write about them .
After a draft of the first chapter of “ The Family ” was published in Harper ’s in 2003 , he was sussed out by Family associates overt and covert ( including a sexy blonde ) , and in the end The Family archive in Wheaton , Ill. , where he did extensive digging , was closed to the public .
But Sharlet ’s social relations with his Family contacts remain cordial .
Why not ?
He ’s a smart guy with a future .
Someday he might prove useful .
This is how The Family operates , and quite often it goes over people ’s heads , as it is meant to .
Take U.S. News & World Report ’s religion specialist , Jay Tolson , whose faint - praise debunk indignantly disproves that political fundamentalists “ take … their marching orders from The Fellowship . ”
Problem is , Sharlet never suggests such a thing .
No wonder they call themselves The Family and The Fellowship — uppercase removed , those are the relevant models .
The Family makes connections and encourages behavior based on bonds of friendship , faith and shared experience .
It ’s networking for Christ , theocracy as hegemony .
Sharlet ’s research proves ( as even Tolson acknowledges ) that all the dictators named above received crucial support from the organization begun in Seattle in 1935 — with seed money from a local developer — by Norwegian - born clergyman and Goodwill Industries middle executive Abram Vereide .
But as with the State Department , some of its projects are benign — orphanages , hospitals , even peace accords .
And always the dirtiest details are left to Family - linked power brokers — carefully nurtured local “ key men ” — in the belief that , ultimately , Christ thrives in a stable capitalist order .
The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power By Jeff Sharlet Harper , 464 pages
Doug Coe , Vereide ’s successor for nearly half a century now , has some provocative ideas .
He likes to cite the Mafia , Hitler - Goebbels - Himmler and Communist Party cells as examples of the strong faith of a few changing the world — “ enemies ” who put Christ ’s teachings into practice .
Sharlet pinpoints one of Coe ’s favorite slogans as especially fraught : “ Jesus plus nothing . ”
You could say this mantra aspires toward Godhead .
But in a world of many Jesuses — “ Killing the Buddha ” touches upon at least a dozen — it can also be seen as undercutting Jesus ’ reality .
Is Jesus still Jesus without his life example , his teachings , his scripture , his churches that Coe says have no biblical basis ?
( The Bible , Coe claims , speaks only of that manly abstraction , the Body of Christ . )
For Sharlet , Jesus plus zero equals power for its own sake , an abstraction with disastrously concrete consequences .
Family members are inculcated with the principle of loyalty — “ Loyalty to what ?
The idea of loyalty . ”
Part of him clearly feels that Coe and his enablers are monsters .
But he also conveys that at some level the guys he meets are nice , normal , well - meaning .
If Doug Coe is a little strange , he knows how to stay quiet about it .
A Family of monsters would n’t function .
For nearly 300 pages , including some of the best background on seminal evangelists Jonathan Edwards and Charles Grandison Finney I ’ve ever read , Sharlet says to hell with stereotype and traces this shadowy seam of Christianity .
I so admired his formal austerity that at first I was disappointed when he switched up , devoting the book ’s final quarter to reporting on more familiar fundamentalist types — home - schoolers , abstinence activists , life - tossed devotees of a prelapsarian Ted Haggard , even some Oregon progressives .
But there ’s no resisting Sharlet ’s empathy , which must have been sorely tested by his several seasons among the evangelical elite — whether they ’re as nutty as the Colorado Springs insurance agent who fears demons in every urban place or as sharp as the virgin grade - school teacher from Brooklyn who ’ll probably have a ball in bed once he gets married , you can see why these people need Jesus in their lives and hope their spiritual struggles wo n’t ever ease to a complacent halt .
Tying these populist endeavors to The Family is a knotty undertaking , and Sharlet does n’t quite put a bow on it .
But though the most fluent stylists are rarely as lucid essaying exegesis as writing narrative or history , Sharlet ’s many philosophical passages go down much better than most .
Here he closes with a few progressives , believers who work mostly in the helping professions salving their pain over the shooting of a mentor by renewing their belief in “ absolute Truth . ”
Then he visits David Kuo , Bush ’s Coe-trained “ faith - based initiatives ” expert , who later wrote a much - praised book exposing how crassly political his supposedly charitable office was .
Sharlet , whose research has left him rather pessimistic about combating hegemony , suspects Kuo has n’t really changed his spots — sure , Jimmy Carter and Hillary Clinton are preferable to George W. Bush and Sam Brownback , but in the end , as The Family understands , all serve the same order .
Sharlet proffers one shred of hope — “ believers and unbelievers alike , all of us who love our neighbors more than we love power or empire or even the solace of certainty . ”
Secular humanists can scoff if they like , but I ’m here to testify that Sharlet is both more intelligent and better informed than most of them .
If he believes that “ believers and unbelievers alike ” fall into this sainted host , I believe him .

On Persistence , Still Not Happy
Persistence is hard and something you need to deal with in every app .
I 've written about what 's available in Squeak , written about simpler image - based solutions for really small systems where just dumping out to one file is sufficient ; however , nothing I 've used so far has satisfied me completely for various reasons , so before I get to the point of this post , let me do a quick review of my current thoughts on the matter .
Relational Databases
Tired of em , I do n't care how much they have to offer me in the areas of declarative indexing and queries , transactions , triggers , stored procedures , views , or any of the handful of things they offer that I do n't really want from them .
The price they make me pay in programming just is n't worth it for small systems .
I do n't want my business logic in the database .
I do n't want to use a big mess of tables to model all my data as a handful of global variables , aka tables , that multiple applications share and modify freely .
What I do want from them , transactional persistence of my object model , they absolutely suck at and all attempts to shoehorn an object model into a relational database ends up being an exercise in frustration , compromise , and cussing .
I think using a database as an integration point between multiple applications is a terrible idea that just leads to a bunch of fragile applications and a data model you can't change for fear of breaking them .
Enough said , on to more object - oriented approaches !
Active Record
Ruby on Rails has brought the ActiveRecord pattern mainstream , which was as far as I know , first popularized in Martin Fowler 's book Patterns Of Enterprise Application Architecture which largely dealt with all the various known methods of mapping objects to databases .
Initially , I was n't a fan of the pattern and preferred the more complex domain model with a metadata mapping , but having written an object - relational mapper at a previous gig , used several open - source ones , as well as tried out several pure object databases , I 've come to appreciate the simplicity and explicitness of its simple API .
If you have to work with a relational database , this is a fairly good compromise for doing so .
You can't bind a real object model to a relational database cleanly without massive effort , so do n't try , just revel in the fact that you 're editing rows rather than trying to hide it .
It works reasonably well , and it 's easy to get other team members to use it because it 's simple .
" Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication " -- Leonardo Da Vinci
Other Approaches
A total OO purist , or a young one still enamored with patternitis , would n't want objects to save themselves as an ActiveRecord does .
You can see this in the design of most object - oriented databases available , it 's considered a sin to make you inherit from a class to obtain persistence .
I used to be one of those guys too , but I 've changed my mind in favor of pragmatism .
The typical usage pattern is to create a connection to the OODB server which basically presents itself to you as a persistent dictionary of some sort where you put objects into it and then " commit " any unsaved changes .
They will save any object and leave it up to you what your object should look like , intruding as little as possible on your domain , so they say .
Behind the scenes there 's some voodoo going on where this persistent dictionary tries to figure out what 's actually been changed either by having installed some sort of write barrier that marks objects dirty automatically when they get changed , comparing your objects to a cached copy created when they were originally read , or sometimes even explicitly forcing the programmer to manually mark the object dirty .
The point of all of this complexity of course , is to minimize writes to the disk to reduce IO and keep things snappy .
Simplicity Matters
What seems to be overlooked in this approach is the amount of accidental complexity that is imposed upon the programmer .
If I have to open a connection to get a persistent dictionary to work with , I now have to store this configuration information , manage the creation of this connection , possibly pool it if it's an expensive resource , and decide where to hang this dictionary so I can have access to it from within my application .
This is usually some sort of current session object I can always reach such as a WASession subclass in Seaside .
Now , this all actually seems pretty normal , but should it be ?
I 'm not saying this is wrong , but one has to be aware of the trade - offs made for any particular API or style .
At some point , you have to wonder if we 're not suffering from some form of technical Stockholm syndrome where we forget that all this complexity is killing us and we forget just how painful it really is because we 've grown accustomed to it .
Sit down and try explaining one of your programs that use some of this stuff to another programmer unfamiliar with your setup .
If you really pay attention , you 'll notice just how much of the explaining you 're doing has nothing to do with the actual problem you 're trying to solve .
Much of it is just accidental complexity for plumbing and scaffolding that crept in .
If you spend more time explaining the persistence framework than your program and the actual problem it 's solving , then maybe that 's a problem you 'll want to revisit sometime .
Do I really want to write code somewhat like ...
user := User firstName : ' Ramon ' lastName : ' Leon ' .
self session commit : [ self session users at : user id put : user ] .
with all the associated configuration setup and cognitive load of remembering what I called the accessor to get #users and how I 'm hashing the user for this or that class while remembering the semantics of what exactly is committed , or whether I forgot to mark something dirty , or would I rather do something more straight forward and simple like this ...
user := User firstName : ' Ramon ' lastName : ' Leon ' . user save .
And just assume the object knows how to persist itself and there 's no magic going on ?
If I say save I just know it commits to disk , whether there were any changes or not .
No setup , no configuration , no magic , just save the damn object already .
Contrary to popular belief , disk IO is not the bottleneck , my time is the bottleneck .
Computers are cheap , ram is cheap , disks are cheap , programmer 's time is usually by far the largest expense on any project .
Something simple that just works OK but solidly every time is far more useful to me than something complex that works really really well most of the time but still breaks in weird ways occasionally , forcing me to dig into someone else 's complex code for change detection or topological insertion sorting and blow a week of programmer time working on god damn plumbing .
I want to spend as much time as possible when programming working on my actual problem , not fighting with the persistence framework to get it to behave correctly or map my object correctly .
A Real Solution
Of course , GemStone is offering GLASS , a 4 gig persistent image that just magically solves all your problems .
That will be the preferred option for persistence when you really need to scale in the Seaside world , and I for one will be using it when necessary ; however , it does require a 64 bit server and introduces the small additional complexity of changing to an entirely different Smalltalk and learning its class library .
Definitely an option if you outgrow Squeak .
But will you ?
I 'll get into GemStone more in another post when I can get more into it and give it the attention it deserves , but my main point now is that there 's still a need for simple GemStone 'ish like persistence for Squeak .
Reality Check
Let 's be honest , most apps do n't need to scale .
Most apps in the real world are written to run small businesses , which DHH calls the fortune five million .
The simple fact is , in all likelihood scaling is not and probably wo n't ever be your problem .
We might like to think we 're writing the next YouTube or Twitter , but odds are we 're not .
You can make a career just replacing spreadsheets from hell with simple applications that make people lives easier without ever once hitting the limits of a single Squeak image ( such was the inspiration for Dabble Db ) , so do n't waste your time scaling .
You do n't have a scaling problem unless you have a scaling problem .
Even if you do have an app that needs to scale , it 'll probably need 2 or 3 back end supporting applications that do n't and it's a waste of time making them scale if they do n't need too .
If scaling ever becomes a problem , be happy , it 's a nice problem to have unless you 're doing something stupid like giving away all of your services for free and hoping you 'll figure out that little money thing later on .
Conventions Rule
Ruby on Rails has shown us that beyond making things easier with ActiveRecord , things often need to be made more structured and less configurable .
Configuration is a hidden complexity that Java has shown can kill any chance for any real productivity , sometimes having more configuration than actual code .
It 's amazing how much simpler programs can get if you just have the guts to make a few tough choices , decide how you want to do things , and always do it that way .
Ruby on Rails true contribution to the programming community was its convention over configuration philosophy , ActiveRecord itself was in use long before Rails .
Convention over configuration is really just a nice way of the framework writer saying " This is how it 's done and if you do n't like it , tough . "
The problem then of course becomes finding a framework with conventions you agree with , but it 's a big world , you 're probably a programmer if you 're reading this , so if you can't find something , write your own .
The only problem with other people 's frameworks is that they 're other people 's frameworks .
There 's nothing quite like living in a world of your own creation .
What I Wanted
I wanted something like ActiveRecord from Rails but not mapped to a relational database , that I could use with Seaside and Squeak for small applications .
I 've accepted that if I need to scale , I 'll use GemStone , this limits what I need from a persistence solution for Squeak .
For Squeak , I need a simple , fast , configuration free , crash - proof , easy to use object database that does n't require heavy thinking to use , optimize , or explain to others that allows me to build and iterate prototypes and small applications quickly without having to keep a schema in sync or stop to figure out why something is n't working , or why it 's too slow to be usable .
I do n't want any complex indexing schemes to be necessary , which means I want something like a prevalence system where all the objects are kept in memory all the time so everything is just automatically fast .
I basically just want my classes in Squeak to be persistent and crash - proof .
I do n't need a query language , I have the entire Smalltalk collections hierarchy at my disposal , and I sure as hell do n't need SQL .
I also do n't want a bunch of configuration .
If I want to find all the instances of a User in memory I can simply say ...
someUsers := User all Instances .
Without having to first go and configure what memory #allInstances will refer to because obviously I want #allInstances in the current image .
After all , is n't a persistent image what we 're really after to begin with ?
Do n't we just want our persistent objects to be available to us as if they were just always in memory and the image could never crash ?
Should n't our persistent API be nearly as simple ?
Since I 'm basically after a persistent image , I do n't need any configuration ; the image is my configuration .
It is my unit of deployment and I 've already got one per app / customer anyway .
I do n't currently , nor do I plan on running multiple customers out of a single image so I can simply assume that when I persist an instance , it will be stored automatically in some subdirectory in the directory my image itself is in , overridable of course , but with a suitable default .
If I want to host another instance of a particular database , I 'll put another image in a different directory and fire it up .
And now I 'm finally getting to the point ...
SandstoneDb
Since I could n't find anything that worked exactly the way I wanted , though Prevayler was pretty close , I just wrote my own .
It 's a simple object database that uses SmartRefStreams to serialize clusters of objects to disk .
Ordinary ReferenceStreams can mix up your instance variables when deserializing older versions of a class .
The root of each cluster is an ActiveRecord / OODB hybrid .
It makes ActiveRecord a bit more object oriented by treating it as an aggregate root and its class as a repository for its instances .
I 'm mixing and matching what I like from Domain Driven Design , Prevayler , and ActiveRecord into a single simple framework that suits me .
SandstoneDb API
To use SandstoneDb , just subclass SDActiveRecord and restart your image to ensure the proper directories are created , that 's it , there is no further configuration .
The database is kept in a subdirectory matching the name of the class in the same directory as the image .
This is a Prevayler like system so all data is kept in memory written to disk on save ; on system startup , all data is loaded from disk back into memory .
This keeps the image itself small .
Like Prevayler , there 's a startup cost associated with loading all the instances into memory and rebuilding the object graph , however once loaded , accessing your objects is blazing fast and you do n't need to worry about indexing or special query syntaxes like you would with an on - disk database .
This of course limits the size of the database to whatever you 're willing to put up with in load time and whatever you can fit in ram .
To give you a rough idea , loading up a 360 meg database containing about 73,000 hotel objects on my 3ghz Xeon Windows workstation takes about 57 minutes .
That 's an average of about 5 k per object .
Hefty and definitely pushing the upper limits of acceptable .
Of course , load time will vary depending upon your specific domain and the size of the objects .
This blog is nearly two years old and only has a few hundred objects varying from 2 k to 90 k , some of my customers have been using their small apps for nearly a year and only accumulated 500 to 600 business objects averaging 0.5 k each .
Load time for apps this small is insignificant and using a relational database would be akin to using a sledgehammer to hang an index card with a thumbtack .
API
SandstoneDb has a very simple API for querying and iterating on the class side representing the repository for those instances :
queries
#atId : ( for fetching a record by its #id )
#atId:ifAbsent :
# do : ( for iterating all records )
#find : ( for finding first matching record )
#find : ifAbsent :
#find : ifPresent :
# findAll ( for grabbing all records )
# findAll : ( for finding all matching record )
Being pretty much just variations of #select : and #detect : , little if any explanation is required for how to use these .
The #find naming is to make it clear these queries could potentially be more expensive than just the standard # select : and #detect : .
Though it 's memory - based now , I 'm leaving open the option of future implementations that could be disk - based allowing larger databases than will fit in memory ; the same API should work regardless .
There 's an equally simple API for the instance side :
Accessors that come in handy for all persistent objects .
#id ( a UUID string in base 36 )
#createdOn
#updatedOn
#version ( useful in critical sections to validate you 're working on the version you expect )
#indexString ( all instance variable 's asStrings as a single string for easy searching )
Actions you can perform on a record .
# save ( thread safe )
#save : ( same as above but you can pass a block if you have other work you want done while the object is locked )
#critical : ( grabs or creates a Monitor for thread safety )
#abortChanges ( rollback to the last saved version )
# delete ( thread safe )
#validate ( for subclasses to override and throw exceptions to prevent saves )
You can freely have records holding references to other records but a record must be saved before it can be referenced .
If you attempted to save an object that references another record that answers true to #isNew , you 'll get an exception .
Saves are not cascaded , only the programmer can know the proper save order his object model requires .
To do safe cascaded saves would require actual transactions .
Saves are always explicit , if you did n't save it , it was n't saved , there is no magic , and you should never be left scratching your wondering if your objects were saved or not .
Events you can override to hook into a records life cycle .
#onBeforeFirstSave
#onAfterFirstSave
#onBeforeSave
#onAfterSave
#onBeforeDelete
#onAfterDelete
Be careful with these , if an exception occurs you will prevent the life cycle from completing properly , but then again , that might be what you intend .
A testing method you might find useful on occasion .
#isNew ( answers true prior to the first successful save )
Only subclass SDActiveRecord for aggregate roots where you need to be able to query for the object , for all other objects just use ordinary Smalltalk objects .
You DO NOT need to make every one of your domain objects into ActiveRecords , this is not Ruby on Rails , choosing your model carefully gives you natural transaction boundaries since the save of a single ActiveRecord and all ordinary objects contained within is atomic and stored in a single file .
There are no real transactions so you can not atomically save multiple ActiveRecords .
A good example of an aggregate root object would an # Order class , while its # LineItem class just be an ordinary Smalltalk object .
A #BlogPost is an aggregate root while a # BlogComment is an ordinary Smalltalk object .
# Order and # BlogPost would be ActiveRecords .
This allows you to query for # Order and # BlogPost but not for # LineItem and # BlogComment , which is as it should be , those items do n't make much sense outside the context of their aggregate root and no other object in the system should be allowed to reference them directly , only aggregate roots can be referenced by other objects .
This of course means should you improperly reference say an # OrderItem from an object other than its parent # Order ( which is the root of the file they 're bother stored in ) , then you 'll ultimately end up referencing a copy rather than the original because such a reference wo n't be able to maintain its identity after an image restart .
In the real world , this is more than enough to write most applications .
Transactions are a nice to have feature , they are not a must - have feature and their value has been grossly oversold .
Starbucks does n't use a two - phase commit , and it's good to remind yourself that the world chugs on anyway , mistakes are sometimes made and corrective actions are taken , but you do n't need transactions to do useful work .
MySql became the most popular open - source database in existence long before they added transactions as a feature .
Here are some examples of using an ActiveRecord ...
person := Person find : [ :e | e name = ' Joe ' ]. person save .
person delete .
user :=
User find : [ :e | e email = ' Joe@Schmoe.com ' ] ifAbsent : [ User named : ' Joe ' email : ' Joe@Schmoe.com ' ]. joe := Person at Id : anId. managers := Employee findAll : [ :e | e subordinates notEmpty ] .
Concurrency is handled by calling either # save or #save : and it 's entirely up to the programmer to put critical sections around the appropriate code .
You are working on the same instances of these objects as other threads and you need to be aware of that to deal with concurrency correctly .
You can wrap a #save : around any chunk of code to ensure you have a lock on that object like so ...
auction save : [ auction addBid : ( Bid price : 30 dollars user : self session currentUser ) ] .
While #critical : lets you decide when to call #save , in case you want other stuff inside the critical section of code to do something more complex than a simple implicit save .
When you 're working with multiple distributed systems , like a credit card processor , transactions do n't really cut it anyway so you might do something like save the record , get the auth , and if successful , update the record again with the new auth ...
auction critical : [ [ auction acceptBid : aBid ; save ; authorizeBuyerCC ; save ] on : Error do : [ : error | auction reopen ; save ] ]
That 's about all there is to using it , there are some more things going on under the hood like crash recovery and startup but if you really want to know how that works , read the code .
SandstoneDb is available on SqueakSource and is MIT licensed and makes a handy development and prototyping or small application database for Seaside .
If you happen to use it and find any bugs or performance issues , please send me a test case and I 'll see what I can do to correct it quickly .
" Florian " , the DVD Burning Robot
By Aaron Shephard , California
Posted on September 12th , 2008 Jump to : About Florian Florian in Action Detailed Pictures
Why ?
It is said that there are two kinds of sysadmins :
Those who have a verified , functional backup solution , and those whose systems have n't crashed yet .
Most of the data loss I 've experienced has in fact been due to wetware failures rather than real hardware problems .
( That 's a fancy way to say it was user error , i.e. my own dang fault ;)
Manual backups to DVD- R are possible , but boooring , with a spindle of discs and a Sharpie pen , scribbling " 16 Jan 2008 MP3 1 / 57 " ... " 16 Jan 2008 MP3 2 / 57 " ... etc .
Being the enterprising nerd that I am , I decided to to build an automated solution , which would take a stack of blank discs , burn them one at a time , label them for me , and then stack them neatly for me to put them away on a shelf .
Note that I do not use this machine for DVD ripping .
Frequently folks think I 've built this thing to somehow defraud the MPAA .
Never mind the fact that the CPU is grossly underpowered for ripping , there are easier ways to deal with multiple discs !
This unit lives solely to back up data and does not handle video .
Idea
The first step to research what was available commercially and what had been done by other hobbyists .
There are commercial DVD robots , but they are costly .
Many of the DIY solutions I saw were novel , but not what I 'd consider reliable .
It 's impressive from a hobby standpoint to make machinery entirely from wood , for instance , or out of Lego ( really ! ) , but I suspect such a machine would wear out quickly or require intervention after a handful of operations .
My machine would be required to go through a stack of 100 or more discs without intervention .
It would have to introduce minimal wear and tear on the discs .
Any scratches would wreak havoc later should I want to actually be able to READ the discs , which is an important part of the " functional , verified backup solution " !
This is a project that screams " microcontrollers " for the people who are into such things ; for me however , it screamed " Mini - ITX " .
By virtue of being a PC , the Mini-ITX is easily networked to the backup target .
It 's also far easier to make changes to the mechanism controller in software than having to modify the hardware of a dedicated controller .
That and I had a spare M10000 sitting around begging to be used :D
Design
While my buddies accuse me of having a machine shop in my garage , I do n't , for instance , have a lathe , so making my own machine parts was largely out the question .
One * can * buy slides and bearings and such new , of course , but they are costly , and I expected a certain amount of change to the design as the project progressed .
Also , waiting a week for parts to arrive in the mail ( and paying as much in shipping costs as parts ) each time grates on me .
The second best choice , then , was to scour the surplus shops for devices which had assemblies and parts that might work .
A round of Silicon Valley 's surplus shops netted a pair of tape libraries and a small CD duplicating system .
While I * hate * tape as a backup medium and the complexity of tape changers , that same complexity meant that the devices have lots of motors and slides and various moving parts for me to use .
I lucked out with the CD duplicator .
It was only made to do perhaps 20 - 25 discs and had a very odd setup of sliding discs from a stack , so I was n't able to use it in its entirety , but the mechanism by which it picked up the discs was invaluable .
I also gutted an old scanner for its slide mechanism , stepper motor , bearings , etc .
While I could visualize how most of the DVD changer would go together , the most important part was also the part I was most having trouble with .
The mechanism to actually pick up and drop a disc worried me , as it would be the centerpiece of the entire affair .
I spent quite some time in my shop trying various ways to pick up a disc : mechanical fingers to grab the disc at the outside , with varying angles from the vertical , vacuum suction cups , levers in the center hole , etc etc .
None worked to my liking , as all would sometimes pick up one disc , sometimes two , and more often than not , none .
In order to automate a backup to a hundred or so discs , this thing would have to grab one -- and only one !
-- disc , every time .
In the end that CD duplicator worked out nicely ; it has a solenoid - operated lever with three fingers that grab the disc in the center hole .
Once that was decided , the rest of the setup was engineered from that point out .
I read up on labelling systems for burners , and while I liked the idea of color , the prospect of moving discs between two stacks , a burner AND a printer was rather daunting .
I opted instead to use a Lightscribe burner , which merely requires that the disc be flipped over in the drive to be labelled .
Execution
In general , I constructed the unit from acrylic for a number of reasons .
It 's easy to work , is available in a variety of shapes and sizes and is relatively inexpensive in comparison to , for instance , aluminum .
Aluminum is used for those parts which required additional stiffness or for bridging a vertical surface to a horizontal one .
The disc stacks are wood , as explained below , and a few bits are high density polyethylene ( " HDPE " , which I 'll touch on again as well . )
One of the hobby robot places , Lynxmotion , had a gripper ( they call " Little Grip " ) which seemed perfect for grasping and flipping discs .
I already had a few RC servo motors from a previous project , as well as Lynxmotion 's " Pan and Tilt " kit .
These combined allow the flipper mechanism to rotate in all three dimensions .
Not only can it therefore grasp a disc and flip it over in place , but the disc can also be rotated away from the drive and discarded into a coaster pile in case of bad burns .
Note that due to the extra weight of the gripper , there 's a stack of fender washers as counter - weight to keep the unit balanced .
The flipper mechanism and its servo controller ( see below ) are mounted to the shell from a CD - ROM drive , allowing it to be easily mounted in a stack with the burner .
The stack storage was also problematic ; since the disc picker mechanism grabs from the center , I could n't use a center pole the way that the spindles come at the store .
I also discovered that even thick acrylic rods bend a fair bit over distance , preventing them from keeping the disc stack centered .
The end solution was therefore hardwood dowels , which are stiff enough to keep the discs accurately stacked .
They 're still reasonably light and more affordable than metal .
They 're mounted in balsa blocks , largely friction - fit into place , the holes being drilled with a 47 / 64 " to be just slightly smaller than the 3/4 " OD dowel .
With the central picking and burning mechanisms decided , the next piece would be the vertical movement of the picking mechanism .
The mechanism is mounted to bearing slides riding metal rods , all from the tape libraries .
Motion is achieved with a stepper motor driving a toothed belt .
There 's an idler gear at the bottom which provides torque multiplication .
By half - stepping the motor there are about 7200 steps over the 11 " travel , which allows very accurate location .
The ends of the travel are detected by optical sensors on each end .
The lateral sliding mechanism is essentially a larger scale variation on the same theme .
I did n't have a stepper motor with enough torque , so this one is driven by a regular DC motor with an attached gearbox .
It 's further reduced by another geared idler wheel setup .
Initially this rode on a bearing assembly from the tape libraries , but in the end I had better luck with a piece of HDPE , drilled to slide on the rods .
( The lateral travel actually uses three rods joined end to end with allthread . )
HDPE is peculiar stuff , not least as it's allegedly self - lubricating for purposes such as this .
( It 's more traditionally used for plastic cutting boards , for instance . )
There are opto sensors at each end , as well as the center ; the motor control software runs the motor in either direction until the desired sensor kicks ( with a timeout in case of failure . )
There are also sensors on the supply stack , to determine when it 's empty , and around the drive , to determine when the drive is open .
Finally , there are two sets of sensors on the sides of the picking mechanism .
The upper one is slightly skewed from the horizontal , and detects the presense of a disc in the picker .
The lower set detects when the picker is positioned at the top of a stack of discs , i.e. is ready to pick one up .
There are fudge factors built into the motion control ; for instance , when picking up a disc , the picker slides a hair side - to - side , to allow it to successfully grab discs which are not perfectly centered .
You 'll see this in the video below .
One of the problems I faced with this project is continually thinking in three dimensions ; fitment issues are exponentially more complicated when it's not just cabling and figuring reach and such in a flat plane , but in space .
The optical sensors on the picker have to clear the spindle rods as it moves up and down , but also as it moves across -- which , obviously can only happen if the picker is lifted to the very top .
As a result , the motion control software must ensure that the various pieces which could interfere are in their proper position before moving .
Otherwise , things get stuck , motors make bad noises , and occasionally things break :(
The computer part of this setup is straightforward .
The motherboard is an Epia M10000 left over from previous projects .
A 512MB stick of RAM and a hard drive grabbed at random from the spares ( 40 GB , I think ) make it boot .
The burner was bought on price point , i.e. was the least expensive Lightscribe unit I could get .
Both are PATA to match the motherboard .
Electronics
The stepper " controller " , actually , is just four Darlington transistors , their accompanying base resistors , and then some LED 's to indicate power in and coil engagement .
The Darlingtons were required as I could n't get enough gain from regular transistors to drive the stepper coils from a TTL output .
The pad - per - hole circuit boards are admittedly low - tech , but they 're ideal for the simple circuits used here .
They 're cheap and easy to change as the design progressed , and diagnosing problems is simple with the color - coded telco wire used for point - to - point .
Most of wiring harnesses were liberated from old PC cases ; when more length was required , multiples were soldered together and then heatshrink applied .
LED 's , particularly blinking ones , are a critical part of any electronic project .
Besides the stepper motor LED's , you 'll notice at the top center a bank of sixteen LED's , which are ON ( green ) / OFF ( red ) indicators for eight bits .
It 's used alternately as a diagnostic tool by the motor control software mirroring the status of the various optical sensors to the LED's , and then occasionally blinking them randomly or in a Knight Rider pattern to amuse passersby .
The basic idea for the stepper controller circuit came from this kind fellow , though I ended up not using the CMOS logic on the left side of the schematic and doing it entirely in software .
Much of the controlling logic -- not just for the stepper but for the entire unit -- is done in software as it's easier to code than to solder ;)
Everything you ever wanted to know about steppers can be found on this guy 's web page .
The LCD display is driven by a gizmo to run it from a serial port , and is attached to a COM port on the motherboard .
The backup scripts send status to the COM port , then so that the machine can operate headlessly ( i.e. without monitor , and in fact without a keyboard or mouse as well . )
The other COM port uses a Scott Edwards SSC II to control the RC servos on the flipper mechanism .
The last PC interface is an ancient unit , that allows a parallel port to control 32 bits each input and output .
It came from Australia 's Dontronics and is no longer in production .
LPT port stuff is blase ' any more , it seems , and everyone wants USB .
It 's a shame , as it 's simple and quite well laid out .
This is the longer board at the rear of the setup , with all the colored wires .
( Speaking of no longer around , the DC motor controller and the serial - LCD bridge both came from Wirz , who no longer cater to the kit crowd . )
Software
Without getting into the penguin - vs - Bill controversy , I happen to be a Microsoft shop , so Florian runs Windows XP .
The desktop can be accessed remotely over RDP , and it 's trivial to network to the various Windows servers and workstations to access the files to back up .
The controlling software is all in Perl , oddly enough , grouped into batch files for logical functions like loading a disc from the blank stack , flipping a disc , and unloading a disc into the done pile .
While Perl is not necessarily well - suited to bit - banging , it has modules for serial port access , and can interface to the ubiquitous inpout32.dll for direct hardware access .
The rest of the duties are a cakewalk for Perl : simple programmatic logic and text management , conditional looping , etc .
The grouping and splitting of files into ~ 4.3 GB chunks is also done in Perl .
Writing my own solution has both its benefits ( all the features I want , and only the features I want ) and its drawbacks ( * I * have to write all those features , and there 's nobody to blame for bugs but myself = ) )
Burning is scripted via Nero 's command - line interface , and the labelling is handled via the Lightscribe SDK which also offers a CLI ( woohoo ! ) .
I wrote a quick and dirty Winbatch EXE that takes text specified by the backup process ( namely , the name of the backup set , the date and the disc number ) and stamps them onto a BMP to be fed to the LightScribe CLI to label the disc .
ATHENS , Aug. 13 ( AP ) -
The most beloved emblems of the modern Olympics have a decidedly dark past .
The torch relay that culminates in the ceremonial lighting of the flame at the Olympic stadium was ordered by Adolf Hitler , who tried to make the 1936 Berlin Games a celebration of the Third Reich .
Hitler 's Nazi propaganda machine also popularized the five interlocking rings as the symbol of the Games .
Now , both are universally recognized icons of the Olympics .
But historians say neither had much , if anything , to do with the Games born centuries ago in ancient Olympia .
" The torch relay is so ingrained in the modern choreography that most people today assume it was a revival of a pagan tradition - unaware that it was actually concocted for Hitler 's Games in Berlin , " the author Tony Perrottet wrote in " The Naked Olympics " ( Random House , 2004 ) .
Perrottet added , " Ironically , considering its repellent origins , the torch race has come to symbolize international brotherhood today , and remains a centerpiece of our own pomp - filled Olympic opening ceremonies . "
The Supreme Court ruled last week that a group of employees suing for age discrimination should get their day in court even though they filed their complaint on the wrong form .
The decision is noteworthy because it suggests that this court could be pulling back from what has often seemed like a knee - jerk inclination to rule for corporations over workers and consumers .
A group of couriers over the age of 40 sued Federal Express , claiming it tried to push out older workers .
The issue was whether they submitted a proper complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within the legal time limit .
FedEx claimed the couriers filed the wrong form , but the court ruled , 7 to 2 , that an intake questionnaire and a signed affidavit  which the E.E.O.C. considered a valid complaint  met its “ permissive standard ” for what was acceptable .
It is surprising and welcome to see the court apply any sort of permissive standard , considering how it ruled in a similar case just last year .
Through a tortured and illogical reading of the law , the court ruled , 5 to 4 , that a Goodyear employee missed the deadline for filing a complaint that she was paid less than male colleagues .
That was one of a series of rulings in recent years that stretched the law to come out against little - guy parties .
In one egregious decision last year , the court ignored its precedents to hold that an inmate lost the right to challenge his murder conviction because he missed a deadline  even though he had filed the appeal by the day the federal district judge ( mistakenly ) told him to .
" Now at last there is a new variety which we think will help excite the market .
We believe that they will become the culinary hit of the summer once people have tasted them .
For the past few months I 've been working on a language that I thought of as a hybrid of Scheme and Erlang .
Lisp - 1 , non-hygienic macros , message - passing concurrency , implicit parallelism on function args , single assignment , no mutable values .
Mostly I 'm pleased with what I 've learned from it , but today I realized that I could n't see it as a usable language .
The problem is that single assignment prevents the user from redefining functions at the REPL .
Or , rather , you can do it ( it creates a new environment containing the new binding ) , but it does n't affect the functions that use the old binding .
I do n't have a problem with that in ML ; but I just could n't see myself using a Lisp that did n't let me redefine functions .
I just wanted to post about it , on the theory that we do n't see enough people talking about their failures .
Maybe somebody else will see this and avoid the trap I painted myself into ; or maybe they 'll be inspired to find a way I did n't think of .
Oh , and why single assignment ?
Because it means that environments are immutable , too — the only time you get to bind is when you create a new environment , with ( let ) — which means that environments can safely be shared across processes , which makes processes cheaper .
It also means that it 's relatively safe to evaluate function arguments in parallel , since there are no assignments to get out of order .
( It 's only relatively safe , though , since message send / receive could get misordered . )
A group of US researchers has laid out the foundations for a new online library on human genetics stored within the existing framework of open - access encyclopedia Wikipedia .
" There are about 25,000 genes in the humane genome .
We have 9,000 articles , " Andrew Su - one of those behind the " Gene Wiki " project from the Genomics Institute at the Novartis Research Foundation in San Diego , California - said .
" Our goal is to provide a uniform starting point for all genes , " he said , noting that afterwards it was up to other scientists to add information and keep it up to date , as happens now with Wikipedia entries .
" The entire community will generate content and also oversee that content . "
Meanwhile , researchers from Children 's Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School are also harnessing the power of the internet for their work , this time to track outbreaks of infectious disease such as meningitis or tuberculosis .
HealthMap.org is a data - gathering system that collects , organises and disseminates information on outbreaks from online discussion forums and news outlets on the Internet .
" Web - based electronic information sources can play an important role in early event detection and support situational awareness by providing current , highly local information about outbreaks , " researcher John Brownstein said .

Here we are near the end of the long , hot summer , and that odor wafting toward you is n't skunked beer or uncollected trash - - it 's desperation .
You can tell when campaign ads talk about " celebrity " and feature Paris Hilton and Britney Spears , both of whom might be hard - pressed to answer how many years are in a U.S. senator 's term ( quick - - somebody cue Jay Leno 's " Jaywalking ! " ) .
It was around this time eight years ago when the traveling campaign press seized on the " Who would you rather have a beer with ? " test for the presidency .
And five years after that , we learned that the winner of the beer test appointed the commissioner of the International Arabian Horse Association as administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency before a hurricane wiped out an American city .
We saw how that turned out .
Now we 're back in the stink of it again .
Barely a month left before the conventions , and the second sentence in a front - page Wall Street Journal article reads , " But in a nation in which 66 percent of the voting - age population is overweight and 32 percent is obese , could Sen.
Obama 's skinniness be a liability ? "
As blogger Duncan Black , who writes under the name " Atrios , " says , " The stupid , it burns me . "
The appearance of Spears and Hilton in the presidential stakes makes it very apparent that despite $ 4 gas , a slow - motion mortgage industry collapse , rising unemployment , an accelerating hurricane season , and every month bringing a new contaminated food item , John McCain intends on running a campaign for Most Popular Kid in the Playground , and he seems petulant that he 's not winning .
Despite appending " Straight Talk " to every vehicle that transports him , McCain is now pushing away national political reporters -- once the people he called " his base " -- and their substantive questions about actual issues of policy in order to field softball questions from local media .
And there are reasons for that :
The GOP has run out of intellectual steam .
Eight years of George W. Bush have shown conclusively that the entire raison d'être of the Republican governing machine was to steer federal money to private industry , enriching the few at the expense of the many .
Six tax cuts in as many years left the nation 's infrastructure crumbling while corporate profits soared .
Two wars accompanied by hundreds of no -bid contracts siphoned billions of dollars out of the treasury and into politically connected companies like Blackwater and Halliburton before draining into the sands of the Middle East .
Year in and year out , the Bush administration predicted that tax cuts would stimulate the economy , leading to the end of deficits -- and yet the budget bled more and more red ink each year , culminating in a administration - projected deficit of $ 482 billion by the time the president leaves office .
Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota , the Democratic chairman of the Senate Budget Committee told the Los Angeles Times , " If we gave Olympic medals for fiscal irresponsibility , President Bush would take the gold , the silver , and the bronze , because he's got the three highest record deficits ever .
. . .
He sets records in every single category : 2009 would be the gold ; 2004 the silver ; 2008 the bronze . "
The surpluses that Bush inherited ( after the Clinton administration 's 1993 deficit - reduction plan erased the deficits from the Reagan and Bush I years ) might as well have been poured directly into the pockets of the top 1 percent , which is why , before and after the ' 04 elections , you saw the deification process ( last used for Ronald Reagan ) beginning , such as the our leader billboard put up by Clear Channel on Interstate 4 outside of Orlando .
In 2006 , that 1 percent took the highest share of the country 's adjusted gross income since the Gilded Age of the 1920s , while its average tax rate fell to the lowest level since 1990 .
Now , the same oligarchy that has been the beneficiary of the Bush largess is starting to see the writing on the wall :
The good times may be coming to an end .
Large Republican - leaning corporations like Wal - Mart are reportedly calling managers and supervisors into meetings featuring dire warnings ab0ut what might happen if a Democratic administration takes over .
A Wall Street Journal article states , " The actions by Wal - Mart - - the nation 's largest private employer - - reflect a growing concern among big business that a reinvigorated labor movement could reverse years of declining union membership . "
Imagine an administration without a toothless Department of Labor corrupted by years of corporate complicity .
Imagine an administration that believes government exists to do more than privatize federal assets for corporate gain .
The friends of Bush and McCain sitting in their executive suites are n't feeling comfortable about the way the winds are blowing .
One percent of the country by itself can't outvote the other 99 percent that are n't sitting quite as pretty .
Which is why this summer 's media stories are stinking of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears .
They 're hoping you 'll be distracted by the smell .

Add United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon to the list of people who understand that arresting and punishing sex workers is counter - productive in the battle against HIV / AIDS .
And take the government of Cambodia off that list .
Add United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon to the list of
people who understand that arresting and punishing sex workers is
counter - productive in the battle against HIV / AIDS .
And take the government of Cambodia off that list .
The
Global Working Group on HIV and Sex Work Policy wrote to Ban in June to
applaud his statement commending the findings of a March report that
favored decriminalizing sex work .
The Report of the Commission on AIDS
in Asia noted that sex workers are part of the solution to preventing
the spread of HIV , and advised countries to " avoid programs that
accentuate AIDS - related stigma and can be counterproductive .
Such
programs may include ‘ crack - downs ’ on red - light areas and arrest of
sex workers . "
To express their gratitude for
this understanding , sex workers and advocates circulated a statement at
the June 11 - 12 UN High - Level Meeting on HIV / AIDS as Ban spoke to the
gathering in New York .
" Sex workers thank [ Ban ] for his support of
their efforts to combat the HIV / AIDS epidemic , " the statement said .
The
March report strongly advised countries to enlist sex workers in the
effort to prevent the spread of HIV .
It included firm recommendations
against punitive measures targeting sex work and other frowned - upon
behaviors , on the grounds that such approaches have proven
counter - productive .
The UN Secretary - General supported these
recommendations in his statement and sex workers everywhere are
grateful .

Unfortunately , some governments
continue to deny reality .
Under pressure from the United States ,
Cambodia outlawed prostitution in February .
The government ’s promotion
of a " no condoms , no sex " program in legal brothels there had
succeeded in reducing HIV infection rates , but now those brothels have
closed or gone underground , along with bars , karaoke clubs and street
areas .
Hundreds of women have been arrested , jailed or displaced , while
dozens have been raped and beaten by police and prison guards .
The HIV prevention and care programs that were working have collapsed .
The new law , ironically named the Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation Law , is a failure in every way .
It encourages
trafficking and exploitation because it makes sex workers easier prey :
the workers can no longer seek clients in public and must depend upon
others to introduce them .
Worse , police now use condoms as evidence of
prostitution , so sex workers can no longer use them .
We can expect to
see HIV rates rise as a result .
The U.S. ambassador to Cambodia acknowledged in an article in The International Herald Tribune that
U.S. influence played a part in the passage of this dangerous law .
The
annual U.S. Trafficking
In Persons Report ranks countries on their
efforts to end the practice according to U.S. perception , with those
low on the list risking economic sanctions .
By passing the law ,
Cambodia moved up from the " Tier 2 watch list " to " Tier 2 " and thus
evaded sanctions .
But
is U.S. aid worth the cost in sex workers ’ lives and in lost ground
against HIV / AIDS ?
Sex workers in Cambodia protested the new law on June
4 , calling for repeal and an end to raids .
" Do n’t be fooled by talk of
rescuing ‘ sex slaves ’ until you have heard our testimonials and seen
video evidence of the brutality and misery this new law is causing , "
their statement said ( watch the video below ) .
Sex
workers and their allies also protested the new law at the Cambodian
Mission to the United Nations in New York on June 11 , during the
High - Level Meeting on AIDS .
Further demonstrations are planned in the
United Kingdom and Australia .
Cambodian sex workers call for a repeal of the trafficking law passed by the Cambodian government under pressure from the US government .
UPDATE at 10:54 am : Detained sex workers in Cambodia were released on June 24 , 2008
Sex workers documented human rights abuses and sought local and international support in their campaign against these violations .
Supporters have been invaluable .
The next steps include continued support for changing the law that led to these abuses , as well as immediate care and assistance for those who were abused in detention .

All this being said I had an epiphany recently .
A vagina has enough going for it that it ’s worth the extra effort to stop that unruly mop from hanging in its eyes .
My old view which was , “ why not let the poor thing live out its homely life in peace ” , has been changed to “ my muff is like Allison from The Breakfast Club ” .
You might remember Allison , she was the depressed , unsightly gal with crazy hair that covered most of her face .
But , at the end she lets Molly Ringwald ’s character do her hair and you realize she ’s actually quite lovely .
Where is Molly Ringwald when you need her ?
What would cause this type of 180 you ask , online video porn of course .
I was just introduced to the wonders of YouTube - like porn sites by my husband who swears he only hears about such things from his vulgar co-workers .
Being a modern sort of couple we like to use technology to our advantage whenever possible – which includes huddling around a laptop in bed watching raunchy homemade video porn vignettes .
After some sheepish discussion on what keyword searches we should try ( btw , Abercombie & Fitch model seducing average looking woman in a Tahitian hotel bar before taking her out to his yacht to have hot , sweaty , above deck sex does n’t turn up any results , so do n’t bother ) , we hit upon “ Eating Pussy Lesson ” .
I was thinking we would get something along the lines of “ the clit is not a myth ” and “ yes you do actually need to put your mouth on it to be successful ” , but what I got was much , much better .
I mature blond woman – still a looker but someone you genuinely felt you could take anatomical advice from – gave the lesson on a young buxom blond in a bustier .
Our teacher furthered both the scientific and fetishistic quotient by wearing black rubber gloves .
I wo n’t get into the details except to say that I learned a great deal from this woman and by the end felt that the vagina was a brilliant piece of equipment that should receive at least as much attention as a car does ; a regular wash & wax and the occasional splurge on the deluxe wheel rim package with papaya scent .
But let ’s be realistic , rarely do epiphanies happen in a vacuum .
There was a bit of a lead up to this .
As I stated earlier I felt that my lower coif needed little attention and that this was a reasonable and widespread course of action .
And of course I was right .
The average American woman does choose to let nature take its course down below .
However , as my recent anecdotal and completely unscientific research clearly indicates – the average single American woman between the ages of 20 and 35 , who lives in an urban area ( particularly in Southern California ) , waxes the shit out of her va-jay jay .
Yes , that dreaded South American spa treatment , and the closest most of us will ever get to a lesbian sex act … the Brazilian wax job .
I was in many ways shocked to learn that most of my friends partake .
I thought there were few reasons girls like us might obtain a Brazilian .
Among them might be an upcoming stint in Amateur Girls Take Hot Cock 7 , or a date with Ron Jeremy .
These otherwise normal women in my life were shelling out $ 70 a pop to let a small asian woman take them in a back room and rip out their anal hair .
Yikes .
One of my friends is actually lasering her beave completely bald .
Double yikes .
This last conversation was had over a round of beers at a local pub and I was the only one in the group who had to scoop her chin up off the table .
The rest of the ladies felt this was not only a wise aesthetic choice , but smart from an economic point of view also .
Pay several hundred dollars now but never have to pay for a wax job again , let alone a razor .
Do n’t be surprised if you see “ laser yourself bald ” as hot new tip for financially savvy females in Suze Orman ’s next book .
After my informal education I was certainly more aware that bush hair removal on a massive scale was far more common than I ever thought .
Regular gals are out there with landing strips or nothing at all and I suppose regular guys have come to expect it .
To think my poor husband had to work around all that fluff for years .
But if you ’re hoping for me to wrap this up with a Brazilian salon recommendation , you ’re out of luck .
I ’m going to have to count myself as a moderate on this issue .
I ’ll go for an advanced bikini wax ( a la landing strip ) , and I ’ll even keep it nice and trim with a pair of safety scissors .
But to whatever confused stray hairs made a right when they should have made a left and ended up doomed to a life next to my butt hole , I say live and let live .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - “ Samantha Who ? ” star Christina Applegate , 36 , is free of cancer after having both breasts removed to combat the disease , the actress told a U.S. television news show on Tuesday .
Actress Christina Applegate ( R ) , star of the ABC network series " Samantha Who " , is interviewed by Robin Roberts on ABC's " Good Morning America " in New York August 19 , 2008 in this video frame grab from ABC .
REUTERS / ABCNEWS.com / Handout
Applegate , who revealed her diagnosis for breast cancer earlier this month , had the double mastectomy performed a month after her diagnosis , she said on ABC ’s “ Good Morning America . ”
The actress , who stars on the ABC sitcom “ Samantha Who ? , ” said she bore a genetic risk for developing breast cancer , and she said her surgery was meant to prevent the cancer she suffered in one breast from coming back .
But she said it was difficult to have both breasts surgically removed .
“ Sometimes , you know , I cry , ” Applegate said .
“ And sometimes I scream .
And I get really angry .
And I get really upset , you know , into wallowing in self - pity sometimes .
And I think it ’s all part of the healing . ”
Applegate also talked about her mother , Nancy Priddy , who survived breast cancer and helped support the film and TV star in battling cancer .
“ She ’s been sort of this quiet warrior in the back and has been a great support , and just telling me that I was going to be OK .
And I knew I was going to be OK .
I ’ve watched her , ” Applegate said .
In the interview with ABC , Applegate said she will have reconstructive surgery on her breasts in coming months , and she showed fans that her sense of humor has remained intact .
“ I ’m going to have cute boobs ‘ til I ’m 90 , ” she said .
The California - born Applegate rose to fame playing a ditzy daughter on the Fox network ’s bawdy family sitcom “ Married ... With Children , ” and since then has starred in several movies and TV shows .
She won an Emmy , U.S. television ’s top honor , for a guest role on “ Friends , ” and was Emmy - nominated for “ Samantha Who ? ” playing an amnesiac trying to put her life back together .
Applegate told “ Good Morning America ” she is starting a charitable foundation to help women meet the costs of MRI exams , which is how her disease was discovered .
The actress also will appear on upcoming TV fundraiser “ Stand Up to Cancer ” singing alongside Mariah Carey , Beyonce and Sheryl Crow , who also has battled breast cancer .

Questions about the attitude of Italians to their Roma minority were again being asked yesterday after photographs were published of sunbathers continuing as normal with a day at the beach despite the bodies of two Gypsy girls who had drowned being laid out on the sand nearby .
A civil liberties group said it had asked for talks with the authorities to shed light on the circumstances of the girls ' death .
The incident took place outside Naples , where a Roma encampment was burned to the ground this year after its inhabitants had been evacuated for their own safety .
Accounts given by Italian media varied , but according to the news agency Ansa , the victims - aged 14 and 16 - and two other young Gypsies had been begging from daytrippers on the beach at Torregaveta , west of Naples , on Saturday .
Other reports indicated they were selling trinkets .
The area is easily reached from the city by a railway line that ends near the shore .
At about 1 pm , the four girls decided to go into the water even though none of them , it seems , knew how to swim .
They soon got into difficulties because of strong currents in the area and were hit by an unusually big wave .
Two of the girls were rescued by life - savers from a nearby private beach .
But rescuers were unable to reach the two oldest until they were already dead .
Their corpses were dragged ashore and laid out on the sand under beach towels .
" But the knot of curious onlookers that formed around the girls ' bodies dissolved as [ swiftly ] as it had formed , " the newspaper Corriere della Sera reported .
" Few left the beach or abandoned their sunbathing .
When the police from the mortuary arrived an hour later with coffins , the two girls were carried away on the shoulders [ of the officers ] between bathers stretched out in the sun . "
La Repubblica also expressed astonishment at the behaviour of those present .
" While the lifeless bodies of the girls were still on the sand , there were those who carried on sunbathing or having lunch just a few metres away , " it reported .
Corriere recalled that this was not the first time people had decided a death was no reason to give up their day at the beach .
In August 1997 , sunbathers carried on as normal after a man drowned near Trieste .
But the fact that the two victims on this occasion were Roma added an extra twist to the affair .
Italy is gripped by anti-Gypsy feeling .
Since coming to office in May , Silvio Berlusconi's rightwing government has appointed three special commissioners to deal with the Roma in each of Italy 's three biggest cities - Naples , Milan and Rome .
It has also ordered the fingerprinting of the country 's Gypsy population , including minors , who make up more than half of the estimated 150,000 Roma in Italy .
The European commission has asked the Italian government for more details on the census , and this month the European parliament approved a motion condemning it as an act of discrimination banned by the European convention of human rights .
Berlusconi last week told the commission president , José Manuel Barroso , that the information was being collected to ensure Gypsy children went to school .
The civil liberties group EveryOne said it was unconvinced by reports of the incident at Torregaveta and asked whether there might be something more sinister behind it .
A statement from the group said : " Two young Roma would never have left their scant merchandise for ' a refreshing dip ' in the waves .
Two Gypsy girls would never have gone bathing in full view of everyone because of the modesty that is one of their distinguishing characteristics . "
The group said it had asked for a meeting with the authorities , adding : " We await their response . "
This was my first summer at the clinic .
This guy brought in his cat ( i think the cat 's name might have been Buddy , I do n't remember for sure ) .
No carrier , no brace / leash , he just carried the cat in his arms wrapped in a towel .
Now this is a major pet peeve of mine and of most people in vet clinics ; when bringing your cat to the vet , you really need to bring it in a carrier .
I do n't care how much he hates the carrier , or how well behaved he is when you carry him , the vet clinic / animal hospital is a stressful environment for your animal and you can't predict how he 's going to act , and you certainly can't predict what other animals will be there .
But we 'll get back to that later .
So this guy brings in his cat , who 's having problems breathing .
He 's a really sweet guy , an old man that lives alone with this cat , and you could tell that he absolutely loves this cat .
And the cat is one of the sweetest cats I 've had the pleasure to work with .
So we bring him downstairs for a chest x-ray and bloodwork ; turns out that it was a pretty serious case of pleural effusion ( fluid buildup around the lungs ) that was causing the breathing problems ; the only reason he was still alive at this point was that he was such a calm , well behaved cat , and didnt get overly stressed out as we were poking him for bloodwork and laying him out for x-rays .
He was loving the attention in fact ; the whole time he just wanted pets and to cuddle .
He 's still probably one of my favorite patients .
It really broke my heart when he got such a serious diagnosis .
So the doctor sighed , brought the chest x-ray upstairs to try to explain to the client the gravity of the situation , and that he absolutely needed to be hospitalized to that she could observe him overnight and get back results on the bloodwork .
The poor man was devastated , and clearly in denial .
He refused hospitalization several times ( with the doctor and another tech desperately trying to get him to reconsider ) , saying he just wanted to bring the cat home .
After it was clear that we could n't convince him to leave the cat with us , we offered to lend him one of our cat carriers to bring him home in ( standard practice for when people bring in their cats unrestrained , it happens fairly often ) .
Again , he refused .
The doctor insisted , explaining that any extra stress could be fatal for the cat .
The man insisted that its okay , the cat loves him and trusts him , he prefers to be held , blahblahblah .
So after several fruitless attempts to get him to hospitalize the cat , and to at least let us give him a carrier for the cat , he was billed out and getting ready to leave .
At this point a storm had started ; it was pouring out , and there was heavy thunder and lightning .
One final plea to let us give him a carrier , one final refusal , and out he went , with the cat wrapped in a towel in his arms .
They made it as far as his car , when a loud clap of thunder freaked the cat out .
He leapt from his owners arms , and died right there .
I 'm still haunted by that cat ; I 'm even getting a little wistful as I type this .
The next week I 'm asked by the doctor , " You were up there when I insisted that he hospitalize the cat right ?
You heard him refuse ? "
" Of course , several times . "
" And when I offered a cat carrier , you heard him refuse , you heard me tell him why it was important that he be in a carrier , right ? "
" Oh doc , he isnt ... "
Oh , but he was .
It turns out earlier that day he called her hysterically , saying it was all her fault his cat is dead , swearing that he was going to sue her for malpractice .
That was all we heard of it though ; I guess he may have called a lawyer or two who told him that he did n't have a case , maybe he had time to calm down and come to his senses .
I really do feel bad for that man .
The cat was fairly young , the death was sudden and tragic , and it really seemed like that cat was all he had .
I can sympathize .
But to refuse treatment , refuse proper transport for the animal , and then try to sue the doctor for malpractice ?
Not cool .
Marvin and Arthur Dent 's adventures will be penned by a new author
All the characters have been blown to pieces , and the trilogy is already two books too long .
But the Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy has never had a problem with highly improbable events .
Douglas Adams died in 2001 , having written five of the enduringly popular Hitchhiker books - still inaccurately dubbed a trilogy .
About 16 million copies of the books have been sold worldwide , but fans were left disappointed when it seemed as though Adams ' early death ended the series with all the main characters seemingly meeting a grisly end .
Adams himself said : " I suspect at some point in the future I will write a sixth Hitchhiker book I would love to finish Hitchhiker on a slightly more upbeat note .
" Five seems to be a wrong kind of number , six is a better kind of number . "

Now it seems Adams ' wish has come true .
Children 's author Eoin Colfer has been chosen to write the sixth of the series by Adams ' widow Jane Belson .
He writes of his joy at being able to continue the series with the new book And Another Thing .
I first read the Hitchhiker 's Guide in my late teens when Ted Roche , a libertine friend of mine , pressed it into my sweaty palms and hissed at me with fanatical intensity that I must read it or be ridiculed forever by the school literati .
Relax , dude , I remember saying with eighties ' insouciance .
Ridicule is nothing to be scared of .
But I was scared .
Petrified in fact .
If one was not a sportsman , the only other circle to belong to was the readers ' circle .
Places were limited and expulsions were swift and ruthless .
If one had not read the livre du jour then one would not be offered book swapsies on Friday .
If this happened , then a person might be forced to turn to his own siblings for conversation .
Colfer likens the chance to write the book as " being offered the superpower of your choice "
So , in this spirit of quasi - persecution I scuttled home after double chemistry and found a quiet bathroom where I could settle down and read what I was certain would be a thinly veiled version of Star Wars .
Vogons destroy the Earth and a single hero survives .
Please .
I could almost write the rest myself .
Never have I been so happy to be proven wrong .
The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy was like nothing I had read before , or since for that matter .
If you have read it then you know exactly what I am talking about .
If you have n't then read it now , moron .
The problem is the hyperbole puts people off .
If it 's so popular then it must be middle of the road , brimming with clichés and easily digested on the sands of Ibiza .
All false assumptions .
The Guide is a slice of satirical genius .
A marvel of quantum tomfoolery .
A dissection of the absurdities of our human condition .
A space odyssey that forces us to face ourselves and collapse in hysterics .

A quest ?
For the next couple of decades I followed the exploits of Arthur Dent and his intergalactic troupe as they stumbled through space and time befuddled and bereft , drinking tea in the face of impossible odds and generally failing to find enlightenment at every turn .
It 's like a quest for the holy grail where the grail is neither holy nor grail - shaped .
I travelled with Arthur Dent as he lost his planet , learned to fly , found love , made sandwiches , got to know his daughter , found his planet again briefly and finally got blown to atoms .
Blown to atoms !
Surely not , but no need to panic , Douglas Adams would surely reassemble Arthur somehow in the next book .
But as we all know , the next book never came and the legions of Hitchhiker fans were left with their hearts beating a little too quickly for all eternity .
I realised that this is a wonderful opportunity to work with characters I have loved since childhood
Douglas Adams
It became a whimsy of mine to finish the story , just for my own peace of mind .
I often wondered how Douglas Adams would have resurrected his beloved characters .
And now , almost quarter of a century after first reading Hitchhiker , I have been given the incredible opportunity of writing the next chapter in the saga myself .
In an actual book rather than in my head .
My first reaction was semi-outrage that anyone should be allowed to tamper with this incredible series .
But on reflection I realised that this is a wonderful opportunity to work with characters I have loved since childhood and give them something of my own voice while holding onto the spirit of Douglas Adams and not laying a single finger on his five books .
Once again I am terrified by a Hitchhiker book and this time it is my own .
I feel more pressure to perform now than I ever have with my own books , and that is why I am bloody determined that this will be the best thing I have ever written .
And if it is n't then I will make sure that the cover is extremely pretty .
For the first time in decades I feel the uncertainty that I last felt in my teenage years .
There are people out there that really want to like this book .
Ted Roche is one .
I will track him down in eight months time , with a proof copy in my sweaty grip , press it into his hands and tell him with fanatical intensity that he really has to read this book .
Then I will sit on the corner of his sofa until he is finished and await the verdict .

I felt the animation was a nice touch .
Before I posted the news here I was trying to find an awesome video a saw online a while back about why the NES did the whole blinking thing .
Unfortunately , I ca n’t seem to find it .
The video was n’t so much about the blinking as more talking about the difference between the NES and the Famicom systems , of which the Famicom did n’t do the whole blinking thing .
I remember it has something to do with what the difference between 60 - pin vs. 72 - pin cartridges and what each of the pins did .
And in the video they also talked about the sound difference between the NES and Famicom versions of Castlevania III : Dracula ’s Curse .
I know , random information .
But if anyone knows which video I ’m talking about , post it in this entries ’ forum thread and then I can update the main page with a link to it .
I think it would add some good background information for this comic .
Update :
Ghegs was so kind enough to tell me where the video was located .
It was done by Famicom Dojo and that episode in particular was called Cartridges and Pins .
It ’s an entertaining and informative watch .
I really enjoyed the forum discussion for the last comic .
Good times , good times .
Thanks to everyone who participated in it as well as everyone who took the time to follow along .
I appreciate it .
Since March , staffers working on the Democratic National Convention have been using the city of Denver ’s tax - free gas pumps to fill up their cars — and using its carwashes .
A dispute about this prompted city officials Tuesday to promise that the local host committee will reimburse the city at a market rate for gas — and pay state and federal taxes on the fuel .
It was never the intent of the city not to properly charge the Democrats for the fuel or its taxes , said Katherine Archuleta , mayoral liaison to the convention .
Some Denver City Council members became angry when Denver public - works employee Christine Downs told them Tuesday that the host committee will reimburse the city for the carwashes and tax - free fuel it is using for its fleet of vehicles .
Councilwoman Jeanne Faatz reacted sharply .
She said she did n’t think it was fair that local host - committee employees , as well as those with the Democratic National Convention Committee ( DNCC ) who use those cars , are driving around on tax - free fuel .
“ It did n’t sit well , ” she said .
“ I pay taxes on my fuel when I fill up my own car . ”
City Councilman Charlie Brown agreed .
“ Does the ( Democratic ) Party want to accept tax - free fuel ? ” he asked .
“ This money goes to our state highway system .
Why should n’t the DNC be willing to help our roads and our maintenance and our construction ? ”
Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper told council members that Minneapolis had a similar deal with the Republicans .
That is n’t true , said Teresa McFarland , spokeswoman for the local host committee for the Republican National Convention .
“ We pay for fuel like everyone else does , ” she said .
Later in the day , the camp of GOP presidential hopeful John McCain issued a statement saying that Sen. Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic nominee , was “ for a gas - tax holiday — as long as it benefits him and his political party . ”
It is against the Colorado Department of Revenue ’s rules for any nonprofit , private business or government contractor to receive tax - free fuel , which is reserved for local and state governments .
The Denver 2008 Convention Host Committee holds an unsigned contract with the city for fuel and carwashes .
The host committee has racked up about $ 10,000 in charges so far , but no bills have been issued and no reimbursements sent , Downs said .
The value of the contract is estimated at $ 466,125 .
Archuleta said city gas pumps are preferred for security purposes — particularly during the convention , when host - committee vehicles will be carrying dignitaries , she said .
“ The City of Denver and the Denver Host Committee informed us late this afternoon about this matter and told us that the Denver Host Committee will pay all applicable taxes and fees related to their fuel contract , as they should , ” the DNCC said in a statement Tuesday .

I just stumbled across what I believe is the first poster for the upcoming adaptation of Gibson 's awesome novel Neuromancer , and while I love the looks of it , I still wonder if ANYONE could pull of even a remote interpretation of this ?
" Based on William Gibsonâ€™s seminal cyberpunk novel , Hayden Christensen stars as Cage , a petty future Tokyo thief whose trade is jacking his brain directly into computer systems .
When this skill is taken away from him , it seems his life is destined to end in an explosion of violence and drugsâ€¦ until the mysterious Armitage offers redemption â€ “ at a price .
Revelation follows revelation as Cage discovers that no one is in control of his or her own destiny and a new form of sentient technology is taking over .
Itâ€™s down to Cage to face Neuromancer and do something he never has before : make the right choice .
Higher rez look after the break !

even the lord of the rings , a great trilogy with a very decent adaptation , had it Â´s flaws ; anyone who have read the books knows that even with +10 hours of movies , they couldn
Â´t cover all the aspects of Tolkien Â´s books .
then I turn my eyes to neuromancer and I think about GibsonÂ´s scenario - describing talent , how many details he provides and still , how many things he leaves for the readers to build ( what is , after all , ' the color of a tv tuned to a dead channel ' ?
What about ' a pair of blades that would look better in a surgery table ' ? ) ... i donÂ´t know .
When you Â´re obsessed about a book and you Â´ve read it many times , it Â´s nearly impossible to see a movie living to your expectations , so iÂ´m pretty sure IÂ´m gonna walk out of the theater disappointed .
oh , and BTW , Christensen ?
If I could pick an actor who looked like the Case I imagined , I think IÂ´d pick Jake Gylenhaal .
I see Case as a quiet guy with decent eye expressions and sudden emotion bursts , and I think Gylenhaal , judging by Donnie Darko and many other films , would be a great Case .

I agree with Ewan McGregor look for CASe 's character on the movie .

BTW , Johny Mnemonic was not as bad a movie at all though it was not well promoted .
Existenz is also a good starting point for Neuromancer 's dark ambient .
I 'd like to see some second generation Tron - like environment for Wintermute .
Probably we will see many remakes of Neuromancer until we get to something as good as Blade Runner or The Matrix I. Milla Jovovich as in the fifth element would perform fairly good as the cyberninja .
Aphex Twin would definitely be the soundtrack for the movie .

At the Orange County Sanitation District , a settling basin is used to filter water as part of the advanced secondary treatment , before the water is diverted into the ocean , in Fountain Valley , Calif .
Pharmaceuticals in waterways are damaging wildlife across the nation and around the globe , research shows .
Enlarge By Matt Rourke , AP
The federal government does n't require any testing and has n't set safety limits for drugs in water .
Of the 62 major water providers contacted , the drinking water for only 28 was tested .
Of the 28 major metropolitan areas where tests were performed on drinking water supplies , only Albuquerque ; Austin , Texas ; and Virginia Beach ; said tests were negative .
TAP WATER TESTING TAP WATER TESTING
Here 's the list of metropolitan areas , with the number of pharmaceuticals detected and some examples of specific drugs that were found , or where tests were negative , not conducted or awaiting results : Albuquerque , N.M. : tests negative Arlington , Texas : 1 ( unspecified pharmaceutical ) Atlanta : 3 ( acetaminophen , caffeine and cotinine ) Austin , Texas : tests negative Baltimore : no testing Birmingham , Ala. : no testing Boston : no testing Charlotte , N.C. : no testing Chicago : no testing Cincinnati : 1 ( caffeine ) Cleveland : no testing Colorado Springs , Colo. : no testing Columbus , Ohio : 5 ( azithromycin , roxithromycin , tylosin , virginiamycin and caffeine ) Concord , Calif. : 2 ( meprobamate and sulfamethoxazole ) Dallas : results pending Denver : ( unspecified antibiotics ) Detroit : ( unspecified drugs ) El Paso , Texas : no testing Fairfax , Va. : no testing Fort Worth , Texas : no testing Fresno , Calif. : no testing Honolulu : no testing Houston : no testing Indianapolis : 1 ( caffeine ) Jacksonville , Fla. : no testing Kansas City , Mo. : no testing Las Vegas : 3 ( carbamazepine , meprobamate and phenytoin ) Long Beach , Calif. : 2 ( meprobamate and phenytoin ) Los Angeles : 2 ( meprobamate and phenytoin ) Louisville , Ky. : 3 ( caffeine , carbamazepine and phenytoin ) Memphis , Tenn. : no testing Mesa , Ariz . : no testing Miami : no testing Milwaukee : 1 ( cotinine ) Minneapolis : 1 ( caffeine ) Nashville , Tenn. : no testing New Orleans : 3 ( clofibric acid , estrone and naproxen ) New York City : no testing Northern New Jersey : 7 ( caffeine , carbamazepine , codeine , cotinine , dehydronifedipine , diphenhydramine and sulfathiazole ) Oakland , Calif. : no testing Oklahoma City : no testing Omaha , Neb. : no testing Orlando , Fla. : no testing Philadelphia : 56 ( including amoxicillin , azithromycin , carbamazepine , diclofenac , prednisone and tetracycline ) Phoenix : no testing Portland , Ore. : 4 ( acetaminophen , caffeine , ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole ) Prince George 's and Montgomery counties , Md. : no testing Riverside County , Calif. : 2 ( meprobamate and phenytoin ) Sacramento , Calif. : no testing San Antonio : no testing San Diego : 3 ( ibuprofen , meprobamate and phenytoin ) San Francisco : 1 ( estradiol ) San Jose , Calif. : no testing Santa Clara , Calif. : no testing Seattle : no testing Southern California : 2 ( meprobamate and phenytoin ) Suffolk County , N.Y. : no testing Tucson , Ariz . : 3 ( carbamazepine , dehydronifedipine and sulfamethoxazole ) Tulsa , Okla . : no testing Virginia Beach , Va. : tests negative Washington , D.C. : 6 ( carbamazepine , caffeine , ibuprofen , monensin , naproxen and sulfamethoxazole ) Wichita , Kan. : no testing .
About the study :
At least one pharmaceutical was detected in tests of treated drinking water supplies for 24 major metropolitan areas , according to an Associated Press survey of 62 major water providers and data obtained from independent researchers .
Only 28 tested drinking water .
Three of those said results were negative ; Dallas says tests were conducted but results are not yet available .
Thirty - four locations said no testing was conducted .
Test protocols varied widely .
Some researchers looked only for one pharmaceutical or two ; others looked for many .
Some water systems said tests had been negative , but the AP found independent research showing otherwise .
Both prescription and non-prescription drugs were detected .
Because coffee and tobacco are so widely used , researchers say their byproducts are good indicators of the presence of pharmaceuticals .
Thus , they routinely test for , and often find , both caffeine and nicotine 's metabolite cotinine more frequently than other drugs .

ILL EFFECTS ?
Troubled by drugs discovered in European waters , poisons expert and biologist Francesco Pomati set up an experiment :
He exposed developing human kidney cells to a mixture of 13 drugs at levels mimicking those found in Italian rivers .
There were drugs to fight high cholesterol and blood pressure , seizures and depression , pain and infection , and cancer , all in tiny amounts .
The result :
The pharmaceutical blend slowed cell growth by up to a third suggesting that scant amounts may exert powerful effects , said Pomati , who works at the University of New South Wales in Sydney , Australia .
Taken alone , this was a modest study .
But in fact Pomati's work is part of a body of emerging scientific studies that indicate that over time , humans could be harmed by ingesting drinking water contaminated with tiny amounts of pharmaceuticals .
In another recently published study , Pomati discovered that some of those pharmaceuticals could amplify or reverse the effects of some others .
And Pomati's work indicates some drugs cause cellular effects at scant concentrations that strangely cannot be seen at higher levels .
Such findings are preliminary ; they alone cannot demonstrate the same effects within the human body .
But they provide scientific hints , just like cellular experiments that routinely guide discovery of new drugs .
They also heighten worry about the possible effects on especially vulnerable groups , like the very young , old or sick .
" My wife is pregnant , and I do n't let my wife drink the water ... , " said Pomati .
Elsewhere in the world , other researchers are finding results similar to Pomati's .
In research awaiting publication , human breast cancer cells grew twice as fast when exposed to estrogens taken from catfish caught near untreated sewage overflows in Pennsylvania , compared with other fish .
The University of Pittsburgh researchers did n't calculate how much effect came from pharmaceuticals instead of natural hormones , but their earlier work points to birth - control pills and hormone treatments as important contributors , said lead researcher Conrad Volz .
" There is the potential for an increased risk for those people who are prone to estrogenic cancer , " said Volz , who studies environmental hazards at the university 's Cancer Institute .
He said people who regularly drink water containing low levels of hormones may be at higher risk , since they would presumably consume more of these drugs than those who only occasionally eat such fish .
Scientists at the Helmholtz research center in Leipzig , Germany , linked low levels of the pain reliever diclofenac to an inflammatory - like response in human blood cells , according to biologist Kristin Schirmer .
Inflammation at the wrong time and place plays a role in conditions ranging from infections and arthritis to heart disease .
Sandra Steingraber , a biologist at New York 's Ithaca College , adds that many efforts to determine how trace drugs affect humans do n't fully consider the whole range of pharmaceuticals in the environment and whether someone has been exposed at more susceptible times , like during childhood or old age .
" The timing makes the poison as much as the dose , " she said .
" And the dose itself is not the dose from just any one thing it 's from this whole kaleidoscope of chemicals . "
Taking notice of accumulating evidence , the drug industry has backed studies of its own in recent years that have found very slight , if any , risk to humans .
But these studies have n't used water samples analyzed for drugs .
Instead , the studies estimate danger from what 's known about how much of a drug is sold and how toxic it is to animals .
Then , safety margins are added for unknowns , such as possible effects of decades of exposure .
Those margins are just educated guesses .
Also , the studies usually ignore what might happen to people exposed to the complex combinations of medicines that are often found in drinking water .
Then , there are the byproducts of the drugs .
When medications are digested and processed through water treatment plants , they may take a new metabolic form .
" They miss some of the big issues .
Our research shows mixtures are so prevalent , " said Dana Kolpin , a U.S. Geological Survey water expert who launched a plethora of research in 2002 after finding pharmaceuticals in most samples taken from 139 streams in 30 states .
" If there are any cumulative or additive issues , you can't just dismiss things so quickly . "
Even if Kolpin is right , the industry may be focusing on the wrong pharmaceuticals , said chemist James Shine at the Harvard School of Public Health , who oversaw what 's probably the broadest risk review yet , a yet - to - be- published study covering scores of the most common drugs sold in the United States .
As suspected , some chemotherapy drugs turn up high on that list .
But blood - pressure diuretics , though rarely considered , appear to pose more risk than many drugs more often evaluated .
Even when researchers downplay risk , that may not be the final word .
People " are going to be concerned about being medicated by mandate when you turn on the tap , " said Dr. Stevan Gressitt , a psychiatrist who 's led a push for a program in Maine that allows consumers to turn in unused pharmaceuticals for secure disposal or destruction .
" And that 's going to be seen if the level is ( only ) one molecule in 100 taps . " --
The Associated Press A vast array of pharmaceuticals — including antibiotics , anti-convulsants , mood stabilizers and sex hormones — have been found in the drinking water supplies of at least 41 million Americans , an Associated Press investigation shows .
To be sure , the concentrations of these pharmaceuticals are tiny , measured in quantities of parts per billion or trillion , far below the levels of a medical dose .
Also , utilities insist their water is safe .
WATER DEPARTMENTS : Reports rarely released to public BOTTLED WATER :
Is it any safer ?

But the presence of so many prescription drugs — and over - the - counter medicines like acetaminophen and ibuprofen — in so much of our drinking water is heightening worries among scientists of long - term consequences to human health .
In the course of a five - month inquiry , the AP discovered that drugs have been detected in the drinking water supplies of 24 major metropolitan areas — from Southern California to Northern New Jersey , from Detroit to Louisville Water providers rarely disclose results of pharmaceutical screenings , unless pressed , the AP found .
For example , the head of a group representing major California suppliers said the public " does n't know how to interpret the information " and might be unduly alarmed .
How do the drugs get into the water ?
People take pills .
Their bodies absorb some of the medication , but the rest of it passes through and is flushed down the toilet .
The wastewater is treated before it is discharged into reservoirs , rivers or lakes .
Then , some of the water is cleansed again at drinking water treatment plants and piped to consumers .
But most treatments do not remove all drug residue .
And while researchers do not yet understand the exact risks from decades of persistent exposure to random combinations of low levels of pharmaceuticals , recent studies — which have gone virtually unnoticed by the general public — have found alarming effects on human cells and wildlife .
" We recognize it is a growing concern and we 're taking it very seriously , " said Benjamin H. Grumbles , assistant administrator for water at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
Members of the AP National Investigative Team reviewed hundreds of scientific reports , analyzed federal drinking water databases , visited environmental study sites and treatment plants and interviewed more than 230 officials , academics and scientists .
They also surveyed the nation 's 50 largest cities and a dozen other major water providers , as well as smaller community water providers in all 50 states .
Here are some of the key test results obtained by the AP : • Officials in Philadelphia said testing there discovered 56 pharmaceuticals or byproducts in treated drinking water , including medicines for pain , infection , high cholesterol , asthma , epilepsy , mental illness and heart problems .
Sixty - three pharmaceuticals or byproducts were found in the city 's watersheds .
• Anti-epileptic and anti-anxiety medications were detected in a portion of the treated drinking water for 18.5 million people in Southern California .
• Researchers at the U.S. Geological Survey analyzed a Passaic Valley Water Commission drinking water treatment plant , which serves 850,000 people in Northern New Jersey , and found a metabolized angina medicine and the mood - stabilizing carbamazepine in drinking water .
•
A sex hormone was detected in San Francisco 's drinking water .
•
The drinking water for Washington , D.C. , and surrounding areas tested positive for six pharmaceuticals .
•
Three medications , including an antibiotic , were found in drinking water supplied to Tucson .
The situation is undoubtedly worse than suggested by the positive test results in the major population centers documented by the AP .
The federal government does n't require any testing and has n't set safety limits for drugs in water .
Of the 62 major water providers contacted , the drinking water for only 28 was tested .
Among the 34 that have n't : Houston , Chicago , Miami , Baltimore , Phoenix , Boston and New York City 's Department of Environmental Protection , which delivers water to 9 million people .
Some providers screen only for one or two pharmaceuticals , leaving open the possibility that others are present .
The AP 's investigation also indicates that watersheds , the natural sources of most of the nation 's water supply , also are contaminated .
Tests were conducted in the watersheds of 35 of the 62 major providers surveyed by the AP , and pharmaceuticals were detected in 28 .
Yet officials in six of those 28 metropolitan areas said they did not go on to test their drinking water — Fairfax , Va. ; Montgomery County in Maryland ; Omaha ; Oklahoma City ; Santa Clara , Calif. , and New York City .
The New York state health department and the USGS tested the source of the city 's water , upstate .
They found trace concentrations of heart medicine , infection fighters , estrogen , anti-convulsants , a mood stabilizer and a tranquilizer .
City water officials declined repeated requests for an interview .
In a statement , they insisted that " New York City 's drinking water continues to meet all federal and state regulations regarding drinking water quality in the watershed and the distribution system " — regulations that do not address trace pharmaceuticals .
In several cases , officials at municipal or regional water providers told the AP that pharmaceuticals had not been detected , but the AP obtained the results of tests conducted by independent researchers that showed otherwise .
For example , water department officials in New Orleans said their water had not been tested for pharmaceuticals , but a Tulane University researcher and his students have published a study that found the pain reliever naproxen , the sex hormone estrone and the anti-cholesterol drug byproduct clofibric acid in treated drinking water .
Of the 28 major metropolitan areas where tests were performed on drinking water supplies , only Albuquerque ; Austin , Texas ; and Virginia Beach ; said tests were negative .
The drinking water in Dallas has been tested , but officials are awaiting results .
Arlington ,
Texas , acknowledged that traces of a pharmaceutical were detected in its drinking water but cited post - 9/11 security concerns in refusing to identify the drug .
The AP also contacted 52 small water providers — one in each state , and two each in Missouri and Texas — that serve communities with populations around 25,000 .
All but one said their drinking water had not been screened for pharmaceuticals ; officials in Emporia , Kan. , refused to answer AP 's questions , also citing post - 9/11 issues .
Rural consumers who draw water from their own wells are n't in the clear either , experts say .
The Stroud Water Research Center , in Avondale , Pa. , has measured water samples from New York City 's upstate watershed for caffeine , a common contaminant that scientists often look for as a possible signal for the presence of other pharmaceuticals .
Though more caffeine was detected at suburban sites , researcher Anthony Aufdenkampe was struck by the relatively high levels even in less populated areas .
He suspects it escapes from failed septic tanks , maybe with other drugs .
" Septic systems are essentially small treatment plants that are essentially unmanaged and therefore tend to fail , " Aufdenkampe said .
Even users of bottled water and home filtration systems do n't necessarily avoid exposure .
Bottlers , some of which simply repackage tap water , do not typically treat or test for pharmaceuticals , according to the industry 's main trade group .
The same goes for the makers of home filtration systems .
Contamination is not confined to the United States .
More than 100 different pharmaceuticals have been detected in lakes , rivers , reservoirs and streams throughout the world .
Studies have detected pharmaceuticals in waters throughout Asia , Australia , Canada and Europe — even in Swiss lakes and the North Sea .
For example , in Canada , a study of 20 Ontario drinking water treatment plants by a national research institute found nine different drugs in water samples .
Japanese health officials in December called for human health impact studies after detecting prescription drugs in drinking water at seven different sites .
In the United States , the problem is n't confined to surface waters .
Pharmaceuticals also permeate aquifers deep underground , source of 40 % of the nation 's water supply .
Federal scientists who drew water in 24 states from aquifers near contaminant sources such as landfills and animal feed lots found minuscule levels of hormones , antibiotics and other drugs .
Perhaps it 's because Americans have been taking drugs — and flushing them unmetabolized or unused — in growing amounts .
Over the past five years , the number of U.S. prescriptions rose 12 % to a record 3.7 billion , while non-prescription drug purchases held steady around 3.3 billion , according to IMS Health and The Nielsen Co . " People think that if they take a medication , their body absorbs it and it disappears , but of course that 's not the case , " said EPA scientist Christian Daughton , one of the first to draw attention to the issue of pharmaceuticals in water in the United States .
Some drugs , including widely used cholesterol fighters , tranquilizers and anti-epileptic medications , resist modern drinking water and wastewater treatment processes .
Plus , the EPA says there are no sewage treatment systems specifically engineered to remove pharmaceuticals .
One technology , reverse osmosis , removes virtually all pharmaceutical contaminants but is very expensive for large - scale use and leaves several gallons of polluted water for every one that is made drinkable .
Another issue :
There 's evidence that adding chlorine , a common process in conventional drinking water treatment plants , makes some pharmaceuticals more toxic .
Human waste is n't the only source of contamination .
Cattle , for example , are given ear implants that provide a slow release of trenbolone , an anabolic steroid used by some bodybuilders , which causes cattle to bulk up .
But not all the trenbolone circulating in a steer is metabolized .
A German study showed 10 % of the steroid passed right through the animals .
Water sampled downstream of a Nebraska feedlot had steroid levels four times as high as the water taken upstream .
Male fathead minnows living in that downstream area had low testosterone levels and small heads .
Other veterinary drugs also play a role .
Pets are now treated for arthritis , cancer , heart disease , diabetes , allergies , dementia , and even obesity — sometimes with the same drugs as humans .
The inflation - adjusted value of veterinary drugs rose by 8 % , to $ 5.2 billion , over the past five years , according to an analysis of data from the Animal Health Institute .
Ask the pharmaceutical industry whether the contamination of water supplies is a problem , and officials will tell you no .
" Based on what we now know , I would say we find there 's little or no risk from pharmaceuticals in the environment to human health , " said microbiologist Thomas White , a consultant for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America .
But at a conference last summer , Mary Buzby — director of environmental technology for drug maker Merck & Co. Inc. — said : " There 's no doubt about it , pharmaceuticals are being detected in the environment and there is genuine concern that these compounds , in the small concentrations that they 're at , could be causing impacts to human health or to aquatic organisms . "
Recent laboratory research has found that small amounts of medication have affected human embryonic kidney cells , human blood cells and human breast cancer cells .
The cancer cells proliferated too quickly ; the kidney cells grew too slowly ; and the blood cells showed biological activity associated with inflammation .
Also , pharmaceuticals in waterways are damaging wildlife across the nation and around the globe , research shows .
Notably , male fish are being feminized , creating egg yolk proteins , a process usually restricted to females .
Pharmaceuticals also are affecting sentinel species at the foundation of the pyramid of life — such as earth worms in the wild and zooplankton in the laboratory , studies show .
Some scientists stress that the research is extremely limited , and there are too many unknowns .
They say , though , that the documented health problems in wildlife are disconcerting .
" It brings a question to people 's minds that if the fish were affected ... might there be a potential problem for humans ? "
EPA research biologist Vickie Wilson told the AP .
" It could be that the fish are just exquisitely sensitive because of their physiology or something .
We have n't gotten far enough along . "
With limited research funds , said Shane Snyder , research and development project manager at the Southern Nevada Water Authority , a greater emphasis should be put on studying the effects of drugs in water .
" I think it 's a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there , and so little is being spent on human health , " said Snyder .
" They need to just accept that these things are everywhere — every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there .
It 's time for the EPA to step up to the plate and make a statement about the need to study effects , both human and environmental . "
To the degree that the EPA is focused on the issue , it appears to be looking at detection .
Grumbles acknowledged that just late last year the agency developed three new methods to " detect and quantify pharmaceuticals " in wastewater .
" We realize that we have a limited amount of data on the concentrations , " he said .
" We 're going to be able to learn a lot more . "
While Grumbles said the EPA had analyzed 287 pharmaceuticals for possible inclusion on a draft list of candidates for regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act , he said only one , nitroglycerin , was on the list .
Nitroglycerin can be used as a drug for heart problems , but the key reason it 's being considered is its widespread use in making explosives .
So much is unknown .
Many independent scientists are skeptical that trace concentrations will ultimately prove to be harmful to humans .
Confidence about human safety is based largely on studies that poison lab animals with much higher amounts .
There 's growing concern in the scientific community , meanwhile , that certain drugs — or combinations of drugs — may harm humans over decades because water , unlike most specific foods , is consumed in sizable amounts every day .
Our bodies may shrug off a relatively big one - time dose , yet suffer from a smaller amount delivered continuously over a half century , perhaps subtly stirring allergies or nerve damage .
Pregnant women , the elderly and the very ill might be more sensitive .
Many concerns about chronic low - level exposure focus on certain drug classes : chemotherapy that can act as a powerful poison ; hormones that can hamper reproduction or development ; medicines for depression and epilepsy that can damage the brain or change behavior ; antibiotics that can allow human germs to mutate into more dangerous forms ; pain relievers and blood - pressure diuretics .
For several decades , federal environmental officials and non-profit watchdog environmental groups have focused on regulated contaminants — pesticides , lead , PCBs — which are present in higher concentrations and clearly pose a health risk .
However , some experts say medications may pose a unique danger because , unlike most pollutants , they were crafted to act on the human body .
" These are chemicals that are designed to have very specific effects at very low concentrations .
That 's what pharmaceuticals do .
So when they get out to the environment , it should not be a shock to people that they have effects , " says zoologist John Sumpter at Brunel University in London , who has studied trace hormones , heart medicine and other drugs .
And while drugs are tested to be safe for humans , the timeframe is usually over a matter of months , not a lifetime .
Pharmaceuticals also can produce side effects and interact with other drugs at normal medical doses .
That 's why — aside from therapeutic doses of fluoride injected into potable water supplies — pharmaceuticals are prescribed to people who need them , not delivered to everyone in their drinking water .
" We know we are being exposed to other people 's drugs through our drinking water , and that can't be good , " says Dr. David Carpenter , who directs the Institute for Health and the Environment of the State University of New York at Albany .

Defense contractor orders Iraq employees to surrender cell phones
KBR , Inc. , formerly a division of Halliburton as Kellogg , Brown & Root , has ordered employees in the Middle East to turn in their personal cell phones , citing " a safety and security concern . "
As CNN reported , an e-mail sent to KBR employees in Iraq , Afghanistan and Kuwait ordered employees to stop using their phones and turn them in , warning of disciplinary action , including termination , for noncompliance .
One employee , refusing to surrender his phone , said that no reason was given for the demand , and that he was " not aware of any security breaches involving the use of cell phones . "
" KBR has a communication system , but as with any system it does fail and we can only communicate with another installation by use of the cell phones , " the employee added .
" We pay for this use with our own funds . "
" The matter giving rise to this message is stil being reviewed by KBR management , so the company will not provide further comment at this time , " KBR spokesperson Heather L. Browne said in a statement .
DREW JOINS THE ENOUGH CLUB … .
It seemed unlikely that Elizabeth Drew , an accomplished journalist and author , would join the ever - growing “ Enough ” Club .
She did , after all , write a glowing book about John McCain as recently as 2002 , praising him as a principled , honorable man of conscience .
But now , Drew ’s done .
After noting McCain ’s shift to the hard right , away from the 2000 persona that made him a hero to many , Drew explains that McCain “ morph[ed ] into just another panderer — to Bush and the Republican Party ’s conservative base . ”
[ S ] ome very smart political analysts believed from the outset that McCain could win the nomination by sticking with his old self .
And they still believe that McCain won the nomination not because he gave himself over to the base but as a result of a process of elimination of inferior candidates who divided up the conservative vote , as these observers had predicted .
( These people insisted on anonymity because McCain is known in Republican circles to have a long memory and a vindictive streak . )
By then I had already concluded that that there was a disturbingly erratic side of McCain ’s nature .
There ’s a certain lack of seriousness in him .
And he does not appear to be a reflective man , or very interested in domestic issues . [… ]
McCain ’s recent conduct of his campaign — his willingness to lie repeatedly ( including in his acceptance speech ) and to play Russian roulette with the vice - presidency , in order to fulfill his long - held ambition — has reinforced my earlier , and growing , sense that John McCain is not a principled man .
In fact , it ’s not clear who he is .
McCain is certainly losing friends fast , is n’t he ?
Drew ’s condemnation comes just a couple of days after Richard Cohen’s .
Which came a couple of days after Stephen Chapman’s .
Which followed Michael Kinsley , Thomas Friedman , Sebastian Mallaby , Joe Klein , E.J. Dionne , Jr. , Ruth Marcus , Mark Halperin , and Bob Herbert .
Even David Brooks is getting there .
All admired John McCain , all held him in the highest regard , and all of have been disgusted as McCain has descended into a Republican hack .
McCain probably does n’t care — hacks ca n’t be bothered to earn and keep respect — but their collective revolt tells us quite a bit about McCain ’s transition .
From Vanessa Thomas : " Line 1110 of the source code just made my day . "
Rick Olson clicked " yes " because " Danger " is his middle name .
Elizabeth 's only thought when this popped up was " Yes .
Yes , it would be . "

I spent many years working in nursing homes and cancer clinics , and you would n’t think those sorts of jobs would make you want to physically beat on your coworkers , but oh how I did want to .
Because I swear to God , few things make me feel stabby like hearing someone talk to an elderly or sick person in babytalk .
Not only does it simply not help , but it ’s rude and disrespectful .
And now there has been an actual study done that proves I am right .
Via Hot Air Headlines .
Williams , who has more than 20 years of experience as a nurse working with older adults , says that based on this assumption , many hospital and nursing - home caregivers communicate in “ elderspeak . ”
This includes using basic vocabulary and grammar , speaking in a high - pitched or loud voice , sounding overly caring or controlling , and using terms of endearment such as “ honey ” and “ sweetie , ” Williams says .
“ Elderspeak is a kind of talk or communication that is common between younger adults and older adults in a variety of settings , ” she says , adding that it ’s not too far from “ baby talk . ”
But her latest study , presented Monday at the 2008 Alzheimer ’s Association International Conference on Alzheimer ’s Disease , shows that this language might have the opposite effect .
… When staff members spoke in elderspeak , the residents ’ resistance to care nearly doubled compared with when staff spoke normally .
Even in silence , dementia patients were more cooperative than when hearing elderspeak .
Hmph .
That ’s what I thought .
When I first started at the nursing home as a nurse ’s aide way back in the day , I was assigned a resident I ’ll call Mary who allegedly refused to eat .
I remember the nurses telling me she was a real handful , very uncooperative , blah blah , “ and good luck trying to get her to eat . ”
Okay fine .
So the first day , I brought Mary her breakfast and sure enough , she was n’t too interested .
I was sitting with her , trying to figure out how to rectify this situation but not saying much because I just did n’t know what would work , when one of the more obnoxious nurses walked by the room and decided to stop in and show me just how “ difficult ” Mary was .
And it began :
Oh now Maaaarrrrrryy honey , let ’s not be hard on the new aide today mmmmkayyyy ?
Let ’s see if we can get you to eeaaatttt something mmkay ?
Can you be a good girl for us and just eat a bite of your eeeeggggssss ?
Of course replete with the high - pitched squeak at the end of each drawn - out word , precisely how you might talk to a 6 - month - old .
It was when she said “ can you be a good girl ” that I started wanting to beat on the nurse .
Can you be a good girl ?
Are you freaking KIDDING me with this shit ?
Are you really addressing a 90 - year - old woman like that ?
Mary lived up to the nurse ’s low expectations and refused to eat , muttering something about how the food was no good , and the nurse got frustrated and left the room but not without the brilliant advice to me that I should n’t “ waste my time if Mary ’s not going to be helpful . ”
Oh god GET OUT .
My whole life , I ’ve hated that babytalk nonsense , and as soon as I saw it in action like this I figured maybe that ’s what Mary ’s problem was , maybe she was depressed because she lived in a tiny room with no visitors and everyone talked to her like she was an infant .
I knew it might get me fired or at least hated by the nurse if she overheard me but I did n’t care because it seemed to me that Mary eating was more important , so I just flat - out asked Mary : “ Does it bother you when people talk to you like that ?
Because it sure as heck bothers me hearing it . ”
Bam .
Mary cracked up in giggles and reached over to squeeze my arm and said that yes , as a matter of fact , it pissed her right the hell off .
We chatted a little , I told her it was my biggest pet peeve in life , she told me her biggest pet peeve ( something to do with Bob Saget ) , and thus she was cheered up and thus she ate her breakfast but only after making me add extra butter .
Pretty simple .
Never had any trouble getting her to eat after that .
She just wanted some adult human interaction ; it helped her appetite .
Anyway .
It ’s not just old people that so many healthcare workers do this to .
When I was up visiting Rupert ’s dad in the rehab hospital , they did it to him .
One of the recovery room nurses did it to Rupert after his surgery , too .
It ’s like they see someone in a hospital gown and immediately deduct 30 points off their IQ .
Drives me NUTS .
So I am just here to tell you , in case you ’re one of the people who talks to patients or the sickly like they ’re babies : do n’t do that .
You sound like an idiot , you are n’t helping , and it ’s just plain rude .
MOSCOW 
Three days after the Czech Republic signed an agreement with the United States to host a tracking radar for an antiballistic missile system that Russia vehemently opposes , the authorities in Prague said the flow of Russian oil to their country was beginning to dwindle .
In a statement on Friday , Czech officials declined to link the reduced supply to the deal signed Tuesday in Prague .
Still , though the flow of oil can vary for technical reasons , it was clear that the Czechs suspected a connection and intended to ask the Russians to explain the decline .
Russia maintains that the missiles meant to shoot down other missiles pose a threat to its own nuclear deterrence .
The Bush administration says they are intended instead to counter a threat from Iran , which launched nine missiles on Wednesday .
In the deal , the Czech Republic agreed to have the United States place a tracking radar on Czech territory .
That radar would be linked to interceptor missiles elsewhere ; the United States is in talks with Poland and Lithuania to host those .
Here 's proof that Citroen is set to come out of its shell when it comes to car design - because the ' tin snail ' is back !
These pictures show how a successor to the 2CV is shaping up .
Boasting a thoroughly modern interpretation of the classic design , it has its eyes on the lucrative family car market .
Based on insider information , our pictures show what you have to look forward to .
Taking over where the Evoque concept car of 2005 left off ( Issue 865 ) the shape is instantly recognisable and could n't be confused with anything else .
As Fiat has done with the 500 and VW with the Beetle , Citroen has followed the current trend for reinventing classic models .
By cashing in on the charm of the original 2CV , the French firm is set to launch into uncharted territory - going up against prestige models such as BMW 's MINI .
With the same curved bonnet , slab sides and covered rear wheels , it looks just like the original 2CV , which first appeared in 1948 .
Trademark details such as the slatted bonnet and double chevron grille remain intact .
But with flush - fitting windows and faired - in lights , the shape has been given a modern update .
It promises to be extremely eco-friendly , too .
With car firms ever more concerned about their impact on the environment , the 2CV will be a showcase for Citroen 's green technology .
It 's likely to be made from plastic body panels , and with power coming from a hybrid diesel engine ( see below ) , it should boast low fuel consumption and emissions .
As with the exterior , the cabin will draw on its famous predecessor with a minimalist look .
A large , thin - rimmed steering wheel dominates the interior , while the fixed central hub contains controls for the stereo .
There will also be a retro speedometer , and as with the original car , the gearlever will be mounted in the centre of the dashboard .
However , while the 2CV was designed to be cheap and cheerful , the newcomer will feature lots of hi-tech kit as standard , including sat-nav and connectivity for the latest handheld gadgets .
As with the MINI , personalisation will be a big part of the 2CV 's appeal , with contrasting body panel colours , seat trims and the option of a full - length sunroof .
It 's possible the Citroen could feature panoramic glass , as well as a removable canvas top .
Under the skin , the 2CV is likely to use platform architecture from the C3 supermini and C4 hatch , featuring a front - wheel - drive layout and a comfortable driving experience .
The new model will be positioned above the C3 in Citroen 's range , and will carry a premium price .
Although the firm is tight - lipped about production , our sources indicate that a concept version could appear in 2009 .
A Yale professor of physiology has scientifically proven that 's impossible to get drunk on beer .
It 's true !
The numbers do n't lie !
So drink away , citizens — at work , at home , at breakfast , anytime !
Of course , there 's a catch : this scientician decided this in 1955 , when things were simultaneously much more uptight and also sooo much cooler .
Dr. Leon A. Greenberg ,
Yale professor of physiology , said beer is n't [ intoxicating ] – and should be reclassified to the non-intoxicating drinks .
This brought emphatic objection from other scientists .
They wanted to know if the man who is " high " or " tight " is n't also drunk .
Beer certainly makes people " high " and " tight , " they said .
That 's a good question !
It depends on what this " high " or " tight " man is drinking ?
For people to show consistently the " abnormal behavior " which goes with intoxication , the alcohol content of their blood must be 0.15 per cent or higher .
THE AVERAGE alcohol content of American beers is 3.7 per cent by weight .
In order for the alcohol blood level to be at 0.15 per cent , there would have to be two and one - half quarts of 3.7 beer in the stomach .
But the capacity of the human stomach is one and one - half to two quarts .
Therefore , no one can drink enough beer at one time to get intoxicated , according to theory .
As for doing it by degrees : beer is destroyed or eliminated in the body at the rate of one - third of a quart an hour .
So three quarts would have to be consumed in two or three hours , and this , he said , was " physiologically unnatural . "
See ?
It 's air - tight .
Back when 0.15 was considered , like , almost drunk .
The good old days .
Also it 's totally true !
We fiddled around with this handy intoxication calculator and we'd need to down 5 beers in one hour to get to like 0.11 .
And we 'd still be legal to drive home to 1955 !
Thanks , science !
But it is n't that simple .
Not by a long shot .
The findings might be interpreted as confirmation that high - fructose corn syrup -- the much maligned sweetener added to many processed foods -- really does cause more weight gain than the other sugars we eat .
" Our study shows for the first time the surprising speed with which humans make body fat from fructose , " lead author Elizabeth Parks , PhD , of UTSW 's Center for Human Nutrition .
Research from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center ( UTSW ) shows that the body turns fructose into fat more efficiently than it does other sugars .
July 31 , 2008 -- Dieters know to limit their sugar intake , but new research suggests that not all sugars are equal when it comes to packing on the pounds .
Sugars : Fructose , Glucose , and Sucrose
Parks and her research team studied the simple sugar fructose , not high - fructose corn syrup or sucrose , which are a mix of fructose and glucose .
Just about all the sugar we eat in foods , including those in fruits , contain some fructose and glucose .
" The goal was not to test the effects of high - fructose corn syrup , " Parks tells WebMD .
" The study did n't address that . "
Instead , the researchers wanted to find out if fructose is more likely to lead to fat development than glucose .
They did this by feeding six healthy people breakfast drinks containing three different sugar combinations followed by a carefully controlled lunch over several weeks .
In one test , the breakfast drink contained 100 % glucose , similar to the oral glucose test doctors give when they suspect diabetes .
In another , the drink was half glucose and half fructose , and in the third , the drink was 25 % glucose and 75 % fructose .
The researchers measured the conversion of the sugars to fat in the liver and how the morning sugar meal influenced the metabolization of foods eaten later in the day .
They found that lipogenesis -- the process by which sugars are turned to body fat -- increased significantly when the breakfast drinks contained fructose .
In addition , the study suggested that when fructose is eaten with fat or before fat is consumed , the fat is more likely to be stored rather than burned , Parks says .
Parks explains that the liver tends to act like a traffic cop for glucose , determining whether glucose will be burned for energy or stored as fat .
Fructose , on the other hand , seems to bypass the process .
" Fructose gets made into fat more quickly , and when that process is turned on there seems to be a signal that goes to the liver that says store all the other fats you are seeing , " she says .
McCain 's camp claims the senator is partly responsible for the tentative bailout plan .
McCain claims bailout credit
Previewing a McCain campaign message for the days ahead , top strategist Steve Schmidt claimed Sunday that Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) is partly responsible for the tentative agreement on a mortgage bailout that congressional leaders announced shortly after midnight .
Schmidt was appearing on NBC’s “ Meet the Press ” with David Axelrod , the Obama campaign ’s chief strategist , who ridiculed the McCain claim as “ a little bit of fiction . ”

Obama , asked on CBS ’s “ Face the Nation ” if McCain deserved credit for bringing lawmakers together , replied “ No , ” according to AP .
McCain himself was modest , saying on ABC ’s “ This Week ” that congressional negotiators deserve “ great credit ” for the bipartisan deal .
“ " It was n’t because of me , ” McCain said .
“ They did it themselves . ”
McCain initially took a low - profile role in the bailout debate , saying little at a White House meeting and not even saying which version he favored .
His campaign released a list of 17 phone calls he had made on Saturday , from President Bush 11 House members .
Schmidt argued : “ Earlier in the week , when Senator McCain came back to Washington , there had been no deal reached .
…
What Senator McCain was able to do was to help bring all the parties to the table , including the House Republicans . ”
Axelrod responded : “ When this crisis emerged , Senator McCain 's first reaction was to say the economy is fundamentally strong .
The next day , he suggested a commission to study this .
And by eight days later , he said it was such a crisis that he was going to suspend his campaign .
He showed up a day later in Washington .
“ It is n't clear what his role was .
So it ’s a little bit of fiction to now claim credit for it .
That 's not the important thing , though .
The important thing is that the principles that Senator Obama outlined originally are now embraced and taxpayers will be protected . ”
Moderator Tom Brokaw billed the 15 - minute segment as “ Schmidt versus Axelrod , ” a first joint appearance .
The appearance was contentious throughout , with the two top strategists occasionally talking over each other .
Axelrod started by tweaking Schmidt about McCain ’s threat to skip the debate , saying : “ It was a great setting .
It was a great debate – glad that it went forward , glad you guys came . ”
Schmidt then referred to Obama as “ a great talker . ”
And Schmidt said Obama had not used the word “ victory ” in the debate .
The Obama campaign is launching an ad on national cable Monday pointing out that McCain had not mentioned “ the middle class . ”
Schmidt said he addressed middle - class concerned but did not use those words .
Obama had suggested in a statement earlier Sunday morning that he is likely to support the latest bailout proposal , although he would review it if he were elected president .
Schmidt also suggested McCain is likely to support the tentative agreement : “ He ’s happy that there appears to be a framework completed .
… Senator McCain looks forward to reading the fine print of this .
But it does appear that great progress has been made overnight . ”
On other matters , Axelrod acknowledged Obama may have to rethink his priorities because of money constraints imposed by the financial breakdown .
“ Obviously we ’re going to have to look at the budget , and Senator Obama said he ’s going go through it line by line and he ’s going to get rid of things that do n’t work , ” Axelrod said .
“ We have , for example , a reading program that was installed by the Bush administration that turned out to be a big boondoggle – it ’s not helping any kids learn .
We ought to say :
That does n’t work ; let ’s get rid of it .
“ And that ’s the approach he ’s going to take .
If we ’re going to do … the things that are going to strengthen the middle class in our economy , we ’re going to have to be very flinty - eyed about what we can keep and what we do n’t . ”

Democrats.com has its first winner in the Pelosi Video Contest !
Congratulations to Anthony from We Are Change Ohio for his outstanding effort to get an answer from Speaker Pelosi !
Andrew writes :
I confronted Nancy Pelosi with the full articles of Impeachment .
The crimes were highlighted .
I have the full details of the confrontation in my video .
It was extremely difficult to not only record the confrontation fully , but also to bring her the articles because security was n’t allowing any cameras or allowing anyone to bring anything to her other than her book .
So I literally had to sneak all this by .
I maintained integrity by remaining polite and trying to get a response out of her without getting aggressive like other have been .
I kept my confrontation on the point and not only did I confront her with this but I got two responses .
I got her to admit that she has n’t read the articles of impeachment and when I mentioned that all the crimes that Bush has done like eviscerating the Constitution she replied “ that ’s terrible ” .
Unfortunately I was only able to get audio but I still have the footage in its original form on my camera intact .
I hope this is the answer you folks were looking for and I did my best .
She has n’t read the articles of impeachment and the crimes listed in the articles are “ terrible ” according to her .
Bob Fertik , President of Democrats.com said : “ Pelosi Video Contest remains open so we encourage everyone to keep trying to get a substantive answer from Pelosi to our question :

Firefighters worked until Wednesday morning to extinguish a three - alarm blaze on the top floor of an Apple computer office building in Cupertino , a fire captain said .
The fire broke out around 10 p.m. Tuesday in the area of a heating and air conditioning unit on the roof of the two - story Apple Six building at 20604 Valley Green Drive , Santa Clara County fire captain Daron Pisciotta said .
Construction crews had been working on the unit when the fire started , he added .
No one was injured but smoke and water damage to the west wing of the 120,000 - square - foot building was extensive .
Firefighters controlled the blaze in about three hours but remained on the scene until 7 a.m .
" The cause appears to be accidental and related to construction , " Pisciotta said

Standard Operating Procedure : The People Behind the Abu Ghraib Abuse
Academy Award winner and documentary filmmaker Errol Morris ’s Standard Operating Procedure is an inquiry into the prisoner torture and abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib prison .
It is , predictably , a very bleak and depressing movie .
But the very scale of Standard Operating Procedure , which in its expensive - looking production values , special effects and elaborately choreographed re-enactments , shows that Errol Morris has grown weary of working in the dimly lit outer fringes of motion picture productions , to which documentary filmmakers are still too often relegated .
Standard Operating Procedure is a big , provocative and disturbing work , although what makes it most provocative is that its greatest ambitions are for its own visual style .
In sweeping strokes , the documentary addresses many of the issues that abound when government - authorized torture is accompanied by that very government ’s public denial of responsibility , leaving young male and female soldiers bereft of anything except their own poorly - informed tactics .
Morris explains that a major force driving the project was the profusion of photographs that were taken by the American soldiers at the Abu Ghraib prison that document , in horrifyingly graphic detail , the prisoner abuse that those very soldiers helped to perpetuate .
Morris and his documentary crew “ set out to examine the context of these photographs , ” attempting to uncover what had happened within the accepted narrative about the torture .
For him the photographs functioned as both an exposé and a cover - up because while they revealed the horror , they also “ convinced journalists and readers they had seen everything . ”
Morris was n’t convinced that he had seen everything .
He made this movie , which at its finest and most focussed , tries to investigate how seeing both does and does not evolve into understanding .
To that end , Morris employed two familiar documentary strategies : direct - address interviews and re-enactments in which actors re-enact actual historical events .
As a tactic , the interviews with some of the soldiers who actually carried out the torture and abuse at Iraq ’s Abu Ghraib prison could have enabled the documentary ’s subjects to speak for themselves , to raise their own voices .
Unfortunately , as the film progresses , it becomes clear that even when those subjects are able to speak from the vantage point of looking back in retrospect , they are only capable of providing , or willing to provide , anything more than defensive testimonies on their own behalves .
It is testimony to a government ’s pervasive moral vacuum .

OAK HILLS – A swarm of bees surrounded the home of an Oak Hills woman , trapping her inside as she watched in horror as hundreds of bees attacked her two dogs outside , killing one .
“ The worst thing for me was looking out the door and seeing Chewy looking up at me – ‘ help me , let me in ’ – and I could n’t do it , ” said the resident , who asked to be identified only by her first name , Linda .
Linda said she watched helplessly through the window as Chewy , a 15 - year - old cocker mix , and her other dog looked for some sign of help .
The second dog , a boxer , was critically injured from bee stings and is recovering at home in the 12000 block of Stuveling Street in Oak Hills .
Linda ’s yellow Labrador retriever jumped into a pond on the property to escape the bees .
Joe Harris of Harris Termite and Pest Control said the bees were particularly angry – something that is becoming more and more common from Oak Hills to Pinion Hills .
“ At Linda ’s place those bees were very , very , very , very aggressive , extremely aggressive , ” he said .
Harris is not sure what type of bees they are but they are aggressive enough that even in a protective bee suit , it was difficult to get close to the hive .
It took several attempts before they were exterminated , Harris said .
Linda said she initially contacted a beekeeper to remove the hive on one of the columns of her portico outside the front door .
But when her eldest son was stung , she decided they had to go .
One bee expert pounded on the column with a hammer , she said .
That ’s when the bees started showing aggressive tendencies and the keeper recommend calling an exterminator .
Shortly afterward , the bees began swarming and then they attacked the dogs .
Harris said afterward , he received several other calls about bees swarming in the area .
“ God was looking out for me that day , ” Linda said , “ because I called four different exterminators and none of them could come out for four or five hours and I was trapped in my house watching my animals die . ”

Have you ever heard of the Institute for Justice ( IJ ) ?
They 're like the ACLU , except they tackle those issues that the ACLU wo n't touch – you know , things that are n't free speech or abortion issues , like unfair licensing schemes and eminent domain abuse .
This is from their Profile :
Founded in 1991 , the Institute for Justice is what a civil liberties law firm should be .
As our nation 's only libertarian public interest law firm , we engage in cutting - edge litigation and advocacy both in the courts of law and in the court of public opinion on behalf of individuals whose most basic rights are denied by the government –like the right to earn an honest living , private property rights , and the right to free speech , especially in the areas of commercial and Internet speech .
As Wired magazine said , the Institute for Justice “ helps individuals subject to wacky government regulations . ”
Simply put , we challenge the government when it stands in the way of people trying to earn an honest living , when it unconstitutionally takes away individuals ' property , when bureaucrats instead of parents dictate the education of children , and when government stifles speech .
We seek a rule of law under which individuals can control their destinies as free and responsible members of society .
They 're awesome – you should sign up for their newsletter .
They ended the dance ban in Pinal County , AZ ; they successfully defended an impoverished woman 's right to braid her neighbor 's hair for money without having to go through expensive and unnecessary licensing procedures ; they even broke up the casket cartel in Missouri , allowing private vendors to sell caskets without a funeral director 's license .
You see , most of these licensing schemes are in place to prevent new competition in a field .
It is a way for rent - seeking businesses to maintain cartel prices .
By making the entry cost into a market artificially high , they effectively weed out a certain percentage of their competition .
As Nobel Prize - winning economist Milton Friedman famously said , “ licensure almost inevitably becomes a tool in the hands of a special producer group to obtain a monopoly position at the expense of the rest of the public .
There is no way to avoid this result . ”
These schemes often mire self - starters in unnecessary poverty , and hamper the market 's ability to provide services at affordable prices .
As James Harris points out , “ Today , an incredible one in five Americans must secure the government 's permission to pursue their occupation — a figure that has risen from about one in 20 in the 1950s . ”
Army medic Matt Bell could n't even tie his own shoes , after he was shot by a sniper , just above the left clavicle .
There was major nerve damage in one hand ; a shoulder was barely functional .
Now , a year and half later , Bell has a great deal of his mobility back – thanks , in part , to his Nintendo Wii .
“ ' Wii Sports ' forces him to grip the remote - controller and move his hand , and sometimes his entire arm , to play successfully , " Soldiers magazine notes .
" Guitar Hero promotes dexterity in his fingers , which became rigid from lack of use after his injury . "
* Hector Romero , another WRAMC
[ Walter Reed Army Medical Center ] occupational therapist , said the Wii focuses a patient ’s attention on playing , not on the pain and fatigue that often accompany rehabilitation .
* *“ When the body is hurt , it tries to stop movement because all it wants to do is heal , ” Romero said .
“ With the Wii , patients overcome their fears and the body ’s reaction to movement .
It is a positive distraction , and is extremely effective in improving dexterity and eliciting an increased range of motion . ” *
Obviously , Bell has had all kinds of surgeries and types of rehab , too .
But Walter Reed 's therapists are combining the Wii with the more traditional therapies .
* Romero gave the example of a patient with an upper - extremity injury who was asked to hold a weight in his hand with his elbow bent , which forces the forearm down and stretches the muscles , ligaments and tendons .
The exercise can be painful ,
Romero said , but with the Wii remote in the opposite hand and his attention focused on the game unfolding on the screen , the patient was unaware of the discomfort until after the therapy . *

Which gay and lesbian couples are more likely to legalize their relationship and hold a commitment ceremony ?
Those with children and strong religious beliefs , says a new University of Illinois study .
" Opponents of relationship recognition for same - sex couples often say that we have to protect children , or that same - sex relationships are against God .
But this study suggests that lesbians and gay men who seek relationship recognition may be acting to protect their children and enact their own religious beliefs , " said Ramona Faith Oswald , a U of I associate professor of family studies .
In the study , 190 persons who were cohabiting with a same - sex partner were surveyed to gather a broad range of information about lesbian and gay persons living in downstate Illinois .
Within this group , a subsample of those who had legalized their same - sex relationship by making a will or granting power of attorney to their partner was identified .
Length of relationship was the strongest predictor that a couple would legalize their relationship .
Legalizers in this sample were more likely to belong to a supportive religious congregation than non-legalizing cohabiters , Oswald said .
" Faith communities may be important sources of legal education and advocacy for same - sex couples , " she noted .
From the legalizers , Oswald identified a still narrower group she called ritualizers , couples who had both legalized and participated in a commitment ceremony .
Having children and identifying religious beliefs as being very important in their daily life were the strongest predictors that a legalized couple would ritualize their relationship .
In fact , mothers and fathers in this study were 3.5 times more likely to have had a commitment ceremony than lesbians or gay men who lived together and had legalized their relationship but had not been part of a commitment ritual , she said .
Most children in this study were from partners ' previous relationships , she noted .
" Couples may be using commitment rituals to build cohesion within stepfamilies as the role of gay and lesbian stepparents is often vague .
Such ceremonies may help couples validate their sense of belonging and obligation to each other while also demonstrating to friends and relatives that they are a family unit , " she said .
Most children in the study were teenagers at the time of the commitment ceremony , Oswald noted .
" It 's interesting that couples were motivated to have a commitment ceremony when their children were at this developmental stage , just starting their own romantic explorations .
There may be an element of parenting going on here , with couples wanting to give their children an example of commitment by formalizing their own .
It 's an interesting question for future research , " she said .
With the Religious Freedom and Protections Civil Unions
Act under consideration in the Illinois House of Representatives , Oswald hopes this study will help to explain the motivations of gay and lesbian couples who wish to obtain civil unions .
" This study is an important contribution because it separates the legal and ritualistic aspects of solidifying a relationship .
Not all same - sex couples want legal protection or ritual recognition .
However , those who do appear to take these steps for the same reasons straight people often do — parenthood and religious commitment , " she said .
" This common ground should be part of our policy debates , " she added .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Gasoline prices fell for the 20th straight day , pushing the nationwide average down more than 25 cents , according to a survey of gas station credit card swipes released Wednesday .
Regular unleaded gas fell 0.9 cent to a nationwide average of $ 3.862 a gallon , said motorist advocacy group AAA .
Prices hit a record high of $ 4.114 at the pump on July 16 .
Since then , gasoline - and the future contracts of crude oil - have declined on signs that high prices have caused Americans to consume less .
Still , the price of a gallon of regular gas remains more than $ 1 higher than it was a year ago .
Ethanol .
Faced with rising fuel costs , many drivers have turned to ethanol , which is made primarily from corn and is increasingly available in regions with strong agricultural industries such as the Midwest .
The price of E85 , an 85 % ethanol blend that also burns cleaner than straight gasoline , fell a penny to $ 3.132 a gallon on average , AAA reported .
While ethanol is derived from renewable sources , it is less efficient than gasoline .
As a result , a car running on E85 would pay the equivalent of $ 4.122 per gallon to get the same mileage as gas , the AAA survey estimated .
Diesel .
The average price of diesel fuel , which is used to power most trucks and commercial vehicles , fell to $ 4.633 a gallon from $ 4.644 the previous day , according to AAA .
Diesel prices have climbed more than 56 % in the last year , driving up costs for businesses and inflating the prices of the goods and services those businesses provide .
State prices .
The AAA survey , which averages data from credit card swipes at 85,000 fuel stations around the country , showed that gas remains above $ 4 a gallon in 11 states and the District of Columbia .
Gas in Alaska , the state with the highest prices , fell to an average of $ 4.63 a gallon from $ 4.646 the previous day .
Hawaii , the state with the second highest prices , saw average prices rise slightly to $ 4.468 .
California , the state in third place , saw prices slip to $ 4.189 on average .
In Oklahoma , the state with the cheapest gas , prices rose slightly to $ 3.613 a gallon .
In Missouri , the next cheapest state for gas , drivers paid $ 3.628 on average , followed by Minnesota at $ 3.642 a gallon .
Drivers in Hawaii , the state with the most expensive diesel , paid $ 5.391 a gallon for diesel .
Diesel , on average , was cheapest in Oklahoma at $ 4.414 , according to the AAA survey .

A decision by Johnson & Johnson , the giant health care conglomerate , to sue the American Red Cross last year for commercializing the Red Cross symbol may be turning into a bit of a disaster for the company .
This week the company lost the second round in its trademark dispute against the disaster relief agency when a federal judge in Manhattan threw out most of the case .
In a decision late Wednesday , Judge Jed S. Rakoff of United States District Court said the Congressional charter for the Red Cross gave it the right to use the symbol  a Greek red cross against a white background  even for business purposes .
The company and the Red Cross had amicably shared use of the symbol for more than a century through an agreement signed in 1895 .
Johnson & Johnson has also used the symbol on packaging for many of its consumer health products , like Band - Aids .
NEW YORK - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , which yesterday agreed to buy Constellation Energy Group Inc. , is increasing the pace of deals as debt markets freeze up and stocks fall .
The deal to pay $ 4.7 billion for Constellation is Buffett 's eighth acquisition disclosed since October , compared with six in the prior 12 months , when the largest was a $ 350 million purchase of an underwear and pajama company .
Omaha - based Berkshire , which had $ 31.2 billion in cash on June 30 , is acting as buyouts by competitors slow amid a credit crunch .
" This is the kind of environment that opens up more opportunities for someone like Berkshire who does still have a lot of cash , " said Gary Ransom , an analyst with Fox - Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller .
Buffett 's recent deals include agreeing in April to provide $ 6.5 billion to help Mars Inc. buy Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. in a deal giving him a discounted stake in the chewing gum maker and pledging in July $ 3 billion to Dow Chemical Co. 's $ 15.4 billion purchase of Rohm & Haas Co .
Buffett is making deals at a time when others can't .
A yearlong contraction in global credit markets has choked funding for leveraged buyouts and reduced corporations ' ability to acquire rivals , shrinking the value of announced mergers 29 percent to $ 2.29 trillion this year from the same period in 2007 , Bloomberg data show .
" When there are market dislocations , we 're always going to take advantage of them , " Buffett said during the company 's annual meeting in May .
" Berkshire will make some extra money out of this . "
The Constellation deal , struck by Berkshire 's MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. , was revealed as American International Group , the largest US insurer , tries to sell assets to repay an emergency $ 85 billion loan from the government .
Berkshire typically gets about half of its revenue from its insurer units , and Buffett said last year that he 's interested in acquiring " a great business in any industry that we would understand . "
Investors have been speculating Buffett might bid on financial companies as their market value plunged on losses tied to home loans .

American medical care may be the most expensive in the world , but that does not mean it is worth every penny .
A study to be released Thursday highlights the stark contrast between what the United States spends on its health system and the quality of care it delivers , especially when compared with many other industrialized nations .
The report , the second national scorecard from this influential health policy research group , shows that the United States spends more than twice as much on each person for health care as most other industrialized countries .
But it has fallen to last place among those countries in preventing deaths through use of timely and effective medical care , according to the report by the Commonwealth Fund , a nonprofit research group in New York .
Access to care in the United States has worsened since the fund ’s first report card in 2006 as more people  some 75 million  are believed to lack adequate health insurance or are uninsured altogether .
And within the nation , the report found , the cost and quality of care vary drastically .
The findings are likely to provide supporting evidence for the political notion that the nation ’s health care system needs to be fixed .
Both presumptive presidential nominees , Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama , argue that the country needs to get more value for its health care money , even if they do not agree on what changes would be most effective .
But few people these days defend the status quo .

* I recently moved .
I found an apartment that was in a great neighborhood in a building with other dogs and dog friendly folks ..... this was because did a little work and looked for a place that was right for me and the dog , and stumbled over this fantastic place where I now live . *
I recently got a new job that requires that I spend more time at work .
I was worried that this would negatively affect my little pup , so I make an effort to get up earlier so that we can go for a good walk before I leave , and I arranged for someone to spend time with the little guy for a while during the day while I 'm at work .
My career chugs along and my little guy is still happy . *
I live in a tiny , tiny apartment , but this does not negatively affect the dog in any way .
Granted , he is a little guy , but the fact is that between walks before and after work , and extended play time outdoors in the evening , the size of the apartment does n't hurt my pup 's quality of life ( or mine , for that matter ) .
He has never chewed up anything I own , broken anything in the house , or done any damage to any structure that I have lived in .
He does bark a bit when people walk by my kitchen window , but mostly that 's because he 's crazy .
Or maybe because he thinks that everyone loves him and maybe that person wants to come in and pet him or give him a treat .
I do n't speak any dog , so I can't ask him . *
I do n't have a high paying job ( or career , for that matter ) , so I do n't have a lot of disposable cash , but I do have money saved in case the dog has a minor medical emergency , and the information for Care Credit in case he has a major medical emergency . *
Admittedly , I do n't have any kids ( I am both unpleasant and squishy , which makes finding a baby daddy trialsome ) , but I distinctly remember having pets when I was a kid , and I have six brothers and sisters that my mom had to watch over .
She seemed to do OK with seven kids and a dog , and while I find her an extraordinary human being , I do n't think that she has any kind of pet - care superpowers .
My dog makes me laugh and he cuddles up against me and he provides me with an opening to meet some very nice ( and some very interesting ) people when we 're out walking and he hides under the blankets when it thunders and lets me feel like I 'm soothing him and he brings me toys to play with when he gets bored and he rolls over in the grass and reminds me how much fun it is to be alive .
He gives me all of this and more , and all I do is walk him , feed him , and play with him .
I hope that all the people who post their dogs for adoption on this list have done every possible thing that they can do in order to keep it before they give up on themselves .
I just want to say to all of you who think that it 's too hard to take care of you pet : YOU CAN DO IT !
Your pet believes in you , and I believe in you , too !
The financial panic that has engulfed the planet is considered by politicians , bureaucrats , journalists and mainstream economists to be a problem of regulation .
I find myself in the uncomfortable position of having to agree with this gang of opinion makers , but it is not a problem of insufficient regulation , inadequate regulation , unenforced regulation , out - dated regulation , or anything of the kind .
The problem is with regulation itself .
With regard to financial markets , government regulates everything .
There is the Federal Reserve that regulates the money supply , interest rates and everything else .
There is the Treasury with its array of regulatory powers .
There is the Comptroller of the Currency , the Securities and Exchange Commission , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board .
Government has multiple layers of regulators concerning mortgages , financial institutions , and stock markets .
I have taught money and banking and was formerly the Assistant Superintendent of Banking in the state of Alabama and I can not think of a single thing related to this financial crisis that is not regulated .
Government regulation is the problem .
Since going off the gold standard in 1971 we have experienced a series of bubble and bust cycles in the economy and each time the crisis has been dealt with bailouts , more regulations , and loosening of gold standard era constraints .
The money supply as measured by M2 had long been just a couple of hundred billion and is now approaching $ 8 trillion dollars and we supposedly are still suffering from a lack of liquidity !
The American public once again finds itself playing 3 Card Monty with a dealer who insists we play and tells us that we cannot lose .
We will put our bailout money down on the table , we will be reassured that we cannot lose ( with more government regulation and “ oversight ” ) , the Fed will inject more fiat money and when the cups are turned we will all have our wealth ripped off .
What the American public needs to be told is that the crisis is actually the market trying to reestablish some rational order in the economy beset by regulation .
It is the market that is tearing down these mega financial firms and disposing of the crazy financial products that they created .
It is the market that is punishing those who grew rich on paper money schemes , derivatives , sub prime mortgages , and hedge funds .
These are the same people the taxpayer is being asked to bail out –Wall Street fat cats .
What the American public needs to hear is that regulation is the problem and that the “ unfettered market ” is the only way to break out of the business cycle .
All that is required is a gold coin system of money and for the rule of law to be applied to banking whereby demand deposits are held as reserves in the bank .
The economics of gold would regulate the money supply and the interest rate would regulate the amount of demand and time deposits as well as borrowing and lending .
No government regulation is required .
There is no systemic or macroeconomic risk and the market eliminates the business cycle .
The only requirement is the legal recognition of the statement in the US Constitution that gold and silver are money .
The market can handle everything else .
Apple 's insistence on keeping iPhone 2.0 development under strict non disclosure agreements is frustrating efforts in the development community to share ideas , teach classes on iPhone development , and print reference books on the subject .
However , it 's not preventing iPhone coders from making record profits from mobile development through .
With money rolling into the iPhone App Store at a million dollar per day pace , Apple is unlikely to feel any pressure to change its NDA policy in the short term .
Developers initially signed the NDA to gain access to the pre-release iPhone SDK in March .
The NDA prevents developers from talking publicly about features in the software development kit , but it also bars them from talking to other users , even those who are also under NDA , unless they work together in the same company .
Because the NDA precludes iPhone developers from participating in conference discussion panels or training sessions , blogging or contributing to mailing lists , or even having private discussions with other developers , many are left frustrated in their attempts to share what they 've learned or find answers to problems they 're experiencing .
That has pushed iPhone developers to seek creative ways around the limitations .
According to an article in the Los Angeles Times , " Some developers who are seeking help have resorted to paying each other $ 1 .
That way , if challenged by Apple 's legal department , they can argue that they are subcontractors and therefore free to discuss the software . "
Why NDA ?
Apple certainly is n't alone in putting developers under NDA .
Google 's Android open source project selected a subset of its software developers earlier this year and offered them private access to special builds of the software after signing an NDA .
This resulted in complaints from the open community among those who were shut out of access to all of Android 's SDK updates over the last year between November 2007 and this month , when Google finally released another public beta .
Just days after releasing that second public beta of Android however , complaints began to pile up about Google 's lack of " promised " support for Bluetooth features and for Google 's own Gtalk service , which was pulled over security concerns .
The two missing features that Google chose to delay in order to ship Android 1.0 on time were given nearly as much attention by bloggers as the company 's entire year of progress on the Android SDK .
Apple works hard to manage its public appearance because its critics are similarly looking for any scrap of detail they can sensationalize to sell as news .
By putting developers under NDA , the company can communicate more about its future plans to developers and retain the freedom to make changes as needed without the scrutiny of a non-technical media exposing every engineering decision to uninformed public debate , at least as long as developers respect the NDA they signed .
Expectation management
The historical failure of many developers to abide by their NDAs has had a chilling effect on the amount of detail Apple has been willing to provide .
Even within the NDA - covered iPhone SDK , which anyone can signup to participate in , Apple has revealed next to nothing about the future of hardware peripheral support on the iPhone , including expanded Bluetooth support or any devices that might attach to its USB dock connector .
There is also little known about the company 's future plans to expose other low level device access to third parties .
Detailed information on how much access Apple will eventually grant developers may be withheld because Apple has n't yet decided what it can support in the near term , given its finite resources .
It 's far safer for the company to under - promise and over - deliver than to outline an extensive plan for features and services that it is unable to complete .
Last year , Apple released interim web - based development details for the iPhone without any clue about whether plans to ever open a full SDK were even in the cards .
This allowed the company to provide a partial solution immediately and reveal details on its Cocoa Touch efforts only when those tools were nearly ready to ship .
Apple did n't escape criticism , but it was able to sustain interest in iPhone development and got third parties such as Facebook and Google working on iPhone web apps even before its full development strategy was finished .
In contrast , over a similar period of time public interest in Google 's Android peaked early , then waned for nearly a year before being met with grumbling disappointment .
Microsoft was similarly badgered in the press for dropping features from Windows Vista advertised during its years ' long beta period , despite the fact that some of them , such as WinFS , were n't delivering the expected results and customers were n't even sure why they might need them .
Vista ended up with a bad reputation for not living up to early expectations that were simply set too high , and which overshadowed its more significant advances .
Opaque engineering decisions
Apple has been similarly criticized for setting expectations that proved more difficult to deliver than expected .
When Apple chose to delay the release of Leopard in order to concentrate its efforts on shipping the iPhone , the decision was met with scorn by Mac users who though they were being left out , and ridicule from critics who insisted that the six month delay would prevent Leopard from taking any competitive advantage of Vista 's setbacks .
Further , despite noting that Leopard 's advertised features were subject to change , Apple was also criticized for saying Leopard 's Time Machine backup feature would work with the AirPort Extreme .
At the launch of Leopard , the feature still was n't ready .
Apple simply dropped any mention without providing any hint of whether it would ever ship , frustrating many users .
It was eventually provided through a software update involving both Leopard and the AirPort 's firmware .
Apple was also taken to task for not supporting Java SE 6 in Leopard .
The company made no comment on its plans , but eventually ended up delivering Java SE 6 exclusively for 64 - bit Intel Macs .
That engineering decision weighed the typical users of Java SE 6 against the resources needed to deliver it on each segment of the Mac platform .
As with any decision , it did not please every user .
By simply ignoring the spirited and often uninformed debates that flare up around every engineering decision the company makes , Apple 's engineers are able to focus on making decisions based on a more complete , internal picture of all of the factors involved , rather than being distracted to explain why each decision was made and rethinking each one in blogs and other public forums .
Apple 's own developers are kept under strict NDA in part to keep engineering decisions based on attainable goals the company sets for itself , rather than opinions expressed in focus groups .
Apple is working to avoid the committee - designed compromises and politically splintered engineering that often occurs in decentralized open source projects .
Google 's move to place Android 's early development under NDA was no doubt made for similar reasons , and even Microsoft has expressed that it will be saying less about the new features of its upcoming software for the same reasons .
Patent protection
Another reason for locking up iPhone details behind NDA is that Apple can't seek to patent any inventions after they are publicly published .
By keeping the iPhone 's details under NDA , it can retroactively seek patent protection for ideas that it discovers are more novel that originally thought .
Earlier this month , the Daring Fireball blog cited a reader commenting on the subject who explained , " At my company , our lawyers advised us to keep what we considered more - or - less public software under NDA for a very long time because demoing software to someone under NDA , no matter how many people it is , avoids ' publishing ' the software and any inventions contained therein .
We know Apple ’s been building up a patent strategy around multi- touch ; maybe their lawyers believe there are patentable inventions described in the iPhone SDK and they are telling Apple to keep everything under NDA until they know provisional patents can be filed within a reasonable amount of time ( you get a year after publishing in the US , but in the EU , I think you forfeit any patent claims once your invention is ' published ' ) . "
" In the eyes of the USPTO , " the source noted , " every invention in the iPhone SDK is a non-published invention and will continue to be so until the NDA is lifted . "
Waiting for the other NDA to drop
Despite all the reasons Apple has for keeping things private and under control , or at least as private as the " anyone can see but nobody can say " NDA allows , iPhone developers are still frustrated by their inability to share knowledge and the legal uncertainty surrounding any attempt to do so .
Stanford University has already scheduled a class on iPhone programming for incoming students , which raises questions about how Apple will react to public discussion of its iPhone development platform .
Several authors have written reference guides they feel they can't publish due to worries that Apple would sue them for breaking their NDA .
The LA Times cited the publisher of " iPhone in Action , " who has already pre-sold 400 copies .
So far , the publisher has delivered an electronic version that only covers web development , withholding the portions that delve into the Cocoa Touch SDK .
The company fears it may have to refund users if it can't legally publish the information .

Apple has determined that under certain conditions the new ultracompact Apple USB power adapter 's metal prongs can break off and remain in a power outlet , creating a risk of electric shock .
We have received reports of detached blades involving a very small percentage of the adapters sold , but no injuries have been reported .
The ultracompact USB power adapters were supplied with every iPhone 3G sold in the following countries , and may also have been purchased separately as an accessory :
US
Japan
Canada
Mexico
Several Latin American countries ( click here for a detailed list of countries )
Note : Apple USB power adapters supplied with original iPhones or supplied with iPhone 3G units sold in other countries are not affected .
Customer safety is always Apple 's top priority , and therefore we have voluntarily decided to exchange every ultracompact power adapter for a new , redesigned adapter , free of charge .
Users with ultracompact power adapters should immediately stop using them until they exchange them for a new , redesigned ultracompact adapter .
In the meantime , they should charge their iPhone 3G by connecting it to their computer with the USB cable that came with their iPhone or by using a standard - sized Apple USB Power Adapter ( with fold up prongs ) or with a third party adapter designed to work with the iPhone , such as a car charger .

Jim Griffin consults for Warner , one of the four major music labels , and he sees a disturbing sight when he looks around at the digital music landscape .
Taking music without paying for it may not be " morally voluntary , " Griffin says , but he admits it has become " functionally voluntary . "
No civilized society , he adds , can endure " purely voluntary payment for art , knowledge , and culture . "
So Griffin 's job is to help Warner monetize digital music , and he 's convinced that the issue of payment for music is nothing less than " our generation 's nuclear power . "
If our society can monetize music in a balanced , consumer - friendly way , the results will be awesome .
If we can 't ... well , remember Chernobyl ?
Speaking today at the Progress & Freedom Foundation 's annual Aspen conference , Griffin made an impassioned case for music and the importance of monetizing it .
He started from the premise , of course , that those who create art should be able to profit from their creative work .
He told the story of a Parisian composer in the 1840s who went to dinner at a Champs Elysee restaurant , heard the orchestra there playing his tune , and left without paying for his supper .
When hauled before a magistrate , the composer wondered why he should pay for dinner when the restaurant had paid him nothing for his own work .
Out of the incident , the world 's first collection society was born .
Collecting societies perform two tasks : collecting a pot of money , then distributing it fairly to artists .
In the US , groups like ASCAP collect royalties from ( among others ) radio stations on behalf of songwriters ; this arrangement allows DJs to spin any song they like without negotiating a separate deal with every writer or rightsholder .
The societies also make the process of paying for music more efficient .
Rather than forcing every ASCAP royalty payer to track every single song ever played throughout the year , collection societies today generally rely on statistical sampling techniques to split up the money between performers in the same way that US TV networks sell advertising based on a small sample of Nielsen families .
Griffin's most intriguing idea , and one he 's been pitching for some time now , is a voluntary , blanket music license ; essentially , bringing the collection society model to end users .
In this model , consumers would pay royalties into a pot ( by paying an extra monthly fee to their ISPs , for instance ) and would then have access to all the music from all the labels that participate in the scheme .
The new collection society would then distribute the money to artists and labels .
Blanket licensing has been touted by groups like the EFF and bands like the Barenaked Ladies , but it 's notable that a label like Warner has tapped Griffin to seriously investigate the idea .
While quick to stress that he is n't in favor of a compulsory ( i.e. , government - mandated ) blanket license , Griffin is convinced that a blanket license is the way to make it almost frictionless for consumers to access a huge collection of music .
How this would work in practice still remains unclear — would users be allowed to keep the music they download after they stop paying a fee ?
What about bands and labels that do n't sign on ?
etc.— and some versions of the idea start to sound a lot like existing subscription services .
Griffin was n't ready to reveal any details of the organization he 's putting together , but he did make clear that the entire issue of monetizing music is the " canary in the coal mine . "
Music has led the way when it comes to content online ; print is too difficult to digitize and share in most cases , while movies have until recently been too large to transfer easily .
Griffin argues that monetizing music , then , will establish the models for other forms of online content .
If the music industry ultimately finds itself incapable of turning tunes into cash online , then Griffin believes there 's little hope for other creators .
He wants Warner and the other major labels to do this by making art " feel free " to those who enjoy it , even if it is n't .
This fits well with the paradigm articulated later in the morning by technology lawyer Jim Burger , who argued that network filters , three - strikes rules , and legislation wo n't save the content businesses .
The real answer to online piracy problems will be a market answer ; if content creators want to succeed online , they need to focus even more on " seducing " consumers than on pistol - whipping them .
" Honey draws more flies than vinegar , " Burger said , and it 's encouraging to see a major label like Warner at least serious about giving someone like Griffin the time and money to build a beehive .
HYPERINFLATION requires a good head for figures and a sturdy wallet to hold wads of low - value paper money .
Goverments have attempted to keep pace with hyperinflation by issuing ever - higher denomination banknotes to replace worthless notes that might as well serve as wallpaper .
Last week Zimbabwe 's central bank unveiled a 100 billion dollar banknote to cope with inflation running at 2.2 m % .
On Sunday July 27th the bank changed tack and announced it would be lopping off a string of zeroes on replacement notes , in what passes for economic reform in stricken Zimbabwe .
But Robert Mugabe has some way to go before he can claim for his country the accolade of printing the highest - denomination banknote .
A note issued in post - war Hungary came with a mind - boggling 19 digits .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The biggest U.S. outbreak of measles since 2001 is unfolding in 10 states , with at least 72 people ranging from infants to the elderly becoming ill -- most of them unvaccinated , U.S. health officials said on Thursday .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said none of those who caught the highly contagious viral illness has died , but at least 14 people have been hospitalized , most with pneumonia triggered by measles .
There were 116 cases in 2001 , and the last major U.S. outbreak occurred from 1989 to 1991 , when 55,000 people got measles and 123 died .
Anne Schuchat , who heads the CDC ’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , said she expects “ many more cases this year than we had in 2001 based on what ’s going on today . ”
Public health officials have been stressing the importance of immunizing children in the face of increasingly vocal groups who object to vaccines for religious reasons or because they think the shots may cause autism or other problems .
CDC officials said overwhelming scientific evidence points to the safety of the combined measles - mumps - rubella , or MMR , shot and other childhood vaccines .
“ We are concerned ... about the population of people who are choosing not to be vaccinated , and whether we may be on the verge of facing larger - scale outbreaks in the United States , ” said Jane Seward of the CDC ’s division of viral diseases .
The CDC said most of the measles cases can be traced to 10 people who picked up the disease overseas and then traveled back to the United States , where others became infected .
The ages of those sickened ranged from 5 months to 71 years .
GLOBAL PROBLEM
“ These cases and outbreaks resulted primarily from failure to vaccinate , many because of personal or religious belief exemption , ” the agency said in a statement .
The CDC said 64 cases were reported from January 1 through April 25 in Arizona , California , Hawaii , Illinois , Michigan , New York , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Wisconsin .
Eight more confirmed cases -- all involving unvaccinated children in one family who had attended a church gathering in the Seattle area -- have been reported since then in Washington state , the state department of health said on Thursday .
Those spreading measles were infected in Switzerland and Israel , both of which have larger outbreaks , as well as in India , Belgium , Italy and likely China and Japan , the CDC said .
“ Transmission has occurred in community and health care settings , including homes , child care centers , schools , hospitals , emergency rooms and physicians ’ offices , ” it said .
The disease causes fever , cough , redness and irritation of the eyes and a rash .
Serious complications include encephalitis and pneumonia that can be fatal .
Measles remains a leading cause of death among children in poor countries , killing about 250,000 people a year globally .
Before a vaccine was introduced in 1963 , more than half a million people got measles in the United States and 500 died annually .
Thanks to the vaccination program , measles is no longer endemic in the United States , and ongoing transmission of the virus was declared eliminated in 2000 .
The annual number of cases since then generally has been in the dozens and caused by someone infected in another country .

Meet Wilma :
The face of Neanderthal woman revealed for the first time
Artists and scientists have created the first model of a Neanderthal based in part on ancient DNA evidence .
She has been put together using analysis of DNA from 43,000 - year - old bones that had been cannibalised .
Wilma has been pieced together using ancient DNA
The model has been nicknamed Wilma after she was found to have red -hair like the Flintstones character .
The findings had suggested that at least some Neanderthals would have had red hair , pale skin , and possibly freckles .
Created for an October 2008 National Geographic magazine article , Wilma has a skeleton made from replicas of pelvis and skull bones from Neanderthal females .
Hunter : ' Wilma ' in a classic hunting pose
Wilma was commissioned by National Geographic to illustrate the magazine article
The full feature on neanderthals is in the latest issue of National Geographic magazine , on sale now
Copies of male Neanderthal bones - resized to female dimensions - filled in the gaps .
National Geographic 's senior science editor , Jamie Shreeve , who oversaw the project , said : " For the first time , anthropologists can go beyond fossils and peer into the actual genes of an extinct species of human .
" We saw an opportunity to literally embody this new science in a full - size Neanderthal female , reconstructed using the latest information from genetics , fossil evidence , and archaeology . "
More information on Wilma can be read at the National Geographic website .

Diamond and Kashyap on the Recent Financial Upheavals
As an economist , I am supposed to have something intelligent to say about the current financial crisis .
To be honest , however , I have n’t got the foggiest idea what this all means .
So I did what I always do when something related to banking arises : I knocked on the doors of my colleagues Doug Diamond and Anil Kashyap , and asked them for the answers .
What they told me was so interesting and insightful that I begged them to write their explanations down for a broader audience .
They were kind enough to take the time to do so .
In what follows , they discuss what has happened in the financial sector in the last few days , why it happened , and what it means for everyday people .
The F.A.Q. ’s of Lehman and A.I.G .
By Douglas W. Diamond and Anil K. Kashyap
A Guest Post
For most of the last 20 years we have been studying banks , monetary policy , and financial crises .
So for us the events of the last year have been especially fascinating .
The last 10 days have been the most remarkable period of government intervention into the financial system since the Great Depression .
In talking with reporters and our noneconomist friends , we have been besieged with questions about several aspects of these events .
Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions with our best answers .
1 ) What has happened that is so remarkable ?
This episode started when the Treasury nationalized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on September 8 .
Their combined assets are over $ 5 trillion .
These firms help guarantee most of the mortgages in the United States .
The Treasury only got authority from Congress to take this action in July , and in seeking the authority had insisted that no intervention would be needed .
The Treasury has replaced the management of both companies and will presumably oversee their operation .
This decision marked an acknowledgment by the government that the mortgage market and the institutions to make it operate in the U.S. are broken .
On Monday , the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history was made by Lehman Brothers .
Lehman had over $ 600 billion in assets and 25,000 employees .
( The largest previous filing was WorldCom , whose assets just prior to bankruptcy were just over $ 100 billion . )
On Tuesday , the Federal Reserve made a bridge loan to A.I.G. , the largest insurance company in the world ; perhaps best known to most of the world as the shirt sponsor of Manchester United soccer club , A.I.G. has assets of over $ 1 trillion and over 100,000 employees worldwide .
The Fed has the option to purchase up to 80 percent of the shares of A.I.G. , is replacing A.I.G. ’s management , and is nearly wiping out A.I.G. ’s existing shareholders .
A.I.G. is to be wound down by selling its assets over the next two years .
( Do n’t worry , Man U will be fine . )
The Fed has never asserted its authority to intervene on this scale , in this form , or in a firm so far removed from its own supervisory authority .
2 ) Why did these things happen ?
The common denominator in all three cases was the inability of the firms to retain financing .
The reasons , though , differed in each case .
The Fannie and Freddie situation was a result of their unique roles in the economy .
They had been set up to support the housing market .
They helped guarantee mortgages ( provided they met certain standards ) , and were able to fund these guarantees by issuing their own debt , which was in turn tacitly backed by the government .
The government guarantees allowed Fannie and Freddie to take on far more debt than a normal company .
In principle , they were also supposed to use the government guarantee to reduce the mortgage cost to the homeowners , but the Fed and others have argued that this hardly occurred .
Instead , they appear to have used the funding advantage to rack up huge profits and squeeze the private sector out of the “ conforming ” mortgage market .
Regardless , many firms and foreign governments considered the debt of Fannie and Freddie as a substitute for U.S. Treasury securities and snapped it up eagerly .
Fannie and Freddie were weakly supervised and strayed from the core mission .
They began using their subsidized financing to buy mortgage - backed securities which were backed by pools of mortgages that did not meet their usual standards .
Over the last year , it became clear that their thin capital was not enough to cover the losses on these subprime mortgages .
The massive amount of diffusely held debt would have caused collapses everywhere if it was defaulted upon ; so the Treasury announced that it would explicitly guarantee the debt .
But once the debt was guaranteed to be secure ( and the government would wipe out shareholders if it carried through with the guarantee ) , no self - interested investor was willing to supply more equity to help buffer the losses .
Hence , the Treasury ended up taking them over .
Lehman ’s demise came when it could not even keep borrowing .
Lehman was rolling over at least $ 100 billion a month to finance its investments in real estate , bonds , stocks , and financial assets .
When it is hard for lenders to monitor their investments and borrowers can rapidly change the risk on their balance sheets , lenders opt for short - term lending .
Compared to legal or other channels , their threat to refuse to roll over funding is the most effective option to keep the borrower in line .
This was especially relevant for Lehman , because as an investment bank , it could transform its risk characteristics very easily by using derivatives and by churning its trading portfolio .
So for Lehman ( and all investment banks ) , the short - term financing is not an accident ; it is inevitable .
Why did the financing dry up ?
For months , short - sellers were convinced that Lehman ’s real - estate losses were bigger than it had acknowledged .
As more bad news about the real estate market emerged , including the losses at Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , this view spread .
Lehman ’s costs of borrowing rose and its share price fell .
With an impending downgrade to its credit rating looming , legal restrictions were going to prevent certain firms from continuing to lend to Lehman .
Other counterparties that might have been able to lend , even if Lehman ’s credit rating was impaired , simply decided that the chance of default in the near future was too high , partly because they feared that future credit conditions would get even tighter and force Lehman and others to default at that time .
A.I.G. had to raise money because it had written $ 57 billion of insurance contracts whose payouts depended on the losses incurred on subprime real - estate related investments .
While its core insurance businesses and other subsidiaries ( such as its large aircraft - leasing operation ) were doing fine , these contracts , called credit default swaps ( C.D.S. ’s ) , were hemorrhaging .
Furthermore , the possibility of further losses loomed if the housing market continued to deteriorate .
The credit - rating agencies looking at the potential losses downgraded A.I.G. ’s debt on Monday .
With its lower credit ratings , A.I.G. ’s insurance contracts required A.I.G. to demonstrate that it had collateral to service the contracts ; estimates suggested that it needed roughly $ 15 billion in immediate collateral .
A second problem A.I.G. faced is that if it failed to post the collateral , it would be considered to have defaulted on the C.D.S.’s.
Were A.I.G. to default on C.D.S. ’s , some other A.I.G. contracts ( tied to losses on other financial securities ) contain clauses saying that its other contractual partners could insist on prepayment of their claims .
These cross - default clauses are present so that resources from one part of the business do not get diverted to plug a hole in another part .
A.I.G. had another $ 380 billion of these other insurance contracts outstanding .
No private investors were willing to step into this situation and loan A.I.G. the money it needed to post the collateral .
In the scramble to make good on the C.D.S. ’s , A.I.G. ’s ability to service its own debt would come into question .
A.I.G. had $ 160 billion in bonds that were held all over the world : nowhere near as widely as the Fannie and Freddie bonds , but still dispersed widely .
In addition , other large financial firms — including Pacific Investment Management Company ( Pimco ) , the largest bond - investment fund in the world — had guaranteed A.I.G. ’s bonds by writing C.D.S. contracts .
Given the huge size of the contracts and the number of parties intertwined , the Federal Reserve decided that a default by A.I.G. would wreak havoc on the financial system and cause contagious failures .
There was an immediate need to get A.I.G. the collateral to honor its contracts , so the Fed loaned A.I.G. $ 85 billion .
3 ) Why did the Treasury and Fed let Lehman fail but rescue Bear Stearns , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and A.I.G.?
We have already explained why Fannie , Freddie , and A.I.G. were supported .
In March , Bear Stearns lost its access to credit in almost the same fashion as Lehman ; yet Bear was rescued and Lehman was not .
Bear Stearns was bailed out for two reasons .
One was that the Fed had very imperfect information about what was going on at Bear .
The Fed was not Bear ’s regulator , the amount of publicly available information was limited , and its staff was not versed in all of the ways in which Bear might have been connected to other parts of the financial system .
The second problem was that Bear ’s counterparties in many transactions were not prepared for the sudden demise of Bear .
A Bear bankruptcy might have triggered a wave of forced selling of collateral that Bear would have given its counterparties .
Given the potential chaos that would have resulted from Bear Stearns filing for bankruptcy , the Fed had little choice but to engineer a rescue .
In doing so , the Fed argued that the rescue was a rare , perhaps once - in - a - generation , event .
When Bear was rescued , the Fed created a new lending facility to help provide bridge financing to other investment banks .
The new lending arrangement was proposed precisely because there were concerns that Lehman and other banks were at risk for a Bear - like run .
Since March , the Fed had also studied what to do if this were to happen again ; it concluded that if it modified its lending facility slightly , it could withstand a bankruptcy ; it made these changes to the lending facility on Sunday night .
Once the Fed had made these changes and determined that it and the others in the market had an understanding of the indirect or “ collateral damage ” effects of a bankruptcy , it could rely on the protections of the bankruptcy code to stop the run on Lehman , and to sell its operating assets separately from its toxic mortgage - backed assets .
Against this backdrop , if the government had rescued Lehman , it would have repudiated the claim that the Bear rescue was extraordinary ; it would have also conceded that in the six months since Bear failed , neither the new facility that it set up nor the other steps to make markets more robust were reliable .
Essentially , the Fed and the Treasury would have been admitting that they had lied or were incompetent in stabilizing the financial system — or both .
It was not surprising that they drew the line at helping Lehman .
Based on all the publicly available information , this was clearly the right thing to do .
4 ) I do not work at Lehman or A.I.G. and do not own much stock ; why should I care ?
The concern for the man on Main Street is not the bankruptcy of Lehman , per se .
Rather , it is the collective inability of major financial institutions to find funding .
As their own funding dries up , the remaining financial firms will be much more cautious in extending credit to normal firms and individuals .
So even for people whose own circumstances have not much changed , the cost of the credit is going to rise .
For an individual or business that falls behind on payments or needs an increase in short - term credit because of the slowing economy , credit will be much harder to obtain than in recent years .
This is going to slow growth .
We have not seen this much stress in the financial system since the Great Depression , so we do not have any recent history to rely upon in quantifying the magnitude of the slowdown .
A recent educated guess by Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs suggests that G.D.P. growth will be just about 2 percentage points lower in 2008 and 2009 .
But as he explains , extrapolations of this sort are highly uncertain .
5 ) What does it mean for the Fed and Treasury going ahead ?
A reasonable reading of the recent bailouts suggests a simple rule : if a firm is on the verge of collapse and its ties to the financial system will lead to a cascade of chaos , the firm will be saved .
A bankruptcy will be permitted only if the failure can be contained .
Assuming the level of chaos is sufficiently high , this dichotomy is probably consistent with the mandate of the Federal Reserve .
The rescue of A.I.G. , however , raises some major challenges .
One is where to draw the line .
A.I.G. was an insurance company , not a bank or a broker dealer , so the Fed had no special relationship with A.I.G .
Presumably , if a very large airline or automaker had been involved in the C.D.S. market , the same reasoning that led to the rescue would apply .
A second challenge comes with defining the acceptable level of chaos .
We will never be able to find out what would have happened if A.I.G. had been allowed to fail .
Furthermore , there are some reasons to believe that even if A.I.G. continues to operate , the fundamental stress in the financial system will remain .
If the rescue does not mark a turning point , the bailout may be viewed quite differently down the road .
Should the government intervene if it merely postpones an inevitable adjustment ?
Creditor runs can make adjustment too fast ; blanket bailouts can make adjustment too slow .
Has the Fed found the speed that is just right ?
Third , now that A.I.G. has been lent to , how will regulation have to be adjusted ?
Surely the Fed cannot be called upon to provide backstop financing whenever a large member of the financial system runs into trouble .
How does it prevent a replay of this scenario , and can it be done without stifling innovation ?
6 ) What does this mean for the markets going ahead ?
Letting Lehman go means that the remaining large financial services firms now must understand that they need to manage their own risks more carefully .
This includes both securing adequate funding and being prudent about which counterparties to rely upon .
Both of these developments are welcome .
If the remaining investment banks , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , do not get more secure funding in place , they may be acquired or subject to a run too .
In the current environment , relying almost exclusively on short - term debt is hazardous , even if a firm or bank has nothing wrong with it .
7 ) When will the turmoil end ?
The inability to secure short - term funding fundamentally comes from having insufficient capital .
There are many indicators that the largest financial institutions are collectively short of capital .
One signal is that there were apparently only two bidders for Lehman , when the ongoing value from operating most of the bank was surely far above the $ 3.60 share price from Friday .
Another is the elevated cost of borrowing that banks are charging each other .
A third indicator is the reluctance to take on certain types of risk , such as jumbo mortgages , so that the cost of this type of borrowing is unusually high .
The fear of being the next Lehman ought to convince many of the large institutions that , despite however much they already raised , more is needed .
It may be expensive to attract more equity financing , but the choice may be bankruptcy or sale .
The decision by the Federal Reserve to not cut interest rates suggests the Fed also recognizes that the short - term interest rate is a very inefficient way to address this problem .

Aussie astronomers find ' baby ' supernova
An object thought to a faraway galaxy is actually the youngest and brightest supernova remnant in the Milky Way , according to a new study .
The team led , by Dr Bryan Gaensler from the University of Sydney , published their findings in the latest edition of The Astrophysical Journal Letters .
The object , known as G350.1 - 0.3 , was first discovered in the 1980s , but its irregular shape led astronomers to believe it was a background galaxy .
According to co-author and University of Sydney PhD student Anant Tanna , Gaensler thought the object 's brightness and spectral index was too similar to that of a supernova , than that of a faraway galaxy .
" He said ' let 's have a look at this in x-rays and check to see whether it is a galaxy or a supernova remnant ' , " says Tanna .
The team used data from the European Space Agency 's orbiting x-ray observatory XMM - Newton to analyse the object .
When they examined G350.1 - 0.3 they concluded it is an irregularly - shaped supernova remnant .
" Given the information obtained from the x-ray observation it 's pretty much definite that this is a supernova remnant , " Tanna says .
Small and young
To explain its shape , the team looked at radio surveys and discovered that G350.1 - 0.3 had exploded next to a dense cloud of gas about 15,000 light years from earth .
The cloud prevented the blast from expanding evenly in all directions , resulting in an example of a rare kind of misshapen supernova remnant .
" The large cloud explains why it is such an unusual shape , because the shock wave is expanding into a very unhomogeneous environment , " Tanna says .
According to Tanna , G350.1 - 0.3 is incredibly small and young in astronomical terms , only eight light years across and about 1000 years old .
" Only a handful of such young supernova remnants are known .
So even having one more is important , " says Tanna .
" It may turn out that many of the youngest supernova remnants have these strange shapes .
The hunt is now on to find more . "
Improving understanding
Tanna believes G350.1 - 0.3 will help astronomers better understand the evolution of supernova and their parent stars .
" Young supernova help astronomers trace back through the life of a supernova remnant , back to when there was an actual star was there , " Tanna says .
" They can then work out what type of star it was and have a better understanding of what kinds of stars explode and how certain remnants form . "
Tanna defends the astronomers who misclassified the supernova as a background galaxy two decades ago .
" Had we been in those people 's position with the same data , we would have made the same conclusion , " Tanna says .
" It 's not that they were wrong , it 's just that new information allows us to develop or rule out theories . "
This is not the first time that Gaensler has corrected the astronomical text books .
In February , he led a team that concluded that our home galaxy - the Milky Way - is 12,000 light - years thick when seen edge - on , not 6000 as previously thought .
Celebrity Justice for Khloe Kardashian - Four Hours in Jail
In another case of celebrity justice , presented herself on Friday to serve a 30 day jail term for DUI and probation violations .
She was released after serving less than five hours behind bars in the Los Angeles County jail .
The reality television celebrity is on E! network in Keeping Up With the Kardasians .
The daughter of famed O.J. Simpson trial lawyer Robert Kardashian , she was arrested for drunk driving in 2007 and ordered to do road side clean up but failed to show up .
She also blew off the alcohol education requirement .
A judge then ordered her to serve a month behind bars .
Khloe , 24 , entered the facility at 8:52 a.m. on Friday , July 18th and was released due to overcrowding at 1:29 p.m.
Upon leaving , Kardashian thanked the Sheriff 's Department for their professionalism .
She must now complete the provisions of her probation , which will include community service and successful completion of an alcohol education program .
Nicole Richie knows something about celebrity justice .
In 2007 she was ordered to serve 96 hours jail time for probation violations related to several DUI convictions .
Richie was released after an 82 minute incarceration .

Julia Child was Covert OSS Spy During WWII ( Photos )
During the early 1940's , Presidentauthorized the creation of the Office of Strategic Services - an early version of the CIA .
The secret organization recruited 24,000 spies including many famous and influential people to participate in surveillance across the globe .
Among those was the famed chef
Child met her future husband , Paul Cushing Child , while on assignment for the OSS in Sri Lanka .
The cook , author and television personality died at age 91 in 2004 .
The secret has come to light now that 750,000 documents will be open for inspection .
This long guarded information sheds light on the last secrets from the wartime intelligence agency that was disbanded in 1945 by President Harry Truman .
The CIA had resisted releasing OSS records for years until former CIA Director William Casey , himself an OSS alum , cleared the way for transfer of millions of pages of information to the National Archives when he took over the CIA in 1980 .
Spies within the OSS included soldiers , actors , historians , lawyers , athletes , professors and reporters .
They studied military plans , created propaganda , infiltrated enemy ranks and stirred resistance among foreign troops .
Notables include John Hemingway , son of author Ernest Hemingway , Quentin and Kermit Roosevelt , sons of President Roosevelt , Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg , Chicago White Sox catcher Moe Berg , Sterling Hayden , a film and television actor , historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. , and author Thomas Braden , who wrote the book that inspired the Eight is Enough television series .
Most never gave any inkling to their involvement in the secret spy ring .
Several members , well into their 90's , are thrilled to be able to finally let out their secret .
Walter Mess,93 , now living in Falls Church , VA , did covert work in Poland and North Africa .
The only person he ever told was his wife because he said : " I was told to keep my mouth shut . "
Another former spy , Elizabeth McIntosh , 93 , of Woodbridge , VA was thrilled with the opening of records .
" They 've finally after all these years gotten the names out .
All of these people had been told never to mention they were with the OSS .
I think it 's terrific . "

At different points during his ordeal , one of his captors stood on his head while another warned him he would never see his family again unless he came up with £ 200,000 ( $ 419,000 ) .
He was reportedly told he and his 13 - year - old son would be executed if he did not produce the ransom .
The scheme started to go awry when the captors gave their victim a powerful sedative after he made several panicked calls to his wife for the money , the Daily Mail reported .
London 's Southwark Crown Court was told that Gul immediately panicked when the victim fell ill and the captors delivered the man bleeding , semi-conscious and in an office chair to his home , where she told his wife he was drunk and sexually assaulted her .
The stricken businessman was taken to hospital where doctors found his face and head covered in cuts and bruises and marks on his wrists where he had been bound with tape , the paper reported .
Gul 's co-conspirator Mukshud Ali , 18 , was sentenced to seven years and nine months in a young offenders ' institution along with Quasim Ahmed , 21 , who was jailed for eight years , and former West Ham under - 17s footballer Shakib Chowdhury , 20 , who was sent to a young offenders ' institution to serve 8 ½ years , the paper said .
The sentencing judge , Deborah Taylor , reportedly told them : " You were involved in this wicked , premeditated and brutal plan to lure Mr Malik to a flat where he was beaten up and tied to a chair with his eyes and mouth bound .
" His seven hours of suffering caused him pain , fear and distress ... and he believed he was going to be shot .
" You showed a reckless disregard to his health and safety .
" He was only released when you became scared for yourselves after he was drugged and became semi-conscious . "
The judge continued : " He not only suffered physical injuries - cuts and bruises to his head and body - for which he had to have treatment in hospital for four days , but suffered psychological injury and the exacerbation of heart and spinal conditions . "
The judge said the victim 's family had suffered greatly and was now considering leaving the country .

Rwanda has accused France of playing an active role in the genocide of 1994 , in which about 800,000 people were killed .
An independent Rwandan commission said France was aware of preparations for the genocide and helped train the ethnic Hutu militia perpetrators .
The report also accused French troops of direct involvement in the killings .
It named 33 senior French military and political figures that it said should be prosecuted .
France has previously denied any such responsibility .
Among those named in the report were the late former President , Francois Mitterrand , and the then Prime Minister Edouard Balladur .
Two men who went on to become prime minister were also named - Alain Juppe , the foreign minister at the time , and his then chief aide , Dominique de Villepin .
The French foreign ministry told the BBC it would only respond to the fresh allegations after reading the report , which was released on Tuesday afternoon .
Checkpoints Earlier this year France 's Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner denied French responsibility in connection with the genocide , but said political errors had been made .
The Rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused French politicians and military officials to justice
Rwandan justice ministry
Report raises issue of motive Some 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered by Hutu militias in just 100 days in 1994 .
The report says France backed Rwanda 's Hutu government with political , military , diplomatic and logistical support .
It accuses France of training Hutu militias responsible for the slaughter , helping plan the genocide , and participating in the killings .
" French forces directly assassinated Tutsis and Hutus accused of hiding Tutsis ...
French forces committed several rapes on Tutsi survivors , " said a statement from the justice ministry cited by AFP news agency .
" Considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes , the Rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused French politicians and military officials to justice , " the statement said .
It further alleged that French forces did nothing to challenge checkpoints used by Hutu forces in the genocide .
" They clearly requested that the Interahamwes continue to man those checkpoints and kill Tutsis attempting to flee , " it said .
Testimonies
The BBC's Geoffrey Mutagoma in the Rwandan capital , Kigali , says the commission spent nearly two years investigating France 's alleged role in the genocide .
It heard testimonies from genocide survivors , researchers , writers and reporters .
The 500 - page document was presented to the Rwanda 's government last November , but was not made public until now .
Rwanda has repeatedly accused France of arming and training the Hutu militias that perpetrated the genocide , and of dragging its feet in co-operating with the investigations that followed .
France has maintained that its forces helped protect civilians during a UN - sanctioned mission in Rwanda at the time .
The two countries have had a frosty relationship since 2006 when a French judge implicated Rwandan President Paul Kagame in the downing in 1994 of then - President Juvenal Habyarimana 's plane - an event widely seen as triggering the killings .
President Kagame has always denied the charge .
He says Mr Habyarimana , a Hutu , was killed by Hutu extremists who then blamed the incident on Tutsi rebels to provide the pretext for the genocide .

What are these ?
There will always be people who take great delight in the powerful betraying cluelessness over technology .
When Senator Ted Stevens , Republican of Alaska , was indicted last week on charges of filing false financial disclosures , the news was met with reminders that he once referred to the Internet as a “ series of tubes . ”
Some mocked President Bush , too , when he referred to his using “ the Google ” and “ the Internets . ”
Mr. Bush used to e-mail but gave it up when he became president because of concerns about security and a paper trail  the same things , presumably , a successor would consider .
In the rarefied context of the Oval Office , however , there can be great value in having a president who has an intuitive sense of how a technology works , said Tom Wheeler , a telecommunications entrepreneur and investor who wrote the recent book “ Mr. Lincoln ’s T - Mails : The Untold Story of how Abraham Lincoln Used the Telegraph to Win the Civil War . ”
“ I do n’t think it ’s so much a question of what a president is doing today , ” Mr. Wheeler said .
“ It ’s a question of how responsive are you to the fact that there will be continuing technological change during your term . ”
Mr. Wheeler , a supporter and fundraiser for Mr. McCain ’s Democratic rival , Senator Barack Obama , said that Lincoln was the model of a president who embraced technology .
Lincoln ’s mastery of the telegraph machine not only put him well ahead of most of his constituents on the technology curve but also allowed him to speak directly to his generals and track their actions .
Lincoln gave a speech in 1860 that said the United States ’ responsiveness to new technology was the chief virtue separating it from Europe .
The speech begins , “ All creation is a mine , and every man a miner . ”
It ’s no surprise that Mr. McCain  standard - bearer of the party of Lincoln  has moved to press delete on the notion that he is a Luddite .
“ I do understand the importance of the computer , ” Mr. McCain reassured in The San Francisco Chronicle last week .
“ I understand the importance of the blogs . ”
He said , “ I am forcing myself  let me put it this way , I am using the computer more and more every day . ”
But keeping up with technology “ does n’t mean that I have to e-mail people , ” he said .
“ Now , I read e-mails . ”
The staff is “ constantly showing them to me as the news breaks during the day . ”

In case you do n’t understand why there are so many exclamation points in the piece below , they are an essential part of the The Mogambo Guru ’s style manual .
Via : Contrarian Profits :
When you look at what John Williams at shadowstats.com calculates as inflation , according to the time - honored method of actually looking at real prices instead of the “ qualified estimates ” that are used today , you will see that annual inflation in consumer prices is actually running at over 13 % !
…
Mr. Cherniawski coolly says that I do n’t know the literal half of it , as “ The alarming part of this report is the acceleration of inflation in the past 3 months .
While the unadjusted rate for the past 12 months was 6.2 % , the 3 - month annualized rate of increase was 11.9 % . ”
Yikes !
We ’re freaking doomed !
The report itself noted , without any hint of alarm , that “ On a seasonally adjusted basis , the CPI - U advanced 0.8 percent in July , following a 1.1 percent increase in June . ”
Yow !
Some of the terrifying specifics were that the energy index rose 4 % , which accounted for “ about half of the overall increase in the all items index . ”
The worse news for people who eat food is that “ the food index rose 0.9 percent in July after rising 0.8 percent in June .
Indexes for five of the six major grocery store food groups rose at least 1.0 percent . ”
In one freaking month !
This is outrageous inflation !

" Power ! Money !
Lust ! Sex ! "
Over and over , the throbbing chorus of a dance hit explodes out of a battery of seven - foot - tall ( 2.1 - meter - tall ) speakers so powerful that the wood dance floor trembles , earthquake style , with every reverberating bass note .
Through a purple haze of smoke and sweat the strobe lights ' red glare illuminates the dancing couples : men with mohawks and painted faces , women in vinyl skirts so micro they serve no functional purpose .
It 's 4:45 a.m. at the popular London club Egg , and a few dancers have collapsed on the sofas or taken refuge at the bar .
But after a long night of liquor , drugs , tobacco , and earthshaking noise , most are still vigorously , and happily , strutting their stuff across that trembling wood floor .
How do they do it ?
" Actually , we usually see a revival about half four or so in the morning , " says Egg night manager Simon Patrick .
" That 's when we get the real rush at the bar for Red Bull .
And the kids say , ' I 've had eight Red Bulls — I 'm flying ! '
They 'll dance right round the clock .
At seven in the morning we have trouble getting them out the door . "
" It 's like putting your whole system on fast - forward , " Lee Murphy shouts above the din as he glides across the floor with four - inch - high ( 10 - centimeter - high ) soles on his dancing shoes , a gold ring in his chin , and a slender silver and blue can of Red Bull energy drink in each hand .
" By four or five in the morning you 're totally blotto , " the 29 - year - old London nurse explains .
" That 's where the Red Bull comes in .
I drink these two tins , it 's like drinking a pint of speed . "
For Lee Murphy and other habitués of the all - night club scene around the world — not to mention a legion of marathon runners , mountain bikers , fighter pilots , college crammers , and late - night truckers hoping to cover another hundred miles ( 160 kilometers ) before turning in — the canned concoctions marketed as energy drinks represent a fizzy new manifestation of one of mankind 's oldest stimulants : caffeine .
The active ingredient in the hugely successful Austrian product Red Bull is a solid jolt of caffeine , blended with a handful of other ingredients .
One 8.3 - ounce ( 0.25 - liter ) can has two to three times the amount of caffeine as a 12 - ounce ( 0.35 - liter ) can of soda .
" The kids in the clubs , they think they 've happened upon this great new invention , " says Neil Stanley , director of sleep research at the Human Psychopharmacology Research Unit at Britain 's University of Surrey .
" But we 've known for centuries that caffeinated drinks work .
They get you out of an energy slump and make you more alert .
Really all they 've found is a new kind of caffeine delivery system . "
The dual power to counter physical fatigue and increase alertness is part of the reason caffeine ranks as the world 's most popular mood - altering drug , eclipsing the likes of nicotine and alcohol .
The drug is encountered not just at the soda fountain or the espresso bar but also in diet pills and pain relievers .
It is the only habit - forming psychoactive drug we routinely serve to our children ( in all those sodas and chocolate bars ) .
In fact , most babies in the developed world enter the universe with traces of caffeine in their bodies , a transfer through the umbilical cord from the mother 's latte or Snapple .
Caffeine 's pervasiveness is a cause for concern among some scientists and public health advocates , but that has n't dampened its popularity .
Sales of Red Bull and copycat energy drinks with names like Red Devil , Roaring Lion , RockStar , SoBe Adrenaline Rush , Go Fast , and Whoop Ass are booming .
Meanwhile new coffee shops are opening so fast all over the world that even the most dedicated devotee of the triple - shot , no -foam , double - caramel , skinny macchiato can't keep track .
Every working day , Starbucks opens four new outlets somewhere on the planet and hires 200 new employees .
There 's a joke in many cities that Starbucks is going to open a new store in the parking lot of the local Starbucks , but this is not true .
Yet .
It was less than 200 years ago that people first figured out that the buzz they got from coffee and tea was the same buzz , produced by the same chemical agent .
An alkaloid that occurs naturally in the leaves , seeds , and fruit of tea , coffee , cacao , kola trees , and more than 60 other plants , this ancient wonder drug had been prescribed for human use as far back as the sixth century B.C. , when the great spiritual leader Lao - tzu is said to have recommended tea as an elixir for disciples of his new religion , Taoism .
But it was n't until 1820 , after coffee shops had proliferated in western Europe , that a new breed of scientist began to wonder what it was that made this drink so popular .
The German chemist Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge first isolated the drug in the coffee bean .
The newly discovered substance was dubbed " caffeine , " meaning something found in coffee .
Then , in 1838 chemists discerned that the effective ingredient in tea was the same substance as Runge 's caffeine .
Before the end of the century the same drug would be found in kola nuts and cacao .
It 's hardly a coincidence that coffee and tea caught on in Europe just as the first factories were ushering in the industrial revolution .
The widespread use of caffeinated drinks — replacing the ubiquitous beer — facilitated the great transformation of human economic endeavor from the farm to the factory .
Boiling water to make coffee or tea helped decrease the incidence of disease among workers in crowded cities .
And the caffeine in their systems kept them from falling asleep over the machinery .
In a sense , caffeine is the drug that made the modern world possible .
And the more modern our world gets , the more we seem to need it .
Without that useful jolt of coffee — or Diet Coke or Red Bull — to get us out of bed and back to work , the 24 - hour society of the developed world could n't exist .
" For most of human existence , your pattern of sleeping and wakefulness was basically a matter of the sun and the season , " explains Charles Czeisler , a neuroscientist and sleep expert at Harvard Medical School .
" When the nature of work changed from a schedule built around the sun to an indoor job timed by a clock , humans had to adapt .
The widespread use of caffeinated food and drink — in combination with the invention of electric light — allowed people to cope with a work schedule set by the clock , not by daylight or the natural sleep cycle . "
Czeisler , who rarely consumes any caffeine , is a bundle of wide - awake energy in his white lab coat , racing around his lab at Boston 's Brigham and Women 's Hospital , grabbing journal articles from the shelves and digging through charts to find the key data points .
" Caffeine is what 's called a wake - promoting therapeutic , " he says .
Scientists have developed various theories to explain caffeine 's " wake - promoting " power .
The consensus today focuses on the drug 's interference with adenosine , a chemical in the body that acts as a natural sleeping pill .
Caffeine blocks the hypnotic effect of adenosine and keeps us from falling asleep .
Since caffeine has also been shown to enhance mood and increase alertness in moderate amounts , it 's a potent potion for students and scholars stuck in the lab at three in the morning .
Paul Erdős , the Hungarian mathematician who often worked his equations around the clock , is known for saying that " a mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems . "
Caffeine 's ability to murder sleep also makes it a drug of choice for long - distance travelers .
There are as many different jet - lag remedies as there are seats on a trans -Pacific flight .
But one approach , outlined in The Caffeine Advantage by Bennett Alan Weinberg and Bonnie K. Bealer , involves abstaining from caffeine for several days before traveling , then dosing yourself with small amounts of coffee or tea on the day you arrive to stay alert — preferably out in the sunshine — until your regular bedtime in your destination .
( During weeks of global travel for this article , it worked for me . )
" Caffeine helps people try to wrest control away from the human circadian rhythm that is hardwired in all of us , " says Czeisler .
But then a shadow crosses the doctor 's sunny face , and his tone changes sharply .
" On the other hand , " he says solemnly , " there is a heavy , heavy price that has been paid for all this extra wakefulness . "
Without adequate sleep — the conventional eight hours out of each 24 is about right — the human body will not function at its best , physically , mentally , or emotionally , the doctor says .
" As a society , we are tremendously sleep deprived . "
In fact , the professor goes on , there is a sort of catch - 22 at the heart of the modern craving for caffeine .
" The principal reason that caffeine is used around the world is to promote wakefulness , " Czeisler says .
" But the principal reason that people need that crutch is inadequate sleep .
Think about that :
We use caffeine to make up for a sleep deficit that is largely the result of using caffeine . "
Dietrich Mateschitz is n't losing sleep over how much caffeine he consumes .
A big , friendly man with a big , friendly smile that beams out from his stubble of white beard , the Austrian marketing whiz describes himself as " comfortable with risk , " whether he 's climbing a rocky cliff , helicopter skiing , mountain hiking an impossibly steep trail in the Alps — or doing business .
Mateschitz ought to be comfortable with risk , because the biggest chance he ever took paid off in spectacular fashion , placing a whole new product on supermarket shelves , spawning hundreds of competitors , and making himself a billionaire , all within 15 years .
In the 1980s Mateschitz was working for Blendax , a German cosmetics company , marketing skin care products and toothpaste in East Asia .
His regular overnight flights from Frankfurt to Tokyo and Beijing inevitably resulted in jet lag , which Mateschitz came to despise .
He was a salesman , after all ; he needed to be at the peak of energy to do his job right .
But the long flights left him drained and worn .
He began to notice that taxi drivers in most Asian cities were regularly sipping from small bottles of tonic .
After one exhausting flight to Bangkok , he asked the cab driver to share the drink .
Eureka !
" Jet lag was gone , " he recalls .
" Suddenly , I felt so awake . "
Relating the story nearly two decades later , Mateschitz still remembers the sheer excitement of that moment of discovery .
" I found these drinks all over Asia , and there were huge markets for them .
I started thinking :
Why does n't the West have this product ? "
The West , of course , already had the key ingredient of those Asian mixtures : caffeine .
The drink that worked so well for Dietrich Mateschitz , a Thai tonic named Krating Daeng ( that is , Red Bull ) , was a blend of caffeine , an amino acid called taurine , and a carbohydrate , glucuronolactone .
The Austrian quit his toothpaste - selling job and invested his life savings in a license to sell Krating Daeng in the West .
After tinkering somewhat with the flavoring and the packaging — and adding carbonation — he launched the beverage in Europe in the late 1980s .
At first , stores did n't know what to do with an energy drink .
There was no such product , and thus no market for it .
Mateschitz solved that problem with a brilliant marketing campaign .
" You do n't drink Red Bull .
You use it , " the ads proclaimed .
" You 've got better things to do than sleep . "
" Red Bull gives you wings . "
Red Bull began organizing extreme sporting events , ranging from kitesurfing , streetluge , and paragliding to its Flugtag championships ( that is , human - powered flying machines ) and its own Seifenkistenrennen , or Soap Box Derby .
The target market was the educated , vigorous , and well - paid European youth culture — people who spent long days on the trading floor and the running track and long nights at downtown clubs , dancing and drinking until dawn .
By the turn of the century , the hottest new cocktail among Europe 's clubbing set was the Vodka Bull , Red Bull mixed with vodka .
( You can also buy a Bullgarita , which is Red Bull with tequila , a Chambull , which is Red Bull with champagne , or a Bullmeister , which is Red Bull with Jägermeister . )
" Red Bull rocks , right around the clock , " the company said in its advertising , including the helpful assurance that " Adding alcohol does not change Red Bull 's properties . "
Red Bull arrived in the United States in 1997 , promoting a series of extreme sporting events and hiring " social superstars " on college campuses to serve as Red Bull brand managers .
Today the product is in more than a hundred countries , selling close to two billion cans a year .
The home office of Red Bull , in a breathtaking corner of the Austrian Alps beside a blue jewel of a mountain lake called the Fuschlsee , feels more like an upscale beach club than the world headquarters of a multibillion - dollar corporation .
Mateschitz asked the architect to create the building in the form of two erupting volcanoes to reflect the product 's explosive sales growth .
Young staffers in tank tops and denim fill the company parking lot with their mountain bikes ; a large black dog sleeps under the 20 - foot - high ( 6.1 - meter - high ) palm trees in the lobby outside the CEO 's office .
Herr Mateschitz , now 60 , follows the code , wearing jeans and loafers to work ( no socks ) and joining in beach Volleyball games on the lakefront with his junior executives .
Mateschitz modestly plays down his own role in the success of Red Bull and gives all the credit to the " formula . "
" In marketing , you differentiate from existing products , " he says .
" Now coffee offers the caffeine , but in a bitter form , not cold and refreshing .
Other soft drinks are refreshing and thirst quenching , but they offer no benefits .
Pleasure was a good thing to market , but we saw that there was a place also in that market for efficacy , for a pleasurable drink that serves a function .
This is the niche ; this is Red Bull . "
The idea of giving a soft drink a " function " by adding in hefty doses of a habit - forming drug makes some people more than a little nervous .
France and Denmark have banned energy drinks like Red Bull altogether , citing health concerns about the elevated caffeine level , as well as the addition of other supplements .
Initially , even cans of Red Bull sold in its home country , Austria , carried the warning Nicht mit Alkohol mischen —
Do n't mix with alcohol .
Alarms were raised in Ireland after an 18 - year - old basketball player drank several cans of Red Bull before a game — and then collapsed and died on the court .
A coroner 's inquest was inconclusive about whether Red Bull had contributed to this sudden death .
But the unexplained collapse of an athletic young man prompted the government in Dublin to establish a Stimulant Drinks Committee to study the impact of energy drinks on Ireland 's public health .
" The first thing I noticed , when the committee was meeting , was how much coffee they drank , " says Martin Higgins , the energetic chief executive of Ireland 's food safety promotion board , which supervised the study .
" I guess we all have to get our stimulants one way or another . "
Although the committee looked at all the ingredients of Red Bull and similar products , it concluded that caffeine was the major attraction .
" It was n't so much energy or physical strength that people were buying , " Higgins says .
" It was that caffeine buzz , particularly in the nightclub setting .
And it was the caffeine that prompted the most concern from the committee . "
In the end , the Stimulant Drinks Committee found no serious risk from consumption of caffeinated energy drinks — at moderate levels .
The group recommended warning labels saying the drinks are unsuitable for children , pregnant women , and people sensitive to caffeine , as well as public health reminders that caffeinated energy drinks should not be consumed for rehydrating purposes during sports or exercise .
Last year the European Union , guided in part by the Irish study , began requiring packaged drinks with more than 150 milligrams of caffeine per liter to be labeled " high caffeine content " drinks .
By that standard , Red Bull and most of its competitors are high - caffeine beverages — so is any cup of coffee , for that matter — but most colas and other soft drinks are not .
The labeling requirement applies in all 25 EU nations .
Australia and New Zealand have also adopted warning requirements .
The United States has no such rule , but many canned energy drinks sold in the U.S. carry warnings anyway .
One member of Ireland 's Stimulant Drinks Committee who was not at all satisfied with its proceedings — indeed , he decided to withdraw from the study group — is Jack James , a psychologist who believes there is little to be gained from labeling some drinks high caffeine .
He says that such a label implies consumers are perfectly safe in drinking beverages with lower levels of caffeine , a conclusion he says is n't supported by the evidence .
While consumers around the world continue their intake of the drug year after year , James sits in his spartan office at the National University of Ireland 's Galway campus , documenting the reasons they should stop .
A colleague once dubbed him a caffeine crusader .
An Australian native with curly hair , wire - rim glasses , and a steely determination , James sips at a glass of tepid water over the course of a four - hour interview .
Previously a daily consumer of caffeine , he 's mostly sworn off the stuff for years .
" People at the scientific meetings say to me , ' Hey , Jack , want a coffee ? ' "
James has criticized research reports funded by the soft drink and coffee industries , which he says portray caffeine as a benign substance while ignoring evidence of its potential adverse effects .
His own research papers warn that caffeine is a psychoactive drug that raises blood pressure and thus increases the risk of heart disease .
But Jack James 's view is out of sync with most public health pronouncements about caffeine .
While the coffee and soft drink industries do finance some laboratory work on caffeine , there are also many independent investigators .
And the consensus view seems to be that the world 's most popular drug is not dangerous at moderate levels of consumption — up to 300 milligrams ( one to two small - 12 - ounce - take - out ( small - 0.35 - liter - take - out ) cups of coffee or six to eight cans of soda a day ) .
Caffeine is still a drug , though , which may explain why it makes people worry .
Over the years population studies have shown that people who consume caffeine have higher rates of kidney and bladder cancer , fibrocystic breast disease , pancreatic cancer , and osteoporosis .
Yet such findings cannot prove that caffeine caused the disease .
All that can be studied are short - term effects .
Like other drugs , caffeine does have a definite impact on mental and physical functions .
Repeated studies have shown that caffeine is analeptic ( it stimulates the central nervous system ) and ergogenic ( it improves physical performance ) .
It is also a diuretic , though recent studies show that it is not dehydrating in moderate amounts , even in athletes , as has been widely believed .
Caffeinated drinks do increase urine output , but only about the same as water .
Caffeine boosts blood pressure , too , but this effect is temporary .
And while some studies have shown that caffeine increases calcium loss , any effect is so small that it could be eliminated with as little as two tablespoons of milk a day .
Indeed much of the research suggests that caffeine may have benefits for human health .
Studies have shown it can help relieve pain , thwart migraine headaches , reduce asthma symptoms , and elevate mood .
As a mental stimulant , it increases alertness , cognition , and reaction speed ; because it combats fatigue , it improves performance on vigilance tasks like driving , flying , solving simple math problems , and data entry .
And despite its nearly universal use , caffeine has rarely been abused .
" With caffeine , overuse tends to stop itself , " says Jack Bergman , a behavioral pharmacologist in the department of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School .
" You get jittery and uncomfortable , and you do n't want to continue . "
The point at which an individual reaches that jittery stage varies greatly .
Some people seem to be genetically more susceptible to caffeine 's effects and may have increased anxiety after consuming even small amounts .
In a minority of people , doses of 300 milligrams or more may prompt an increase in tension , anxiety , even panic attacks , which may account for why studies show that nervous people generally have lower caffeine consumption .
As for caffeine use among children , it 's clear that their lower body weight means they should consume less than adults .
Ireland 's Stimulant Drinks Committee report advised that consumption of high - caffeine beverages should be discouraged in children to prevent possible increases in anxiety or nervousness .
But there 's no conclusive evidence about whether caffeine is harmful to children in small amounts .
A report from the Australia New Zealand Food Authority concluded that children appear to metabolize caffeine more quickly , and that there was no reason to suspect that they are more sensitive to its effects — good or bad — than adults .
Even for pregnant women , a population the Food and Drug Administration advises to avoid caffeine if possible , risks appear to be small , as long as daily intake is kept to moderate levels .
Michael Bracken , a perinatal epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health , has tracked the habits of thousands of expectant mothers over the past two decades .
" Based on current evidence , we can safely say to a pregnant woman , if you 're under 300 milligrams of caffeine per day — that 's about one to two cups of coffee — you 're not doing anything harmful to the child . "
After decades of testing , caffeine remains on the FDA 's list of food additives " generally recognized as safe . "
" Looking at all the studies of caffeine , it is very hard to argue that moderate consumption is bad for you , " says Bergman .
" The behavioral effects are real , but mild .
It undoubtedly produces some physical dependence .
I get up in the morning and usually have a couple cups of coffee .
But when I do n't , the withdrawal symptoms are n't severe . "
Some caffeine users might argue with Bergman : A day or so without caffeine can cause headaches , irritability , a lack of energy , and , of course , sleepiness .
But compared with giving up cocaine or heroin , getting over caffeine is short and easy .
Withdrawal symptoms tend to disappear in two to four days , though they can last up to a week or more .
Still , the desire to avoid withdrawal pangs may explain why billions of humans so eagerly consume caffeine every day .
The person who says , " I 'm a monster until that first cup of coffee in the morning , " is describing a mild form of addiction .
In fact , Jack James contends that the widespread physical dependence on caffeine may have skewed research findings , exaggerating caffeine 's mood - boosting effects .
If scientists compare two groups of subjects — some who have been given caffeine and others who have not — any improvement in mood or performance in the caffeinated group could be simply a relief from withdrawal symptoms .
" It may be that we are all on one of those endless cycles , " agrees Derk - Jan Dijk , a physiologist at the University of Surrey 's sleep research center .
" You take caffeine , and you are more alert .
Then the next morning , the effect has worn off and you need more of the drug to restore the alertness .
But maybe we could step off the cycle .
For those of us who work during the day , we might do just as well without caffeine . "
On the other hand , that coffee ritual in the morning , maybe with your doughnut , is a normal part of life that we enjoy .
It 's calming .
It helps order the day .
And all that can be useful for anybody .
Over the centuries humans have created countless rituals to accompany consumption of their favorite drug .
Often , the ritual has grown to transcend the beverage .
In Japan 's austerely elegant chanoyu , or tea ceremony , the simple surroundings of the tearoom , the soft rustle of kimono across tatami floor , the spare beauty of a hand - molded brown cup , matter as much as the tea itself .
The British have turned their afternoon ritual into a pageant of pomp and luxury .
In the glittering splendor of London 's Fortnum & Mason food emporium , afternoon tea is served amid green marble pillars and huge floral sprays , in fine china cups of gold and green .
Obsequious waiters serve finger sandwiches , scones with clotted cream , and tropical fruit tarts with the Earl Grey or Lapsang Souchong .
A pianist in the center of the room plays " On the Sunny Side of the Street " — just right , because you do indeed feel rich as Rockefeller , at least until the teapot runs dry and the check ( $ 44 ! ) arrives .
Americans , true to form , have engineered a rather more casual set of caffeinated rituals : a cruller and coffee at the local Dunkin ' Donuts , or instant with powdered creamer and Sweet 'n Low at the desk .
In the past decade or so , however , America 's morning rite of caffeine consumption has moved decidedly upscale .
A flood of new coffee shops has turned the 75 - cent cup of perked joe , refills free , into a six - dollar extravaganza brewed and blended expressly for each customer by a personal barista .
" We have built a whole new ritual of coffee in this country , " says Howard Schultz , the man who invented Starbucks .
In two decades Schultz turned a single espresso bar in a coffee shop at the corner of Fourth and Spring in Seattle into a Fortune 500 company , building a global icon so familiar that Playboy has done a feature on the " Women of Starbucks . "
A five - cup - a - day coffee drinker himself , the 51 - year - old Schultz is a picture of intensity as he prowls his office and recalls how it all began .
Schultz was a coffee bean salesman for a Seattle coffee bean store named Starbucks — after the first mate in Melville 's Moby Dick — when he visited Milan in 1983 and fell in love with the ambience of that great Italian institution , the espresso bar .
" It was about excellent coffee , but it was more than that , " he says in passionate tones .
" It was about conversation .
About community .
About human connection .
And fine coffee was the link .
I thought ,
You know , we could do this in Seattle . "
On a drizzly ( what else ? )
Seattle morning in April 1984 , Schultz set up a tiny espresso bar in the rear corner of the coffee bean store , offering mysterious beverages like caffe latte that the likes of Dunkin ' Donuts had never dreamed of .
Within days there were long lines on the sidewalk outside , and Howard Schultz never looked back .
He soon left the company and opened his own espresso bar , called Il Giornale , or The Daily .
Two years later he bought out his former employer , and now there are more than 8,500 Starbucks around the world , with another 1,500 scheduled to open this year .
Schultz does n't like to emphasize the role caffeine may play in his company 's success : " I do n't think it 's the caffeine .
I think the ritual , the romance of the thing , is really more important . "
But the caffeine is there .
A few miles down the interstate from Schultz 's office , at the Starbucks roasting plant in Kent , Washington , supervisor Tom Walters knows that firsthand .
" I 've been asked not to make the connection between coffee and caffeine , " Walters says as he strolls past mountains of 70 - kilogram ( 154 - pound ) burlap sacks holding fresh - picked beans from Colombia , Costa Rica , Nicaragua , Indonesia .
" But we see a hell of a lot of caffeine around here .
When you roast the beans , the caffeine forms a kind of fuzz on the roaster .
So when we 're too busy to get a coffee break , some people just run a finger down the casing of the roaster and lick it , and get their jolt that way . "
Getting that jolt , of course , is why many of the most popular beverages on Earth — coffee , cola , tea — just happen to contain caffeine .
Whether it's a graduate student downing mocha in the lab or a monk sipping green tea while chanting in the temple , mankind 's favorite stimulant is at work every day , all over the world .
